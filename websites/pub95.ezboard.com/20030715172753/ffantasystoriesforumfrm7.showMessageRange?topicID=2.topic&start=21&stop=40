I'd kept it down long enough, shouldn't I let It out sometime, on someone? She'd insulted me... close to destroyed the gift from my long-time love... and she could be a danger to my daughter. Fur started to sprout around my neck, and fangs grew once again. I could smell the aroma of confidence she exuded- yet she was a mage. Not magic stops the Blood Rage. Hell, if the Snakes couldn't, how could she?<br>
<br>
Stalking back towards her, I was still in half-transformation. The spear was strapped to my back, as my newly developed claws can tear through more than any sword. Just before my eyes transformed, as well, I shook away the inhibitions. No. Question the elf first. Then we hunt. Ok?<br>
<br>
..................................Fine.<br>
<br>
&quot;OPAL!&quot; I roared. I guess I still hadn't completely returned to human state, because he eyes went wide. I looked behind me to see a tail still snaking around. I grabbed her by her tunic, and pulled her close enough for her to see my fangs pulsing. &quot;What do you know. What did you tell her. What is going on. Speak before I get too hungry.&quot;<br>
<br>
!#$%^&amp;*!@#$%^&amp;*!@#$%^&amp;*<br>
<br>
The dead rats located that blasted mage for me again. Gods, I hate casters; too cocky, and they always run. Running after her with all the speed I could muster in human state, I finally got to her before she exited the gates. I grabbed on to her shoulder, and she spun around like a demon unleashed, and fire in her eyes. Guess she doesn't like being touched, eh?<br>
<br>
Damn! The fangs came back. Fur was still sprouting on my hands, somewhat. At least the feline eyes hadn't come yet...<br>
<br>
&quot;Business with *my* family is my business, as well, Paradise. That *is* your correct name, isn't it?&quot; I could tell she was going through her mind, listing the ways to torture Opal Darkbriar for speaking too much. That goes without saying. &quot;I know about the war. I know you need power. I suggest you enlist a seasoned general-   Myself. But, first,&quot; I grinned, showing the pearly whites, &quot;Please      apologize for destroying my last gift of love that remains.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uparadisetheheretic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paradise the Heretic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Decay</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 1:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.globalrray.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the true paradises. . .</span><hr size=1> Paradise glarred at the man who had dared to touch her, unphased by his 'transformation'.

    &quot;I apologize to no one.  Why should I apologize for your mistakes?&quot;  The two stared at eachother for quite some time, neither moving or blinking, a battle of wills.  Finally Paradise once again broke the silence.  &quot;You want to work for me than do you?  Well, you have to understand something about how I work:  I trust no one.  My trust must be earned, and until you have it you should live in fear of my wrath.  Continually insulting me is no way of earning that trust.  I suggest you come to Neriak with me.

He saw the sun, but it seemed to shed no light upon these unholy woods.  Even the water looked sickly and wrong.  The trees were twisted and gnarled and the animals were sadistic.  Unnatural yellow eyes stared at him from out of the gloom.  He would have sang a song of speed, but he feared his voice would echo throughout the wretched woods and bring upon him the wrath of the dark elves, or if not them, their golem allies.  He neared the rocky wall in which was the entrance of Neriak, the city of dark elves.  Gaurds in bloody mail weilding wicked swords guarded the entrance.  His guild master had refused to lend him the mask which he had so needed.  With one hand, he held open his eye and with the other, he squeezed a drop of blood from a small vial.  He repeated the procedure for the other eye, and then removed a glass jar of blue ink.  He had spent his last platinum piece on the vial, ink was a rare commodity, rarely wasted on cosmetical purposed.  He smeared the quick drying liquid over his face and hands.  Now for the final touch, he poured a mixture of ash and guanno in his water pouch.  He shook the liquid before carefully pouring it over his lustrious brown hair.  Brown faded into tan, and finally gray.  Were once had stood a handsome half elf, was a tall, blunt featured dark elf.  Praying to Prexus his disguise would work, he walked past the guards with an air of arrogance only a dark elf would have.  His disguise had worked..suprisingly.  Inside the entrance tunnels was a row of pikes upon which were the bodies of a group of halflings, most likely clerics.  A dark elf leaving the city glared at him as Matt shuddered.  He would have to hide not only his appearance, but his kind good nature as well, but he must find her.  If anything is true, I must find her, he thought. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A> at: 6/12/02 2:06:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 3:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Plays of Power</span><hr size=1> &quot;Backtalk to me, will you, bitch?&quot; I screamed. My tail snaked out fully, and I skipped the full animal stage of the Ner'Shalrok- the Blood Rage, the Lion Clan's special gift. I slashed across her belly, and my heightened hearing brought me to new levels of exhilliration as her screams pierced my very soul. The beauty turned suddenly ugly, enraged, and fearful for her life. Lightning was called down, and fire erupted upon my short fur. They struck me simultaneously, and a blizzard unlike anything the world had ever seen before blew in my face. I stepped through the mess of mana unscathed, just like with that blasted Rainkeeper. I grabbed her robes, and lifted her up with my left hand, just like that blasted Rainkeeper. Then, with feline eyes and a glorious golden mane, I devoured her entire head, JUST like that blasted Rainkeeper... Karana...<br>
<br>
I snapped out of my reverie. Standing before me was the beauty, looking into my eyes with deadly intent. She didn't know half of what she was getting in to... If only she'd traveled to the Plane of Storms lately... Yet again, like with everything on this damned plane of reality, I bit my tongue. Literally. Mustering all the self control I could, I snapped to attention, and curtly saluted her. A skeleton rounded the corner, carrying a few backpacks. &quot;I serve a higher purpose,&quot; I growled. I smoothed the anger out of my voice, and continued when I trusted my own vocal chords. &quot;But I am also a knight. I have my duties, and my loyalties,&quot; I grabbed the bags, and slung them over my shoulder, after removing a massive mace and hooking it onto my belt. &quot;I've led armies bigger than you've ever seen. I feel my presence would be helpful, if not necessary, in the coming battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes seemed to grow in distaste. I could feel that she was about to say something else, possibley even strike me dad, so I acted. I walked past her, and out the gate, towards Neriak. I tossed a bag of provisions to her, and continued, &quot;Necessary, that is, if there's more in charge with sense like Opal Darkbriar.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 5:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lightwalkers do not belong in the shadows</span><hr size=1> Bellona could feel him.

Cursing herself over in her mind, she sits at the waters edge. The trickling of the water eased her. Staring down at its surface, she see's a reflection of a symbol on the water.

This human angered her immensly, but there was also something about him that she found familiar some how.  maybe it was his arrogant attitude that she found so familiar, for many was the time others had hated her for her arrogance.  He said he knew Bellona...he said he was family. . . what did he mean by this?  surely that creature had no relation to the mighty Bellona, leader of the their'dal and child of hate . . . <br>
<br>
there was only one person who could answer these questions for her, and that was Bellona herself.  It had been many, many years since Paradise had first meet the hate child, and a lot had happened since then.  Would Bellona reckognize Paradise as the voice from her dreams?  We would soon find out.  <br>
<br>
Paradise watched as that human walked down the path through the commonlands that lead to Nektolous.  With a snap of her fingers she disapeared and reapeared in front of him, white bubbles of mana disapating into the evening sky.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me your name, before my plague finds you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Mindles.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mindles . . .&quot;  paradise began, she had heard that name before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Bellona's father.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hate and anger ripped through Paradise, although it did not appear on her face.  This was the father of Bellona.  How could she had been so blind to not have seen it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are your rations.&quot;  Mindles said lightly, assuming he'd get more respect now that she knew who he was.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't eat . . . rations.&quot;  Paradise said with a smirk.  &quot;And I travel alone.  We will meet again in Neriak, and there, in the presence of the hate child, we will discuss this war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paradise flicked her wrist and she disapeared from the mortal world.  She smiled to herself as she walked, 'that family has a lot of power.  i just hope they know how to use it.' she thought to herself.  <br>
<br>
When she got to the entrance of Neriak she stepped out of the shadows and revealed herself to the guards.  Neither gaurd dared challenge her as she entered the forbidden city of the Dark Elves.<br>

Ahh, the powers of teleportation; how easily the arcanely gifted had it. They didn't get hit, hardly, weren't expected to lug around all this armor, didn't have to worry about moving to avoid decapitation, didn't have to go through fighting styles repetetively...<br>
<br>
Of course, warriors didn't have to memorize so many things. They didn't have to invoke such extreme energy. And, to top it all off, they didn't have to worry about harnessing things that could easily suck their soul from their body. But that's okay- I get to deal with it all. Ah, the joys of being chosen for Hate's plan.<br>
<br>
I walked along the trodden paths in the Commonlands for a little bit. I looked to the sky, and the clouds, and to the green grass and healthy trees. I never really knew how much I missed this, I guess; that blasted Curse kept me from seeing anything clearly, except for my family...<br>
<br>
I made it to the Nektulos forest by dark. I loved that place at midnight; it felt like home. I passed a massive stone golem, and he saluted as I walked past. I saluted back with a smirk, and continued my walk through the forest, my Deadeye spell working beautifully to cut through the black. I had a pet skeleton reanimated to carry my gear for most of the way; after all, I was walking in my flayed skin and magical leathers. Ain't no WAY I'm trekking again with all that platemail. As a result, I tend to set a faster pace than most fighters. Only problem was that my pet crumbled soon enough, and I turned just in time to see the flash of steel cut through the spine of Kobn. DAMN! I lose more pets that way...<br>
<br>
I scooped out a crustacean shell breastplate and fitted it over the flayed skin tunic quickly, while drawing my shadowed mace and shield of trapped souls. I brought my sheild up in a defensive position just fast enough to block a shadowy arrow. It disentigrated as soon as it touched the plate. Dust fell to the ground, and snakes started to writhe up out of the dirt. &quot;No... Not here! Not like this! NOT HERE!&quot; I scooped up my gear, and ran like the nine hells were pursuing me, because, in all reality...<br>

Blood seeped out of the wounds her sharp teeth had caused, yet he seemed not to notice.  It was her eyes that had completely filled him with revulsion.  He saw behind her calm mask of security animal desires and hatred.  No longer did he feel the burning in his loins when images of her filled his mind.  Her beauty was undeniable, yet, in the same light, she was hideous.  He thought that once he had found her and talked to her, everything would become clear, but now he had only more questions.  Matteus looked down at his hands, his ink was running.  It would be not long before people took notice that he was not one of their own.  Like an average dark elf, he shoved malicously through the throngs of people.  As the they grew fewer, and the neon lights less common, he breathed a sigh of relief.  He traveled through the dark tunnel, emerging on the other side.  The bright light of the sun, even dampered by the gloom of the trees, blinded him.  His eyes had become accustomed to the neon lights of Neriak.  His head throbbed, and the blood covering his eyes began to drip.  Running past the guards with his head held low and his cowl pulled tightly over his face Matteus fled to the the river.  It was now that he realized he held a bag tightly in his hand.  That odd man had given it to him.  What manner of halfling would walk into the city of Neriak without fear encompassing their entire being?  From within the burlap sack, he removed a green necklace.  He slowly slipped it over his neck.  The cool material felt refreshing against his skin.  Matteus looked down at his blue arms, shaking his head.  Without a thought, he dove into the murky waters below leaving behind a stream of blue and white in the water as his guise slipped off his skin.  For a minute, his fears and thoughts were left behind in the world of hate, her world. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usuedydar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suedydar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 11:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Silent are watching...</span><hr size=1>   He ran through the streets of Felwithe, into the Paladin's guild, and into a secret passageway; known to only a few in Felwithe.

<br>
Standing up, he opens a closet doors removing a suit of gleaming crested armor, handling each piece with care. Rummaging around a bit more, he removes a long, slender case from the closet. Inside is a sword surrounded by an eirie glow. &quot;My friend, it seems like I need your help again. I hope you will serve me as well today as you did then,&quot; he speaks to the sword as he removes it from its case. It glows brighter as it is spoken to. &quot;Yes, you feel it also.

Paradise walked up the main stairs and through the ancient hallways until she came to the large double doors that stood as the entrance to the main hall.  she put one hand on the doors, lightly, and they swung open with tremendous force.  The elders were already gathered around the table, awaiting her arival.  Paradise strode into the room confidently, and immediatly got down to buisness.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Opal refuses to join us.  She is trying to strike a truce with the Paladins of Freeport.&quot;  There was a general moan of displeaseure among the Dark Elf elders.  &quot;We must have our forces rallied at Paineel in six moons time.  I fear the Paladins are organising faster than we anticipated.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the elders began to speak, in a slow, wavering voice.  &quot;And why should we help you, human?  This is your war, not ours, and the Their'dal people feel no need to assist such an inferior race.  We have lived by ourselves for thousands of years happily and securely.  I do not think this council will choose to back you in your campeign against the light walkers, and I don't . . .&quot;  Paradise slammed her fists down on the long wooden table, a few inches from the speaking elf.<br>
   &quot;THIS is not about your stupid race wars.  This is an oportunity for you to gain the upper hand in the battle against the light.  Our has the dark elf council grown old, weak, and ignorant?  Your father would never have tolerated your behavior today!&quot;  another dark elf stood up in defense of the other.<br>
<br>
   &quot;HUMAN!  DO NOT speak to a member of the their'dal council in such a manner!  Show some respect for your superiors!&quot;  The elf looked around at the other council members for support, but no one moved.  Paradise's red eyes turned to black and she raised both hands over her head.  As she did so the two rebelious elves flew into the air, hoovering above their seats.  Blood started dripping from their bodies to the floor as they strained to scream.  Their flesh turned black and rotted away, their bones turned to dust.  Paradise lowered her hands and let fall the messy lumps of tissue and cloth, spattering blood on the walls and the ceiling as they hit the ground.  Paradise walked slowly and calmly around the room, making eye contact with each and every remaining council member.<br>
    &quot;Gather your army and send them to Paineel.  I will continue to Qeynos and gather my Clan and meet them there.&quot;  paradise waited to make sure there were no objections and than made her way to the door.  Just before walking through she turned around and said, &quot;One more thing.  Send Bellona to lead them.  She is one Dark Elf who has some sense left in her, unlike you corpses who have lost their taste for blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Paradise left the room, leaving the council with confused and scared looks on their faces. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 2:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dark Council</span><hr size=1> Bellona sits calmly, her mind an utter blank as she still looks out over the waters. <br>

<br>
&quot;Ithvol, what is it?&quot; Her patients was running short.<br>
<br>
&quot;A woman named Paradise came to the elders today. She murdered two of them in ways I've never seen before. She wishes for the Tier'Dal to join in her war. It is a risk the council is not willing to take, neither is Opal. She wishes to set an attack against the lightwalkers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the council refused?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a great chance that we may loose many soldiers an-&quot;<br>

&quot;With war there is always risks. Have you lost faith in your people? Our Knights and Soldiers are trained for perfection and our Magic wielders cast with precision and power... Have you forgotten? Perhaps it has been too long since you stood beside your fellow man and fought... I have seen the way we work in numbers, when the cause is good and the drive strong, we will win.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...I can see now why Paradise wishes for you to lead the Teir'Dal army... You must take our troops to Paineel within six moons&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell her it will be done. Send word to all of Neriak that compliance is mandatory. Anyone who refuses to aid us is against us and will be killed... Send 20 Shadow Knights to Freeport. Ask Opal once if she will join us, if she hesitates, kill her. If she refuses, kill her. If she joins us, kill her anyway. Make sure not a single person she commands is able to walk once our forces leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ithvol nods. Bellona truly was a Kali. Bowing, he turns and walks away.<br>
<br>
On the chest of her robe was a ring of fire that blazed through the black cloth. It was the only color on any part of her robes. Pressing this embroidered circle, Bellona speaks into it.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are at war...&quot; Pressing it again, she rests her chin on her knees. Time to get to Paineel...<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Bellona stood amongst her army within the gates of the large city. A dark moon hung over head and made the blackend armor that was worn on thousands of Teir'Dal shine. No one had refused. Pride fills Bellona's heart, but her expression is grim. The Teir'Dal were in lines, each one looking mechanical with their stern faces hid behind the same mask. All eyes were foreward and staring at nothing, though all ears anticipated orders. The silence was deafening. Were they breathing? Bellona could not tell if she was. Clad in cadet blue armor she stands facing the lines. In one hand was a pulsating shield, the other a decapitated paw. She was ready for battle, more than ready. <br>

Innoruk controled the wood, but Prexus held domain over the waters.  Matt's hair was once again deep brown, his eyes emerald green, and his skin tanned.  He reluctantly climbed out of the water and slipped his shirt back on.  He felt refreshed, rejuvinated.  Odd noised echoed throughout Nektulos, unnatural noises.  He dismissed them as nothing but the results of sick tier'dal rituals.  As he began his trek back to the Commonlands, he realized something was amiss, something besides the noises, yet he hadn't a clue as to what.  Quietly, he slinked through the woods.  Upon his arrival at the Commonlands, it dawned upon him.  He hadn't seen nor heard a single guard.  Why?  His curiosity had never been a force to be quelled.  As quickly as he had arrived, Matt turned around and sprinted to the dark-elven city of Neriak.  With the guards gone, he braved the paths and after a good ten minutes of running, he stood before the stone enterance of Neriak.  He now understood what the odd noises were.  Shouting and cheers were coming from within the city.  His curiosity yet again got the better of his as he removed a tiny flute from his pocket.  He raised the wood to his lips and emmitted a long low note.  White mist flowed forth from the end.  Mist clung to his skin, hiding him behind its obscurity.  As the mist faded, so did all remnants of Matt.  He continued to quietly play the song as he crept into the city.  Beyond the first gate, hundreds of Tier'dal stood together.  From they shouting and cheers he made out four words, &quot;Hate, War, Kill, and Paineel.&quot;  It didn't take an erudite to figure out what those four added up to.  The site of a sea of tier'dal was enough to frighten even Matt.  With haste, he fled the city of hate.  They shall wage war, but what is to happen in Paineel?

My reserves of power had been depleated by summoning the undead beasts to aid me; how foolish it was, too, as they'd all been cut down within minutes. I sucked the life force and flesh from another dozen, but they came anyways. I was nearly exhausted, but I'd yet to see one Slayer, and we all know what that means...<br>
<br>
Trouble.<br>
<br>
The magic on the green, scaled armor of the Clan of the Snake was enough to make even the greatest oak decay in minutes, if focused correctly. The stench of disease and the aroma of death meant nothing to me; the taint of the Snakes did. Swinging the mace again to try and remove some of the brain and skullbone that had come along with it, I tripped over a root. Another elf in green swung a longsword at me, and I parried just in time. My foot came up, and I flung him ten feet away. I was up on my feet and running again, and I was nearly to Neriak! YES! With that deadly woman and Bell, we had more than enough to push these foot soldiers back through the gate, and these plane-jumping fools wouldn't plague Norrath again... Well, until they found another gate, but still...<br>
<br>
The fact that they'd even FOUND us here was amazing; I've been jumping planes for aeons now, and they've never tracked me, once. Odd. I didn't have time to ponder, however, before I was clubbed from behind. I rolled forward, dropped my bags of armor, and grabbed a scimitar, gripping it in my other hand, hoping I could duel wield for a bit. Looking up, I knew I needed it.<br>
<br>
He was big like a barbarian. He had a long, black cloak of living shadow. He carried only one Death-tainted longsword, and his green platemail gave of the stench of Kai all around. &quot;Go back to your false god, freak!&quot; I spat. &quot;Kai is *NOTHING* on this plane; The Lions will defeat you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Balance will be tipped, you furry freak,&quot; his voice sounded like steel grating across granite, and the dark green helm, the head of a snake with its fangs dropping on either side of his face, glistened in the darkness. &quot;Death will be all. Kai will reward us. Stand down.&quot; He rose his sword, and brought it down, slicing through my poor travelling armor, and slicing into my left arm. I shouted, and crushed his breastplate with my mace.<br>
<br>
My left arm came back up, and chopped down at his neck. He parried, and I crushed him in the head, knocking off the helm. He kicked my in the stomach, and I rolled backwards, grabbed my bags, and made a mad dash for Neriak, all the while screaming, &quot;Our forces are great! We will CRUSH you! The Lions live AGAAAIN!&quot;<br>
<br>
I finally made it to the entrance, but there were no guards! WHY were there no guards?? This was getting harder and harder...<br>
<br>
The Slayer dove and caught my foot. His forked tongue flicked out, and his eyes went serpentine on me- he was about to bite. I crushed him in the head, and slashed at his face, but he knocked the scimitar out of my hand easily. He clawed his way up my body, his weight nearly crushing me, and I felt the rage risin in my again; my fangs elongated, and I dropped the mace, slashing him across the face.<br>
<br>
A few minutes of bloody struggle went by, rolling, hitting, scraping, and vying for the neck bite; a quick finish. I finally got on top of him, and planted my knee in his chest, underneath the breastplate. I rolled, and kicked up with the other knee, sending him tumbling out into the forest. I grabbed my weapons, and my battered and beaten form ran into the cave just as the first ranks of Tier'Dal started marching. I backed up, confused, and turned to the Slayer. He was still standing there, looking more like a serpent. I was well recognized in Neriak, and was allowed to move aside or being sliced to ribbons. I chose the first. I looked back as the columns started moving out; the Slayer was gone. I couldn't smell the vile taint of Kai anywhere. I guess they fled, the first intelligent thing I've seen a Snake do in centuries.<br>
<br>
&quot;I gotta tell Bellona... I never explained the Balance to her fully, but she's gotta believe me in this,&quot; I turned, and waited for the wave of black skinned elves to file out, scanning for Bellona all the while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=181&stop=184>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=40><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> -
