You are making ME try to keep this thread on topic.  If Sadsackadar wants to insult someone by comparing them to Mirswith then that's his contribution to this thread.  Besides, from my impressions most people will take it as a compliment so it just makes him look dumber for saying it.  That would be like me telling someone &quot;You're as ugly as Jeisenne&quot;.  Now, we all now that probably nobody else is THAT good looking, but most people will say thanks if they have any idea who you are.  So with that being said:<br>
<br>
<br>
Wow cool mask.  It almost hides how ugly you are.<br>
<br>
Do I need to log my 26 Shaman on so I can get some buffs and heals?<br>
<br>
I probably still had 100HP, next time maybe you can wait till I have 50 until your CH kicks in?<br>
<br>
You're camping the Captain?  I thought it took 3 full groups of TD just to get out of bed.<br>
<br>
Can anyone summon bandages?  At least I can heal myself to 50% between fights.  Oh we have a Cleric?  And who would that be? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umalilkiashadowwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malilkia Shadowwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#778899>(11/13/01 6:35:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://roleplayersinteraction.com/test_pictures/Cat2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ::shakes his head in disapointment::</span><hr size=1> /sigh wow a friendly fun post ruined.

They were great and I can easily say I had the most fun with them on this game, they are great to be around...rowdy, joking, having fun...that is how I remember them and honestly I would not have them any other way.  Also, they dropped what they were doing so many times to help me I lost count.  All around they are some of the best people on this game in my opinion.<br>

<br>
Mirswith, You do not know me, and I do not know you. You may have not done anything to me, but you did to everyone else by ruining a fun post. I may not post much but I give everyone respect no mater how bad I dislike them or dislike thier post, and I expect the same respect to post I create for others to enjoy.  Take your issues to rants. Thats what that forum is for.<br>

I will restart this post, and other oddball posts. <p><img src="http://www.roleplayersinteraction.com/images/corimages/images/logo.png">

If you understand that comment, it wasn't for you.  If you didn't understand it.. then unfortunatly you arent ready to.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the insults I use vary based on the person, I'll post some of the cleaner ones I have hotkeyd<br>
<br>
/em tries to pick %T's pocket, but based on the number of times they broke Mez, decides they are too poor.<br>
<br>
i.e. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nikkoli tries to pick loser_01's pocket, but based on the number of times they broke Mez, decides they are too poor.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
(as in they are so poor they cannot afford to even pay attention)<br>
<br>
You tank like a Ranger!<br>
(old favorite of everyone, although I dont believe it yet)<br>
<br>
Why dont you get your hand out of the MoB's pocket and put your blade in its back?<br>
(I have grouped with a lot of rogues oddly enough)<br>
<br>
Man, you pull so slow your mom AND your sister say thanks.<br>
<br>
You already have your moms looks, why dont you grow her balls too?  <br>
<br>
(to a wizard) Well thats 1005 dresses that overnuking panzy has replaced this year.<br>
<br>
You beg as much as your sister did last night!<br>
<br>
Hey =o) Darwin *WAS* right about evolution!  Thanks for proving it!<br>
<br>
We dont ask our tanks to sit down and heal, so you shouldn't be standing up and tanking.<br>
<br>
Man, I just ran out of bandages.... we're going to need to get a cleric now... Oh wait.. I didn't see you overthere ignoring us.<br>
<br>
Anyone mind if I log off real quickly?  I have a couple characters close that could give us the buffs we need.<br>

Cartoon Avatars.  If you get off on insulting\being offended\flirting\cybering\roleplaying to the point where you actually get upset\  with CARTOONS ,then order a latex doll.  It feels much better. <br>
<br>
<br>
I think it's funny that cartoon avatars cause this much tension. lol   Then again, generally speaking the avatars are a direct reflection of what people are like in real life roleplay or not.  What I think is funny is when people NEED this adoration from the cartoon avatars.  That makes me shake my head and then chuckle. <br>
<br>
It's a game poke your head into the real world every now and again and regain that equilibrium with reality that some of you so obviously lack. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ucyransbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cyransbane</A> at: 11/14/01 12:16:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umirswithofinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirswith of Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#778899>(11/14/01 12:43:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.classicgaming.com/ninjagaiden/gallery/sdryu.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> dont fret, im not posting here anymore, later everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umirswithofinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirswith of Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#778899>(11/14/01 12:43:57 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.classicgaming.com/ninjagaiden/gallery/sdryu.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> Dont fret, you wont have to falsely accuse me of hijacking a thread anymore, i wont post on the innoruuk boards again, laters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unikkoli1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nikkoli1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#778899>(11/14/01 5:53:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> The insults I use are usually used in good fun..
