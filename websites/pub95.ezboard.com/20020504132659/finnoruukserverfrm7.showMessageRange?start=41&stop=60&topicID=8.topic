Its the sound of laughter and even singing . With a darkening scowl He quickly summons the spectral essence of one of his many slain enemies . With threats of suffering yet to come and arcane dark magicks he binds the will of the spectre to his own. Quickly he dispatches the Spectre to spy upon what is transpiring in yonder house . Waiting impatiently for his minion to return he quickly cloaks himself with powerful enchantments and magicks .The spectre quickly returns bearing news of a gathering of the corrupted races of Norrath. Who are obviously celebrating some depraved light side ritual . <br>
<br>
Zavier decides that now is the time to spread the Hate of Innoruuk to these despised dwellers of the light . Like a veritable thundercloud of doom Zavier moves silently as death itself till he can look in the window of the home from which the laughter and music come from . As he prepares to strike he sees a half elven woman of indeterminate age bending over what appears to be some sort of brewing barrel .He quickly reaches into his pouch and withdraws a weirdly shimmering green emerald and begins to chant his most powerful life draining spell , suddenly the half elven woman stands erect and turns to reply to some shouted jest from the other room . Zavier is struck dumb , He knows who this woman is . <br>
<br>
Though releasing his power is nigh impossible Zavier dismisses the magicks he had summoned . For he owes a life debt to this woman , this half elf woman known as Laurelai. Retreating to contemplate what he has seen he is stunned by the fact that he did not do what is his nature , which is to sow Hate and Discord.Quickly Zavier casts another of his magicks and returns to his home. <br>
<br>
Going over to a shelf that has long been unused , he takes down a strangely carved shell . Chanting a spell of dispelling he opens the shell to remove a strangely glowing emerald unlike many of his gems which contain the essence of his defeated foes this one glows not green but a pure glowing white and chiming musically .He removes it and places it in a gem encrusted box ,made of sandalwood and buffed to a softly glowing sheen . He summons his most inoffensive spirit thrall and instructs it to deliver it to this half elven bard . <br>
<br>
When the spirit arrives at the home , the party is still in full effect and if possible it is even more lively . The spirit softly scratches against the window until Laurelai looks up from the brewing she is doing .The spirit in a small and breathy voice tells Laurelai that it brings her a gift ,and a message from its master. With a look of startlement and perhaps even fear she opens the window . The spirit of a sudden stiffens in surprise and where the spirit had eyes of a glowing green fire suddenly the cold calculating purple hued stare of a dark elf blazes forth . A deeper and more resonant voice speaks from the spirit and begins to spin a tale of life debts owed and payments to be made . <br>
<br>
&quot; I am yet unknown to thee mistress of the music , but listen to my tale . When I was but newly come to my necromatic powers , I and several of my Kindred journeyed from our dark elven home to exchange knowledge with our dark brethren in the land of the Steamfont Mts. We journeyed on a sea going vessel named the &quot;Sirens Song&quot; .<br>
<br>
While we journeyed onboard this aptly named ship,I stayed below communing with my newly found spirit companion who stands before you now . During this voyage you saved the lives of myself and my Kindred at the sacrifice of one who was well beloved by you . Determined to not let this sacrifice go unanswered , when I came into the fullness of my power . I returned to the Ocean of Tears and began my search for the one gift that I felt could repay the sacrifice that you made .I found the home of the Sea Harpies ,also known as Sirens . To defeat their magickal songs I surrounded myself with the aura of the dead and the wailing of the Banshees . I went into their lair and thru the hate vested in me by my dread lord Innoruuk , I defeated them one by one .<br>
<br>
 Till I came to one that was old and haggard and close to the death that I freely give . She quavered in fear before my power and begged for her life . I told her that I would not kill her if she returned the Paladin Galadrid to me . With an evil laugh she she had one of her hags deliver his water logged remains to me , thinking that she had gotten out of this with her life . She told me that this was her end of the bargain and to leave her now . I of course fulfilled my end of the bargain and had my Thrall kill her . Looking at me as she died with accusation in her eyes I told her &quot;foolish hag I said I would not kill you and as you can see I have not . My thrall completed my pact for me &quot;.<br>
<br>
Beginning a ritual that would summon forth his essence I was dumbfounded to discover to much time had passed . Determined to not admit defeat I tried again and again racing thru my store of souls. When the last soul had been released in a vain attempt to summon forth Galadrid I saw a misty blue form coalesce before me . I was struck dumb because it was Prexus himself , come in answer to my magicks that had warped and roiled throughout the sea. <br>
<br>
<br>
He told me that what I attempted was in vain because Galadrid was where all go who give their lives to the sea while protecting the innocent . He told me that while my attempt was in vain he could do one thing for me and he channeled a pure white energy into one of my depleted soul stones . When the stone is held a wonderful pure tenor can be heard singing a song <br>
<br>
&quot;My heart is lost to never be returned<br>
and yet tho' gone I do not miss it still<br>
For in my mind, her image has been burned<br>
and my poor heart has gone to where it will.<br>
<br>
She sings to me and 'way my soul has fled<br>
For keeping safe within her hands it lies<br>
and now I go to where my heart has led<br>
and hope in matters of love it is wise.<br>
<br>
I see, I see her shining like the sky<br>
So lovely, yet so brave to know no fear<br>
I drown to her, and in those eyes I die<br>
What may I do to keep her to me near?<br>
<br>
Her eyes they wrap around my mortal frame<br>
I pray though that her arms will do the same&quot; <br>
<br>
and when it is held against the eyes a picture of Galadrid singing while sitting outside of a window onboard a ship can be seen&quot;.<br>
<br>
This is my tale milady bard . While I despise those who follow the light , I admired the sacrifice you had made . I empathize with those who sacrifice for my dread lord Innoruuk is a demanding lord . <br>
<br>
With that the spirit disincorporates and the glowing sandalwood box settles to the window sill.<br>

That she could easily remove such a creature did not lull her into a sense of ease.  This was no simple skeleton, but a pet.  And though it was a weak one, she could sense from the powers that bound it, that the master was powerful indeed.  Why was it here?  Curiosity got the better of her, and she opened the window.  A voice that was soft- like the hissing issued from a body that was expelling its last breath- began to tell her a tale.<br>
<br>
As the words continued, she becan to recognize the story, and immediately felt her stomach clench at the memory.  As much as she had tried, she had never been able to forget that trip to the Butcherblock port.  Then the liche told about the sea hag dredging forth Galadrid's ruined body, and Laurelai began to cry outright, biting her lip so that the party goers would not hear her... but she refused to turn away from the minion.  She nodded grimly as it was revealed that the hag was now dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Justice has been done- though I would have preferred it not been necessary in the first place&quot;  she thought.<br>
<br>
Then the pet held out a box- simply though finely crafted.  A clatter of bones accompanied the pet's departure as it disassembled.  Having heard the words, but still unbelieving, the bard was conflicted.  She wanted to see Galadrid's face again, but knew her old wound would be re-opned at the sight.  Sighing to herself at her lack of wisdom, she opened the box to find a clear gem that glowed a pearly aura.  As she held it in her hand, she heard his voice, and the briney tears slid down her lashes; some splatting on the ground, some running down her chin and neck.<br>
<br>

<br>
Then she held the gem up so she could see it, and through blurry eyes, she looked at the spirit gem's portait of the dead paladin whom she had loved.  It was indeed Galadrid- young and brown and smiling with those gleaming sky colored eyes.  Laurelai held the gem tightly to her chest and looked out into the darkness.<br>

Laurelai went back to the ewer and splashed cold water on her face before she rejoined the party.  She went to the table and picked up a plate and began to fill it with the best and most delicate foods.  She placed a few flavorful fish rolls on the plate, a large wedge of the meat pie she had baked, some steamed vegetables, and a cup of rabbit stew.  Thinking that such a person as a necromancer would likely not want a strong drink, she filled a flask with Karana tea and headed back out to the step.  Before she made it there though, she turned back and cut a slice of berry pie to be set out on the step as well.  If the necromancer decided company was not what he wanted, he certainly could use a meal... and who could turn down berry pie?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Lenore held the gem protectively, knowing it was Laurelai's most prized possession.  She did remember the tale of a love lost at sea, and mourned with her sister.  At the sound of a commotion, Lenore gently replaced the gem from where Laurelai had taken it from.  The gem safe and secure, she left to see what was going on.<br>
<br>
In the room, an elf was appealing to the guests in aid for a fallen man.  A barbarian, Lenore surmised.  A very badly injured one at that.  Calling upon nature, a blue-green aura sprang from her fingertips and surrounded the fallen man in a healing glow, regenerating the man's skin, bones, and blood.<br>
&quot;The regenerative powers of Karana will help him to heal.  He needs clerical attention.&quot;  Kneeling beside the man, placing his head in her lap, she motions for someone to bring her some broth.  She begins to spoon some of the warm liquid between the semi-conscious man's lips.<br>

A faint gust of wind momentarily melded the cloak to the wearer's body, revealing to any who watched that the person within was female.

As he walked through the door he felt something hit behind him. As drunk as he was, he was still scared. He tried to run though and possibly get help from some of the people inside but couldn't move any further inside. Surely this had to be some evil magic. He twisted in fury, but did not think to look behind him. A stick was on his back, horizonally, holding him back. The stick was transparent and thin, with some red hues around the top. He ran again, but to no avail. He reached behind him and felt the stick. He could feel his face growing hot. He heard giggles and snickers coming from the others in the room. He turned the staff vertically and stepped through the door, pulling his blood red cloak around him. He could just feign death right now from embarassment.                                                                          <br>
     He saw a few friends across the room and went to sit with them. Lenuvila laughed as he stepped closer but allowed him to sit down. He started to sit but felt something below him. He looked down and spied a young ranger. &quot;Oops!&quot; is all he said, again embarassed. He said down beside her and begain talking, while holding one hand to block his face from the stares and lingering giggles of the crowd.<br>

Though not one to associate with others for any reasons but those of the utmost importance, food was running low and the night held a bitter cold he was not about to indulge in. Dark elves were often hunted in areas such as this, especially those who followed the dark arts, so usually stealth was the best way to travel. Unfortunately it is hard to acquire goods and services if the mortals you deal with cannot see you. Stealing was not something this necromancer did either, so the only option left was to pick some out-of-the-way place and hope he didn't have to kill too many people to get served. Not that death bothered him, but at times a unseen person would slip away to alert nearby guards, who often traveled in large packs. So the only real option left was to make sure no one was foolish enough to attempt a fight at this time of the day, with one such as him. Summoning forth the most fearsome minion he could muster from the realm of death, throwing back his black hood, and with Sarnak-Skull staff in hand, Porizj moved out of the trees and towards the door. &quot;Hopefully these fools will be sober enough to recognize the power this staff carries with it, the power my minion carries with it, and the power my eyes carry in them&quot; he thought to himself as his hand moved towards the door. If there was one thing Porizj didn't need right now, it was some drunken fool who didn't know true power when he saw it, and was foolish enough to pick a fight.<br>
<br>
Pausing before his hand touched the door, he felt something in the air which caused him to sigh. There was at least one paladin in here. As he pushed the door open with his staff, he already knew tonight was going to be a long night.<br>
