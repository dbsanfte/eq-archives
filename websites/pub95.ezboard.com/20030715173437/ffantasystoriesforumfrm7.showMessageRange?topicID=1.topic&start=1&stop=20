It was still carved there, like a gem imbued on a sword. Wait- how did he know what a sword was all of a sudden?<br>
<br>
It didn't matter. All that really mattered at all was that the sun was hot. The letters were gruff, and the sweat from the heat made it hard to read the letters, but they were still there. He didn't know why he knew what they said, but he knew. &quot;B  O  B&quot; was engraved into his hard, rock-colored flesh. His tan wasn't the darkest thing on the lad's body, though. His hair was blacker than coal- well, actually, it kind of *was* coal, as he'd just emerged from a deep mine in the near past. His fingernails were long and dirty, his hair matted to his leathery back. He should have been dressed in a loincloth, for all the difference it would make.<br>
<br>
Actually, when he looked down, he was surprised to see pants at all. Tattered and torn at the knees, the denim was stone washed and faded. Bob really was confused, now.<br>
<br>
The night did little to aid Bob's sweating. He was still covered in a sheen, but at least that made the dirt and soil come off easier when he took a dunk in a small watering hole.<br>
<br>
A scream.<br>
<br>
Of all the things he couldn't remember, Bob could remember the sound of a woman. He could also remember the distinct scent of blood. He could taste it in the air once again. Through the dimly lit streets and shady, forested areas, Bob took off at full flight. Females meant more of his kind. It had to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/9/02 10:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sorry if it sucks, you caught me just as i was going to bed</span><hr size=1> <br>
The whip comes down hard over and over again on the girls delicate aqua skin. Her screams die out along with her consciousness. They would not let her escape her harsh reality. A swift kick to the stomach returns her to the world and to the unbareable pain. Had there been anything in her stomach, it would had been on the ground in front of her, however a lack of food for three days made that impossible. Slashes in the back of her shirt reveal the steadily emerald blood that bleeds from her newly made cuts that rest atop scars. A man yanks her from the ground and shoves her back in line with the rest of them, the rest of her people. Their lives were some of the most difficult to live. They would work out in the fields all day until they could lift their arms no more, for that they would be beat just like the girl was. Each one of dorned the same three letters on their arm, though none of them were literate enough to read. The progretion of slaves goes on into the distance, there was hundreds of them, all going towards the same dreaded place...<br>
<br>
Tears stream down the girls nearly flawless face and clear two small pathways down her cheeks. Had she been clean, her aqua skin would have glittered in the light, but she was covered in dirt from the dusty fields. Blisters on her hands throb as a light wind rushes past her. She can feel the pain taking over and threatening collapse. The wind rushes through her frosty hair and swirls around her. Everything begins to spin. Falling to the ground, her violet eyes blur. The last thing seen is the Slave Master's whip rising into the air above her. <br>

Now I got something to work with for Bob... : )</span><hr size=1> The fat man raised his whip. He looked so much like Bob... Well, as close to Bob as he'd ever seen in his memories, which were by far incomplete. He was quite fat, but big. Almost too big. His black mustache glistened with sweat in the humid day. A purple sash crossed his midsection, half covering a red vest with golden buttons. He was the only fully dressed man out here.<br>
<br>
Below the long leather tail gripped in his hand was a beautiful woman. Young, yes, but she was definetley grown into womanhood. There was something else odd about her, as well... What was it?<br>
<br>
Was it the blood gushing from her body? Was it the dust that covered her, the way her body sprawled across the ground with exhaustion? Was it her tightly contracted muscles, obviously developed from long hours of hard work? No. Just before the beauty fell to the ground, &quot;B  O  B&quot; knew what it was; the eyes. Her beautiful, violet eyes shone with the radiance of a world gone mad, and &quot;B  O  B&quot; couldn't let that look go. Then the whip was raised.<br>
<br>
He didn't know anything about his abilities. &quot;B  O  B&quot; didn't think anything about the way he was able to nearly instantly appear beneath the fall of the wicked, barbed weapon. All he knew was that he needed to be there, and he was.<br>
<br>
The astounded Slave Master nearly screeched in rage. He ripped the whip back off of Bob's arm, taking flesh and sinew with it. He seemed not to notice. Muscled thugs crowded in around Bob, outnumbering him four to one, including the Slave Master. The wild, ragged looking young man ran dirty fingernails through his hair, and growled. Everything changed from it's normal hue, a violet tint, to a vicious red glow. Blood pumped through his tightly corded muscles, and a howl escaped his throat. A fist came screaming towards Bob's face, and he leaned backwards to avoid it. Bending at his knees, the fist overshot. He continued his backwards descent when the whip shot towards him. It caught Bob in the abdomen, just above the navel, and he grabbed the barbed strip of leather again. This time, Bob braced himself on the ground with a palm down, and yanked with all his strength. The Slave Master tumbled over.<br>
<br>
Three more standing. Bob hopped into the air and spun, releasing his hold on the length of the whip to send it spiraling outwards from his body. The barbs caught one man in the chest, another across the face, and the third avoided it all together. Bob landed, kicking up a cloud of dust, and was distracted from his melee by a stirring near his feet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 11:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> la~</span><hr size=1> Everything was in a haze. The world still spun around her, but she could make out figures. One stood before her, looking down with eyes that comforted her. He was a model for perfection with his deeply tanned skin and jet-black hair. She was caught up in his gaze when she saw it. A large man coming up fast to strike down the one who was obviously helping her. Instincts kick in and she raises her palms to the on commer. Closing her eyes and turning her face away, she takes a deep breath and prepairs for the worst. Voilet strands of energy explode from her palms and completely shoot through the man. Without warning he falls to his knees, his eyes gone violet and blood seeping from his mouth. Fear stuck to her body, she could not move or open her eyes. She heard movement near her, but she was already gone. Lost in her own mind with the 'darkness' encircling her. Her body trembles and her breath is taken in gasps, ~let the whip come... oh god let it come... the pain will save me... let the whip come...~ The whip never came... but the tears seem to never stop flowing... <p><Br> <Br> <Br>I'm just a sample of a soul made to look just like a human being</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la~</span><hr size=1> The violet waves pierced through the man's skin. Bob had broken the man's nose who avoided the whip. The one with a gash on his chest was grapling with the smaller wild man, but that third, the one with a gash on his face, died first. Instinct drew Bob's body out of the way of the blast, and the man he didn't see fell dead.<br>
<br>
He quickly bit out the gashed chest man's windpipe, and mule kicked the other one's face. His head spun around with a resounding *PPOPPP!*, and Bob wiped his mouth off. He knelt down to the beautiful woman, only now seeing her beautiful, aqua skin. Her eyes were clenched tight, face caked in dirt while tears streamed down, clearing chaotic paths across her perfect face. Bob put his hand on her cheek, and lifted her head, making cheek to cheek contact. Beauty... Power... Wasted? No... Come to me, he thought. Come back with me...<br>
<br>
The red faded. Blue serenity replaced the previous red viciousness. A tear fell from his cheek for this tortured being, this battered soul. He knew not how, or how long it took, but Bob was suddenly kneeling, resting her back on green grass next to a small stream. The clear water shone through, and he poured a bit on her aqua face. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la~</span><hr size=1> She felt it, the cool water against her skin, and disappeared. It had been forever since she had returned to the water, her abilities kept her from it while living as a slave. She was able to change forms and become part of the water, doing so always gave her mental clarity and a peace that she found no where else. She let only a moment pass before stepping out of the water and next to the man who saved her. Her skin was clean and glimmered like it should. Her hair was straight and seemed longer now that the tangles were gone. Her clothes had changed. She now wore long white pants, and a white top that had no straps and showed her stomach.

Bob's eyes were wide as dinner plates. He looked to his wrist to reassure himself. He whispered to himself, &quot;I. Am. B. O. B.&quot; He stood up from his knuckle-dragging posture. He straightened his back, and stood to his full height, which wasn't much by normal human standards... of course, he couldn't have known that. His bloody forearms and knuckles were the least of his concern, and he didn't realize how incredibley dingy and filthy he really was.

Hope for sentient beings was rekindled inside his shattered frame.<br>
<br>
Bob spoke, shakily, not trusting his own voice. It was still gutteral and a bit rough, but he could make out words well enough, to convey emotions, if nothing else. The violet tint returned to his world as Bob looked into this creature's eyes. So beautiful...<br>
<br>
&quot;F...&quot; He began. Looking around, he saw a yellow daisy. The flower was common everywhere, but there was only one here; Bob didn't know the worthlessness of this blossom, but the feeling was conveyed well enough. &quot;F-f...&quot; He handed the flower to the being before him. He knew he'd not find another creature so striking and so compassionate on this mudball of a planet; not among his kind, nor hers. Well, if there was truly a difference between the two. &quot;Frrrr...&quot;<br>
<br>
Setting the flower into her palm, Bob nearly choked on the words. &quot;B-beeee myyy... Frrrr... frrrrrrrrrRRRRRRE- frrriend?&quot; Large violet eyes looked down at him, and seemed to glow in the tint of the world.<br>

<br>
&quot;I... I... I...&quot;  What could she say? What words would be right? Interaction with other life was so difficult. She begins to wish she was back in line... back where she knew what to do, where she was asure of herself. <br>

He looked at it closely, inspecting for damage. Then, he saw it; there was a BUG on his FLOWER!! Grunting angrily, he dunked the dandelion into the water, and watched the frail insect float away on crystalline waters.<br>
<br>
Setting a knuckle down and hunching his already crooked spine, Bob did a kind of monkey jigg over towards her. He put a dingy arm around her shoulders, and tucked the flower behind her ear. Tears stung at the edges of his eyes. She didn't want to be my friend...<br>
<br>
Bob didn't waste any time. A reassuring nuzzle on the delicate skin of her arm, and he was gone like the breeze. Before she even looked up, he was grunting and hooting with each leap. He was into the trees, russling the branches before she realized he was gone-<br>

As if forcing her whole family away from her was not enough, she had to force someone who helped her away as well. Someone... who helped her, that was right! She had to find him. Instantly her eyes shift aqua, where was he? Her eyes were drawn upwards, the trees. All that she saw was a blur, green energies radiated from the tree's, but this kind soul radiated yellow, he was easy to follow. She had not noticed, but clouds formed over head while the two had talked, or in this case, while they did not talk. Slowly, one drop after another fell to the ground and was absorbed instantly into the thirsty soil. Her feet moved faster and faster along the softening ground, following that yellow energy where ever it took her. With her own speed, the rain fell harder. Sheets of rain drop from the heavens, it was time to use her skill to her advantage. Mid-stride she jumps, and disappears. Faster than any human could ever hope to travel, her form liquifies and is sent rushing from one droplet to the next, she *would* catch up to this person, she had to...  <p><Br> <Br> <Br>I'm just a sample of a soul made to look just like a human being</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 9:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wablop.</span><hr size=1> Instinct played out again.

<br>
Things don't follow things unless they're hunting them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hunt-   errrrrrr!!!&quot; he growled. His eyes glowed green, and everything about him turned to that of the trees- he blended in like a chameleon. At first, he was surprised by this. Soon after, though, he felt the presence of the stalker pass him by, underneath the canopy. POUNCE!<br>
<br>
On the way down, his eyes flared red. Combat magick seeped from his pores, and red flares of energy flowed from his body, streaming outwards to encase the thing that followed. Only....<br>
<br>
There was nothing there!<br>
<br>
Confused and bewildered, Bob knew he felt the presence before him, but there was nothing...<br>
<br>
The drops sluiced off his body- dirt was slowly washed away as he stared where he knew something should be. He sat down, the red fading, his eyes shifting back to violet; the shrubs surrounding him and trees above him did little to protect him from the chill of the rain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 12:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> mwahaha</span><hr size=1> She appears, her form perfect as ever and completely dry.

Bob's eyes shone bright blue, and he stood more erect, and finally straightened his shoulders. He poked his finger into his chest. &quot;B-&quot; His mind clouded, and he looked again to his wrist. &quot;B  O  B&quot; was still carved there.

<br>
The speech came so fast that Bob couldn't understand what he said. All he knew was that the common language was coming from some external force- the tongue he spoke in, which he somehow *knew* was called Combine, came from him, indeed.<br>
<br>
His eyes lifted from the ground to meet hers; she was a bit bewildered, and Bob wasn't sure if she understood. Somehow, for the first time, he did. Being slightly taller than her, he could stoop a bit, as was his normal posture. Bob touched her shoulder, saying, &quot;Mien dellagroot del ne'seeko,&quot;<br>
                       &quot;My princess of the waves,&quot;<br>
<br>
The transparent voice encased his words again, clarifying them. Bob took her stamped and numbered wrist, and put his lips to it. Then he pointed to himself again. &quot;Bob.&quot;<br>
<br>
He pointed to her. &quot;As'ahmay,&quot; he whispered.<br>

She repeated the word, not knowing what it meant, but loving it none the less. His language was breath taking, almost as stunning as he was. As'ahmay... she did not know what it meant, but for now, it would be her name. Her hand trembles at the feel of his skin against hers, another life... Interacting with another life... She knew it was all supposed to come naturally, but it didn't. Her slender finger's delicately brush away a few strands of his hair from his forehead. Everything about him so was intriguing.

As'ahmay... Beauty... He pressed her delicate hand to his cheek, reveling in the soft touch of another's skin to his own. He could remember little, though that need for remembering was rarely needed; he knew he'd never been touched with compassion so deep before this day.<br>
<br>
With her palm and fingers gingerly touching his cheek, Bob looked to As'ahmay again, lost in her perfection. He reached out and touched her cheek, and stared into her very soul. &quot;Beauty...&quot; He whispered. &quot;Mien As'ahmay... My Beauty,&quot; His hand reached slowly behind her head, and pulled her face gently closer. His lips touched hers, as he felt it should be done. When the contact was made, everything in Bob's head swam, exploded, and stole his breath away; she was so gentle...<br>
<br>
Shouts had been echoing off in the distance for nearly half an hour now, but neither had noticed, so wrapped up in each other they were. As Bob withdrew his lips, and moved closer for another wonderful kiss that filled him with so much joy, big, burly men burst through the underbrush, with tan shirts, high black boots, and big guns. &quot;As'ahmay...&quot; he whispered again. &quot;My beauty.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=1.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=1.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=20><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7>Role Playing Forum</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
