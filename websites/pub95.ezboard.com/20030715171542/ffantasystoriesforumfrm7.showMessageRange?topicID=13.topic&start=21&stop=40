He didn't get a discription of the fellow Jerron from the shopkeep, but he thought he could just go around asking. Finding that the small bit of info he had obtained wasn't really the great news he had taken it for, Andy was more or less discouraged once more. So many people wandering around the streets. &quot;Do you know where I can find a man named Jerron?&quot; he asked again as a stranger bumped into him. The man was shorter than he was and looked to be a more or less of a rough one. &quot;Well boy, I'm looking for that guy too. Maybe the both of us could look together. I hear that he and a few of his friends have a room in one of those buildings over there.&quot; he nodded towards them with his chin. &quot;But a few of my boys here haven't been able to find them for some time. It seems like weeks. So you looking for em for a reason?&quot; Andy smiled, &quot;My sister is one of his friends and I was hoping that he would know where she is.&quot; The man's smile grew. &quot;Ahh a friend huh? Well then I'll just stick around with you.&quot; The smile was one of malicious intent. &quot;I'm Andy, who are you?&quot; The man looked up at him. &quot;I'm George. You can call me Georgie.&quot; Andy smiled. This city was so much different than the home he had grown up ini. He was happy there until he learned that his life had been a lie. His parents had come across him when he was little wandering the streets and taken him in. Only did they tell him about this a few short weeks ago. Ever siince then he went in search for his family. Not finding anything but small bits of information about his parents and more about his sister than his father or mother. And that was only her name. &quot;So how do you know Jerron?&quot; Andy asked hoping to understand the malicious look. &quot;Well, he is a friend of ours, you see we always go to clubs to hang out, it was just a few weeks ago that him and his group, there were eight of them, left the clubs. See we had a bit of a disagreement and so I wanted to make a mence.&quot; Understanding swept through him. This was not a friend, but atleast he might be able to help. Reaching a hand into his finely tailored suit Andy felt for the small blade the man he called father had given him before he left. It was the one he learned to fight with. In his family's home Andy was always curious with the more primative weapons such as knives and the martial arts. There were a rare few left that knew those arts well enough to teach in his home city. Everyone there was a peacful sort and Andy deeply missed his home. But he had to find his sister before he could go. He only hoped he could conveince her to come back with him. Looking down to the mean little man leading them down the street, Andy slowly started to pull the blade from his coat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rillen@fantasystoriesforum>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/22/02 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> gaaaa, I've gotta post again, don't I.</span><hr size=1> Together they wept, tearlessly.  The physical contact was good for Jerron.  Her hands felt foreign, but comforting.  He welcomed the instance in time in which he could let down his guard, and bare his soul to one of the few who could understand him.  They had been through the same thing, lost the same people, felt the same pains.  But, it was even harder for her.  Jerron had never grown as close to Mika and Jash as Nefer had.  He hid behind a curtain of uncertainty and fear.  How ever terrible he felt, she must feel a thousand times worse.  And for that, he held her tighter to his chest, never wishing to let go.  The echoing of feet, stepping quickily down stairs, interrupted the moment.  Awkwardly, he unclasped his arms from her tiny frame.  His hands lingered on her arm, not wanting to let go.  &quot;Lets go.  I'm really not that hungry, but I just need to get of here.&quot;  She nodded.  He couldn't tell if she smiled, but he wished that she did.  Acting quite the gentleman, he held open the door for her, and she stepped out.  Carmen had come down, and stood holding a legal pad.  <br>
&quot;Oh, good, your still here.  While your out, can you pick up this stuff?&quot;  He took the offered pad and looked it over.<br>
&quot;Sure.&quot;  The things were pretty simple, light bulbs, toilet paper, bread, milk, cheese, coffee, tea, the basics.  They needed nothing else.  &quot;We'll be back soon.&quot;  <br>

Jerron was still reading the list as she began to pull on his arm. She wanted out of the house today more than ever. The depressed feeling might lift a bit once they entered the fresh air. With their arms interlocked around eachother they walked down the stairs and out of the building. <br>
<br>
The sky was beautiful. At least in Nefertiti's eyes. Pale, soft, and grey. It's color was completely unwavering, not a single cloud dare creep across it's magnificantness. Her lips wanted to smile, but the sorrow that clung to her, no matter what her mood, kept it just as it was. Glancing from side to side they paused. Her voice was tiny, hushed, yet sweet as always and unfearful. &quot;Where to first, sweetpea?&quot; A little sigh escaped her bubblegum lips and she rested her head against his arm. Where to first? How about back to a few months ago when the group was all together? How about into the future to better times? How about a magical land of happiness and rainbows where all of this @#%$ would disappear? There was always the corner store, after all they were having a sale of some sort. One of those once a year sales they have every three months. Rubbing her hand up and down the arm of Jerron's she clung to she waited for him to answer. Staying home would have been so much more easier. Less stress of being in public. But then again, they did have eachother. One foot in front of the other was all it took. And in doing just that she made her way towards the store with her arms still clutching Jerron's.  <p><br>

A Crappy post from me!</span><hr size=1> Carmen sauntered back into the kitchen, a heavy sigh escaping her lips and filling the silence of the apartment. On the table before her, two plates of old breakfast food sat. Jerron must have made breakfast for the ladies, but as usual, it didn't get eatten.<br>
<br>
Lifting the plates from the table, Carmen walked them over to the trash can. She tossed the old contents into the garbage, then walked the plates to the sink. Turning on the water, she began to scrub the plates clean. It was weird. She never was a very neat girl, but ever since Carmen had moved in permanently with Jerron and Neferiti, she'd delevoped this weird desire to keep everything clean. It wasn't like they ever had visitors, but other than eachother it was all they had. So, she took pride in it. <br>
<br>
When all the dishes were done, dried, and put away, Carmen wiped down the counter and the table. Looking around, she decided the kitchen looked well enough and tossed the sponge back into the sink. <br>
<br>
Making her way out into the living room, she scanned the place, making sure she had grabbed the last of the beer bottles. Which, of course, she had earlier that morning while the rest of the crew was still asleep. <br>
<br>
Carmen stood in the middle of the room, she had nothing to do... Devin was asleep, Jerron and Neferiti were out.<br>
<br>
Looking down at her body, she decided what she needed to go do. Take a shower. <br>
<br>
Walking back to the room, Nefer and herself shared, Carmen grabbed a clean bra and pair underwear. She decided she'd just come back and change into her clothes when she was done... A nice hot shower did sound relaxing right then... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/23/02 7:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> again</span><hr size=1> Walking out of the ally, Andy looked at his hands. They were covered in blood. The man had hit him first he kept telling himself. That man hit him first, but he didn't see the knife. looking at the crowd he shoved his hands back into his pockets. Decideing he would walk to the nearest store and see if he could wash the blood off, Andy started to move towards the first shop he could see. Walking in he saw it was a general store and there were only a few people in it. There was a young woman who looked to be almost sick clinging onto another man who didn't look much better, an elderly couple and a few single shoppers. Walking to the clerk he smiled. &quot;Do you have a restroom here?&quot; The clerk smiled and pointed to the back of the store. Nodding his thanks Andy hurried to the back.<br>
<br>
Once he had cleaned his blade and his hands, he was now back on his search. He would just have to be more careful who he talked to. Walking back into the store most of the shoppers and left only the elderly couple and the two ill looking shoppers. Smiling at them he waited behind the old people in line for the clerk. The other two came behind him and waited as well. Finally the old couple was done and was leaving the store. Andy walked up to the clerk. &quot;Sir, could you prehaps help me once more? I'm looking for someone, I can't give you much information on her, but I do know her name. Nefertiti. I hear she has a compainion by the name of Jerron, but I have been unsuccessful in finding either of them. Do you know where I could?&quot; with a grin on the clerk's face he pointed behind Andy. Slowly turning around, he saw the two ill looking folks. &quot;I don't understand, are they outside?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/23/02 8:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Here comes the rain again...</span><hr size=1> Here comes the rain again<br>

'ok' she thought, 'i'm ready'.  pulling her sleve back down she bent over and picked up her things.<br>
<br>
The door swung easily open without Mika having to lay a finger on it.  Which was a good thing, for in her left hand she carried a large brown sack filled with meat and vegitable curries.  In her right hand she carried a small black backpak that contained her only possesions.  Almost as if she had never been gone and the events of the last few months had never happened, she waltzed into the large common room and flung herself down on the sofa.  she reached into the bag and took out a small box of curry and threw it at devin who was reclined in the corner.  it landed with a warm plop on his chest but did not spill.  <br>
   &quot;you better start eating before it gets cold&quot;  Mika warned.  without waiting for a response she got up to see who else was home.  a box of curry in one hand and chopsticks in the other she walked toward the sound of the running shower.  she kicked open the bathroom door which had been left unlatched and called into the steam filled room through a full mouth, &quot;hullo?&quot;<br>

He stared the man in his searching eyes and spoke.  &quot;I am Jerron.  Who are you to ask?&quot;  After he spoke, he felt foolish.  This man could be an officer, or a keeter.

Marcus? She thought her brother would be named Osiris or Tutum-whatever, something Egyptian like hers, but Marcus? ...Brother? She had a brother? What did he want? Why was he here? Ooo! Her parents never told her about this! Her parents... They had something to do with this... Her brother... The offspring of those horrid people... Ice collected in her eyes and her muscles tightened. Parents. Her parents. She felt the grotesque markings of her past sting her abdomen. Parents. Bound to her forever. Cruel past. The pain. The hurt. Abuse? Trauma. Scars. Blood stained. Her blood. Their hands. Parents. Family. Returned… Every pain stricken memory in her mind screamed out at once in a harmonious call for help. The heart gripping noise echoed from the depths of her brain and ripped at her soul. Jerron’s arm was dropped instantly and her eyes turned on Andy. Stormy gray and dripping with a hate so deep not even her gods themselves could save her from it. <br>
<br>
“Try Egypt”<br>
<br>
Nefertiti thrusts her shoulder into Andy as she pushes her way by. She thought Jerron might have called out to her, or maybe someone else did… It didn’t mater she couldn’t hear them, not now. Not as she ran on, to a place she once knew, a place that hopefully was the same as it was then. An old refuge. No, she couldn’t hear them now… Her mind was gone. Images, flashbacks, just like in the movies… only real. They were of her past, of her trials, of her grievances. Of her pain… Always pain. Because there’s no better word. <br>

They did bear a resemblance, but ...she had never mentioned siblings.  But, then again, when did she mention her family?  Hardly, except in a curse.  It was more than possible that this smiling lump was her kin.  One had only to look into her eyes to tell her feelings about the situation though.  Her gaze made daggers seem dull.  Without puasing to grab his hand, she left.  In a flurry of black cloth and turqoise stone, she pushed past the man who claimed to be her brother, and into the street.  &quot;Nefer, wait!&quot;  But, she did not wait.  Oh gods, this couldn't be good for her.  He tried to follow her, but he lost her in a throng of people.  Whether that Marcus charecter searched also, he didn't know, nor did he care.  In the corner of his eye he saw a small flash of black, Nefer, turning onto another street.  Gods, he knew were she was heading.  <br>

Carmen was standing naked in the shower clutching her heart (aperently mika had suprised her).  Mika blushed and apologized and quickly made her way back to the main room in time to catch devin's questions.  <br>
<br>
Mika stood and stared blankly at Devin.  Part of her wanted to answer him, to tell him exactly what had happened to her; to cry on his shoulder.  But that was not her style and she knew it.  She had also decided that some things were better forgotten, and she desperatly wanted this to be one of them.  So instead, she took another bite of curry and sat down on the couch.  <br>
     &quot;how ya doing?&quot;  she mumbled as she licked sauce from the corner of her mouth.  <br>
<br>
a dagger cut into her heart.  Neferititi was near and her emotions were high.  Mika called out through time and space, whispered in her friends ear, &quot;come.&quot;<br>

Mika? Could it really have been Mika? The hot water beat down on Carmen for hours in her mind. Stunned and unable to function. Mika? Slowly, the ability to move came back to her and she carefully turned off the shower. Mika! Jumping from the white tile she ripped her towel from the bar and burst through the door wrapping it around herself as she did so. Running into the living room she stopped dead in her tracks and stared at the couch. Mika... Soap bubbles slid down her still soaked skin while tiny droplets littered the floor from her drenched blonde hair. Confusion. Happiness. Saddness. Wonder. Anger. Hope? Which one to feel... None. As her blank violet eyes watched Mika's every movement Carmen had no idea what she should feel. Confusion because Mika mysterious returned and things seemed to be as they were months ago. A Dream? Happiness because a lost friend was returned. Sadness because the others were still gone. Wonder where the others are. Anger because there is nothing better to feel. Or hope... Hope that the others might return just as Mika did and the past two months will have been nothing more than a terrible nightmare that finally - FINALLY will come to an end...<br>
<br>
~*(Nefertiti *~ Come... She heard it echo through her mind. She knew the voice well. It couldn't be. She almost didn't want it to be. For if it was... then it would cause the wounds she was trying so hard to mend to reopen and then close and she wasn't sure if she could handle such a thing. And so she continued to run. Tears rolling down her cheeks and the wind burning them into her skin with its icy kiss. She had finally snapped... Thought she heard her* voice again... She was hearing things. Crazy. No other explination. Wanted something so bad she made it true. Lies. She* was long gone. Never to return. Remember? But her* voice... it was here, it was real. How? No. Lies. Wrong. Crazy. <br>
She needed to be safe. She needed to feel protected. So she ran. No one would find her where she was going. They couldn't. She didn't want them to. Her feet slowed as she came upon large steel gates. The fimiliar &quot;F&quot; was twisted and entwined in metal vines high up on the gate. No one knew what the &quot;F&quot; stood for, but in her eyes it was beautiful. <br>
A child's voice came from the sandbox 80 feet to her right. The sun shown through as other children giggled near by. &quot;One day I'll own this whoooole thing. I will. And I'll change my name to &quot;F&quot; so that the gates will mean ME. And you can come and stay here with me. We can live here together and be King and Queen until we're old, and then we'll give it to our grandchildren and they can be Prince and Princess forever, and they'll carry on my &quot;F&quot; name. I just need to make up the name first.&quot; Little girl with a little boy. Sitting in a little sand box. Bright blue eyes and dark brown hair up in pig tails with bows that matched the turquoise shirt she wore. The sun faded and the children were long since gone. A soul hadn't set foot on these grounds for years. Abandoned and lost. Nefertiti squeezed through the gates and ran through the large court yard that she had spent the majority of her childhood in. No one knew of her secret love for this place, no one had the slightest clue... except for one. She slammed open the enormous wooden front doors. Everything was dimmer now. Unlike the dead and unkept yards, the inside's only flaw was dust and cobwebs. All of the furniture had been left as well as all the furnishings. Thick draps hung over the windows and kept out the light. Nefertiti turned around ever-so slowly. It was all the same... A heavy pounding on the steps jerked her entire body to face them. A tiny giggle came from higher up on the stair well just beyond it's turn. <br>
&quot;Titi! Come on!&quot; <br>
&quot;W... wait!&quot;<br>
Her feet clomped up each turn of steps as fast as she could. The giggling called her up, up, and up. These stairs were always exhausting. Letting out a breathless sigh, she took the final step and reached the top. Gods damn those things, pain in the ass. <br>
&quot;Titi, hurry!&quot;<br>
Again, she found herself trailing after the youthful voice. Through this hall, turn onto this one, past these doors... this castle like house was gigantic! An utter maze of coridors, hallways, wings, and rooms. The voice and laughter grew quieter...<br>
&quot;Wait! Not so fast! I can't keep up!&quot;<br>
Running again. The noise had all but died leaving only the pounding of her feet to keep away the silence. She ran almost frantically now, knowing and not knowing where she was going and trying to find that voice again. Her hand grabbed onto a door knob and thrust open the door. Out of breath she looked blankly into the room. De-hehehehe. That laugh! From behind her it rang out and made her jump. Spining around behind she was greated with-nothing. And the laughter was gone...<br>

Reluctantly, he turned for home.  She would come back, stable.  The five minutes it took him to get home were plagued with thoughts of Nefer, her still form lying, blood dripping from a wound in her side.  As strong as he wanted her to be, and wished she was, he couldn't get himself to believe it.  And oddly, he felt strange, as if eyes were staring down at him, as if he were being followed.

She had the look of a squirril who just watched a nut get up and run away.  Devin was sitting up now and was giving Mika a very similar look so Mika felt obligated to say something, as if to lagitamize her existance.  &quot;Hey guys!&quot;  she said, trying hard to sound normal.  No one said anything, they just kept staring.  &quot;Soo . . . &quot; Mika began again after an akward silence, &quot;where is everyone?&quot;  feeling very self conscious, mika poked idly at the little bit of curry left at the bottom of her box, averting her eyes from the stares.  finally, in desperation, &quot;I gotta go out for a smoke.&quot;  Mika blurted out as she stood up and headed for the door.

There was slight resistance from the other side, but nothing notable.  Jerron finally allowed himself to breathe.  Nefer was out, alone, and Jerron now admitted to himself that he worried for her.  It was a dangerous world outside the walls of his apartment, a world he himself feared.  It had taken his friends from him, and daily tried to kill him.  Better for her to be locked away, ignorant of that world.  Damn, Carmen would be mad.  He had forgotten to get the groceries.  Gently, he pulled open the paint-chipped door, and there she stood.  Mika the strong stood before him, a crooked smile on her lips.  There was an awkward silence for but a moment before Mika broke it.  &quot;Hey Jerron.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Mika.......&quot;  She had returned, but from what.  He saw no physical wounds, but.....he could sense something.  Under all her bravado and strength had always hidden an emotional girl just looking for love, but they hid something more now.  Something more personal.  But that didn't matter.  She had returned.  A slight hint of color returned to his cheeks which had been pale for months, and the lips which hadn't parted except to speak formed a smile.  It was nothing like her big, tooty grin, but it was a smile.  He wanted to hug her, to embrace her, and never let her go.  Never to leave her, never again.  No, they had never been that close.  But she was more than just Mika to him.  She was a chance for salvation and a return to the times when he smiled more often.  He quelched the urge, and said, &quot;I've missed you&quot;, and under his breath, added, 'more than you can ever know.' <br>

OOC (Beginning to think I can't write well in an RP....Oh, btw, has anyone ever read anything by Mercedes Lackey?  Well, in her books the people can have innate abilities which I think kinda mirror those we have/had in s'just life.  <br>
Mindspeech-can talk to others, hear their thoughts, and to a degree, attack with it(mental screaming of a sort.  Only used by the strongest mind speakers)  <br>
Empaths-Can feel other's emotions, and help to change them.  Greatly helps people with emotional trauma, and can help people come over fears/heal faters/etc.  Strongest of them can attack with emotions etc fear, anger, hatred.<br>
Fetchers-Can move things.  Can move objects to and fro, the larger the object the harder to move.  The strongest can move people, even themselves, but without great strength and concentration they run the risk of jumbling up the peoples insides ergo-killing them.  Even for the best its a big risk.<br>

Then she saw it.  Her old friends, in the same room together again.  She couldn't help but smile.  but in that smile she also carried longing and sorrow.  Here her friends were, those that she had not seen in far too long.  But there were still some missing.  and the one to whom her thoughts were humbled all . . . well . . . she still hadn't found her.  <br>

<br>
Mika, slightly blushed, fumbled with her cigarettes, mumbled something about going out to get some fresh air and quickly brushed by Jarron and headed down the stairs and out the door.  She needed time to t hink.  She needed time to catch up with herself.  she was beging to wonder if coming back had been such a good idea, maybe she should have stayed in central america,  . . . maybe she should have given her life instead of her soul.  <br>
<br>
she walked the lonely streets as the sun set and the wind howled.  she spoke to neferiti, quietly, under her breath, and she spoke to herself, loud enough that the few passers by gave her funny looks and crossed to the other side of the street when she got near.  she spoke to the wind and asked it for help.  she stopped dead in her tracks when, to her suprise, it answered.  ghostly childish voices came to her on the wind, tickled her ears and made the hair on the back of her neck stand on end.  the speech was incomprehencible but it maintained that certian sophistication that seperated it from the natural sounds and turned it into speech.  <br>
<br>
a single tear rolled from her eye.  she stood in the street, shiviering in the cool evening breeze, home, but not complete.<br>
