Chapter 7<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadows Converge.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This was the last thing he needed, not only had he not wanted to watch over his two grandnieces, he absolutely detested what had happened this night. In order to keep everything quiet he had told his grandson to arrive unnoticed, instead things had gone all amiss. Furthermore he was now having to deal with the situation before him, of three others he held a great deal of contempt for, mostly because of who their father was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kiri, how many times did our parents say never to bring men home?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look who's talking, what about him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was more or less forced to come here. It's not my fault she had this thing for wanting to beat me senseless.&quot;<br>
<br>
At hearing that Rina stood up straight and dropped Ash to the floor as if he where dead weight. It was clear things weren't exactly going over smooth like one would expect. Also there was the fact that these two where at least part vampire, which they knew didn't settle to well with their great uncle. This was becoming one big mess, one that was going to surely become worse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone just shut up now!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But it's her....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I said shut up! I never wanted to baby-sit any of you, and the fact that their here doesn't help matters. If you worried about me finding out or knowing they are some kind of vampires I already know that.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was surprising to everyone in the room, most especially to the ones he was talking about. They had all thought they could hide themselves from anyone, no matter how acquit their senses where. All this did was to further confuse everyone in the room, save for the old man.<br>
<br>
&quot;I might be old, but I'm certainly not stupid. I know that your father had several children after he was resurrected, though I never imagined I would meet them. However, since you pose no threat, or have proven yourselves before my eyes you won't be destroyed here and now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I doubt  you could do that no one is.....&quot;, before Ash could say another word he was proven wrong.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the fact that he didn't believe anyone could be that strong, it was the fact that he didn't believe anyone could move fast enough. Though now he realized this was all an illusion as he found himself being lifted into the air by his shirt. He now knew this old man wasn't all he appeared to be, this much was for certain now.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Ryo, an I fought your father. In fact I've grown much stronger since then, so it is best you don't try to anger me again.&quot;, with that he dropped Ash to the floor.<br>
<br>
Alexander had always known his father was strong, but never fully realized how someone could defeat him. Now he knew why, and furthermore he was at the mercy of one of the few people who could destroy him at a whim. If anything at least he knew where his brother and sister now where, which where going to make things easier for him once this was over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now since it seems your all going to be guests here for awhile... I want your names as I'm sure we're most likely going to be on a first name basis from now on. As for the argument about who's in trouble, I'm taking full responsibility for this all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Sir, my name is Alexander.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm called Ash&quot;, all he could do was wave up from his place on the floor, he was to tired to stand for the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Elizabeth...&quot;<br>
<br>
She was amazed that all this had happened, yet she was also confused as to just why Damon was being so quiet. More so confusing was how her brothers had come to be here in this house with these women. If anything it was odd for her to see her brother Ash so well behaved now, but she knew things where best that he kept on friendly terms with this man called Ryo.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you will notice the two girls who where fighting like children are called Kiri and Rina. The quiet one here is called Damon.&quot;<br>
<br>
All he could do was glance at the others when his name was mentioned. He felt horrible after what had happened earlier. Long ago his grandfather told him that losing control of a situation would have dire results, now he was realizing just how true those words where. If his grandfather hadn't stopped him he would have surely killed Elizabeth in his rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Feel free to rest while your all here. Damon your training will begin in the morning, I suggest you get the bite on your arm looked at. As for you Rina, I'll teach you some more rules about combat tomorrow since it's become blatantly obvious you show no discretion or forethought when fighting.&quot;<br>
<br>
With all that said Ryo simply left them to their own thoughts, as well as anything he had to do. He knew the three he had left there would not harm anyone there. It was sort of an latent ability he had gained through the passage of time. If anything they would be of more help to his family than a hindrance now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like your in trouble again Rina, what did you do this time?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened certainly wasn't my fault, you have to understand that.&quot;, Rina knew full well this wasn't true, if anything it was a bluff at best.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think what he was talking about was the fact that she nearly killed me on accident with some sort of attack.&quot;, Ash hadn't taken the time to even sit up, it was far less painful for him to remain on the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;How was I to know you are what you are?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm surprised anyone was able to hit him, normally he does so well at running away and avoiding such things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't avoid it, whatever it was homed in on me...&quot;, Ash still couldn't shake the feeling the attack had left him with.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well of course it would idiot, that's just how Soul Reactance works.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Soul Reactance, a technique that frees the souls of the undead so that they can enact vengeance upon other undead.&quot;, this was something Damon knew all to well.<br>
<br>
In fact Damon had seen this particular technique used by his own father. If anything it was far more unique than anything else he had seen. This was something he began to wonder about, most especially since his grandfather had mention he would eventually learn some of the most secret of family arts.<br>
<br>
It wasn't odd for Kiri or Rina to see Damon from time to time. They knew he tended to be quiet and withdrawn for the most part. One thing they had noticed was that he tended to avoid women in general. If anything this only made them pay more attention to him, which to them didn't seem like something he wanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for you, I'm not finished with you yet!&quot;, Rina glared down at Ash.<br>
<br>
&quot;No fighting in the house! You remember what happened the last time you and Magus fought right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How could I forget, I wonder how he's doing anyway with grandpa training him.&quot;, this only proved to stir Rina's thoughts now.<br>
<br>
This much was for certain, Rina and Magus had never seen eye to eye on most things. The constant fighting had finally came to the point where they had to be separated. This in turn only made her go out and begin bar room brawls. The way her parents seen this is that at least it wasn't their house that was getting destroyed, and at least she was keeping the usual low lives on their toes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I would imagine that our brother is probably much better at fighting than you are by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As if, sure he had the strength, but he'll always be slow.&quot;<br>
<br>
To say that this was surprising to Elizabeth was an understatement. She had never seen a woman who was so wrapped up in fighting. In fact she seemed to be worse than some of the barbarians she had came across in the town earlier that night. However, her attention was soon brought back to Damon.<br>
<br>
All the while that they had been talking he had been quietly tending to the bite mark on his arm. Damon took little pleasure in this, since he tried his best to avoid being injured. This mostly had to deal with the fact that the clerics from back home would have given anything to get their hands on him. That was something he just wouldn't allow, since if anything he figured they would cause him more harm than good.<br>
<br>
&quot;You could of at least let me do that, since I did cause it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather do things like this myself if you don't mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know Alex, I'd have to say this is the first time anyone's actually gave Becky the cold shoulder.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do believe your right Ash.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure enough, both of Elizabeth's brothers began to laugh, which wasn't the wisest of all things to do. For his part in this Alex found himself ushered back into Kiri's room. Needless to say Ash found himself being handled like a rag doll as Rina shoved him into another room. This in turn left Damon and Elizabeth by themselves, which was something he would have rather avoided.<br>
<br>
&quot;I almost feel sorry for those two, the one will be pampered to death, and the other could be beaten to death.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So why are you so withdrawn anyway? It's something I've been dying to ask you about.&quot;, a look of curiosity came across Elizabeth's face as she finally began to study him.<br>
<br>
In her opinion there shouldn't of really been a reason for Damon to act the way he did. After all he was fairly handsome, and considering what happened earlier he had to of been well built. This was all a big puzzle to her now. It was obvious that there was some reason that he chose to be withdrawn, and now she was determined to find out just what it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose the best explanation is that I'd prefer to be left alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elizabeth didn't get a chance to reply though as she heard her brother Ash being tormented. Apparently Rina as making good on her promise of getting even with him, though not exactly in the way anyone expected. She definitely had some strange tendencies, this one being one of the stranger ones.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let go!!! Stop with the pulling!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quit your whining! It's not that bad, besides I want you to be at full strength when I grind you into the dirt!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Somebody get this mad woman off me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ash made what could be described as a valiant attempt to wedge himself out the door of the room. Of course Rina would have none of this and quickly jerked him back inside and slammed the door shut. At seeing this a slight smile crossed Damon's face, and a small giggle escaped Elizabeth's lips.<br>
<br>
<br>
If anything all Ryo could do on his walk home was wonder just what was coming in the near future. The feelings he had gotten as well as the recent news he had heard of disturbed him. It was becoming apparent that someone of great power as beginning to set into motion a plan.<br>
<br>
He wasn't to fond of dealing with such things, if anything he disliked it more than dealing with his great nieces. At least he had gotten encouraging news that Magus's training was entering the near final stages for the up coming tournament. This was something he would definitely enjoy seeing.<br>
<br>
It wasn't often he got to see a good fight these days, what with the world having calmed down somewhat. This tournament was going to be one that he'd do anything to get to see. Besides he had his own plans for getting Damon to enter. If anything he wanted to see just how far his own grandson could advance.<br>
<br>
What was beginning to complicate matters where the fact that far more people where intending to enter the upcoming fight than ever before. This meant he was going to have to show Damon some special techniques that he'd be saving for just such an occasion. Furthermore he knew that Magus was going to be able to put up one hell of a fight.<br>
<br>
Ryo had noticed that even at an early age that Magus had a talent the likes of which he hadn't seen before. What was odd was the fact that he always seemed to hold back, no matter the situation. This was something he simply couldn't understand, but perhaps it was for the best for him to do such rather than have to face the consequences that both he and Shoken had experienced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deep inside the Mistmoore Castle things where not going as Mayong would have liked. No one had been able to bring his children back home, no matter who it was. He was now being forced to use his last resort. Long ago things had been arranged and now he wasn't going to allow the whims of his foolish children to disturb everything.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since you three are betrothed to my children it is up to you to return them here. Failure will result in your deaths.&quot;<br>
<br>
The people to which he spoke knew all to well this was more of a promise than a threat. None of them wanted to lose the chance at the kind of power they would gain through marriage. This meant they where going to be intent on facing whomever stood in their way, no matter who or what they where.<br>
<br>
Mayong silently cursed to himself of how his children where. They had ended up with his stubbornness save for their mothers compassion. This was what truly had him angered, since it was obvious they where going to fight the arrangements anyway they could. Their escape from the castle as well as them having avoided most of the contact with his spies is what had really gotten to him.<br>
<br>
It didn't matter though he knew just where they where going. Mayong knew they where going to head to Freeport and use the Tournament to hide in. He also knew that some of his old enemies where going to be in that very same city. The worst possible thing he could imagine would be his own children hiding out with the same people responsible for his death.<br>
<br>
Though most disturbing to the great vampire was the fact he felt an old familiar presence of evil beginning to build again. He knew all to well who this was, and hated this person for the way he had been used by them. If anything they where more responsible for his death than the people who carried the Kataoka family name.<br>
<br>
This was by far the worst thing he expected, since he was now going to need every shred of power he could muster to at least ensure his own survival as well as his families survival. He wasn't about to let anyone ruin what he had managed to rebuild over the years. All Mayong now wished for was not to take control of the Faydwer continent, but to simply see his family grow and be safe.<br>
<br>
If anything this was something none of his past enemies would have suspected. In fact it was harder for him to believe it himself. Nonetheless this was something he wanted now, and he was determined to have it at any cost. This meant he was going to use his full power that he had just recently managed to regain to ensure that everything he wanted came to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=96.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=96.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.threadControl?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2>EverQuest Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
