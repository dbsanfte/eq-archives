Chapter 6<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadows from the Past, part 3.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This weather was simply to intolerable a best for the weary traveler. He had heard it had been raining while on the boat, but hadn't actually given it much thought. In fact he was still wondering what his grandfather had to teach him since he had sent for him from his other grandparents. It was something he was use to though, every so often he would take the time to visit his grandparents on either side of the family.<br>
<br>
Still he wondered just why his human grandfather was so odd at times, as if he was detached from what he was doing for a moment. The young man had to admit though that he was more like his grandfather than anyone would have thought. Sure redheads ran in both sides of his family tree, but the fact that his hair was nearly the color of blood is what made the majority of his family believe he took after his human grandfather.<br>
<br>
Though he didn't like to think about it he was often taunted by most of the children where his family had lived on Faydwer because of his looks. Given his mother was a wood elf, and his father was half dark elf he should have looked more like an elf than anything else. Of course with this he hadn't exactly had an easy childhood, but then again his parents where kind and caring as where most of the adult neighbors they had. If anything it was comforting to know that they accepted him just as they accepted his father.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless his mind was brought back to his surroundings as the boat finally stopped at the docks. At least he didn't have to worry about the ocean part of the trip anymore. He had to admit though it was kind of nice to travel by foot for once. Furthermore he had caught a glimpse of several rare creatures the voyage, which had managed to ebb his boredom somewhat.<br>
<br>
Freeport was just as he remembered it, and he often enjoyed coming to visit his family here, especially his cousins. The fact that he had cousins just around his age was nice, it made things pass easier when he was a child on his visits here. He had as much fun as could be expected, what with the eldest of his cousins being male and all. It was quite fun just the same, even though the two younger ones where girls, though at times it was hard to understand them.<br>
<br>
As the young man finally made his way from the docks he could only wonder just what his grandfather was going to teach him this time. The old man had always been so secretive in teaching him, and certainly refused to train him if anyone else besides his cousins where around. From what he could understand he was apparently being taught the family's secret fighting style that had been passed down several generations already.<br>
<br>
The travelers mind raced as he thought of what was to come, though he was certain it was going to be surprising. Still he couldn't exactly let anyone he knew realize he was in the city, that was one of the many things that his grandfathers message has stated. As much as he loathed it he pulled his hooded cloak tighter around his body as went on his way, heeding his grandfathers wishes.<br>
<br>
<br>
The young woman giggled as she watched the passengers get off the boat, in fact she had been waiting on it to arrive. In a way she was glad as she seen no one in particular disembark onto the docks. She just simply couldn't have her brothers ruining her fun so soon. It was far to enjoyable for her to torment the locals here while it was raining. All that remained for her now was to find someone to bother for awhile until she could find a better target. <br>
<br>
She couldn't decided on which one to choose, from all the men getting off the boat none of them really looked like any fun. For a moment she glanced around the crowd from the shadows, running a hand through her deep brown hair. Truthfully most of the men in this city would have given anything to send a night with her just for her looks, which is what she often used to torment them. Though the people before here didn't look at all interesting, then her baby brown eyes locked in on one who was trying to hide his appearance. The wisps of red hair she seen intrigued her, since she had never seen red hair with such an intense pigment to it.<br>
<br>
With that it was settled, she had found the person she was going to bother for the night it seemed. She could tell by the way he moved he could probably give her hours of stalking enjoyment. There was also the fact that he was definitely heading somewhere urgent since he appeared to be avoiding almost all contact with people. That decided she simply pulled her lute from her side pack and started playing, the calm melody echoed through the night as the great game of hers began.<br>
<br>
<br>
The young man knew he was being followed, though it was true he looked human he had senses that where far more heightened than one would expect. He could hear the music from a lute being played clearly, and he could even hear the footsteps of someone. This pretty much helped him understand that the person following him was of light weight, which probably meant they could of been a thief or something worse. He had something planned for such an occasion, which he was ready to put into action.<br>
<br>
In his youth he had learned some of his fathers talents very easily, particularly ones that involved avoiding people. He knew his father had taken it far beyond what most people could since he could literally cling to walls or ceilings at will, and even move across them. This was something he had practiced with his fathers help, which made him excellent at hide and seek with the local children. So he decided it was time to play a game with this person, one which would cause them to come out into the open and into clear view.<br>
<br>
With a simple pivot of his foot he was heading down a darkened alley, and he knew that this had little hiding places for his follower. This was more of an advantage that one might think, since it was very possible to finding higher up and more out of the way places to conceal ones self. There was a smile on his face and then he was gone as he scurried up a wall and into the darkness the shadows provided.<br>
<br>
<br>
She couldn't believe this had happened to her as she looked around the alley with no trace of the young man in sight. There wasn't even a single footprint past a certain point, and now it was clear to her he was much more than he appeared. Not once had anyone managed to lose her, yet this person obviously had, and left her dumbfounded at just how it was done.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can this be possible... Not once has anyone managed to leave me like this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Needless to say she was confused as to just what happened, never before had she seen this in her life. It was like either he had disappeared or flew away. To her knowledge she knew that only certain people could cast levitate, but even then the use of mana would have been clearly visible. The same also applied to any kind of teleportation spell, and with the time and amount of concentration those take she surely would have caught up with him while he was casting it.<br>
<br>
It was at this time she also decided to rule out the simple line of invisibility spells, not only could she see through them all. She knew that the rain would also make that idea useless, since the refraction of light would make any invisible form appear easily in plain sight. Still as she looked around she couldn't make out anything out of the ordinary, that is until her eyes seen a muddy footprint on a wall.<br>
<br>
This was simply incredible to her, she had never ran into anyone who could literally walk across walls. The footprint alone was proof enough that whom ever this person was, they where definitely worth staying around for awhile. Anyone with this kind of talent could surely become a favorite for her to stalk, though she doubted it would be easy to hang onto this person when she finally met him face to face. She was going to need a plan to flush him out into the open.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was a disgusting night for the middle-aged man as he walked down the water soaked street. After having been teased earlier by a certain young woman his night hadn't been going very well at all. In fact he had wasted so much time on this woman he was late for a meeting with Dismal Rage had been embarrassing, and down right disgraceful. It couldn't be helped now though, surely his superiors in Qeynos would reprimand him for this incident.<br>
<br>
All he had known was being a Shadow Knight, which in his mind wasn't so bad since most people kept their distance. He should have known something was odd when the young woman openly started to converse with him in the bar. Nevertheless he had fallen for her beauty, then found himself rejected which now made matters worse. If he knew where she was at now he certainly would do his best to kill her, to both set his mind at ease, and to perhaps use her head to gain some favor with his superiors once he made it back home.<br>
<br>
It was then that his eyes focused in on something to the side has he continued down the street, he recognized the cloths the figure was wearing easily. This was the same woman that had caused all this mess, and he took this as a sign from the gods that perhaps he could have a small amount of pleasure tonight. Whether it was her pain inflicted by his sword or something else, he was going to make sure that her blood flowed this night.<br>
<br>
The rain proved to be a blessing in disguise as he moved through the shadows, with the steady flow of rain it became harder for anyone to hear his movements. He was dead set on spilling her blood as he crept up behind her. There was a flash of light as lightning and he could make out her breathing in that instance of illumination.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was surprising to him, for once he seen a stalking actually being stalked by another person. Either she wasn't very bright, or she was concentrating more on finding him than on her surroundings. In any case she was now in considerably deep trouble. The situation was particularly hard for him to make a decision on.<br>
<br>
He knew very well if he was to interfere that he might be found out, and knowing his grandfather, it would be disastrous. Though there was also the fact if he didn't act he would be letting a seemingly innocent person be harmed. This went not only against his parents teachings, but some of his grandfathers was well. Things never where easy for him, and it appeared as if nothing had really changed.<br>
<br>
The young man's eyes narrowed in as the armored man behind the woman had begun to unsheathe his sword. It was to much for him to think about now, he just couldn't make a decision on what to do. If he helped her he could surely be found out by someone, and if he didn't help her she was most likely going to die. All he could do was let his instincts take over and guide his actions, it was all he had to rely on now.<br>
<br>
The woman didn't even have time to see what hit her as she was shoved out of the way. Once her eyes focused in on just what was happening around her she realized just what had happened to her. She had been moved out of the way just an instance before a sword was about to cut her down. This was something she had never expected, the man from earlier that night had tracked her down. She could tell he had done all this just to seek revenge, which had been averted by the very person she was following.<br>
<br>
&quot;Takes a big man to attack someone from behind doesn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see she's found herself another man, this woman isn't worth it. She's just a tease.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just a bystander, but I won't let a woman be killed before my eyes like this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Such a foolish young man, you must obviously be one of the roaming paladins I've heard about here.&quot;, a slight smile crossed the man's face.<br>
<br>
It was a certainty that he could easily finish off this young man before him. If anything his visit here had given him more information on the capabilities of the Paladins in this city. There was also the fact this one appeared to be unarmed, which was going to make his fight that much easier. None had been able to best him in swordsman ship from his guild.<br>
<br>
A lightning bolt caused the sky to illuminate, that was all it took for the supposed fight to be over. The sword had cleaved deep into the young man's shoulder. Crimson stained the ground as he managed to pull himself from the blade. In this, the elder man took pride, particularly since the battle had seemingly ended with one quick strike. All that was now left was to finish him off and to go on about his business with the woman.<br>
<br>
In the young woman's mind she came to the conclusion all her actions had caused this. It was her flirting with this man earlier that invoked his anger, in this she was certain. Not only that, but also she had stalked this younger man and intended to do the same to him. She realized that unless something was done the young man before her was surely going to die, and then she would most likely share his same fate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your simply a child, so I'll finish you quickly. As for your little lady friend, I'll have some fun with her before she dies.&quot;, with that the man sheathed his sword and stretched out his armor clad hands before his enemy.<br>
<br>
A gruesome smile came to his lips as streams of crimson mana began to flow through his arms. This was the an attack he truly took pleasure in performing. All that was left for him was to complete it, which he done so by pushing his hands forward. The result was a small mass of crimson tinted mana that flew through the air towards the young man with the intent of ending his life in an instant.<br>
<br>
Before the young man's eyes he seen an act he had never actually witnessed in his life time as his would be stalker threw herself between the onslaught coming toward him. In a split second it was over, her body had absorbed the mana and she now lay motionless on the ground in front of him. He could clearly make out the damage she had taken as her body smoldered from the attack, it would of certainly been enough to kill him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What a shame that was, it doesn't really matter though. I can behead you just as easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you no remorse, no compassion?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Compassion and remorse are for the weak, just like yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How.... How could you...&quot;, it was unbelievable that someone could be like this to him.<br>
<br>
This was infuriating, in truth it was now pushing him beyond any limits he might have had as he struggled to stand. All he could do was cover the wound on his shoulder tightly as his teeth clenched down and ground against each other. For the moment he was wishing for anything to help him overcome this man before him, anything at all that could stop him from doing what he wanted now. Unbeknownst to him, his hopes and his wishes where going to come true.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you still think you can fight me with that injury you have. Your nothing but a boy pretending to be a man.&quot;, this was a mistake that the aged Shadow Knight would never have a chance to repeat.<br>
<br>
The young man before him was now fully enraged, and with that fury came the strength he was wishing for. The rain itself was suddenly being forced back away for his body in the shape of a sphere in which he was the very center. Soon the hardened stone walls in the alley came into contact with this unknown force and where being pushed back as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Damon, an your going to pay for what you've done tonight!&quot;, at that he leapt forward, driving a foot into the elder man's face.<br>
<br>
It was all he could do to unsheathe his sword as he avoided a fist that was coming for his face. In his mind he thought surely he couldn't have underestimated this young man called Damon before him. Though not it appeared as if he did as he lashed out with his sword, trying to strike him before another attack could be launched at him.<br>
<br>
This was all in vane though as Damon once again struck out, this time his fist came in contact with his opponents breastplate, causing it to bend and finally crack under the force exerted on it. He was like a man possessed now, all he wished for was the death of this person before him. This person who had not only hurt him, but had also hurt an innocent woman.<br>
<br>
During all of this the woman had began to come to her senses, she had heard the name of the man who had tried to protect her. As her eyes came into force she seen the two once again fighting, this time things where very different from before. It was clear Damon was now winning as he flung their attacker into a wall, which in turn caused the armor clad man to leave an imprint behind as he fell to one knee.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is far from over boy, I promise you that much.&quot;, at that the man was surrounded by mist as he vanished from sight.<br>
<br>
All this proved to do was anger Damon even more so as he struck the stone wall before him with one of his fists. He was like an savage animal out of control now, he wanted to do nothing but take his anger out on anything around him. It was then that his eyes found something to focus his anger on, the young woman who had now become conscious and was sitting up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your the cause of all this! Whom ever you are, your going to pay for this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Elizabeth, and I'm terribly sorry for all of this. Honestly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another flash of lightning brightened the area for an instant, and then Elizabeth found herself in a choke hold as her back was being pulled up against Damon's chest. She couldn't understand why this was happening to her. The only conclusion her now oxygen deprived mind could come to was that he had went completely insane. She realized that the only way she could escape from this would be to reveal something that only her family knew about.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for him to release her from his hold, especially since he now found her mouth tightly clamped down on his arm. She had bit him, and in reaction he had released her, never before had any kind of bite hurt so much. He soon realized just why though as he backed away for a moment and stared at her face. Now he understood, she had fangs and they had sank nearly to the bone when she bit him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damon stop this right now!&quot;<br>
<br>
As he turned to the familiar voice he found a hand come down across his face, which sent him to stumbling to his knee's. The person who had struck him was his grandfather, and it was clear he wasn't happy having seen all that had happened. This all had a somewhat sobering effect on Damon as his mind began to calm back down from its frenzied state.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for you woman, unless you wish the same you'll accompany us to our home. If you refuse you'll be taken by force.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elizabeth definitely wasn't going to refuse this, mostly because she was afraid of what he could do to her. If this person could clearly make Damon become so calm simply by becoming angry then it surely meant he was far more powerful than he appeared. She was curious though, as to just who these people where.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for Damon to fall into step behind his grandfather, he could tell he was angry. Further more he could tell they where heading for his cousins home. He felt awful for what had happened, it was clear to him that he had lost control, something that his grandfather had warned him about many times. All he knew for certain was he was likely to be punished once they where inside and out of sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apologize to the lady here Damon, or else you'll meet a far worse punishment than your thinking of now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry Miss...&quot;<br>
<br>
This all seemed very odd to her, mostly because he didn't try to argue, and also the fact that this aged man seemed to be taking her side. She could tell the two where related just by looks, though she could sense the old man was hiding something. Though she couldn't imagine what it could be at the moment, she was sure she'd find out soon though as they stopped in front of a house.<br>
<br>
Inside she could hear a woman scream out a few words of anger, though it was muffled enough to make what was said incomprehensible. It was then that she sensed something she had been trying to avoid all along in this city. She could tell both of her brothers where very close, though she had no idea where they could be.
