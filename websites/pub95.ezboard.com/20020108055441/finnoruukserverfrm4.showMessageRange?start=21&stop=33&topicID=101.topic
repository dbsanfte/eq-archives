<br>
----<br>
If a fixed number of days per week are set aside as FFA/FiF, I would prefer not to see the same days every week. Some people can only raid on weekends, while others can't play at all on weekends.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Tuesday-Wednesday one week, Saturday-Sunday the next.<br>
<br>
----<br>
If any compromise can be reached, I would strongly suggest making any patch day/server reset a ffa day.  Otherwise, some guilds will do it anyway, no matter what they say.  Better to avoid dissappointment on this one.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Instead of two days a week first in force, perhaps go to 3 days.  However, I do not wish to see more than 2 days a week as FiF days as I feel that is a huge compromise to a booked/scheduled plan.<br>
<br>
----<br>
I really dont have much to suggest, all i know is i liked the way things used to be. I hope that they stay the same.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Nothing. Any FFA/FIF should be on week days. Alot more people are able to come to the planned weekend raids and able to make arrangments for real life things. Everyone should know, real life always comes first and most of the good and respected players plan things this way<br>
<br>
----<br>
 One thing which I would be concerned about is how you show that your groups have the force available to hold the planes.  A single wipeout would, IMHO, not prove that you didn't have the force, as many many guilds go through a wipeout duri<br>
ng breakin.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Time zone difference makes it unfair to base any starts and endings at specific times.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Tuesday-Friday<br>
<br>
----<br>
WEEKENDS. FFA on weekends! More people want to/are able to play on weekends, so it makes sense that the weekends be opened up to more people. Let the uber guilds reserve mid-week time (since it is reserved) for their special raids.<br>

When asked if there were things we could do to help the non-US time zone players, many people basically seemed to feel that a few days FFA/FiF a week would help.<br>
<br>
A lot of people don't seem to understand what the issue is.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
As for public events...  There were only a few comments.  Most of the comments suggested we don't need public events if we allow FFA/FiF.  There were a couple of comments that suggested limiting public events to two scheduled at a time.<br>
<br>
One or two people said anyone should be able to go.  One or two said that only the unguilded or people in non-planes-going guilds should be allowed to go.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>

<br>
----<br>
 As for Uber guilds helping smaller guilds.. so long as it is helping, this is okay. Taking over is unacceptable. But if a_small_guild_01 needs help, and a_big_guild_01 is willing to help, small guild should be able to ask for that help, provided that *small guild still runs the show*. Big guild does what small guild says.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Being the leader of a guild who once needed to request help to kill minibosses and get CRs in the planes, and now is a guild who is requested to come help kill said mobs, and also to CR other guilds who have had a bad breakin, I feel that, as long as the reserved guild is there in force and is able to handle the majority of the plane themselves, calling in extra help for whatever purpose is valid as long as it's done for a specific mob or for CR. I find it perfectly fine for a guild to request help with a miniboss, or CT or Innoruuk, as long as that is<br>
what the extra help comes for, and leaves afterwards. To allow &quot;extra help&quot; to come in and stay for a longer period of time is a loophole large enough to drive a truck through, that allows people to sidestep other rules preventing a certain<br>
 number of people from coming.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Hoi has always followed the rules of summit and plans to continue to do so. if i can be of any help please let me know<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Iceni are opposed to a scheduling system. We feel that a First in Force policy should apply. However, we would also be happy with a FFA policy. We are sick of zoning into empty Planes because we have followed the summit.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 If the spawn time on epic mobs and mini-boses is exactly 72 hours(give or take an hour), then create a forum of when they are killed to help prevent poaching during non-prime time, which might force currently poaching guilds to get back in line if the spawns are only during prime time.(if they are all 72hours+0-12 hours probably a mute point since there is a 24 hour gap for spawn...but differing opinions on spawns so hard to tell exact spawn time)<br>
<br>
With 24 hours of plane time being consumed per booking, guilds should spend atleast 6 hours raiding the plane or clearing the plane which ever comes first or face the same penalties as not meeting the raid requirements.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 I like the current summit, Only thing I dont like are people who poach other people's raids. Something has to be done to punish these people who have no concern for other's plans and commitment. That is something that needs to be addressed. Thanks<br>
<br>
----<br>
 I share concern for the smaller guilds of our server.  Though I have many friends in many &quot;uber&quot; guilds, I do not feel that they should own the planes.  This is unfair to those who choose to participate in guilds for reasons other than phat l3wt. (ie roleplaying etc.)  I do hope a compromise can be reached, if the uber guilds decide to not honor the agreement, the lower guilds will never have the opportunities.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 It is my promary concern that with the ever expanding numbers of planes capable guilds on our server. That it is becoming even more difficult for the unguilded player to get into the planes. (Or anywhere else for that matter.)<br>
<br>
We are just as much a part of the server as LoD, AV, TD or any other guild. In the age where finding a guild is hard, and initiation processes are rigorous and long, The summit needs to be the watchful eye for the ones with the softest voices.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 I want to make a comment about Question 30.<br>
The uber guilds can kill CT without a booking, but they must have permission of the guild that has that plane reserved before entering the zone to do so.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Language needs to be added to allow a guild to help another guild in CR - limiting that help to CR only and the CR guild must then leave after CR is done.<br>
<br>
On question 30, they should only be allowed to kill CT if they have permission from the booking guild and only kill him when the booking guild has cleared to him (killing a few mobs near him is okay, but we want to avoid the situation where an uberguild just clears the plane for a smaller guild in order to get CT).<br>
<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Mate, I admire what you are trying to do, although unless some ideas come about that seem fair, by guild, guild numbers, and guild levels the Defiant will likely stay ffa.  We however will do our very best to honor guilds that have honor.<br>
 Contrary to the reputation a few bitter people feel towards us, that is our way.  The only rules that I have seen work, and are enforceable, are those instituted by Verant, but my ears, as our my guilds, are open.  Good Luck and see ya on<br>
the 27th.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 no<br>
<br>
----<br>
 On the issue of assistance from UberGuildA (Question 32).  I feel it's ok for UberGuildA to come help them clear the plane at ANY time, despite ANY bookings, with permission. But UberGuildA is, in effect, not really helping SmallGuildB for the sake of SmallGuildB, they're just trying to get everything dead so they can take down CT.  Therefore, I feel that ALL drops and randoms during such a situation should be randomed ONLY among SmallGuildB and their scheduled guests.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Second Heaven hopes the summit survives this time of turmoil. It only takes one a-hole to screw up the party. We were just poached last week and it was a big disappointment for us. I hope that other guilds are willing to work with the community.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Should the number of bookings allowed by a guild change?<br>
    (Choose all that apply.)<br>
 A.  Switch to one booking per guild if we institute a partial FFA system<br>
 B.  Keep at two bookings per guild but add additional bookings based on guild size<br>
<br>
 I am not certain that this will answer the questions either of how to evenly distribute the bookings.  It weighs heavily in favour of the larger guilds and lends credence to the smaller guilds complaints that the larger guilds are going to crowd them out.<br>
<br>
---- <br>
 the questions that have not been answered had no answer available that was acceptable<br>
<br>
---- <br>
 The system of scheduling raids under the Summit is unenforcable, and does nothing but cause bad feelings between the folks that attempt to follow it and those <br>
who have more greed than honor.  The FIF method is used for EVERY other 'raid' encounter in the game - ToV, Trakanon, Sky, VS, Velious encounters.  It's time to admit that the schedule system isn't working - to admit that Innoruuk has descended to the level of the other servers where there is more greed in evidence than cooperation, and discard the schedule, moving forward with a FIF agreement.  A half-arsed hybrid of scheduled and FIF events will only extend the problems and bad feelings (FFA is just too chaotic to seriously consider.)  Nevertheless, as it has always done, Amici will continue to abide by the Summit, both in letter and in spirit.<br>
<br>
----<br>
 Total number of guests on a raid should be limited to a total of 6 unless its a joint booking. That would prevent late night cr help which is one of the major causes messing up respawn and booked raids for the euro/asian guilds.<br>
