Eygpt.... He was begininning to think that his quest was foolhearty. Even if she was in this city, which he had begun to doubt, would she even want to meet him. Would she want a brother. He knew how thrown he was after he found out as well. Why, why would he want to put that on anyone else. At first he went looking for his parents, his real parents, but found only an empty house and horrible stories. Dishearted, Andy began to wander. Maybe he should just go home. NO! That was not his home, he was not their son. He was going to find his sister and make it right before he started looking for another problem to find. Well now atleast he knew that Jerron existed in this city. Cursing to himself, Andy started towards the buildings. if all else fails, go door to door. Picking up his pace, but still very much envolved in his thoughts, He ran straight into someone standing in the street. &quot;I'm sorry, I'm very very sorry, I wasn't paying attention and I don't know where I am or where I'm going I just... I'm sorry.&quot; he stammered as he helped the girl up that he had knocked down. He saw something that he had seen in Jerron's eyes, the look of loss. &quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br>

Are you blind? Watch where you're going.&quot; No, just &quot;Do I know you?&quot; Shaking his head Andy had to grin. &quot;I do not believe so, I'm Andy.&quot; Remembering his failure he decided to try with this girl, what the hell he thought. &quot;Do you know a girl named Nefertiti, I was told she might be here, but from the info I just got I might as well give up.&quot; Grinning again, Andy reached into his pocket again, he didn't like the way the hair on the back of his neck kept sticking up. Looking over his shoulder absently he understood why. The police were following him. &quot;Sir could you take your hands out of your pockets?&quot; Looking to the girl, she was no where to be seen. &quot;No, I can't. I think I'll leave em where they are, if you don't have a problem with that.&quot; Obviously they did. Being thrown on the ground, Andy didn't even remember being struck. What the hell. He thought when his knife was lifted from his coat by an invisable hand. &quot;Ok, that is it!&quot; Standing up again he took yet another knife, one he hadn't ever used, only honed. &quot;You can leave me alone, or I can leave you in pieces!&quot; He roared. Surprised again as they dropped his knife and slowly backed away. Andy smiled, even back home the officals would never give him that much respect, they always called his bluff. He put the knife back in his boot and picked the other one up from the side of the street. His smile was gone as he was thrown again up against a wall by no one, there were no police by anymore, there was no one to be seen. Feeling a persistant numbing feeling his his head, Andy just let go and gave up. What the hell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=paradisetheheretic>Paradise the Heretic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Decay</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/4/03 9:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> i smell bacon</span><hr size=1> Mika apeared from the shadows of the nearby alley.

She had also learned that intimidation was sometimes the best weapon.  she hefted her shoulders and tried as hard as she could to be 'intimidating'.  &quot;Now,&quot;  she began, staring Andy coldly in the eyes.  &quot;Who the @#%$ are you and what the @#%$ do you know about Neferiti?&quot;<br>
Mika tweaked her mind and the knife that rested in Andy's boot poped loose and slid through the air, coming to a rest in her hand.  she knew that it's safer to trust no one than to blindly trust a stranger and wind up regretting it.<br>

The bed creeked and swayed as he hummed on the worn mattress.  Black hair, swept back in a triple-laned mohawk, was streaked with a crimson red, the color of burning blood.  Then again, his blood was, in a sense, burning.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll kill all of you- I'll kill all of yooouu!!&quot; he growled.  An old-fashioned sword lay on the mattress, a black-bladed scimitar with a wooden hilt.  The cheap leather scabbard had been burned already, just like the essence of his soul.  The being that was once Derek was now totally consumed; burned away, ravaged, destroyed by the savage beast known only to those who've never loved it, never lived it, as fire.<br>
<br>
Gasoline dripped from scalded fingers.  No hair existed on his shaken hands, quaking at the mere presence of an unlit match in his extremeties.  There was never any water to put out the fires- save the saline tears that he excreted.  There were two gallon-sized buckets in the corner, nearly full of the stuff. Another 5-gallon oil jug sat next to them, the clear plastic tainted with crimson liquid.  Blowtorches and barrels, their combustible contents previously drained, rolled around outside the little room in the middle of nowhere.  Scars traced up and down his arms, all in unison, all in rows.  They reminded him of badges of rank, some kind of ritual.  Ritual... oh yeah...<br>
<br>
Derek, or who used to be Derek, powered his near lifeless hands towards the chrome bowl.  Therein sat a trio of pictures; a man in a Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts surrounded by colleagues, and the importance of the other two escaped him.  All he remembered is that he had drawn sigils and runes on the back with lines of StiXy-suLfur brand combustable gel-powder.  He traced the lines along with the quite large black sword on the side of the bed, weak arms quivering with the effort.  His arms had shrank fully two sizes, his pants literally falling off of him.  But what did food matter anymore?  They were all dead.<br>
<br>
And now Them would all pay.  Oh yes.  Them.<br>
<br>
Not recalling exactly who &quot;Them&quot; referred to, Derek's stomach lurched just before he had properly folded the color picture so that the fire would burn it up best, completely and fully, without a piece of ash remaining.  Just how he would burn Them.  Them would burn, if not by him then by someone else, but they'd BURN!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, his mind went off before he was able to finish folding.  Fires burned behind his eyes, and he saw the visions again.  The icy waters; Brooklyn.  The weights tied to Jash's legs, and the cold, icy waters.  Mika, tied to a chair, bludgeoned repeatedly.  Devin, a shower, and electrodes.  Jerron... well, a plain ass bullet- the tasers and injections had little effect.  Carmen and the skyrise.  Worst of all... Nefertiti.  He didn't even try to rationalize it; he felt the bodies, he smelled the blood.  He even tasted Nefer's lips as they plunged the dagger into her back when they embraced for the last time.<br>
<br>
He roared in blissful rage, the unleashing of emotions erasing all memories for the present.  There was no pain, no family-wide death; just the blood dripping from his mouth, and the sudden combustion of the paper in his hands.  Torrents ripped through his head, wracking his body, tumbling Derek off the bed, and forcing him to wretch the lack of contents in his stomach.  Bile welled up in his throat... and even the floorboards caught fire.<br>
<br>
He realized he was still holdind the burning picture of his enemy; it was black char.  His friends- no,  family!!  They were still on the bed!  And it was burning quickly...<br>
<br>
Summoning the last ounce of strength he posessed, Derek willed himself to the corner, to his saved saline fire solution, and doused the burning bed.  His fingers traced slowly over the captured images of his best friends, the only family he'd ever known.  More pain burned inside at the reminder of their loss, but this image pushed their deaths away for one last moment.  His hand lingered over the picture, secure in its frame, before he picked it up.  Seared flesh touched grainy wood; and six souls seemed to touch one.  Again, Derek fell to the floor, and again, and explosion rocked his previous home.  He could almost smell Nefertiti, could almost feel her presence, as he always used to.  DAMN! his mind finally cried out.  The entire room had gone up in a blaze; another gas can had spille over, and he watched the heat shimmer into plasma above the spilled puddle, working its way towards the source of gasoline.<br>
<br>
No...  This wrecked orphanage was all he had left; it would NOT go down in flames, the way his life had, the way his friends had, the way his love had!!  In a last desparate attempt, he dove for the half-full jug of blood, and succesfully diluted the stream enough to stop the rush of flame...<br>
<br>
But it was still too late.  The flames had spread from the room, and into the neighboring rooms.  Chaz's Pad, they called it, directly across from his own, was where he stored the lion's share of the combustibles, just like the drugs back in the day.  There was no more house anymore; just a flash of light, and memories.  &quot;Titi...&quot;  Sidewalk, bright sun.  Scecnt bubblegum shampoo? Flash- burning stairs, walk lightly.  &quot;I love you.&quot;  &quot;Heehee!  I love you too,  Der-Der!&quot; Doorway.  Falling rafter; DIVE!! &quot;No, Titi, that's not what I-&quot; Stone walkway; safe.  On your feet!  Now tell her.  Before you go for good!  &quot;Ahh, who cares?-&quot; YOU FOOL! &quot;-Wanna get ice cream?&quot;  No...  &quot;Yay~~!  Can we go to Mr. Smirgles?&quot;  nononono...  &quot;Sure, why not?&quot;  Did I... did I ever tell her-<br>
<br>
&quot;Nef... Neffy?&quot; He could have sworn he saw her, if a bit thin, standing in front of him- before he staggered to kiss the rock.<br>

...It was him. Was it? Was she merely seeing what her heart wanted to see? Had her hearts cravings taken over her mind and twisted reality into something other then what it truely was. Everything shut down. Details and actions slipped her mind, but she remained working on some basic level of existance. Some how she ended up at Derek's side. Didn't she? It wasn't certian. If he was hurt, she helped. If he wasn't, she was helping anyway.  <p><br>

The pain in his head was excruciating, throbbing with his pulse, only surpassed by his emotional trauma.  He had been reduced to the ability of a child, with the knowledge of one twice his age.  Months, he hadn't used his mind for anything.  He hadn't needed to, nor had he wanted to.  When it had come down to it, he had failed to get them all out, he had failed, and he was failing now.  His abilities were no longer at his beck and call, maybe somehow due to the lost link between the group, but more likely due to his lack of use.  Nefer still hadn't returned, and worry clutched his heart.  Lately, whenever she left, it was for but a minute.  Minutes had turned to hours, and she was gone.  They were all gone, always leaving him.  Thats why he dare not get too close, never too close.  He scanned the city, over and over.  He wouldn't risk transporting himself to her, it had taken years to learn such an ability and in his current stage he might appear INSIDE her.  The throbbing increased, always steady, always pulsing.  His strength and resolution where fading quickly and still, he had found no hint of her.  As tears of frustration and pain streamed down his face, he gave up.  He had failed again.  (Your always failing Jerron, thats why they leave you.  Thats why there goooone)  It had taken him twenty minutes to build the courage to try to mentally find her, and he had failed.  The pain in his head increased, even without tapping into his mentalities.  Thud, Thud, Thud.

Nefertiti's hands began to tremble as they moved over Derek, tending to his wounds. She could no longer hold anything back. A tear rolled down her paled cheek as her hands finished what they could. She sat back and stared at his still unmoving body. For a moment she felt a stir within his mind, some conflict, but it was gone before she could tell anything of it. What could she do now? Her legs shook. Run? Try as she might to move, she couldn't even begin to muster the strength needed to do it. Mika and Derek alive? This was something she had always wanted...

<br>
So much was going on, so many emotions were swimming in her mind, Carmen didn't know how to function anymore, as she padded down the hall towards the bedroom she shared with Neferiti. Feeling was no longer there. Her movements were graceful, but she felt as if she were robotic, programmed to move against her own will.<br>
<br>
Stepping into the small room, Carmen cringed seeing the heap of clothes on the floor that needed to be hauled out and washed. Did she even have anything clean to wear? Walking over to her chest of drawers, Carmen sifted through what she had to wear. After tossing a pair off black panties and a black bra onto her bed, Carmen continued her search for an outfit. A pair of faded, navy, cargo pants caught her eye and she tossed those onto her bed along with her underwear. What about a shirt? Closing the current drawer she was rummaging through, she moved onto teh next one. Right on top lay a white spaghetti strap tank top and with out even second guessing whether to wear it or not, Carmen tossed it onto her pile. <br>
<br>
Closing the drawer shut with her foot, Carmen stood and let her bath-towel drop to the floor. The door was massively ajar, but she didn't care. Her body wasn't anything to flaunt in her opinion and her friends, well, they were all in their own worlds now-a-days to even care if Carmen walked around the city naked.<br>
<br>
After managing to put on her bra and panties, Carmen decided a black bra just didn't go well with a white shirt. She swapped the bra with a white one, then peeled on her tank top and pants. The shirt hugged her lithe form perfectly and her pants feel perfectly over hips, hanging loose in all the right places. Looking at the full length mirror behind the door, Carmen nodded. Perfect in every way for a Tryck'r like herself. Though her hair need to be combed. It was beginning to dry from her shower, and it wasn't drying nice and sleek, more like ratted and clumpy.<br>
<br>
Long strides carried Carmen to the bathroom, where she parked infront of the sink and raked a comb through her long blonde hair. The long blonde hair that Jash loved when he was around, tears began to gather in teh corner of her eyes. When she had seen Mika, hope had sparked of seeing Jash again, but with every minute that ticks by when Neferiti wasn't there, that Mika was out, that Jerron was drinking, that Devin was injured, Carmen lost hope. He was gone.<br>
<br>
Swallowing hard, Carmen held back salty tears of pain, that she did not want to bare. She had to be the strong one, but with Mika's return maybe the others would strengthen. <br>
<br>
Exiting the bathroom, Carmen clicked out the light. Where are the others, she thought as she padded down the hall towards the living room. &quot;Jerron,&quot; she called out softly. Lilac pools searched the room, as soft lips formed vowels again, &quot;Devin. Guys? Mika, Nefer? Anyone?&quot; Panic began to well up in her chest, where was everyone? Had they all left while she was changing? No, Jerron would never leave with out telling her. Maybe he was in his room? <br>
<br>
Carmen made her way to Jerron's room, rapping lightly on the large wooden door she called, &quot;Jerron, are you in there?&quot; Seconds went by like hours, was he going to call back? Even let her in? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

He had no desire to talk at the moment, he didn't want to see anyone.  Nothing to remind him of his failure.  Yet, he felt himself rise and slowly hobble to the door.  His muscles ached, and his headache had only strengthened in time.  The doorknob was warm to the touch, most likely because  he was cold.  It turned without a squeek, and the friendly face of Carmen popped into view.  She would help him as she always did.  Strong as steel.

If you wanna run with it Rill it could be fun. But we'll see what goes on. I was gonna have her flat out kiss him. BUT decided not to be like that, cause that's not how Carmen really is anyways. She's daring, but not when it comes to boys.<br>
<br>
Carmen stood there before Jerron's bedroom door, the apartment was silent. Though, one would think Carmen was used to it, she wasn't. She herself was normally running around doing chores, trying to keep something in their lives together. It was never this quiet.<br>
<br>
As she stood there, Carmen wondered where they all were, was Jerron really behind that large wooden rectangle before her? <br>
<br>
Perfectly on cue, the young blonde's ears perked to the sound of mattress springs squeeking. He was in there! A wide smile spread over her soft, pink lips.<br>
<br>
The door slowly opened, and Jerron appeared. He looked more run-down then ever as if something was plaguing his thoughts, but why? They just regained one of their old friends, he should have been happy, over-joyed... but he looked worse. Worry laced, the deep violet orbs that made her eyes, but she didn't let her smile fade. Especially, once the slightest hint of one reached the corners of his own mouth. He smiled! It was the first time in ages she had seen this from him! Actually, even before their friends' disappearances he rarely smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jerron greeted her, and her smile only grew wider, as she watched his amazing eyes shift from an ice blue, to a strong green color. He had explained the weird eye color when they had first met, he had called it a 'defect', but Carmen saw it as pure beauty. <br>
<br>
Carmen shook her head to rid her thoughts, they were veering off majorly, as her eyes roamed over Jerron's body. 'Stop that,' she scolded herself. Looking back to Jerron, her soft mouth opened, and words became audible, &quot;I was just wondering where you were. I went to change, instead of scaring the house off with me in a towel, then came out and no one was around. Kind of scared me.&quot; Carmen flipped her pin straight fairy-tale blonde hair over her shoulder, then her smile faded slightly, &quot;You look like you've been thinking way to hard. Want to sit and talk about it? Or would you like to take a rain check? Though... You take rain checks rather often and it slightly worries me. I know, you're not one to express your feelings, but-&quot; She just stopped. She didn't want to go on. Because right then. Deep down she had been hiding the feeling she had been developing for months. Yes, she missed Jash, but she had to face it, he wasn't coming back, and her feeling were floating somewhere else, and she didn't want to admit it not yet. &quot;But,&quot; Carmen continued on, &quot;I think you may want to sometime, and you know I'm here.&quot; Locking eyes with Jerron, Carmen's violet occuli expressed a sense of trust, of respect, and she hoped maybe one day, maybe not today. That Jerron would confide in her. A) She cared strongly about her friend and B) She was beginning to care ona much stronger level. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Mika had been amusing herself with a cockroach she found scurrying down the gutter.  she played a little game with it, flipping it over with her mind and watching it struggle to right itself.  then she would repeat the process, and ever so often, a faint giggle would escape her lips.  the game ended rather abruptly when, while she was trying to flip it over she pushed a little too hard and the poor insect exploded, sending green insect juice flying everywhere.  fortunatly she was far enough away that none of it hit her.  she sighed and tried to find something else to amuse her.  Usually when she was alone, she would meditate (years of which had given her the formidable mental powers that she now posessed) but she decided that what she really wanted right now was a cigarette.  now a days cigarettes came in all forms, the most common of which was a gelcap pill that you chewed on until it burst and filled you with the nicatene goodness.  this method eliminated second hand smoke which the gov't had outlawed years ago.  but Mika had a little nostalgia for the old days (even though she wasn't around that long ago) and preferred to smoke her cigarettes.  so, she flipped a smoke into her mouth and sparked it with her mind.  inhaling deeply, she closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation, the repetative motions, the very act of smoking.<br>
<br>
When she had killed her smoke, she put it in the air in front of her and mentally threw it across the street and put it out against a small stone sign declaring the building behind it to be some kind of orphanage.  the building looked derelect and abandoned.  Mika knew that Neferetti was inside, she had known it for quite a while now.  Mika didn't know however wether or not she wanted to see her.  Over the last few months mika had become emotionally dead.  she wasn't sure what seeing Neffi again would do to her.  <br>
<br>
Mika got up and left.  she lived life (or tried to) without regrets.  so she tried to forget that she knew where neffi was.  she made her way back to the apt. she had found Carmen, Devin, and Jarron in.  As she climbed the stairs to the apt.  she yawned loudly, today had been a relatively eventful day and she was tired.  she was used to and comfortable with falling asleep anywhere, but tonight she hoped there was a bed for her.. . it had been so long since she had slept in a bed . . .<br>
<br>
she knocked on the door and waited for someone to answer . . .<br>
