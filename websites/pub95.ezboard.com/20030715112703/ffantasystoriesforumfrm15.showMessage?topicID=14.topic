<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
&quot;The Punishment.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This was the worst possible punishment Zenki could of imagined. All because Leona and himself had practically levels two buildings in Qeynos his father was going to make him work off the repairs for them. He would of rather been smithing free weapons or armor for the repayment, instead he was stuck delivering mail and spell scrolls.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid witch... This is all your fault!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My fault?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona hated this, her father was making her help Zenki even though she thought it wasn't her fault. After all he had dealt the last blow, and it was his last attack that caused the most destruction. Still she wondered just how Zenki could of caused it all. Then again the other puzzling thing was how did she survive the attack. She hated to admit it, but her father was right in the fact that Zenki had more power that she thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid wi......&quot;<br>
<br>
Before he could react Leona had done smacked Zenki over the head with a scroll. All he did was call her that ever since they had left Qeynos, and they where already nearing the bridge outpost in the Karanas. To her the idea of simply traveling wasn't so bad, but to constantly be called names was just too much.<br>
<br>
&quot;This stinks! Why do things like this always happen to me! I'm a refined lady...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Refined? Yes. But a lady? More like a girl from what I seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
All he could do was snicker, because he knew the insult hit home. Sure he hadn't seen enough of her from their previous encounters, but Zenki knew this was giving him somewhat of an edge in the arguments. Least that's what he thought until Leona smacked him once again with a spell scroll.<br>
<br>
Little did the two know they where being followed, for some reason some rather dark forces had set their sights on them. All the two figures could do was smile, they had their prey in sights and even though they still couldn't determine who their main objective was, it was evident they where going to have some fun with these two. From what they had seen the woman seemed more prone to violence, and thus they thought in their minds she seemed more likely to hold the power they searched for.<br>
<br>
&quot;So... We destroy the one who manipulates the energies and we're done?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, we can't allow -their- power to continue to grow...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet these two where themselves where being watched by a man cloaked in the shadows, wisps of red hair came down concealing all but his black glimmering eyes. He knew the two who where following his nephew where demons. He began to wonder if his decision to intervene in the events in Qeynos was worth drawing this much attention. However, he knew if things came to the worst he could dispose of the two demons, they had no real idea of the true powers that Zenki or anyone with their bloodline could contain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hopefully I can take a bath when we reach Freeport, if it wasn't for you I could of just teleported there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss high and mighty still hasn't learned to teleport others yet, and here I thought you had more skill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenki laughed, that would certainly put a dent in her ego, at least until she decided to smack him again with the scroll. This was getting to be a habit of hers, he didn't know who was worse about hitting him with things now, his mother or Leona. At that moment he was still wondering about that. After all it was pretty normal for his father and him to get hit, of course neither had the nerve to tell her that it wasn't hurting them much anymore.<br>
<br>
It was then that the two demons made their move, they appeared from the shadows and instantly struck Zenki, sending him sliding across the ground on his face. Leona in the meantime was cornered, she didn't know what to do since everything happened so fast, all he heard was Zenki. In truth she couldn't imagine how he could still be conscious from a hit like that.<br>
<br>
&quot;That hurts almost as bad as when my mom broke her frying pan over my head...&quot;<br>
<br>
He was slow to get to his feet, he was lying about it. It felt like the whole side of his body that was hit was broken. This of course surprised the two demons, they had thought for sure the attack would of killed him, for the most part it did kill humans in one strike.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you hold back? You know what we're suppose to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's tougher than he looks, but he'll die, don't worry.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that one of the two stepped forward, then a mass of black mana erupted from its hands and collided with Zenki head on. Nothing could describe the amount of pain Zenki was put in as a fell forward. To the demons he no longer seemed alive, and in truth his mind was still conscious. What had really happened was his mind had finally shut down from the shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what shall we do with her? Perhaps we should take her back with us and let our brethren have their way with her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No harm could come of that, we can dispose of her easily there...&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona's mind was racing, she knew she couldn't take on beings like this, and with Zenki now dead she didn't have much hope of escaping. These creatures where savage and brutal, with no compassion at all. She could tell they where pure evil, no trace of goodness or light dwelled within there being. <br>
<br>
All the cloaked figure could do was smile, the demons had made their first mistake. They failed to release that Zenki was still alive. That was their first mistake he saw, the second was they hadn't been told of the young mans training or past experience. His smile grew wider as he saw Zenki's fingers twitch, his body was recovering from the attacks.<br>
<br>
All Zenki could do was focus on what his father had taught him, for the most part all the training he had received had been that of a monks. He had seen his fathers wounds heal nearly instant through sheer will power. His body had remembered the training, and his subconscious was putting it to good use as again his fingers twitched.<br>
<br>
Leona couldn't believe what she saw, she had actually seen Zenki's fingers move. She didn't think it was possible, but somehow he had survived the last attack. More importantly this meant she might actually live to see her parents again, and perhaps after this little incident they'd reconsider the situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zenki get up already and save me!&quot;<br>
<br>
The two demons found this outburst amusing, to them it was just a feeble attempt to distract for her to try and escape. He was dead, no human could survive a direct unguarded attack from their powers. It was clearly impossible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up already and save me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up! He's dead and you soon will be too!&quot;<br>
<br>
For her outcries she was struck across the face, the demon's claws left light cuts across her cheek. They loved causing pain, and even more so they loved the taste and smell of fresh blood as one the demons tongues snaked out of its gruesome mouth and across the marks on Leona's face. This in turn sent a chill up her spine, but also Zenki could see what was happening out of the corner of his eye.<br>
<br>
All Zenki could feel was some sort of burning, all encompassing urge overwhelm his mind. It seethed and burned. Whatever this feeling was it was causing his body to feel as if it was on fire, it was burning away the fresh wounds. It was then that Zenki decided that he would stop them from doing anymore harm to Leona as he forced his broken body to stand up once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave her alone...&quot;<br>
<br>
The two where surprised, as they turned to see Zenki standing again. They couldn't believe he was alive, and even if he was he surely couldn't do anything to them. After all to date no human had ever harmed them. They simply found this to be amusing, letting out what could best be described as laughter, as they once again struck Leona.<br>
<br>
&quot;You shouldn't have done that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's nothing you can do to stop us human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, you can barely stand as it is...&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenki rushed forward with such speed that the demons as well as Leona lost track of him. This startling new ability frightened Leona, to her this speed was unnatural and inhuman. The next thing she knew one of the demons that had been holding her captive was being lifting into the air and then drove down with enough force to bury its form beneath the earth. It was apparent that Zenki had finally had enough, his anger was controlling his actions now.<br>
<br>
Zenki's form then seemed to disappear from sight again, only to be found behind the next demon. With a quick flying kick the demon found itself sailing through the air and towards the water. Taking this as a chance to gain some advantage it simply levitated out over the water. It was then that Zenki unleashed his rage once again on its comrade, driving his hands down into the earth and ripping its body upwards with a jerk.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is impossible! Your not.....&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the gruesome creature could utter another word it found its head in Zenki's grip, and then with a quick squeeze its life was over. Blood and bone spattered to the ground as the demons head seemed to explode in Zenki's hands. This was not the same Zenki that Leona had seen before, he was like a monster, maddened by the power he now possessed.<br>
<br>
For the first time the creature knew fear, it truly was scared for its foul life. Whatever this person was it certainly couldn't be a human in his eyes, it was so savage and brutal. In fact to the demon Zenki's personality was more like its own, yet it was different. The demon could sense that he wasn't fighting for the pure pleasure of it, some other driving force was causing this.<br>
<br>
All Leona could do was stare in awe as Zenki ran across the surface of the water, it was clear his sights where sent on their last assailant. It was then the demon made a feeble attempt to escape by leaping into the air. Zenki was in hot pursuit and did the same, a short geyser of water forming from where he had jumped. Leona could tell this was not going to be good even if Zenki did win. All his attacks where landing precisely, this in turn causing the creature to resort to other tactics.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you think you've gotten me beaten... Then have a taste of our true power!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a couple quick gestures from the creatures hands a black void appeared around Zenki and engulfed him. Leona had heard of a type of magic that even the highest of wizards couldn't use, it was an innate property found only in creatures known as Demons. At least now she knew what she was facing. However, the demon did not, as it thought this would surely finish off Zenki.<br>
<br>
The cloaked figure smiled at seeing the demon's latest attempt. He knew it would take more than a simple Shadow magic attack to defeat him. Even more so the disturbing was the fact that Zenki was smiling while inside the black mass. He was preparing something for the creature, something that felt very familiar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fukei!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The black mass scattered as several crimson orbs shot out from Zenki's hands and collided with the creature. It was then that Leona dove for cover, she had seen this before and knew it wasn't going to be pleasant. Of course this all had surprised the demon, it was never expecting something like this.<br>
<br>
Finally as the last orb was released from Zenki hands a light erupted from where the demon once was. It engulfed the surrounding area and could be seen for miles. This is turn had a startling effect on the guards who where at the bridge encampment in the Karana's.<br>
<br>
As the light faded away Leona seen Zenki fall to the waters below. All his power had been expended on the final assault, which comforted her. Things where going to get much more interesting for her now...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15>Stories by:  Shoken</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
