<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->Seuinye tossed and turned lightly in her bed. Dreams plagued her sleep, and she had long since tossed the covers from her bed. She wore a nightslip, which was plastered to her body with sweat. Suddenly, she sat up, finding herself looking at a very beautiful human woman who stood at the end of her bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are dos?&quot; she demanded, before recognizing the woman from Azhaagh's story. She mouthed the name Saryrn only briefly as the woman smiled coldly.<br>
<br>
Her goddess lifted a hand, and Seuinye found herself rising into the air, her arms held perpendicular to her body. &quot;Why do you pray to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because dos are my goddess. I devote my life to dos,&quot; Seuinye replied, unsure of the question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. You profess your following of me, yet devout yourself as a priestess - healing those in pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seuinye felt, and looked confused. &quot;But a priestess was my calling in life.&quot; Sudden pain blossemed in her hands and feet as every bone in them was split and shattered. She screamed, then was suddenly stopped, unable to scream though the pain wracked her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;While your screams are pleasent to me, to my ears... I do not have time or the desire to wait for you to finish. Your original calling was as a priestess of Innoruuk. Correct?&quot; she queried, knowing the answer already. Seuinye could do nothing but nod, a whimper escaping her lips.<br>
<br>
Saryrn nodded. &quot;Then why do you continue to pray for healing for those who are enjoying my gifts?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To prolong your gift, mi'lady.&quot; She screamed again, this time her arms and legs shattering, and again the scream was cut short.<br>
<br>
&quot;And why do you think I would want them to live? You do what you think is my will. Now, you will do my will. Your prayers for healing will no longer be answered. I have a priestess, much more skilled than you. I have a prophet. I need a hand in this world.&quot; Saryrn began to pace the room a bit, while Seuinye hung there, her arms and legs mangled beyond recognition.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a taste for pain. I can appreciate this in you. And I will use it. You will be my hand, young one. You will bring pain to the creatures of Norrath, to the primitave tribes and peoples. And when you are ready... you will bring pain to the heros of these lands. You will give them the pain of living as their loved ones die. Do you understand?&quot; She stopped, and looked up at Seuinye, her eyes expressionless.<br>
<br>
&quot;X.. Xas... I... understand,&quot; Seuinye managed through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
Saryrn smiled for the first time. &quot;Good.&quot; She vanished, and Seuinye fell to the bed, her shattered limbs not able to support her any longer. The door became unbarred, and Seuinye's screams rang true and long.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/SeuSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seuinye>Seuinye</A> at: 8/18/03 3:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seuinye>Seuinye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/20/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/Seudoll.jpg width=79 height=168></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes</span><hr size=1> Seuinye sat at a desk in the main room of the Harvesters' hall, her hands moving across the fine parchment pages of a dark tome as she read.  Her hands were now normal sized, and most of the ache had gone away from the bruising and tearing her encounter with her goddess had caused.  Saryrn had answered Ankhami's prayers for healing, as had the goddess Luclin with Kerridwynn's.<br>
<br>
She knew that she had a new purpose in life... to bring Saryrn's gift to the world in a very real, persistent way.  But she found herself asking one question over and over.  How?<br>
<br>
She had begun to peruse the Scythe's library, in hope of finding an answer.  And an answer she had found.  This tome had been left out, one of the few books which was not neatly shelved, and the embossed skull on it's cover caught her eye.  With shaking hands, she had opened it, and began to read on the craft of Necromancy.<br>
<br>
Now, two days later, she was practicing the magicks, learning how to make her very touch poison, how to animate the bones of the dead, how to make her breath a choking poison.<br>
<br>
And her favorite incantation yet... the conversion of her very life force into power for her to wield.<br>
<br>
With a solid thump, she closed the book, and walked outside, and through the hidden passages into the Echo Caverns.  She knew the bones of many dead littered the halls, buried almost casually.  Kneeling on the ground, she took her dagger and buried it deep in the sandy soil which lined the floor.  With concentration, mana began to form on her hand, and drained down the dagger in blue drops akin to blood.  The mana seeped into the ground, seeking and finding a host.<br>
<br>
The soil shifted at her feet, and she stood quickly, dancing away as a skeleton clawed it's way free of it's former resting place.  It's eyes were a haunted blue, the power she had fed it residing there.  With a careless hand, she dusts some of the sand from the skeleton's collarbone, and touched it's facial bones lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect.  Let us begin,&quot; she stated as she led it into the depths of the caverns. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seuinye>Seuinye</A> at: 8/20/03 11:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerridwynn>Kerridwynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ilharess of the Scythe</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/21/03 1:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/Kerridwynn2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn watched the young bonemistress leave the Hall, a smile playing across her lips as she stood at the window in her office.
