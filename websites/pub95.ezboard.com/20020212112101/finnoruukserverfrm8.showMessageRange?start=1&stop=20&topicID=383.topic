And as someone who was on the server from the &quot;BEBP and SSoY&quot; are UBER days and the Planes were something in the sky, to SoL, I disagree that we have a great server.  There's been several posts from people about how things like FBSS's and such were twice on our server what they were on most.  But we are Innoruuk, so that's to be expected.<br><br>I think we've all done some stuff like this.  For instance in Guk.  How many times have you been camping Sage, Ex, and Cav?  When camp check is called, one person in the party calls one camp, another one another, etc.  When I would go in there to hunt I wouldn't even bother.  Just invis up and look around.  If you weren't sitting in there, I'd take it.  And with a Nec/Mage combo vs undead MOB's, I never had someone try to KS me.  They'd usually watch the pets demolish stuff with a spell or 2 from one of us, and just walk away heh.  But I could see say a Warrior/Cleric having a problem with people not even letting them have one of three camp spots.<br><br>The one that always pissed me off the most was farmers, and usually Druids.  I ran into them often because with a Nec for Fear kiting, outdoor zones are the way to go.  I remember hunting Ulthorks when some of them were starting to turn light blue.  Some Druid comes in (/a of course) who cons red to me, roots 5 of them, and DoT's them (tx Verant for the mana-free DoT's BTW /rude).  I told him I didn't mind sharing because I wasn't killing everything, but that it would be nice if he'd kill one or 2 at a time.  Thankfully he was cool about it, though if it had come down to it I might have been able to outgun him anyways.<br><br>I would normally just ignore those people, but for people being that rude, I would have stayed for a bit if I had the time.  Someone telling you they were camping a particular spawn and were kiting/fear kiting when I came up, fine, all yours.  But you try to tell me you &quot;own&quot; an area and let the games begin.  <br><br>I've had people try that in TD with me with the Spirocs as well.  But with two casters with pets, I just told them they were free to kill what they could pull first.  And if they had a problem with that then I could start kiting everything in the area with my pets as well.  But I never understood running around for 20 minutes to kill 4 MOB's versus killing MOB's in 1-2 minutes by doing 1 at a time anyways.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoderrybadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oderry Badgerclaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/28/02 3:08:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clanbadgerclaw.homestead.com/files/face.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I oan all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> If someone gave me grief over something like that I would clear all spawns until the person got tired of Zero Exp and left, then I would go about my marry way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utzinthedruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzin the Druid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/28/02 3:59:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Agree</span><hr size=1> Same thing in Cobalt Scar on the weekend.

They tend not to get involved unless they get a lot of tells over a contested spawn (IE the old days of the Frenzy in Guk).  However, just load a fast nuke (My Mage used to use Burn, only 14 or so damage but less then a 2 second cast) to pull with.  Then if they attack the MOB, you can petition them for KS'ing.  And THAT usually will get a GM/Guides attention.<br><br>Raptors in TD or Aviaks in SK or HG's in RM etc, are all the same.  No defined camp = FFA.  I remember when the Aviak city in SK was a hotly defined area heh, but people's claims to the whole area were laughed at.

I can't say I ever saw this from you specifically, but I saw this many times.<br><br>Druid/Bard kiting multiple HG's.  Charm breaks/too many adds?  Druid/Bard hightails it to zone.  That one pull that another party had becomes 4-5 HG's and they die.  If you're kiting 4 around, what do you do if one stops to attack someone else because you got too close to the PC and too far in front of the MOB?  Generally what I saw was then it became THEIR problem, not yours.  I had adds that I ended up training all the way to the Feerott so I didn't train the people hunting cyclops, but I rarely saw that kind of courtesy there.<br><br>Second, know why you could kill the whole spawn?  Kiting is almost always the slowest way to kill.  How hard is it to kite around all the MOB's as a Bard for 10 or 15 minutes?  However, HG spawn rate is faster then that, so I don't know if it's fair to say you were killing the whole spawn when you are artificially lowering the spawn rate.<br><br>I also saw the following situation.  Bard/Druid kiting multiple HG's right through the area they spawn in.  When another one spawns, it agroes on you.  So effectively they are camping the entire area.  I did most of my HG's with my Necro/Mage.  When I saw stuff like that I generally asked nicely if I could have some of the spawn.  There were only a couple times when someone wanted to in effect claim they were camping them all.  NP.  I just moved where I was sitting a little further out, and when they kited near me some of them agroed on me, so I killed them and told the kiter I was going to petition him for training me if it happened again, and oh BTW, if that Druid/Bard wanted to have a KS contest while we waited for the GM I was ready.  One of those two methods worked every time heh.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugregar1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gregar1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/29/02 10:52:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> You'll have to take my word on it, Ugle, we don't hold the patent on jerks in Norrath.

Otherwise the roaming spiroc will come a calling to you. <br><br><br>Obeorn Winterstrife <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarolpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arolpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/29/02 2:42:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> Ugle,<br><br>You may want to actually play a bard, or go to www.eqdiva.com and read up on something called swarm-kiting.  A well-played bard can solo as fast or faster than any other class.  Basically, you charm one of a group of social mobs, tell it at attack another one, then run out of range.  They entire group will attack your pet, watch your pet's health, and when he's almost dead, break charm or don't recharm, drop a couple DoTs on him, and charm the next one.  I discovered the beauty of this while trying to learn to break spectre island in Oasis.  A well-executed swarm kite is a beautiful thing to behold.<br>If you're really interested, set up a time, meet me in Cobalt Scar, and I'll show you by taking on the entire SS zone-tower camp.  Even with just simple charm-kiting I was able to kill ever single HG in Rathe Mtns by level 37.  I wish I knew the name of the bard who I first saw doing it, when I could barely handle the named Cyclops.<br><br>Arolpin<br>owes his Tambourine to Tulluin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utulluinbardy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TulluinBardy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/29/02 4:03:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.800india.com/computers/tulluin/dolphinboy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> Hehe, I remember that, Arolpin.<br>Remember duo-kiting that skorpikis scrounger?<br><br>Anyway, it takes 1-2 mins to kill an HG while charm kiting.

I can say that I probably died at least 20 times there from either Druids or Bards who did lose control though, who had talked about how much they kicked rear.  Nothing against Bards in particular, I love that class.  But any time you have people playing a character who has the ability to kite multiple MOB's, you also have a higher chance of the results being worse for everyone around if they screw up (or hightail it to zone and leave the mess behind)   : )<br><br>Arolpin, I'd be more impressed to see you do it on the Myconid Spore King.  A better place might be say the Kobold Village in Velks?  Lots of MOB's there, should be a great place to show your stuff.  And I see people posting about how at L55 a Druid/Necro/Bard is still killing red cons, there will always be people who find ways to do things you wouldn't think they could do.  In my experience, when I saw someone kiting around HG's and just picking up adds as they popped, I'd generally get at least two kills from my pulls for every one I saw drop out of their train.  1-2 minutes Tully?  If you're running 5 of them around does that kill all 5 in 1-2 minutes, 2 minutes per, or? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utulluinbardy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TulluinBardy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/29/02 10:28:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.800india.com/computers/tulluin/dolphinboy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> 1-2 minutes per giant...depends on how efficient you have it. <br>Charm kiting used to be a lot easier before they changed the charmed pet to forget his target. <br>Not really worth it anymore, imo. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39706><img src=http://www.800india.com/computers/tulluin/tulluinsig33333.jpg border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarolpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arolpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 12:20:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> Ugle,<br><br>I'd be damn impressed if any bard were able to swam-kite anything in either Sebilis or Velk's Lab.  Bards generally solo outdoors, or stuff that is very, very low blue to them.  Probably the only truly class-defining song we get is Selos, and it's outdoors only.  Soloing a bard is at least as zone and mob dependant as soloing any other class.  If you want I can try to solo a spider in Velk's Lab, but it will be slow since I'll have to mezz him and heal myself up several times before I kill him.  I know that I can solo the two ent frogs in Seb, but unless I'm the only one there, I find that charm fighting them seems to upset folks for some reason.  If I'm trying to tank them, I can barely keep ahead of the respawn.  For some reason those evil bard-haters at Verant don't give me the AC of a warrior and the damage output of a monk.  <br>I hear of bards soloing reds at 55, and but I've certainly never seen it.  I tried Doom at 55, and got my butt handed to me on a platter.  I've heard it's possible, and I think I know how, but it's going to be a long, slow process.  If I'm soloing I'm generally trying to regain some exp while waiting for a raid to begin.  I know where my place is at the end-game:  singing resists and pumping mana for my betters.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Arolpin<br>Arolpin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 8:36:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I own all 20 mobs here</span><hr size=1> Heh that's funny, because I know my Necro at L52 could own Doom heh, he has pretty low resists and not very many HP for a L55.

Soloing a spider wouldn't impress me much, since a Warrior can solo the Spiders in there as well.  <br><br>Besides A, in a party what do you provide?  Let's see, slows for the MOB's, haste which stacks with spell haste for the tanks, regen which helps everyone, mana songs for the casters, Charm/Mez for CC, DoT songs, group invis for downtime, etc.  Bards in most parties would be valuable even if they just sat on their rear and played Jimi Hendrix and couldn't melee at all.
