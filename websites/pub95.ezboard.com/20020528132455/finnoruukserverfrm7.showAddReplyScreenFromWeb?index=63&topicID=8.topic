digs</span><hr size=1> Kinanar gasped as he was pulled from his chair. His trance broken he took his hand off his sword hilt as he was dragged through the house by his hostess. A mug of what seemed to be more stout was crammed into his hand as he was led to a man that needed a healing supposedly. He was shown to the wounded man and then the hostess darted off. The paladin scratched his head in confusion. His mind still burned with the prescence of the necromancer, he should not be allowed to come into such a happy place as this. He stared at the ornate hilt of his sword as he thought of a plan. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukinanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinanar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif " BORDER=0> at: 10/31/01 1:29:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uporizj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Porizj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(10/31/01 1:35:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New digs</span><hr size=1> Slightly taken aback by the warm greeting his hostess had given him, Porizj smiled despite himself. Laying a few pieces of platinum coin on the counter, he spoke. &quot;I will be more than happy to pay for the meal you've given me, but I cannot accept it. I never eat that which my hands haven't prepared, nor drink that which has not been brewed as such. I assure you it is no insult to your clearly superb skills in the kitchen or with a keg, but as you must understand I'm not one of the most loved mortals on this plane. Countless times now I've found poison slipped into perfectly good food or drink by those who would see me dead.&quot; He looked around the room before continuing. &quot;It's obvious there are more than a few here who wouldn't think twice about ridding themselves of my presence.&quot; Raising his voice now, so even those not in the room could head, he said what he hoped was the last thing he'd have to say to this group for the night. &quot;Know this, I carry no qualm with anyone here as of yet. I came to warm my bones and fill my stomach, nothing more. It would make me very unhappy if there was to be any sort of......discomfort aimed in my direction tonight. I am a light sleeper and my minion never sleeps, so don't think a cloak and dagger will do you much good either.&quot; <br>
<br>
Porizj turned back to his hostess. &quot;Now then, would you by chance have any cooking facilities I could use? I would also pay kindly if you had any unbutchered animals. I've known people to go as far as to have precut meat with poison in it on the chance one such as myself comes around. If you could direct me to your main well It would be appreciated. And I hope you don't mind that I always keep my pet with me, I find it deters would-be heroes from making sad mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walking towards the well, Porizj pondered the matters at hand. That dwarf was going to be trouble, this much was obvious. Though he hated wasting good money on fools, he pulled a small peridot from one of his pouches and began to weave a spell. As the peridot began to glow so did his skin. He could feel the protective shield forming around his very being, and at last solidifying as the peridot disappeared into the realm of death. &quot;A small price to pay, I suppose, to keep the meat on my bones one more night.&quot; Though this spell could not keep him entirely from harm, it could keep at least keep a dwarf from stabbing him in the back while he wasn't looking. His minion giggled gleefully, as it could read the minds of mortals, and was looking forward to the promise of blood should that paladin lose his manners.<br>
<br>
After a short walk Porizj found the well, got his pet to fill two large buckets with the clear water, and after checking to make sure it wasn't poisoned, went back into the building.<br>

/ooc The spell I cast absorbs roughly 500 points of damage, in case you guys don't know about necro spells, heh.<br>
