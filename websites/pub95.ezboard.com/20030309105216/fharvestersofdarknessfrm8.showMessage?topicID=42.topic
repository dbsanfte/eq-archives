Thenic alone</span><hr size=1> Thenic murmered while death was near.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hate will live on</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
The ending of the common prayer. He saw the hate in Kerridywnn's eyes. The sorrow in Sarhea's face, the sadistic glee in Morgrist's smile. He had done right. A wedding in the church of Hate should be christened by hate. It was his gift to his friend Drakgeny. The best he could give. <br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Thenic smiled. Kerridwynn chanted the final lines of beseeching to call down their gods Wrath upon him. He knew this was the end of his current role in the Harvesters. He knew his god would be disappointed, but he knew he was doing his job. And thats all he could do.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>live in Hate.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
With pain in her eyes, Kerridywnn murmered something, and Thenic heard the last words as a Harvester<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>goodbye</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Thenic awoke in the priests quarters in the temple. Had she felt remorse? Regret? He would have to ponder this. And now he had all the time he needed to ponder. He returned to his things, scorched, and right where he had sat to die. Kerridwynn walked past him calmly. Everyone else had gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Now you have seen me angry.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
And strode away. He gathered his things, and prepared for a new day with the common prayer.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There is hate, and there is rage.....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
When he finished, he rose and smiled. Today was a new day, and he knew that he would meet it, and imbue in it hate, as he did all things. <br>
<br>
But even with this small solice, all knew that Thenic was again alone.<br>
<br>
((ooc: that was the best wedding i ever went to. started out a little slow, but it picked up nicely<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    .

<br>
*Thenic said a quick goodbye to some people in the foyer of the Harvesters guild house. He had a bit of thinking to do, and a whole month to do it in. But even with that, he felt he had to hurry. he said some final words to kerridwynn before he left*<br>
<br>
&quot;Good luck with everything. And remember what I said. There is hate and there is rage. We work for hate alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Kerridwynn scowled at Thenic. He had tried this many times before. Who was he to think he knew more than she. He was a mere neophyte, and at times bordered on a traitorous wretch.*<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what we must do Thenic. You need to know your place.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Thenic grinned. He so loved pushing peoples buttons. But something in the back of his mind told him to hurry. He smiled politely, and made his way from the hall, and went to the tower of the priests. he left a few things there, picked up his usual gear, and a backpack, and then made his way into the dark and foul forests of Nektulos. Find a place deep in, far from the roaming undead, and away from teh various areas that had been claimed, he laughed outright, claimed from the darkelves by the lightbringers. Even in this last rotten shithole, the lightbringers strove to crush out the last of the darkelves. Massecring Teir'dal children, and saying it was for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. He collapsed to a tree, and pulled out a small flask and a book. He had a lot of drinking to do, and a whole month to do it in.*<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
*He awoke to the pain of his back. It felt as though some great beast was gnawing a hole in his shoulder. He tried reaching back to feel what it was, only to find his hands were tied. He then realised he hadn't opened his eyes yet, and did so. Greeted with the trunk of a tree, he crammed his head around to see just out of the corner of his eye a wolf tearing at his back*<br>
<br>
&quot;graaah! geeeth yaaa daaaaam dug.&quot;<br>
<br>
*that didn't sound right. His mouth tasted like blood, bark, and cotton. He began shaking and screaming to get the dog off. Just then an arrow struck it, and it fell. Feeling satisfied that he had scared it off, the man relaxed a bit.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Oi. joo ok there darkie?&quot;<br>
<br>
*The voice was gruff and deep. And coming from behind him*<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine, jush havin' a lil prolem shtanding up ishall&quot;<br>
<br>
*His whole body ached, and his legs refused to respond. A little problem was an understatement. the voice got closer*<br>
<br>
&quot;Har har. Why joo tied naked 'round swamp tree?&quot;<br>
<br>
*Tied around a tree? That couldn't be right. He didn't remember getting tied around a tree*<br>
<br>
&quot; Whadaya talkin' about? I'm not tied around any tree!&quot;<br>
<br>
*The figure stomped past him, and then he felt a cold chill ran up his arms. The world spun, and he was on his back, looking up at a starry sky.  He felt lighter now, like great weights had been taken off his arms. looking down, he saw ropes tied to his arms and legs, and a tall green man standing nearby. Looking around, he saw several hollowed out skulls, a set of beads and a large warhammer. Looking down at himself, he saw that he was indeed naked, and quickly put his hands over his front*<br>
<br>
&quot;So, why you tied 'round swamp tree naked?&quot; asked the tall green one.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really have no clue. Do you have anything to spare?&quot;<br>
<br>
*the green man shrugged off a strap, connected to which were 2 hooks, both impaled into a smaller green man. the larger man pulled off the smaller ones pants and a leg. He handed the grimey, bloodsoak, slime covered pants to the naked man, and then began gnawing on the torn leg. The dark elf put his new pants on hesitantly... they were completely disgusting, and a bit tight, but better than nothing. the tall green one smiled a toothy grin*<br>
<br>
&quot;Joo lucky me find joo. Spirit weaver Bloodskull like eating Darkies. Brought one back last week.  He an' his howled for while after darkie stopped screamin'. You want froglok?<br>
<br>
*the large green man stuck forward the partially eaten leg of froglok. The dark elf had seen him eat it, so it should be safe... and he was awefully hungry.* &quot;sure&quot;<br>
<br>
*He took a bite, and spat it out immidiately. It tasted worse than... than... something really bad. The large green one looked blankly, then shrugged and stripped the last of the meat from froglok. the dark elf paused a second for thought*<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh... Not to be rude, but who are you? And where am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Joo in Innothule swamp, Troll home!&quot; *troll pounded his chest* &quot;Me Kazz&quot;<br>
<br>
*Kazz? Innothule?, the dark elf thought. Ok. now for the big question*<br>
<br>
Thanks kazz... umm... Who am I? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-family:verdana;font-size:small;">Thenic N'Ryt</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He stepped forth into Neriak. His name was Sindeen. His friend kazz had helped him with that much. It was carved on his arm. He had since gotten some real pants from Grobb. A bit baggy, but they would do. A cape, some prayer beads and his magic hammer. <br>
<br>
The hammer had a story all its own. From it, power was drawn. When he touched it to someone who was wounded, they would heal. When he focused on hurting an enemy, they would be struck by a great force. His hammer was his faith.<br>

Sindeen walked the streets, being greeted with nods from the guards. He walked about trying to recollect something, anything, of this shithole that was his home. Entering a tavern, he overheard an anxious man telling his story</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I was there when it was said. An attack upon our home! the lightbringers will be marching!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sindeen walked over to the barkeep to order a drink and listen in on the conversation as he walked up the barkeep smiled at him </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Aaah! Thenic! Returned already from your haiatus? I guess you'll be having your usual then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uuuh. Sure.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thenic replied, slightly confused. At least now he knew his real name. It was good someone had recognized him. He drank his honey mead, and made some idle conversation, learning a bit about his past. About a group know as the Harvesters of Darkness and about his profession. He was surprized this bartender knew so much about his past. Once he had finished off the mead, he left to seek out these Harvesters in hopes of recovering the rest of his memory. <br>
<br>
But he would have no time. As he left the tavern, a cry was hollared from the gate.<br>
<br>
Lightbringers had entered Nektulos and were on there way to Neriak and quick.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He had seen the carnage. Darkelf had slain darkelf. The army of the light was an overbloated rumor. Few had come, and those that had were dispatched. An army of darkelves had then turned on each other, and on a single bowmaster who had single handedly defeated the baron that lead the charge. She had fought in defense of these peoples home, and they hated her for it. Infact, it was for that hate that the lightbringers had even tried to attack. To destroy the heart of Hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
To make war to destroy hate, because they hated hate so much.<br>
<br>
Thenic wondered how it was that he was a darkelf. He felt glad he had lost his memory, because in it he had forgotten hate.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Thenic walked a long path, sweat beading his forehead. Traveling the path through Highpass hold, while dodging the guards. It seemed today everyone was out to get him, he thought, and only because he sought the past. He thought about todays events. <br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He had journyed to Neriak to find some answers, but was greeted with only questions and anger. No less than 5 people had challenged him in his supposed home of Neriak, and five times he had fallen. Whatever he had done, whoever he was before, he had angered many, and could not stay in neriak for much longer.<br>
<br>
From there he had left for the swamplands. Beckoned by the rumor of people from this organization he knew only as the Harvesters, he traveled. Ssakas was among those met, and the only to stick in his mind. Ssakas related to him that the Harvesters were being hunted by an empire of some sort because of a single halfelf. He related that there were many of his kind that would wanted him dead for betrayal of the empire, and moreso for association with this halfelf. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;There issss... There is one in particular which hates all of the Harvesters. His hate for them is so great, he had begun a quest to stomp us from the face of Norath, starting with Sarhea. All because the Empire is blind to the truth&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The lizard had said. He had his peoples turn his back on him, and was an outcast, much as Thenic was now.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;I might not wear an insignia or a badge of the Harvesters, but when this Saurix comes, I'll stand with you against him.&quot;<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But Saurix had not come for them, but for this mysterious Sarhea. Time past, and they had parted ways as friends.<br>
<br>
They met again briefly a few minutes ago in Highpass, and parted ways again. Thenic could not stay, he had buisiness elsewhere...<br>
<br>
After getting lost 4 times in this marvelous mess of shadowhaven, he had found his way to the trading corner, where people came from all over to haggle and barter goods.<br>
<br>
It was here he met her. Lost in thought, trying to grasp at the last few scraps of hope of finding his past, he sat there, when she walked up. She had been described to him quite well by is friend the bartender, and to a lesser extent by Ssakas, but there was no mistaking it. She walked up to him with a slightly surprized look on her face. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> It was her, the one called Illharess. Clad all in black, and wearing barely veiled hate on her face. Finally, Thenic had caught a break, and had found at least one person who could tell him about his past. He asked her many questions, including about the carved scar on his arm, which she knew naught about. She told him much, but these words resounded in his mind for hours</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Xas, you were once a follower of the Scythe. You were accepted as a member of the hall, and as member of the family. But you betrayed us, you broke the trust we gave you. And I do not know why&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She left, but not before extending to him the location of the new Harvester hall in Shadowhaven. It burned within him. The curiousity of why he had done what he had, and why he had lost his memories of it all. Perhaps a visit to the hall would help him find what he searched for.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Kiyda had been there. He hadn't known she was a member of the Scythe. It made more sense now though; often when travelling, he would happen across her, almost as if she was checking up on him. She said that they had fought in the past, and both she and Thenic agreed that maybe it was better than he was without his memories... he was a horrible person it seemed... so vicious and antagonizing. <br>
<br>
He talked with her, the sage Morgrist, and the overactive Babed. He'd shown them the mark on his arm as well <br>
<br>
Morgrist took a look at it. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;I do not know exactly what this means. Often slaves are marked with the names of their owners or of those who capture them. It is a common practice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Grrr... This name seems familiar to me. Someone from the Sisters of Myth, god knows it wouldn't be beneth them to take a Teir'dal.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Hissed Kiyda, obviously angry.<br>
<br>
Morgrist rubbed his chin and sat back. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Yes. that would fit. You say your mind is broken? This too is a common practice. Enchanters wipe someones mind so as to turn them into an obidient servant, as part of training them to be good slaves... Vivinne often did it. Beyond that, I cannot say.&quot;<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> That was that. Thenic had a new path to follow. He would confront these Sisters and find out what he could. And if that didn't work, he would search Qeynos and Freeport for the slavers. And if they didn't know anything, maybe an enchanter could undo what an enchanter had done.<br>
<br>
But the doubt was there. An evil idea, a horrible thought that gnawed at his soul. A what if of terrible proportions... It was brought by the reactions of those who knew him before he could remember. Their absolute hate and revultion at him. Even in pity they could barely tolerate his presense. What if he hadn't been a slave. What if this Sindeen or Sindeel was a dead end? What if the Sisters knew nothing of him, and had done nothing?<br>
<br>
<br>
What if... what if he had lost his memory on purpose to forget something. To forget the hate, the fear. <br>
<br>
<br>
He pushed this from his mind, and pushed on. He would find the one who tried to enslave him, who had cast the mind-charm that had robbed him of his life </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-family:verdana;font-size:small;">Thenic N'Ryt</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
