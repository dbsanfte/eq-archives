Dragon's Crest<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
&quot;On the Run!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
It is now that I'd like to say I miss my friends that have quit EQ. Estak, if you ever read this I think you should consider coming back, it's just not the same without you. Goranothos, I hope things are going well with you. I hope some day I'll see you all once again on EQ...<br>
<br>
Many years have passed since the second fall of Xernoss. The world itself has been thrust into an oncoming turmoil, much to the thanks of the Spirit Masters having been imprisoned. They where feared for their great power could rival even the most powerful of gods. Having seen this they have been thrust into an alter plane by orders from both Qeynos and Neriak. Their powers have been sealed away via the use of the Dragon's Crest, the very same spell that holds Kerafyrm at bay in a deep slumber. Only two have escaped the punishment forced upon those who carried the power of the Spirit Master. Now the time has come for the last of the bloodline to awaken his abilities that have been hidden for his own protection. It is now time for the great power to be unsealed so that it might once again protect the world...<br>
<br>
The world has become bleak and spirals towards hopelessness, due to circumstances involving the being known as the Dread King the entire Faydwer continent is unlivable. Though through this great things have happened. The Freeport Militia and the Knights of Truth have came to the understanding that if they don't work together then the Dread King could very well invade their city, and neither wants such to happen.<br>
<br>
Qeynos suffered perhaps the greatest of changes since the fall of Erudin. Since the founding of Palsa things have had a profound effect, particularly since travel has been enhanced via the use of air ships. High Pass Hold has thus become a port town much like Qeynos and Freeport once where due to its high vantage point. However, ever since the Dread King came into power on Faydwer the undead in Kithicor have fallen to it's whims. Travel on the ground now through that forsaken forest is near impossible, save for the few who consider it to be a home, these people are ranked among some of the more unique individuals.<br>
<br>
Corruption still laces the Governmental systems, as now they have had to dissuade the publics knowledge of just what occurs on Faydwer. More importantly they've blinded the public to the fact that several people still live in Kithicor. It is in the darkness which has been overrun with undead that the last remaining Spirit Master has been forced to travel through to conceal his identity. The reason for is a new branch of research has been in effect for several years, this is called science, and the users of such methods, the scientists, wish to find out the source of the Spirit Masters great powers.<br>
<br>
Through the years Cain, as well as Zebuxoruk have managed to keep Magus's child from being captured. Yes, the old man has been crafty, living a life that's constantly on the go. Of course the ungod has always kept in touch with them, warning them of when a search team would be heading there way. This is the life that has been forced upon these individuals, their hopes have rested in the fact that if this young man could become old enough he could free his family.<br>
<br>
Cain's ultimate goal is now revenge, he wants nothing more than to see his family again. In truth he would like nothing more than to destroy those who have hunted him and this child who reminds him so much of his own son. Age has been against him and the passage of time has been taking its toll. The old sorcerers powers have gradually been fading, which he has been trying to conceal.<br>
<br>
- Cain, listen up, there's a research team heading your way. -<br>
<br>
-Well Zeb that's nothing really new now is it?-<br>
<br>
-This time isn't like the others, they're serious now.-<br>
<br>
-Start explaining then Zeb, though I doubt it's anything disastrous.-<br>
<br>
-They found some of your old journals mentioning the Exodus, and Cyrus. You where saying?-<br>
<br>
-Well it's not the first time I've been wrong.-<br>
<br>
-There was also that time with the hooker who turned out to be...-, the ungod found himself cut off before another thought could be sent, he knew Cain was touchy on that subject.<br>
<br>
-Now you list up good, anyone could of made that mistake! Now how close is the retrieval team?-<br>
<br>
-I'd give them about 15 minutes tops before they're in Freeport and beating down the door to your room.-<br>
<br>
-Cutting it close aren't we?-, at that the old man was on the move down stairs to the bar area.<br>
<br>
-I'll get back to you on that, just get out of there!-<br>
<br>
Cain didn't have to be told twice, though he knew someone else would be. It wasn't going to be easy for him to find his great great grandson in all this mess. Luck was on his side as he heard him shouting. He could never understand this youngster, and how he could handle so much food and still not gain any weight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Waitress I'll have another 3 plates!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Boy you've had enough, its time we go going!&quot;, instantly Cain grabbed the young man and started to drag him from the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let go you dirty ol' man! Why do you always have to do this while I'm eating?!!!&quot;, all he could do was grab a drumstick from the waitress who was bringing him his food.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here sweetie, see ya around!&quot;, as usual the old man tossed the waitress a hefty bag full of platinum as he disappeared up the stairs with the young man.<br>
<br>
Indeed this time everything was being cut close, of course the both of them being slobs didn't help much either. It wasn't so much the cloths on the floor that where giving them problems, rather it was underwear hanging off the bedposts. This combine with their weapons being scattered all over the room didn't help much either.<br>
<br>
Cain could hear armor clad footsteps nearing the tavern, it was unmistakable now. Over the years his hearing had become attuned to the sound that armor made when it moved, thus he could distinctly make out which metal was used in the armor. This had paid off for him more than once, and today it once again did so. He could clearly hear the telltale sound of government issued armor as it made its way down the street.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was a despicable job for her to perform, of all things it had to be this. She never did like the idea of sending out search teams for individuals, generally it was the typical renegade who had stolen something from one of the governments. After reading the documents over this mission she was more than curious as to what such an old man, and a young man could have done to have her unit sent after them. Most of the time she could care less about what she had to do, as long as she was paid for it.<br>
<br>
It was obvious that whatever these two done, that they had certainly made a big fuss. After all it wasn't often her unit was sent out, mainly because of their higher rate of pay and demands on equipment. They where the best of the best though, and that brought with it a high price, namely access to nearly all the technology the governments had been holding back. They got everything from advanced weapons to communications equipment. The only conditions they had to follow where to keep the use of such items from public view.<br>
<br>
This tended to work out well since most of their targets where hiding in some deserted area of the world. If anything this suited them just fine, since they never had to worry about how much destruction they caused. Most of the time concealment wasn't even needed, save for this instance of course. Truth be known, the development and research teams practically crammed the weapons into their hands half the time.<br>
<br>
Now this time was going to be hard, since they had been only given a rough estimate of their foes abilities. The elder man known as Cain was reported to be a powerful sorcerer, though they where confident this latest form of armor they had received could handle anything he sent at them. The other person was a true mystery though, no name, only an estimated age was given. There wasn't even an MTA listing on this person, which clearly made things more aggrivating.<br>
<br>
This just gave them all the chance to test out the latest MTA reader they had been issued. It was compact unit, integrated right in with their ear pieces. The only difference this time was the fact that it had a small crystal eyepiece that covered one eye. Along with this was a prototype pulse rifle that mimiced most of the bolt type spells that Mage's use to use.<br>
<br>
&quot;Commander Kei, the ones we're searching for are said to be in this tavern.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's get this over with then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most certainly Kei was never one to be seen sitting still. As a child she always had to be busy, and that only made her physically abilities come out even more. Then again her raw strength had gotten her into a fair share of trouble too. It wasn't her fault though, what with her being an eighth kerran. This being known she had received her fair share of attention as she got older, and generally she put her strength to good use by sending the poor unfortunate young men who harassed her to the hospital.<br>
<br>
Through the years her instincts had proven quite amazing and she could easily predict just what the people she tracked down would do. Which is why she sent her fellow team mates in first, to flush out the prey. This was a tried an true method, and generally always worked to lure people out of public places so they could use their more advanced weapons to finish them off. Little could she have expected what might happen though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cain heard the footsteps coming up the stairs and knew from the rhythm of the steps, and the sound they made that they where definitely trained soldiers. He knew getting past them was going to be near impossible especially since he hadn't found the time to teach the youngster anything new as of late. He had slacked off on training, mostly because it had been well over a month since they eluded the last retrieval team.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen up, we're gonna have to go out the window.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why the hell should we when we can just walk down the stairs?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just shut up and get going!&quot;, with that Cain threw their bags out the window, then tossed the youngster out.<br>
<br>
Normally this would have worked, if it wouldn't have been for the fact that the bag's nearly landed on Kei's head. The next surprise was when a young man landed on her, knocking her onto her back with him practically laying ontop of her. Fate seems to have a way of making it's way felt in certain situations, and this one was definitely going to take that account literally.<br>
<br>
With all this happening the young man was dazed, and more so was confused as to just what he landed on. One of his major flaws was that he was damn near gutless, and so had closed his eyes the moment he was sent sailing out the window. The fact that he had landed on something soft had definitely gotten his attention though, and just as any blind person he would, he took it upon himself to feel around just what he had landed on.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell do you think your grabbing?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, Wait a sec its not what you...&quot;, he had made the mistake of placing his hands in the wrong place, and in turn received a good slap across the face for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch out below Hibiki!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cain took it upon himself to then jump out the window, though his landing was much more graceful as he landed next to the young man an the woman. He recognized her all to well, in fact he had seen some of her handy work from before. The fact that Hibiki was apparently feeling her up wasn't going to make things easier on them either.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hibiki, quit your gropin and lets get going before she really gets pissed!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not what you think Grandpa Cain honest!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just shut up an run! Your little play thing there is Command Kei!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before she could make a move the two of them had gathered their things and took off running. At least now she knew what her targets looked like, of course to her surprise her subordinates had seen the entire scene. They viewed her as a cold ice queen of a woman, and seeing her blush like she was just now only brought about tear jerking laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell are you all laughing about?! Your letting our targets get away!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was enough to bring them back to their senses, and back to the mission at hand. Though to be honest Kei was probably more astounded at what happened than what her fellow teammates where. She had more than enough time to memorize both their faces, and so finding them wasn't going to be so difficult now. <br>
<br>
In the meantime Cain and Hibiki where both in a heated argument as they ran down the streets of Freeport. Neither had any idea of what to do now, this had been the closest any team had gotten to them, and Cain was certain it was going to be hard to shake them. The fact that Kei was after them now meant things where worse off than he had realized.<br>
<br>
&quot;God damn it boy, I know she's nice looking an all but she's a real killer!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It wasn't what it looked like! Besides you threw me out onto her!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you had only kept your eyes open then you wouldn't have landed on her! Big Chicken!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look who's talking you mana saturated midget from hell!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If we get out of this I'm gonna kick your ass for that one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean 'If', and just why the hell do we have to always stay on the run?!&quot;, Hibiki now knew from the looks of things that the old man had been lying to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right I'll tell you what I can now, your special okay, they want to use you for a guinea pig in experiments.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What about what you've told me about my parents dying? Is that a lie to?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They ain't dead, the people that pay that woman back there had them sealed away! Now enough with the questions!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cain came to the grim realization that if Kei and her unit where after them that chances of a clean escape where going to be limited at best. The underground tunnels in Freeport where of absolutely no use in this situation, that much was certain. It was certain they could scan them quicker than they could find a hiding place. He knew full well they needed some place that couldn't be traveled well by anyone, including themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Hibiki, you got any idea of a place that we'd even have a problem following us in?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That makes absolutely no sense at all!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Think, boy, think! What place around here would give even us trouble and provide us with a good hiding place?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That would have to be Kithicor, it's over run with the nastiest undead this side of Faydwer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then that's where we're gonna go!&quot;<br>
<br>
No sooner had they come to this decision than none other that Kei had caught up with them. She wasn't about to be made a fool of by these people, after all she had a reputation to uphold. If anything Kei was determined to get this mission over and get her pay, as well as find out just why two ordinary people where so important to find.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Hibiki, I got an idea, but you have to take care of lover girl there for a moment while I get ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll at least I can actually find the real women!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh that's it boy, your toast when this is all done! Just keep them all busy!&quot;, with that Cain shoved Hibiki towards their pursuers.<br>
<br>
Cain definitely had a plan, he knew that there was a teleportation pad just near the entrance to Kithicor. What with all the use of airships hardly anyone took the time to travel on foot or by the use of those pads anymore. It was their best chance at escaping, if only he had the time to complete the spell. This is where Hibiki was desparately needed, because if he could keep them busy long enough they'd both get away and the unit would be left with egg on their faces.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um hey about before, it's not my fault honest! Grandpa, just how am I suppose to keep them busy?!&quot;, as usual, Hibiki felt like he was way in over his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just shut up, fight or at least try to get there attention you wimp!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was far more odd for Hibiki than anything else, he'd never really fought anyone before. The closest he had ever come to a fight was when Cain taught him basic hand to hand techniques. He knew how to dodge well enough, and he damn well knew he could out run them. Since running wasn't an option now he had to make due with whatever he could.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me handle him guys, I owe him a beating for grabbing me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kei had just had about enough of dealing with all of this, she was ready to pulverize something. The orders she was given didn't take into account that he had to be returned in perfect shape, which meant she could have a little fun with him now. For as cruel as she could of been she always preferred a fair fight, even now this took precedence as she discarded he sword.<br>
<br>
She was just going to make this short and simple as she moved forward with the cat like reflexes all Kerran's have been known for. Much to her surprise she found that Hibiki was able to avoid her attack. She simply couldn't understand what was going on now, she had about the fastest reflexes of anyone in any unit. It became apparent to her that just punches weren't going to work against him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you want to be a show off huh? Fine, then I'll give you a show.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh Grandpa hurry it up!!! She's getting mad!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Hibiki could move he found his feet being swept from under him. It wasn't so much the downward trip to the ground that hurt, it was downward punch from Kei that literally bounced him off the hardened stone street. He had never really been good at fighting, and this kind of speed was just out of his league, the first time had just been luck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hibiki! Stop fooling around and fight!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it old man I am!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well try harder!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again Kei was on the offensive as she jerked Hibiki to his feet and forcefully shoved him face first into the wall of a nearby building. She was far from done with him though as her fingers interwined with his hair as she drove his face into the wall again. After that all Hibiki could see was stars. He wasn't use to be hit this hard, even when training with Cain he hadn't been treated so roughly.<br>
<br>
&quot;An to think, the reports listed this guy as being extremely dangerous.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe to a baby but he's no match for our Kei here now is he?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His parents must be ashamed of him! I would be if I had a kid this pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Kei, can we check the reader and see just what this little punk's MTA is at?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go right ahead, no one is looking...&quot;<br>
<br>
She was really enjoying herself now as she rammed Hibiki's head back into the wall. This time when his head was pulled back blood could be seen coming from a gash on his forehead. She was now curious as to just what his MTA could be, after all everyone had at least a rating between one to five. Anything higher indicated they had done some sort of mana manipulation training. What was about to happen shocked her, since she had never before heard one of her teammates so rattled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kei, somethings not right! This thing's busted or something!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just shut up and tell me the reading!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm getting nothing on the wimp.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's impossible, he has to be at least one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm getting zero, it's like he's dead or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hibiki was unconscious as he was being held there by Kei, even in the darkness of his mind he felt weak. He never was one to be much of a fighter and this much proved that, yet there was a nagging feeling. Something was urging him to fight, as if something inside him was reacting to all the violence around him. It was if one part of him was reveling in the violence, while another part despised it and wanted nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Long forgotten visons of his infancy began to flood his mind, images of his parents. He could see his mother clearly, her brown locks of hair and amber colored eyes. Then there was his father, the off-white hair and deep brown eyes. They where the same color as his eyes, though they seemed different. In the same place he could sense other people, people that seemed to give off the same feelings as his parents.<br>
<br>
Soon everything changed, now he was being held by his mother and two men where fighting in front of them. They both appeared to be alike, yet some how different, one had a malevolent temperment. The other was near the exact opposite, as the battle continued they where evenly matched. It was clear they both had trained in the same style of combat, and had done this many times before.<br>
<br>
Everything was cut short as Hibiki once again began to regain conciousness, instantly he felt the pain from his head. He could clearly see the wall before him stained with blood, his own blood. At seeing this something was beginning to eat away at him, he wanted to do something but wasn't sure what. It was then that he felt Kei shake him as if she where about to do something else to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hibiki, damn it wake up! If you don't then you'll end up like your parents!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My..... Par.......ents....&quot;, it was impossible for him to say much else as his senses where still fuzzy.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think it's safe to save this mission is ov.....&quot;, Kei was interrupted once again, this time by an elbow that was being lodged into her stomach.<br>
<br>
If there had been one thing he could remember from being unconscious, it was a few of the moves he had seen the two people fighting perform. He knew he could at least try to mimic them, if anything it was worth a shot since everything else he had tried hadn't worked. Now he had Kei where he wanted her as he span around and flung her over his shoulder. This in turn drove her to the ground, knocking the rest of the wind out of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here we go Hibiki! Hang onto your underwear!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cain had managed to finish casting his spell, and in a flash of light they where gone. This only proved to damage Kei's ego that much more. She couldn't believe she had let her guard down, or that he was able to topple her. Now she knew for certain something was up, and she wanted to know more about what ever Hibiki was.

Only instance in this one where a major event actually takes place though would be how Hibiki is the last, which I'll tell you doesn't take place in any story... It's an event that takes place between the time that spans between the original Line of the Spirit Master and Dragon's Crest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=106.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=106.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=106.topic&index=2><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.threadControl?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2>EverQuest Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
