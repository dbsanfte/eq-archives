It has been fun. I play many classes and even managed to get one character up to 60. Not bad for an old dude like myself. Everyone has their own way they approach the game which makes it all a most interesting online adventure. <br><br>   My rant deals with the seemingly increasing amount of rudeness I see. Tempers seem very short. This rudeness trend goes beyond EQ but since this is an EQ board and is making my EQ life somewhat tiresome as of late I post it here. The internet makes it easy for people to be rude and act in ways they never would if they weren't hiding in their little private cubbyholes. For the most part I tend to ignore much of it as I realize this is just a game and the anonymous person behind the mean ugly ogre that is cussing everyone out may very well be a child.<br><br>   There are certain rules for us to follow and if someone is outside of the rules there are easy enough ways to protest and move on. Just deal with it and let it go! But many things go wrong that are part of the game. It's a game!  Bad pulls, trains, missed heals etc.. Try a little tolerance. If you feel someone purposely did something to you discuss it and then let it go! Then try turning off the computer for awhile and play some basketball or something.  It's called exercise. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>   A few common courtesies thrown in here and there would be kind of nice also. For instance, if I'm invited to join a group I do my best to give the group a chance. Some of the most fun I have playing are in oddball groups. I don't join for two minutes then leave because I get a tell for a better group with a chance for better loot or something.  It doesn't always work out but I atleast give it a little time. I also think it's rude to tell people how to play their class.  If you don't like the way someone is doing something big deal! If it's really hurting the whole group there are nice ways of letting them know. It's called tact.<br>        <br>   My point is, however, that even though EQ is a game, the people playing are real people with real feelings. Many of the players are kids.  Perhaps a touch of real life manners could be applied. Just a touch.<br><br>I did the rant thing!   Woot!   <br><br>            <br><br>    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/8/02 6:20:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Real life manners in EQ?</span><hr size=1> G/L Kal.  Unfortunately because it is a forum that lets you act in anonymity, and especially on a blue server you can't even take action in-game, it's going to bring out the worst in people.  A lot of it is the growth in the user base, and a lot of it is due to the game mechanics.<br><br>I remember playing on Inny in '99.  Ya you had some people who were jerks even then.  But they were the exception rather then the rule.  You go into Seb or VL some nights and see 50-70 people in there, then you go to say WW and can shout all you want since nobody is there to hear things.  IMO, in '99, 20% of the people cared about the l33t, 80% played to RP, Explore, guildchat, whatever.  If the behavior I saw last time I was on is typical, I'd say the number are more reversed.<br><br>Perhaps Verant should have an old-timers server.  People whose characters were created in '99 could move with their gear to a new server.  I would pay a fair amount of money if that happened (if I had any gear heh), because I think it would be a completely different crowd then the typical one nowadays on Inny.  I don't see it as being snobby, since I know of many very nice people who have been on Inny for only a year or so.  But, if throwing the wheat out with the chaff would bring back the people who started playing this game to RP/Explore, I think it would be a much happier server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarisai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arisai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/9/02 12:33:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Real life manners in EQ?</span><hr size=1> &quot;In my day whippersnapper we had to walk from WC to Guk uphill both way in 20 feet of snow, and we didn't even have shoes then!&quot; I think the game is much better now then back in the day(tm).

After all, it's just a game, so who gives a flying fck, right?<br><br>But it *is* a game.  And all the game rules we were supposed to learn when we were growing up should apply...<br><br>GOOD SPORTMANSHIP, a SENSE OF FAIR PLAY, and RESPECT FOR YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS seem to be lacking in so many people.  These are all things that should have been learned by the time you were 10, so saying someone is only 13-16 isn't a good enough dodge for these.<br><br>Why can't people treat others in a fair way, play by the rules, and be gracious at both winning AND losing.  <br><br>Why is it that people sexually harrass others in this &quot;game&quot;, and not only is it okay, but it is encouraged?<br><br>Most of the people who claim that EQ is &quot;just a game&quot; do it in the same post, the same paragraph even, that they are totally tearing a person apart.  What game are they imagining here?  A Cage Match?? <br><br>If this really *were* a game, much of the crap that goes on in game and on the boards would get people thrown out by the ref's.  Or would make it so that people just wouldn't play with them anymore.  Or would get them a lawsuit or put in jail.  <br><br>But it doesn't, because since everyone can hide behind a puter, all of the &quot;hrmmm..maybe I shouldn't do that&quot; thoughts are thrown out the window.

I'm not saying that all players under &lt;insert age&gt; are asses, but there's a disparity of ethics.<br><br>There are also probably more'n a few folks who play because they can't maintain regular relationships out in the real world.  The same crippling personality problems are going to bleed into EQ, though, because it's still personal interaction(however less personal.)  <br><br>There's also a difference regionally in the degree of regard due to other people, in my admittedly limited experience.  The fewer folks you live around, the nicer you have to be to 'em.  You live in a massive suburb, you're going to start looking at other people as obstacles because you never have any deeper contact with them than having to wait behind them while the teller/clerk/cashier sleepwalks through their business with them.  In a less populous environment, you have time to say hello to everyone you pass, so it's easier to smile, to interact; to consider.<br><br> <p><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/39/2383739.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=samira>Samira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/10/02 10:06:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Real life manners in EQ?</span><hr size=1> Unless you're a crusty ol' ranger who lives off by himself in the woods because naught scares him exceptin' folk.<br><br> <p><img src=http://iseult.sidhe.freewebspace.com/images/samira.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunilove.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unilove</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/10/02 10:09:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Real life manners in EQ?</span><hr size=1> Well, there's that.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umandrayke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandrayke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/10/02 11:23:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Real life manners in EQ?</span><hr size=1> I remember being in Cazic Thule when they announced Merlain hitting 50 and<br>the entire zone boo-ed.

I have had a very nice person ran up to be and gave me a robe, that at the time, was worth 800pp, just because she had just got a better one.

Some people feel free to express their 'darker' sides, when they feel it is safe to do so. I just wish they would express their 'lighter' side.<br><br>I prefer to play and have fun and help people. I know that there are plenty of people like me.
