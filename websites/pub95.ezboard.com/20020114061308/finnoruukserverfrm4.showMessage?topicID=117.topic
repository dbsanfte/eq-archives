Everyone else: please do not try to inflame everyone.  I would like to have a mature conversation.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Okay, a large number of guild representatives met to discuss the future of the summit today.  The meeting lasted 5.5 hours.<br>
<br>
The best news: the summit is intact.  Every guild represented (which included TD and NK) has strongly stated they will follow the new summit.<br>
<br>
Bad news for some: there were changes made -- compromises made to arrive at a system we could all agree to.<br>
<br>
I will be writing up something and sending it to the representatives for approval.  But I wanted to share the highlights immediately.  The wording on these highlights should NOT be nit-picked please.<br>
<br>
First, it was agreed that we would go to a partial FFA/FiF system, partial scheduled.  This was the hardest part of the entire discussion.  It was agreed that Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday of each week would be FFA/FiF.  The rest of the week would be scheduled.<br>
<br>
Hate will have 2 of those 3 days FFA, 1 day FiF.  Fear will have 1 day FFA, 2 FiF.  (FiF is first in force.)<br>
<br>
Because of the dramatic effect this has on the available number of bookings, we will be dropping available bookings per guild to 1.  We will be dropping public bookings to 1 as well, with additional controls to ensure that public bookings are used for the reason they were intended: to ensure the unguilded have equal access to the planes as the guilded.<br>
<br>
We are raising the number of people your guild must have to book the planes.  You now must EXPECT 18 of your members will be making the raid.<br>
<br>
Note: if you dual-book with other guilds, you add the number from both guilds.  It was basically decided that 7 people plus 20 guests didn't make sense.<br>
<br>
Note also that it was decided you should have 12 people from the reserving guild(s) or the day of the raid, or declare FFA.<br>
<br>
The 6-man limit was temparily revoked.  As long as the reserving guild has their 18 people, you can invite everyone else you want without limit.  Want to invite LoD or AV in to take down CT or help with Golems, go for it.<br>
<br>
Guilds may invite other guilds to use the 2nd floor of hate without consuming a booking.  This invitation to 2nd is BY INVITATION.  You can't just zone into hate, clear a path, and head upstairs.  You must be invited.<br>
<br>
All of these changes are to take effect on December 1.  HOWEVER, both TD and NK have stated they will be following the new rules on TUESDAY.  You may not like it, but if you have a Tues/Wed/Thur booking in November, I suggest you consider moving it.<br>
<br>
Note that there are three Tue/Wed/Thur bookings in late december.  I will be asking these guilds to move their bookings.<br>
<br>
We agreed to meet again in mid January to discuss how these changes are working out.<br>
<br>
Not everyone is going to like all of these changes.  *I* don't like all of them.  NK and TD don't.  It's a compromise.  If you don't like them, well, I'm going to be blunt.  The meeting was WELL advertised ahead of time.  If you weren't there working for a solution, you forfeited your right to complain.<br>
<br>
I would also like to say -- that although things were stressful at times, we had a lot of people together working for a solution we could all agree to.  The decision to go to FFA/FiF is controversial, but in the end, the final vote was HEAVILY ini favor of this system.  By the end of that portion of the meeting (which took over half the meeting), people were actually sounding excited about trying it out.<br>
<br>
It's my opinion the summit is now stronger than it's ever been.  Furthermore, we're going to meet quarterly to make adjustments.<br>
<br>
Although I'm not sure I'm up for moderating the next one :-)<br>
<br>
Many thanks to Xaria and TFC for offering their IRC channel.  And kudos for everyone working for a solution.<br>

I had thought bookings would now be either 12 or 24 hours.  I think it is posted that FFA/FiF time begins 4am Tues morining and ends 4am Friday morning PST.  What if a raid doesnt start until 6pm Friday?  Is it FFA until 6pm?  Is no one alowed in the plane between 4am and 6pm?<br>
<br>
I think the problem of unscheduled time was a problem from the last summit ad I am not sure it has been addressed.<br>
<br>
I think we should address it before the summit goes into effect and make sure we know what the deal is going to be.  I personally think the best way to handle it is that all bookings are 24 hours.  You book friday you got it between 4am Friday and 4am Sat PST.  You book Sat you got it 4am Sat until 4 am Sun.  Have a common time zone (PST) that is reasonable in most time zones.  That is 7am EST, 12 or 1pm in Europe, prime time in Asia (I think).  So it think that is reasonable.<br>
<br>
I am worried that if this issue isn't addressed the summit will have problems from the start.  If it has been addressed and I missed it because I had to leave early let me know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#778899>(10/30/01 11:05:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Summit III PRELIMINARY Results</span><hr size=1> It was decided to leave booking times alone.  The start/end time for FFA periods is my first draft and no one has commented on it yet.<br>
<br>
But remember -- if FFA ends at 4 am, you still want a 12-hour respawn period.  So the late afternoon raids are likely to zone into a full plane, not an empty plane.<br>
<br>
I tried to get people thinking about respawn times for this meeting, but I think people were too fried.  Maybe in January.<br>
<br>
But no, I wouldn't think that the Friday-night guild would be very pleased if they zoned in just as the FFAers were leaving.  If it were me, I'd be quite angry at finding the zone empty.<br>

<br>
Personally, I oppose 24-hour bookings.  I'd rather SHORTEN the bookings.<br>
<br>
Most guilds clear the planes in a lot less than 16 hours.  I've never been in more than 12, and that's with meager forces.<br>
<br>
Remember that most bookings are now on the weekends.  People tend to book the raids a little tighter.<br>
<br>
You don't really need the plane fully respawned when you go back in.  People tend to do the planes in roughly the same order.  So if the plane is half-spawned, that's probably good enough.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you reserved after Pantheon or one of the other guilds that clears it in 3 hours -- It'll have fully respawned by the end of their 16-hour booking without a respawn period.<br>
<br>
So I wouldn't mind a rule that says &quot;you can't schedule a plane to end closer than 12 hours prior to the next guild's start time.&quot;  Then shorted raids to 12 hours but encourage people to schedule shorter periods.<br>
<br>
I dunno.  I don't think we need 24-hour reservations.  That seems wasteful.<br>
