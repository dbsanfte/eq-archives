<br>
Here is my tale, sorry it is not inchar but I am so lacking on sleep because of this event.<br>
<br>
I was hunting in Karnor's Castle for only the second time when I saw a zone wide message, &quot;Venril Sathir looks down upon the infadels invading is home.&quot; I thought how spooky.<br>
On my next pull, POOF! There was Venril Sathir standing in front me (/emote needs to change his underwear.)<br>
<br>
Picture of Venril Sathir is here:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://personal.mia.bellsouth.net/~wht1986/venril1.jpg">personal.mia.bellsouth.ne...enril1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
My group interacted with him for about 15 minutes trying to figure out what the event entailed. Some of the more Uber people in the zone decided to take him on, and I watch them fall like flies.<br>
<br>
We continued to interact until enough peeps showed up in zone. When we had about 50 or so, we attacked. The total battle time was around 15 minutes. Definitely the hardest thing I have ever fought.<br>
<br>
I was doing fine until with my fast weapons and lvl 58 haste spell on me, I rose to the top of the aggro list. Venthril death touched for 1200, I hit mend, Venthril death touched for 1300, I shout need a heal now, so-n-so begins to cast spell (&quot;Incoming complete heal for Vear&quot;), Venthril hits me for LOADING PLEASE WAIT ... (poop bound like 6 zones away)<br>
<br>
Anyways they finished him off, before I could get back or get rezz. After everyone in zone was rezd, GM shows up and gives 3 or 4 items out.<br>
<br>
Picture of Watcher GM is here:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://personal.mia.bellsouth.net/~wht1986/watch1.jpg">personal.mia.bellsouth.ne...watch1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I thought since our group did so much interaction in the beginning we would get something, but no. Those that gave higher damage got the goods. Hence Uber Peeps got Uber drops. Very disappointing ending, but fight was great insght of what my future holds.  <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>24</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uinienofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inien of Vazaelle</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: GM Event Recap</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 11/1/01 11:07:57 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Total tallied deaths that night......7.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Went into Rathe.  Noticed the zone filled with dragon skeletons, grim reapers, and cool black horsies!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Was bound on the Mountain side of the zone, sitting on the hill watching all the fun, and wishing I had my ITU.  Someone pulled the big, red BloodReaver to the zone.  Myself and everyone within like 100ft was nailed with a 500damage point blank AoE.  Gated to the safety of Toxx with about a bubble of health left.  (Ah, good old Toxx.  Where nothing ever happens <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
Sat there for about 5 minutes and thought it all should be safe to gate back (STUPID!  STUPID!).  Gated back, and was immediately feared and munched by the dragons.  Repopped near zone where BloodReaver was waiting for me and proceded to munch me about 4 more times before I had to quickly /q to keep from loosing my level.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Logged back in to find a very nice epic weilding cleric who started rezzing me upon my arrival.  She didn't accept any money either.  Wish I was better with names.  Can't remember her name now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, Bel showed up.  After binding him we went back and formed a little ragtag group of Me, Bel, Ranger, Pally, and 2 Sk's.  Were doing great for the most part.  Bel got a really nice warrior only necklace.  In fact, he got the only good drop all night.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Later on, the group started disbanding.  When the bad stuff started coming in.  One of the SK's died.  We got trained waiting on him, and I died again.  Came back in and died again trying to get to my body (stupid BloodReaver! ).  Got both bodies and got a 50% rez on both.  That one I paid 70pp for.  It was all I had on me.<br>
<br>
All in all, I had fun.  But I'm now 1.5 yellow instead of 1 yellow from 41.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I checked the wizzy forums at www.graffe.com and it seems all sorts of nice caster (read: wizzy) items were dropping in the event zones.  Ah well, maybe next time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I spent the evening in Iceclad fear kiting cougars to get my level 35 back...   nothing happened there, stormfeather didn't even pop...<br>
<br>
The only thing different was a NPC named Numfreed that had a twin, one at each dock in NRo and IC.  You say to him, &quot;I want a ride&quot; and he ports you to the other dock...<br>
<br>
It was very nice for me cause a couple times I pulled adds and went oom on fears trying to survive and he was an easy out (which there isn't usually from island 1 in IC)...<br>

First was The feast of Tishe Virn taht was in NRo. Some fanatics were trying to make Tishe Virn come back by throwing special mushroom in the ocean. Finally Virn appeared and started attacking anyone in the zone. He was a giant snake. Some cool stuff dropped everywhere in the zone (I was there with my chanter alt and found a caster ring and cloak that give a total of +6 Int, + 45 mana).<br>
<br>
Later, as I died in SK and was bound in HP, I zone in EK to be told that I just entered the Graveyard of the dead. Sit and memorize all my undead spells and mostly my IVU. Run through zone and cross many undead, mostly blues and greens. So I speed up to SK, get my corpse and come back there. Many great stuff id dropping all over that people call out with loc. I looted some SK gloves but those I have had about same stats with more AC. Then I hear of a SK 2hs. Run there and Im the first. Im already starting to drool to see it while waiting for the corpse to be lootable. Than a  &amp;*$/@  uber SK come and try  to loot it too. So im clicking like crazy to be able to loot it first and she got it. Than never dropped again. Finally got a cloak with 10 AC, Dex, Agi, Int. So not a total lost of time.<br>
<br>
I wanted to put some pics like Vear did but dont know how to do it, so Im sending them to Kelwin if he can but them up in the picture area.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Zaboxx Painbringger<BR>

&quot;Want a revive? That's all I can do for you.&quot; Ok, that would be great. I get the cleric that is apparently unaware of rez effects. He says run. I say heal, I can't run. Loading...please wait.<br>
&quot;Reviving. Don't worry, my group will protect you.&quot; Ok, great. Accept revive. Stupid horse thing hits you for way too much for a just rezzed person to handle. /y. Loading...please wait.<br>
Finally, cleric drags all three corpses to zone. Revive. &quot;Bye, I'm logging.&quot; Two and a half yellow bubbles later, I fall asleep with Fae logged in safe in Thurgadin.<br>
Can't wait to get to LGuk and get the xp and more back.<br>
Hope the rest of you had better fun than I did with the zone changes. BTW, EK was back to normal when I logged Madrim in this afternoon, but quickly changed to the Graveyard of whatever. I guess these things will continue. <br>

They are on a two hour cycle, meaning that once it is ended, it will restart in two hours.

Cousin Valandalf was in attendance at the event in NRO and got a nice INT bracelet.  I encourage all of you to try and get some class specific gear while these are going on.

<br>
By the way, I dont know what level is our mule for now, but I got to EK with my 8 bard and got some interesting stuff: a bracer not so bad, a 7 Cha mask and a very good 1hb 13 26 and proc some flame (havent tried it yet).
