The Inny.com staff is supposed to moderate who the hosts are.<br>
<br>
Rules for these events -- pretty open.  But you MUST have a true public signup sheet.  These aren't events to invite a bunch of your friends, these are PUBLIC events.<br>
<br>
To that end, I'd like people to post to this thread if they would like to schedule and host a public event.  Please include your email address -- or else email me as admin@innoruuk.com.  What I'll do is change the password for &quot;public events&quot; and email the password to the first host, so that he/she can schedule an event.<br>
<br>
This person should pick as near a date as reasonable -- don't go making it 6 months away or anything like that.<br>
<br>
We weren't clear during the meeting how much moderation Inny.com is supposed to do on this.  I don't think I'm supposed to exercise much authority over who the hosts are, although if I were going to do so, I'd be picking people I trusted to run good raids.<br>
<br>
My personal desire is that only people who have been to the planes numerous times in the past and are confident of their ability to organize a complex raid volunteer to host these.<br>
<br>
So, who wants to hold a raid?<br>

So you're saying anyone who wants to go can go? <br>
<br>
What if only 10 warriors sign up but no enchanters or clerics? You cannot recruit for your 'public raid'? <br>
<br>
What if the bulk of them are 46-50 and you wanna hit the 2nd floor? <br>
<br>
What if there are individuals who sign up who has an obvious issue with the bulk of people... they still get to go? <br>
<br>
If you guys held a summit and the rules were specified, then perhaps we can update the inny.com page where it shows the Summit Rules about the Public Raids, cuz since I wasn't there I'm unclear on what they are, as I'm sure many are.  Please in any case. Thank you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Let me try to address some of them in a constructive way.<br>
<br>
Who are public raids intended to benefit?  Hopefully, it's folks who wouldn't be able to get to the planes otherwise, like unguilded people and members of small guilds.  Ideally, it's people who will get a real thrill out of going to the Planes and being able to say they went and surived.  For a lot of people who sign up, it's going to be their first planar experience.  The large majority of people who fit into these categories are going to be in the lower end of the level range, like 46-50.<br>
<br>
Now, nothing says that you can't bring 5 or 6 groups of level 46-50 people into the Planes and succeed.  In fact, pre-Kunark, that was your only option.  But if you don't want to have a CR that lasts for days (which was another hallmark of pre-Kunark planar raids), you've got to have a few basic requirements for these public raids.<br>
<br>
The raid leader has to be able to limit attendance by class.  I know there are a lot of soloing druids out there who could really use those PoF drops, but even if the first 14 people who sign up are all druids, you can't take all of them.  So the raid leader has to be permitted to turn people away on this basis.<br>
<br>
The raid leader has to be able to exclude people who are known ninja looters, generally disruptive, or otherwise beyond the fringe of acceptability.  This one is self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
The raid leader has to be able to invite a small number of experienced people to flesh out the raid and make it work.  This might mean recruiting clerics for PoF.  It probably means bringing high level friends to pull and serve as main assist.<br>
<br>
With today's equipment, either plane can easily be broken with a group or two of experienced higher-level players.  If you have these people in place, you can bring along a bunch of level 46-50 people and have fun farming armor drops and killing in the Planes all day.<br>
<br>
Oh, and allow me to suggest as a hard and fast rule, no loot should be reserved on a public raid.<br>
<br>
This, to me, is the ideal scenario for a successful public raid.  It's not as pure, and maybe not as public, as taking the first 36 people who sign up, but it's a lot more likely to work out for everyone involved.  If a raid leader doesn't have the discretion to do the things I mentioned above, the likelihood of a successful raid is slim.<br>

<br>
And I believe the rules on Inny.com are updated.  Let me know if that's not the case.<br>

But the entire goal of public events was to address the needs of people who couldn't go with their guilds.<br>

This is what was originally written....<br>
<br>
====<br>
<br>
The goal of public events is to provided people who are not in a planes-going guild access to the planes.  This includes the unguilded or members of guilds that just do not raid the planes.<br>
<br>
There will be ONE public event on the calendar at a time.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk.com will moderate a SIGNUP SHEET for people who wish to host (perform as raid leader) a public event.<br>
<br>
Once the current public event has started, the next host on the signup sheet should register the next event in a timely fashion.  Failure to promptly pick a date (within 3 days of the previous event) indicates a lack of desire on the hosts part, and the event calendar moderator is free to pick both an event and a host.<br>
<br>
Picking a date far into the future will result in a similar response.<br>
<br>
All public events will be PUBLIC.  A signup sheet will exist ON THE INNY.COM FORUMS.  The host may define reasonable limits based on class counts.  The host may also exclude a small number of people based on bad reputations.  The signup sheet must be made available IMMEDIATELY after posting the event on the calendar.<br>
<br>
To help ensure the success of the raid, these rules will not limit attendance on public events based on guild affiliation. For instance, you may not be able to find enough unguilded clerics to go to Fear, or you may want an experienced puller to assist on the raid.  However, as a guideline, it is expected that the vast majority of attendees of public events should be unguilded or in guilds that are not attending the planes (either scheduled or FFA).<br>
