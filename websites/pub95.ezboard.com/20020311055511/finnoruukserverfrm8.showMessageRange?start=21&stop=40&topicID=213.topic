I work with them on a daily basis.  I fully understand Microsoft's upgrade policies, I see them all the time.  I do NOT understand why Verant, up until YESTERDAY, claimed that the old worlds would work in Win 95.  They stated that Win 95 with DX 8.01a (which works on Win 95) was the minimum OS required up until YESTERDAY.  Do you get that point?  <br>
<br>
If they had tested this new .exe on ONE SINGLE WIN 95 SYSTEM, they would have known that this was a crock, and could have told us earlier.  Instead, they made un utterly unsubstantiated claim based quite apparently on no testing of any sort, and left it to their paying customers to discover that they were wrong.  This happens at the WORST time of the year for me both financially and time-wise, and it really ticks me off that I didn't get any prior notice.  I'm paying money to play a game for relaxation, and now I have to install a new OS on the same system that I'm using to desperately finish the work that's due by Christmas?  Fat chance I'm going to take that time or risk, I just get to pay for EQ for the month of December and don't get to play it.<br>
<br>
As for the condescending attitudes, grow up.  The fact that I was running Win 95 doesn't mean that I'm cheap, lazy, ignorant, or out of work.  It means that I have other financial RESPONSIBILITIES that take precedence over being technologically elite.  I don't buy crap I don't need, and I didn't need Win 95 until YESTERDAY.  At which point, I miraculously needed it the day before, due to Verant's incompetent testing.  THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN PRIOR WARNING.  It's that simple.<br>
<br>
May all your lives be so rich that you never have to think about what you're spending on anything, unless you think that makes you superior, in which case I wish you everything bad that's happened to me in the last decade and hope you choke on it.<br>

I unfortunately have ME on my main computer (It's not actually so bad, better than 95 anyway) and 98 on my other.. had 95 on it but couldn't set up my router with it so I &quot;acquired&quot; a copy of 98 for it.<br>
<br>
Prolly gonna install the copy of XP that I &quot;acquired&quot; on my main one of these days if I have time and Linux (probably Red Hat) on my other.<br>

Regardless, I hate DX8.1 cause it won't work with EQW =/ yet anyway. <p><b>Swall Owed

<br>
your resume notwithstanding, WinXP is 4 generations behind the times. Why? Because it's doing what better OSes did (better, with less) 10 years ago. Win95 was a GUI patched on MSDOS. Y'know, Microsoft makes craploads of money for what they do, too. Doesn't mean their workmanship is worth a crap. (Personally, I've refused to use Sprint for years...)<br>
I repeat, I run everything from an original PC running Dos 3.3, to the old commodore machines, to the Amiga, to an O2 running Irix 6.5, to Win98, NT4, and now win2K.... with Mandrake 8 upcoming, and I'm thinking of getting a 486 to run MS DOS.. why? To play some of my old favorite dos games. <br>
I tell you what; you get a 2002 model Lincoln Town car; I'll get my brother's old 69 camero ss (if I can find it.) That 30 year old car will blow the wheels of the new Towncar as far as performance is concerned. And Windows, especially as it's gotten newer, has gotten more and more like that fat, cushy Towncar. <br>
Why am I not running XP? Lessee, I just dumped a couple grand for new hardware, forked out for the Pro version of Win2K.. why didn't I get XP? Cause I don't have the money? Cause my system's not powerful enough? Noooooo.. because I don't like XP. I don't like what I've seen of it, I don't like what I've heard of MS's registration policy.<br>
<br>
And there are alternatives to DX for games. Just because MS comes out with it doesn't mean you have to support it. There's OpenGL and SDL, for example. True, these won't get you into EQ, but only because the lazy arsed developers have sucked into DX. MS doesn't want to support these other APIs, however, because they are multiplatform. <br>
Actually, I'm surprised anyone is using WinXP.<br>
Why aren't they all using WinCE?<br>
<br>
please tell me how you can make your yearly salary in a few minutes... perhaps the IRS would like to hear. Or maybe you only work a few minutes a year? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  just teasing.<br>

If my company released software to one of our clients claiming that it would run on Win 95, then the day after shipping the release packages said &quot;oops, guess you'll have to upgrade everything to Win 98&quot;, we'd get our butts sued for contract non-compliance, and we'd deserve it.<br>
<br>
I hardly expect VI to test every possible system configuration that every user might have, but this isn't a complex system configuration issue.  It's a simple matter of does it or does it not run on a specific OS.  They said it would up until two days ago, and now, voila, they say it doesn't.  That's incompetent, and yes, it's their fault.  For them to claim it would run on Win 95 and now to say it doesn't means that either:  a) they didn't even try it ONCE on ONE SINGLE WIN 95 MACHINE, or b) they never got it to work but ignored the fact.  That's lousy software development, and it's lousy business.<br>
<br>
And no, I didn't run it on test.  For one, I have a job, and it's not testing THEIR product release.  That's THEIR job.  And two, I couldn't get the PREVIOUS patch to work until the day of Luclin release because it apparently had the undocumented feature of requiring that I have IE5.5 as my primary browser, which I didn't.  Another example of sloppy development.<br>

I build and support NT/2000/HP-UX servers for a living in an environment with more then 8000 desktops, so I've been able to play with a mix of operating systems.  I've also supported Solaris/AIX/IOS systems, and I can get around in the Mac OS's, Linux, and Netware.  I'm not beholden to MS because I don't work there anymore, but MS has the best OS whether it's Win98/2000/XP in the most important way.<br>
<br>
If I were to code an OS that ran on a 286 faster then Win98 on a P4, had better graphics and compatibility then XP/OS X/Solaris, was more stable then Cisco IOS, had a RAM footprint of 50K, and nobody wrote any applications for it, my OS would be a bust.  When I'm running stuff at home, I want the best applications/games that I can get.  Yes if I'm core dumping every 5 minutes that would get old.  But probably 99% of the games/applications out there that a home user would want to run will run on 98/XP.  THAT'S the bottom line.  OS/2 was way better then NT3.5/NT3.51.  It was comparable in most respects to NT4.  So why did it die off when NT was absolutely taking off?  Applications.<br>
<br>
As far as Win95 versus Win98SE, there is no comparison.  Win98SE is 10 times more stable, faster, has a ton more functionality and much more compatibility.  The hardware requirements for 98 are way less then what EQ needs to run, and the upgrade process from 95 is almost painless.  The only fatality I suffered is my WinGDI printer because it requires the OS to drive it and Canon failed to ever write 98 drivers, oh well.  From what I've seen and heard I wouldn't recommend ME, it seems to be pretty bad as far as stability.  2000 is actually a pretty good OS if you have a clue about what you are doing.  Too many UX admins I see run setup.exe and then complain because it doesn't do things the way they want them to do it, simply because they don't know how to use it.  However, some games still had a problem with 2000, XP is supposedly better about that but I don't have any experience with XP and games so I'll have to defer.<br>
<br>
Also if you run 98 you can always boot into MS-DOS mode for your old games which won't run under Windows, which is a huge bonus and something I do for some of my stuff.  Even though I can get a license through work, or through my business license I still have could buy newer OS's really cheaply, I'll continue to use 98 as my home/gaming platform because it's relatively fast, pretty stable, and runs anything I would need for pleasure.<br>
<br>
As far as a monopoly, there is no monopoly.  You can buy Solaris for X86, you can buy Linux.  You can buy an Apple.  You can buy any operating system you want.  Nobody forces you to buy a MS OS.  Is it MS's fault that Adobe, Corel, Aldus, or the other 10,000 software vendors chose to use MS as their platform for their applications?  They could have chosen Solaris, or Mac, or Linux, or whatever they wanted to choose.  They chose Windows.  Why aren't most of the cars out now running Methanol or Diesel?  Because regular old gas still gives the most bang for the buck and has the largest market.<br>
<br>
As far as the comparison between the Town Car and the Camaro, bad choice.  Comparing say my 76 T/A with a 400 Big Block to my 97 Cobra is much more of a fair comparison.  The T/A in a straight line was nearly as fast.  It was much heavier, couldn't corner nearly as well, couldn't stop nearly as fast, was louder both due to exhaust and wind noise, and got not much better then half the gas mileage.  Even for gearheads, there's much more to a car then just 1/4 mile and top speed.  I've had people in my car with quite fast cars from the 60's and 70's who liked it a lot.  It wasn't as fast as some of their cars, but it was smoother, quieter, and braked better.  It's not as well laid out as my RX-7 was, but the creature comforts of newer cars make up for pure horsepower, and with the newer trannys and such a lot more of that horsepower gets to the ground.  I've been in 200'ish HP cars that would probably beat many of the 300+HP cars from the 70's because of that, and would smoke them in anything involving cornering and braking.<br>
<br>
Sucks to be left out like that, but at least the cost of 98 is probably less then the RAM upgrades many people did, and the upgrade process is generally painless.  Hope to see you guys back on-line. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udalynia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalynia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(12/7/01 9:03:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jayhawks.net/~cbell/dalynia-portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Windows 95</span><hr size=1> Yes, Kenross, I see your point perfectly.

I'm just saying that I am personally surprised that anyone is still paying modern computer games on a Windows 95 system.  That you do in no way makes me think less of you.

They're also not the only company who has such practices. For it's history, MS has stolen technology and ideas from others, then used its money base to stall and block them, particularly in the courts, while they rush out a half-arsed duplicate.<br>
The big thing that got MS in the door was IBM. People in the old days wanted IBM. IBM means business computer, by gawd. And the only IBM most of them could afford ran C/P.. err I mean MSDOS. People who wanted home machines either wanted a dual-purpose or elaborate console (so they got Commodores and Ataris) or they wanted to duplicate the functions at work. Doesn't matter if another machine would work better than MSDOS if you couldn't transfer your files to work. And no self-respecting company would have a pack of ataris sitting on their desks!<br>
<br>
I'm not going to go through the entire history of Microsoft, but suffice it to say that yes, in large part MS enjoys its near monopoly status due to its own efforts.<br>
<br>
Frankly, as for 90% of the games I've played, wanted to play, or even seen... I didn't give a crap what OS they ran on.<br>
There's nothing inherent in Linux, for example, that keeps EQ from being able to run on it, except that it's written for the Microsoft APIs.<br>
The DX 8.1 update is necessary due to some changes in the DX API; not just graphics, but sound and input as well. Most of the increased requirements had more to do with the increase in the 3D enviornment more than the update of the graphics API; more polygons, texturing and lighting in hardware, more animations (which means more polygons..) <br>
Even if the API *were* OpenGL, this update would still require more memory and 3d-in-hardware video cards, due to the increased complexity of scenes. It needs the DX update for the same reason. (in other words, it's not the DX8.1 causing the requirement increase, it's the requirement increase causing the need for DX 8.1) And that is Microsoft's fault. But at least we aren't still using WinG, thank ghu.<br>

OMG, if you want to reward someone for selling your product exclusively then you're just a horrible monopoly.  If you want someone to ship your complete product without stripping out parts like your Web Browser, well hey you are just a monopolistic behemoth.  You also call me Naive when you are agreeing with me /boggle.  So MS makes a product that is so much more popular then anything else, so people write code to take advantage of it's strengths, and that makes MS a monopoly.  If you're going to throw around names that have used those strongarm tactics you need to make sure to include Intel, Dell, Novell, Cisco, and most of the other big computer product manufacturers.  The Dell people admit that in bad times they flood the market with their equipment selling it at as low margins as possible simply to keep business from their competitors.  Maybe they don't admit it publically, but I happen to work with some of them rather closely heh.<br>
<br>
Part of Dell's case against MS was the fact that they wouldn't get their HUGE discount if they sold other OS's.  MS can't stop them from selling anything they want.  But they also don't have to reward them if they don't use their products exclusively.  The whole lawsuit came up because Java was open-source licensed for people to modify, and MS made one that was faster and more feature-rich for their OS.  In fact it was considerably faster.  Novell has better file/print services, but they are in the gutter due to their marketing and how much more difficult their product is to use, not to mention the additional cost.  Oracle is in most ways superior to SQL Server, but due to marketing, price, and ease of use they are losing market share big time.  And too many companies are spending 2-3K on Intel boxes where 5 years ago they would have ben buying some sort of Sun Sparcstation.  But as consumers too many MS haters just don't see the bottom line.<br>
<br>
If you want to be forced to pay for all web browsers, then you should support the lawsuit.  If you hate the fact that a disk defragmenter is free, you should support the lawsuit.  If you think it's a bunch of crap that networking is built into the OS and you should buy it seperately, you should support the lawsuit.  If you are pissed that Web Server software is included rather then buying it, you should support the lawsuit.  If you think that we should all be running Solaris on a RISC box for 5-10K instead of on an Intel box for 1-2K, then you should support this lawsuit.<br>
<br>
Companies dealing with computer products don't get ahead by sitting around waiting to win the Lottery.  I can tell you from being in the Industry that for at least the last 12 years it has always been cutthroat.  MS has just been more effective with their tactics then some of the other people.  Yeah I remember using an Amiga many years ago and doing sounds and graphics when the PC's were single channel CGA graphics.  My first computer course was on an Atari 800.  We used Xenix at school.  I still have my TI 99/4A, and my Atari 2600.  Is Windows 98 better then any of those OS'es I used in the past?  Absolutely.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's better then the alternatives for a home/gaming machine.<br>
<br>
You may not give a crap about what OS you are running, but if you want to run 90% of the stuff out there, it's only been coded for 1 Companies OS.  But because MS has made a product that everyone uses and codes for it's Microsoft's fault for being successful.  The PC vendors who cried about MS practices were all getting huge discounts from MS, and to thank MS for all the money they saved over the years they jumped into the lawsuit as well, bravo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kindly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(12/8/01 4:26:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xtimports.com/data/graphics/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Windows 95</span><hr size=1> Oh, after posting all of the below, it occurred to me that you managed to answer the question, &quot;Why are people still using an OS that's 4 years old?&quot; The answer you gave?

<br>
Ugle, don't twist what I say into what you mean. I never suggested that Microsoft was &quot;horrible&quot; or that monopolies were &quot;horrible&quot;. I think AT&amp;T was much better as a monopoly.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If you want someone to ship your complete product without stripping out parts like your Web Browser, well hey you are just a monopolistic behemoth. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You prove my point; the idea of a web browser, and IE itself, were lifted from the people who created Mosaic. At one time, Netscape was to web browser what Kleenex is to tissue. It wasn't that MS included the browser in its distribution; it was that it modified its OS to accomodate its web browser's functionality while not permitting the same functionality for complete, stand-alone web browsers. Heck, I know, let's get Congress to pass a law saying that all software must be written by Microsoft. By competing in the OS market, and using its OS to help it take unfair advantage while competing in the application market, MS is exercising monopolistic practices. I guess the Big Three were just doing fair, compassionate business when they crushed Tucker, huh? (nice parallel... safety glass, front-wheel drive, seatbelts and more.. we eventually saw them all from the big three, but Tucker had them first, decades sooner.)<br>
<br>
Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's worth a damn, or that it's the best there is, or that it's popular with the people it should be popular with. And if I'm going to list people who use the MS model, I'll be busy for a week... but that doesn't make the practice right, or best for consumers.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think you should pay for all web browsers; however, I know of many other than IE that are free or have free versions; I also would like to switch to another web browser since &quot;upgrading&quot; to IE 6 since it's buggy and basically does things the way I don't want to do them (and I still haven't managed to migrate my old email messages from my win98 system to my win2k system). Netscape's looking pretty good, but so are several others like Opera. unfortunately, none of them have a current version for Irix yet.<br>
As for Dell's case, this is a case of the vipers fanging each other, I couldn't care less. As a consumer, I would be furious, and was furious, over the idea that I had to buy MS Windows every time I bought a motherboard.<br>
I think we all should be running Linux or FreeBSD rather than Windows on a desktop. If I'm not mistaken, SGI has put out a version of Irix that runs on Intel-based systems (their own, of course.) <br>
When I play games, I don't care what OS it's running on. If I try to run games and have to configure forever and have continual crashes because my machine is trying to do things I didn't tell it to do (among other reasons,) I care what OS it's running on. When it sends information out on the internet without my knowing, when it allows others to examine what's going on my system w/o my  knowing, when I'm *required* to check in with the OS manufacturer before doing with my hardware whatever the hell I want to with it, I care what OS it's running on. And I do find it amusing as hell that a virtual freeware OS is competing as well as it is against Monolithsoft.<br>
<br>
Real world examples; I got Lightwave 7 (an expensive 3d app); since it requires Windows, I got Win2K to run it on. However, at the moment I prefer running Blender (another 3d app.. free.. used by many people who use LW...) under Irix, even though it also runs under Windows. Interface is identical for Blender on different Oses. But it's more responsive and handles better. Sure, you can blame the programmers for that, but if it's easier to write a non-bloated, efficient program for one OS and not for another, it's quite probably the OS's fault, not the programmer's. Oh, btw.. Newtek, the makers of Lightwave, came out with an Amiga Video Toaster over 10 years ago; it ran on 14mhz equipment. They came out with a Windows-based Toaster just a year or so ago. Considering that Windows is where the money's at, and Newtek has never hesitated to move toward the money, it says a lot that it took that long for them to migrate. <br>
And, you're wrong; Win98 isn't better than AmigaDOS 3.0. It's faster, but then it's running on hardware that's 20-40 times as fast.<br>
Btw, taken a look at WinXP? Can you say.. Gnome? KDE? My first thought when I saw my first XP screenshot was &quot;My gawd, it's X-windows. Yes!&quot; <br>
Defend MS all you like; I see them for what they are. They aren't my friend, they aren't benefactors of humanity, they don't respect my rights. This is true of most companies and whenever they get out of line, I condemn them for it. <br>
Someday, hopefully, the OS will be part of the chip-manufacturing process. Then all software will be applications, and in such a world, I doubt MS will enjoy the advantage it enjoys now. <br>
<br>
I don't hate Microsoft any more than I hate Verant. There are aspects of them I thoroughly disapprove; buggy software, misleading information, smug CS, etc etc.  And I don't intend to get into a &quot;Linux vs Win&quot; or a &quot;Mac vs Win&quot; debate, because that's beside the point. But one thing Red Hat or Mandrake can say to me if I bitch at them about bugs in the software or missing features, or features I don't like... &quot;There's the source code.. go write it yourself.&quot;<br>
And I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> think that would lead to more innovation, fewer bugs, and faster bug-fixes. But Microsoft doesn't have to innovate. Like the Borg, they can wait til someone else develops something new, and then they can move in and invent it.<br>

The DOS you see inside Windows is emulated, so any program that still uses DOS inside of Windows (like old games and such, really anything that uses the Real mode of the processor which DOS requires) uses a DOS emulator.<br>
<br>
This thread go me thinkin so I did some research. Early versions of Windows ran in real mode but relied heavily on the DOS kernel for certain tasks like disk access and port control. Because of this it was dubbed an Operating Environment. It was way buggy and performed REALLY poorly, mainly due to the 640k barrier in the 1mb ram limit of real mode. <br>
<br>
In 1988 Microsoft released Windows 286 which needed a 80286 processor to run because it required Protected mode. Since Intel chips always start in real mode, it would start the computer using MS-DOS, then Windows would switch the mode of the processor to protected mode, load it's own kernel and shell, and control the system without any help from DOS. Remember, DOS needs real mode to run, and since the processor is not in that mode, it remains idle inside the 640k ram... which is why, when Windows has a fatal error, you are left with that blue screen... which is DOS which woke up and told you what happened.<br>
<br>
Windows still needed DOS as a loader for It's protected mode loader program, since the chips still started in real mode. But since Windows NT architecture, they use a loader program that IS NOT DOS but uses the real mode still.<br>
<br>
Microsoft does not like developers to switch the mode of the processor to real mode but they have done it for a long time. For example, Windows ME WILL NOT allow the switch, many people thought ME was buggy because things like Norton Anti-virus wouldnt run on it. Well shocker, it broke the rule and Microsoft caught them.<br>
<br>
Well, to sum it up if you skimmed the text there, since Windows 286, DOS was only used as part of the loader program. There are 2 modes of the processor, real and protected, DOS needs real, Windows 286+ needs protected, so if you are running Windows, you cannot be running DOS at the same time. If you are using some DOS code, it is not part of the operating system unless it is a support program, which has to be ran by the user, and even then, it is run in a DOS Emulator.<br>
