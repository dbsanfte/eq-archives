<br>
Chapter 10<br>
<br>
&quot;The Sea of Tears.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm once again trying my best to begin writing. These days it seems I'm running across less and less to write about. Perhaps the well that all this has come from is finally running dry? If so then I'm just going to have to drill down and tap into a greater source.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Zenki's mind things had went from right from being bad to being what he considered to be a plain out living hell. First he had been dragged onto the Stormbreaker once it had docked at the Freeport Docks, but to top things off so had Leona. An all this had been done by his uncle Ryo, who didn't seemed to trilled about all of this at all either. During all this Nadia had also taken it upon herself to board the ship along with Iris, mostly because of her curiosity about Zenki as well as the possibility of meeting Janus.<br>
<br>
All during the first few hours of the trip Zenki kept up complaining about being forced to come along. Of course for Ryo this was more of a baby-sitting trip than an actual search, especially with the way Zenki and Leona constantly bickered back and forth. It was taking all he had just to keep from throwing the two of them over board. Truth be known he rather wished they'd fall over by accident then at least they'd have something to do other than fight.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is all your fault!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How is this my fault?! Your the one who should be coming on this rather than me, he's your cousin!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You two need to just shut up...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An just who are you to think you can boss me around?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona had little chance to say anything else before Ryo heaved her overboard, an to settle the debate he threw Zenki off as well. Thankfully for them the boat had arrived to dock at a  place called Sister Island. Ryo knew better than to try anything here as he quietly stepped off onto the dock along with Nadia and Iris, who by now knew it was best not to trifle with him. Much to their amusement and Ryo's grief both Leona and Zenki where still at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally someone managed to shut you up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it you little pain!&quot;<br>
<br>
The next thing everyone saw was a flash of light then Zenki frozen from the waist down. This along was enough to bring a rush of laughter from the passengers stepping off the ship. Still even frozen Zenki couldn't resist making a comment. Of course the next one brought even more laughter than the sight of him frozen.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've graduated from Fire starter to Leona the frigid Ice Queen of the Ocean.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh that's it!&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point everyone stopped laughing as Leona set about strangling Zenki. This in turn caused Nadia and Iris to rush down into the water and pull her away, kicking and screaming the whole time. Now as everyone knows Sailors can be some of the foulest of men, particularly the ones aboard the Stormbreaker who started to cheer at seeing three young women being trenched and soaked in the cold ocean waters. As could be expected several slur comments where heard as a result.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take it off baby!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah give us a real show!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was all put to an end though as Ryo made his way back to the docks at hearing the words. Those who had hailed from Freeport instantly fled from his path, save for the few who had been stupid enough to remain. All the shout was put to an end once Ryo had grabbed a braggart in each hand an had hung them over the edge of the docks by their shirts. This alone was enough to keep them quiet now.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suggest you shut up and go about your business on the ship an not trouble the women again. Understood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Sir!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No harm meant on this! Honest!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Now get about your business before I change my mind and turn you into food for the Seafury Cyclops around here!&quot;<br>
<br>
If it was to be known Ryo wasn't fond of the sea. The was mainly due to the fact that before he had been a result of Xernoss stirring up trouble. Earlier he had taken the time to look down below at the wood beam that Shoken had practiced on it. It still bore the deep scars from the repeated blows that it was dealt, even after it had seen some attention from a repairman. For him those memories where like that of dreams. Certainly he knew what was going on, an sometimes he missed being a part of another person. Of course he had grown quite use to being a sole and complete being, able to do whatever he wished whenever he wished.<br>
<br>
A short time had passed before everything had settled in. One of the things that Zenki had noticed after he had managed to chip himself out of the ice was that the island was within sight of several other islands. On the top of one he could clearly see some sort of a shrine, and on the other the only thing within sight was the beach itself. Naturally he had taken the time to talk to several people, giving them the description of Janus and asking them if they had seen him. Much to his dismay as no one had anyone even remotely similar.<br>
<br>
Ryo hadn't had much luck when he had came upon a camp of dwarves. After all he wasn't fond of them in the least. Not that anyone could blame him for all the bar room brawls and street fights he had been involved in because of one noisy drunken dwarf or two with a big mouth. Tonight there would be no such fight as he simply began to search the island for other people. He knew all to well it wouldn't do him any good to get into a fight here, an it surely wouldn't make his questions get answered any quicker. Yet through all this something was nagging at him, making his blood boil as if something or someone he had encountered in the past was nearby.<br>
<br>
Across the Island Iris had been feeling the exact same thing. Quite often as a child she had been far to attuned to the nature of people and beasts. In some cases it had been a great help, but in others it was a curse. On her many trips to Felwithe she had encountered peoples from other lands, an she could sense that there was something dark and sinister about them. She knew it would do no good to tell the guards though. The one time she had told a guard all he had done was laugh at her then tell her to go off an play else where. She expected no different of this place, yet tonight she would do her best in telling someone who might care.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nadia? Leona? Do you two sense anything out of place here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not quite sure what you mean? Maybe its the sailors?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The only thing that will be out of place here is Zenki's jaw if he makes another comment like that again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not that, something just feels unnatural here.&quot;<br>
<br>
They really had no idea of just what was going to happen. Iris had been right that something was out of the place. Any of the lookouts who had taken the time to do their duties right would have noticed the masts partially hidden in the mist. They would have also noticed the flags denoting that they belonged to the trolls of the Broken Skull Raiders. It was their business as pirates to use concealment to their advantage just as they had done tonight. This time would be their first of what they planned to be many successive raids on the islands in the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the things they hadn't counted on was that there was another ship hidden in the darkness. It was a small vessel, mostly composed of veteran fishermen of various backgrounds. All this was true save for two. One was an aged iksar, and another was a young Shadow Knight from Freeport. Neither had a like for the others company, yet they where closer to each other than to the men on the boat they had boarded. They could have been anyone or anything, their intentions didn't matter with the price they had been paid to take them out to one of the islands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lisssten young one... I've only agreed to thisss because you paid half the fare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's fine by me since we both missed the ship at the docks.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only reason the iksar had came was not because he was traveling back to Kunark. Instead his interests lay in the knowledge that his long time friend had left Freeport. A little probing at several darker area's of the social community had given rise to answer to that. If in fact his son was gone then he would most certainly lend his hand in helping track the youngest down. This was far better than just traveling back to Kunark an having nothing to do but train the younger iksar in the arts of combat.<br>
<br>
Monozard still had something on his mind during all this time he had spent on this fishing boat. He wondered why this youngster was heading out into the Ocean of Tears like this. The only answer he had gotten to his questions earlier was that he should mind his own business. It was odd for him though to see this. Given that he was in all appearance outfitted in the armor of an Apprentice Shadow Knight and didn't appear to hold himself like a well skilled swordsman this was far to dangerous a journey, especially if he was indeed going alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you must know something about me, the name is Aurius. Now please stop staring at me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your a ssstrange one, malevolence is a trait of all ssshadow knightsss. It appearsss you have nothing of the sssort yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what would you know about Shadow Knights old iksar?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know plenty. From birth we iksarsss are taught to ssspread terror and malevolence through the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you must know, until I see more of the world I can't make the choice that my path will take. I'm after a man who's caused a lot of grief and suffering. He is said to be part of a band of pirates. Where better to find that sort of man then the sea right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I sssee your point. Ssso your after what I take is revenge, not out to caussse more of the dessstruction that thisss man hasss causssed?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and the only way I could get the information I wanted was by joining and studying at the Shadow Knight guild in Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aurius now took the time to study his traveling companion for this boat ride. Aside from the cloak the best thing he could find to describe what this iksar studied where the hand and leg wraps. These where a clear indication that what he was traveling with was an aged and battle hardened monk. With closer examination he could see the way he held himself was like that of several monks he had see in Freeport. This further more raised his suspicions about why this iksar was here, heading into an area where most of his kind where hated so easily.<br>
<br>
&quot;To sssolve your curiosssity young one, I have come here to aid an old friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then it appears that we both have clear intentions out here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be warned young one. I sssense a great evil coming to thisss place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the aged eyes of the iksar, and the young enthusiastic eyes of his companion the mast of a great ship came into view. It was far enough out of it's foggy confines now to be clearly seen by anyone searching for it. This had been the evil that Monozard talked about as closer inspection brought a sickening revelation to the iksars mind. He knew all to well where this mixed crew came from now. Many years had passed since he has crossed the likes of the Broken Skull's pirates, and here they where sneaking up through the darkness to attack an island.<br>
<br>
Aurius was astonished at the size of the ship before him. It was at least twice as large as the other ships he had seen at the docks in Freeport. Also he now knew that the rumors and stories of the Broken Skull pirates where true in their fullest. None of the ships inhabitants that he could see where what he could consider to be easy prey for any of his most basic training. The man he looked for would surely be known to this rough and course lot before his eyes. He was now going to get revenge for the pain that was caused all those years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
The pirates where use to stealth as they made their way from their ship and into the darkened waters. As typical they instantly spread out, making their way through the darkness exactly as true creatures of the night would. The sentries posted at the furthest edge of the island made no sound as they where each systematically killed. Their vain attempts to scream warnings where halted as grotesque green hands where clamped over their mouths, and then a cutlass shoved through their backs only to exit out their gullets.<br>
<br>
Unlike most trolls, the Broken Skull had allowed in many other races. It was usual practice for the trolls to first destroy the first few defenses of a ship or an island. That way the less resilient of their forces would have little trouble reaching the goal. Their tactics where to take control in numbers rather than use total brute strength. This way the more that survived till the end of a raid, the more they would have to pick out and be sold as slaves.<br>
<br>
Tonight was going to be far different for them though. Ryo had sensed the evil approaching the island and had already taken up observation high in the top of one of the few tree's that graced the island. He waited and watched as their vile creatures came out of the waters, and as they began to take prisoners below. In his mind he knew that Leona, Nadia, and Iris would be fair prey for them to take as slaves. The only wild card in this deck of players would be Zenki. He basically had no idea of how he could or would react to all these events.<br>
<br>
Soon Ryo's eyes spied at small vessel approach the island and then what he could tell was an iksar and a human step foot on the beach. This brought a twisted smile to his face as he realized just who had came. It had been so long since has seen this person, and it was quite surprising to see him here now. The other was a complete mystery to him though, but his armor was that of an apprentice shadow knight, this much he knew.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just as anyone predicted Leona had not taken lightly to seeing a troll, and the chaos that ensued was worse than the incident in Freeport. All manner of obscenities and insults had spewed from her mouth as the pirates stopped to gawk at her. They had managed to sneak up on the three women, but blew their chance as a total surprise when they paused to ogle them. The last thing they would expect was an infuriated sorceress.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meza thik girls make good slaves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know dear boy, I think your right. The Captain would like these lassies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Slave?! Dirty Bastards!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fiesty too! Meza liks!!&quot;<br>
<br>
As to be predicted the next thing that happened was the two unfortunate pirates ended up being incinerated before their cohorts. The resulting explosions and flashes of light could be seen all over the island. Pirates flew this way and that as the ground under them burst open, sending them hurling into the air. Finally after several managed to get in close her hands where shoved behind her back, then tied. Of course during all this Nadia and Iris where of little help, neither where very good at any kind of fight as they where soon tied up like Leona and shoved along towards the docks. All the way Leona constantly screamed, loud enough for the rest of the prisoners to hear from quite a distance away.<br>
<br>
Zenki on the other hand had been doing his best to avoid the few pirates that had found him. They had never seen anyone who could dodge or move as fast as he was. Whether it was daggers, swords, or shurikens they just couldn't hit him. That all held true till he turned to run and ran face first into what looked like the biggest troll he had ever seen. It was at least three times the size of the others and had this stupid looking grin on its face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh hi there fella... Your going to hit me now right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trog SMASH!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The troll promptly slapped a surprised Zenki to the ground with both hands. It was lights out for him as he lay there, the ground clearly cracked under the impact of the his body being forced down so hard. It had been child's play for the Trog to do this, though he had to admit his hands did smart from hitting the young human so hard. The massive troll gave a slight grunt then tossed Zenki over his shoulders and headed towards the docks with his compatriots.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ryo had heard all the commotion and felt the ground rumble as he made his way to the beach silently. He knew that Monozard would surely sense him as he came up from behind. The Shadow knight on the other hand he was certain would be surprised. This all suited Ryo fine, after all he wasn't one to be completely innocent when it came to scaring people. At times he rather loved doing it to the monks in Freeport. It taught them to be well on their toes.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what brings you so far out here on the ocean Monozard?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I came to help you search for your son of course. I would think you would enjoy some sort of civil company.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you come from?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aurius was completely puzzled at this feat, as it was something he knew only rogues where capable of. Clearly this man was not a rogue though, from the clothes he wore and the way he held himself. He simply couldn't grasp what he was, since he held himself similar to Monozard, but something was different. It was as if he was in a constant state of shifting, as if he seemed to be everything and nothing at the same time if that was even possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;I walked up rather slowly, that's where I came from.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Auriusss thisss man here is known asss Ryo, and expect to sssee other such thingsss if you intend to ssstay on this island much longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ryo, as in the same Ryo that trains with the monks in Freeport?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the very same. And from what I can sense is that everyone is gathered at the docks, save for us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You do realize thessse are the Broken Skull piratesss right? That means Zane will be here for sssure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mono I might be getting older, but I'm neither stupid nor blind now and never intend to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
That name had been one that Aurius had long since hated. It was the man he was searching for, and it was the person he was out here for now. This man had managed to slaughter his family save for him, and over the years he had searched and found out who was responsible for the raid that was done on his fathers ship. The shadow knights in Freeport had sensed this hatred, and being followers of Innoruuk realized it was something that could be twisted and used as a perverse power. It had the quality that all of their Knights strive to attain, and now it was coursing through his veins with renewed passion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ssso ssshould we just walk in and lay waste to them like we did in the Crow's Pub back in Qeynosss? Or ssshould we take a calmer approach.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It would appear as your young friend has other plans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both Ryo and Monozard shook their heads as they watched Aurius head towards the docks. That had most certainly settled their dispute over how they should go about saving the people as they quickly fell in step behind the young man. There was something the two of them felt within him now. It was similar in feeling to their own nature, but more intense and fueled by what they knew was the rage of youth.<br>
<br>
As was usual the pirate captain Zane always expected the unexpected. This was the reason he wasn't surprised that someone made it past his underlings. There was a deft flick of his wrist as his cutlass was unsheathed and pointed at the three people he seen come into view before him. One he knew by sight from several years before at a tournament, the iksar he only knew by rumors at best from Qeynos. Of all the people before him the young man garbed in shoddy armor posed more of a mystery, and hence more of a threat than anyone else.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen Fella's I know your not the brightest candles of the lot, but do be more careful so as we don't have anymore guests like those.&quot;<br>
<br>
While he wasn't whole out pleased with this situation as it was now there was nothing he could do. After all who could expect much from a shipload of a mixed bunch, mostly composed of trolls. The best of his warriors was Trog, who doing just as he was told was tying up their captives as he spoke. Zane had given him explicit orders to tie the redheaded fellow they found to the mast, and shackle the crimson haired lass with what he called a fiery temper to its opposite side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zane you've got a lot of nerve coming out to this part of the world. You know well and good coming out here would mean you'd run into me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye I did know I'd see you, as such can be expected since your child is gone is he not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you know about the young Janusss?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For that dear lizard you'll have to get through my men. While not the most astute bunch, they do get the job done when it comes to bashing a skull in.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a nod given between the aged iksar and his old ally. Just as they had done in the Crow's Pub the two leapt back away from each other just as a troll on either side of them struck out. With as much grace and synchronization as two dancers they landed a fierce blow to their advisari. The result was the two trolls collided face to face demonstrating just how clumsy and offish they could be. Not wanting to be left out of the fight Aurius drew his blackened sword from its shield and lashed out at what he could tell was the weakest enemy near him.<br>
<br>
A trail of blood sprayed into the air as a dagger grazed Ryo's shoulder while he was dispatching another foe, this one being a human. Having seen this Monozard had taken a step back from the battle, a deep reptilian chuckle coming from his throat as he knew to well what was going to happen. Long ago he had witnessed what had happened to those who managed to anger Ryo and this was going to be no exception.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you've written your willsss. He will not let you live now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll all perish now... Fools!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The air filled with what could be described the howling of pain and hate itself. Ryo would give them no amount of salvation from his wrath. Normally he repressed such feelings, for the sake of his family and the few he called friends. These where neither though as his eyes narrowed shifted to a ghostly obsidian color at the pirates surrounding him. The first to rush him was to meet a horrible fate as Ryo wrapped his fingers around the idiots arms and jerked upwards. Bone fragments and blood filled the air as the pirates seen the true nature and ferocity of the man before them.<br>
<br>
One after another Aurius watched in astonishment as he watched what he thought was a demon start its assault on their foes. Clearly he could see this man or beast before him cared not for the pain he caused as limbs where torn from bodies, raising showers of crimson liquid into the air. Before long there was not a raider that dared attack the blood drenched Ryo, for fear they would certainly die like their comrades. During all this Monozard watched with what most would call an interest, never having had the chance to witness his old friend in such a frenzied state before.<br>
<br>
The aged pirate leader would have no more of this though and with a snap of his fingers Trog pulled out a cutlass and aimed it at the fierce tempered redheaded beauty shackled to the mast. Zane was not one to lose so easily, and certainly didn't intend to how. He had heard stories of this man before him, and now knew the truth. Also he was willing to bet he had a weakness for the helpless.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trog be a good boy an if our dear supposed Demon of Freeport there so much as moves kill the girl as you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trog not get to use girlie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That all depends upon him down there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bastard, I'd not bet everything on a single person. You have little knowledge about what is aboard that ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona could do nothing but shiver in rage and horror as the massive trolls hand came to wrap around her throat. Tears filled her eyes as it's foul breath filled her nostrils, and its cutlass caressed her cheek. She dare not move now for fear of being choked to death or gutted right before everyone. It was then that her eyes focused in on the terrified looks of Nadia and Iris who had not yet been moved onto the ship. Then her eyes moved on to Aurius and Ryo who stood perfectly still as Monozard swished his reptilian tail back and forth in irritation.<br>
<br>
Little did anyone suspect what was happening in the sleeping mind of Zenki. The darkness spoke to him in sensual tones. It acted as if it wanted to take him, and devour his very being. In the darkness there felt as if there was someone or something. It was alluring and enticing, pulling at his very soul. All he could do was wonder what to do, whether to follow this voice in the darkness, or stay where he was and wait for something else to happen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come to me young Zenki... Forget everything and come be at peace...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That sounds perfect. Forget everything and just resting sounds so very nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes come to me... Come be at peace, forget the women and your family.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those last few words he had heard finally trigged his minds eye. Opening it to the dim reality that surrounded him. In the distance he could see Iris and Nadia, with terrible and frightened looks on their face. He could see his uncle Ryo, obviously frustrated and angered beyond anything he had ever seen before. The other two people he could not clearly make out, but they to appeared to be infuriated just as his uncle was. It was then that he had come to his decision, which would be something none would expect.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll not leave them, and I'll not leave Leona!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was when Leona felt as if her life was going to end. The hair on her neck stood on end as she felt something incredibly strong and savage near here. She began to cringe and finally broken into sobs, since there was nothing she could do to prevent anything. The tears where there because no matter how the events played out she couldn't see anything that would bring her out of this situation. Finally she could hear the wood of the mast beginning to crack, she realized who was just on the other side of the wood now.<br>
<br>
This was when Zane turned to see the young man he had Trog die to the mast, and now he see the wood and chain beginning to strain under the raw strength he now possessed. Zenki let out the most blood chilling scream anyone, save for Ryo, had heard before. The chains finally tore apart at the seams, much to the surprise of Trog. It was a definite challenge or so the beast thought as it pulled its attention away from Leona and stood before his new foe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trog SMASH!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Zenki Smash!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Trog soon found out what a real smash was as Zenki leapt up and drove a knee firmly into the trolls face, mangling it beyond all recognition. There was little time for Trog to recuperate though as he soon found himself being swung by his own massive arms into the mast of the ship. Zane having been a bright man took this chance to move down from the ship, capturing Nadia in one swift motion and bringing a dagger to her throat. The mistake was his attention was still on Ryo, and not on the actions taking place on the ship.<br>
<br>
&quot;You move Demon and I slit her throat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenki dealt the final blow to the massive Trog, and that is when his attention turned fully onto the instigator of all this. There was nothing but contempt and hatred for this man in Zenki's eyes now. Then he seen an unfamiliar figure come up behind him, waiting for the chance to pounce and take the old pirate by surprise. A smile came to Zenki's face as he grasped a piece of the chains that bound him, then threw them down into Zane's face to give his apparent friend below the chance to move.<br>
<br>
Indeed it had been Aurius chance to move and he did so by shoving Nadia out of the way. Hand grasped hand as the young shadow knight found himself the target of the dagger that would surely pierce his weak armor and take his life. He wanted revenge on this man though, and he wanted him to pain. Aurius wanted this man to feel the same suffering he had endured all his life. The hatred and raged fueled his flesh and made his body burn, bringing forth a pain that Zane had never felt before from the hands that where now intertwined with his. There was a burst of force and then the elder man found himself reeling backwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was for myself! This is for my family! Die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aurius found an unrealized speed he had never attained before as his sword was charged by his newfound power. There was a flash of dark light as it cleaved into the chest of his most hated enemy, searing his flesh. The finale was an upper ward jerk of the blade that nearly slip Zane into two before he burst into what could be called the flames from hell itself. It was over at last as he turned away from the burning corpse and looked on at the people before him.<br>
<br>
All Ryo could do was nod, then look over at Zenki. There would be a lot of explaining to be done about what the two of them had done. Also now there was the matter that things where not as they appeared. Whatever was happening in the world was not something as simple as someone disappearing. There where forces at work that would have to be dealt with soon... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=generalbritannicus>General Britannicus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>King of the North</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/03 5:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I like</span><hr size=1> I like it , I've actually read it twice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=119.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.threadControl?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2>EverQuest Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
