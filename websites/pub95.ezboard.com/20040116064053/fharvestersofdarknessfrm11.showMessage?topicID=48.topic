A Very young warrioress, not even completely armored yet, though mostly, and still sporting a shield on her left arm, rather than a second weapon.  She reads the criteria, frowning slightly at the mention of Koda'Dal in the restrictions.. she is half of the hated race, though she hates that half deeply.  Reaching into her pack, she retrieves a quill, ink, and parchment, and in flowing Teir'Dal script (she has recently learned the language, a fact she is very proud of as she admires the Teir'Dal greatly) pens the following: <br>
<br>
&quot;My Ladies and Lords of the Scythe:<br>
I must say I am impressed by what I have heard about this hall.  I have read the policy concerning race and occupations.  I am half elven, half human, my elven side is Koda'Dal. I hope this would nt be detrimental to  me.  One other thing I am concerned about, is that I see nothing that indicates what is an appropriate minimum season for one interested in possibly joining this Guild.  As you may have noticed, I am very young yet, still only in my 6th season.  I am not even sure I am ready to join a guild yet.  But I am much interested in possibly applying here, when I am ready.  Could someone please contact me, or even leave a message here, I am more than willing to return to look for a response, so that my concerns may be addressed?<br>

The neatly written note catches her eye, and she pauses to read it. With a smile on her face, she settles down to write a reply.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Vendui Lady Auryla,<br>
<br>
i have read through the note left in our halls, and decided to send you a short reply. The two questions that worry you are easily answered. <br>
<br>
The fact that you are indeed a halfbreed will make it more of a challenge for you to convince those within the scythe that follow the hard path of your dedication to our cause. As such, it would be wrong to say it will not be 'detrimental', as you put the question.<br>
By itself, however, it will not be the cause for a possible denial should you decide to step forward and apply to become one of us.<br>
<br>
The question of age deserves a similar answer. There is no set rule as to a minimum age or experience for someone to join the Scythe. On the other hand, the average experience of the members is rather high, which means that the learning years will be spent without much company of other members. It would also be foolish to expect to find gifts from elder members placed in your hands. There might be some, but there might as well be none.<br>
<br>
As such, i would advise that you gain more experience, while keeping an eye out for those wearing Harvester colors. See if you can meet with them, and perhaps get to know a few of them. Most, if not all should not react with violence if you approach them with respect.<br>

Few who know where she dwells, would have reason to contact her here.  A few of those who might choose so, may wish more violence upon her due to her recent actions with one of their own, than not.  Frowning, thinking of the paladin she'd tried to convert, she loosed her sword in it's sheathe.  Though rare, indeed, violence was not comepletely unheard of in the streets of New Taanan.<br>
<br>
Opening the door slowly, she was pleased to note the servant, wearing the livery of the Scythe, at her door, bearing in hand a message.  She took it and read it, smileing to herself.  Retrieving quill, ink, and parchment from her desk, she penned, in her flowing script:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am honored you woud choose to send a reply to me with such haste.  I am not surprised that my half elven blood would cause some to mistrust me, at first.  I am often mistaken for a LightBringer, much to my disdain.  As for the challenge of proving myself otherwise, I relish it.  Also, I would not expect gifts laid upon me. It is in me to work for what I have.  In the issue of my season, I would most likely wait until I have earned the right to sport my family name, before officially stepping forward to apply, officially, though I will do as you suggest, and look for those that wear your badge, as I would like to get to know those whom I may wish to someday join.  Again, I thank you for the quickness of the reply. <br>
Respectfully,<br>
Auryla (Thal'Kaarsh)<br>
Loyal Servant of Inorrukk<br>
Warrioress of His Hate&quot;<br>
<br>
Auryla tri-folded the note, and sealed it with a dollop of blood red wax, and imprinted her family crest into the wax.  Handing the note to the servant, she instructed &quot;Take this to whom it concerns, prmptly.&quot;<br>
<br>
The servant bowed, and quickly departed. Shutting the door behind him, Auryla finished her wine, and straped on her armor, and set out to Nektulos forest.  Halflings would do nicely to improve her skills,and her reputation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ssakaschaigidel>Ssakas Chaigidel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of the Scythe<br>

The size of his suite overwhelmed him at times, and often he could not sleep unless Derin was at his side.   His mind still drifted back to that horrible day in the Arena off lake Rathe far too often, and with the memories came the Hatred, the hatred he did not yet have complete control of.<br>
<br>
Ssakas sighed deeply.  He sat at his desk, attempting to occupy his mind with the business of the Scythe.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Half elven warrior of Innorukk.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
His eyes darted to the carafe of wine, breathing on his desk, on the crystal goblets residing beside, one for each Derin and himself.  He took a deep breath, attempting to calm his nerves, and the emotion flowing through his veins.  He shakily picked up a quill, and in sloppy Teir'dal, penned this missive.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lady Auryla,<br>

I realize that others of my House have already been in touch with you, but I still feel the need, for some reason, to contact you.  <br>
<br>
I am Jabbuk Ssakas, Knight of the Scythe.  Your inquiry into our family interests me, and I hope to soon meet with you, face to face.  Our Hall is open for all who pledge not to cause trouble within, and I hope to see you in the lounge.  ((/harvesters))<br>
<br>
Your heritage does not bother me, and you will see no extra distrust based upon your race, at least from me.  Many who walk the darker paths look upon my scales and recoil.  I know what it is to be hated by appearance alone, and I refuse to fall into that trap.  Not all with pale skin are of the Light, just as not all of us with scales are of the Empire.<br>
<br>
Let the Darkness protect you always.<br>
<br>
Jabbuk Ssakas Chaigidel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ssakas laid the quill upon the desk, and looked with disgust upon the shakey script he had produced.  He prided himself both on his Teir'dal, and on his hand writing, and this letter appeared written by a first week student of the language.<br>
<br>
Another deep sigh overtook him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Half elven warrior of Innorukk.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
His hand shot out at the decanter, rocketing it from the desk through the air until the wall halted its progress, the sound of crystal shattering filling the air, as the blood red wine covered the wall, running in streaks down towards the floor.  He looked down at his hand, quivering with the power of Hate, realizing that he had to learn to harness it, to control it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Use your hatred, Ssakas.&quot; Sarhea had told him.  &quot;Do not let it use you.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He stood, and summoned two servants as he strapped on his armor.  Today, haste would be a boon for the first to arrive.  He would get to breath the fresh air, on a messenger run to New Taanan.  The slower of the two would learn the difficulties of removing red wine from white carpet.<br>

I have been doing as has been advised of me, working on improving my skills, and have recently attained my 9th season.

Then, she looked down and saw a Gnome, dressed in the robes of a spellcaster. <br>
<br>
&quot;If yer needing a Gnomish Gearlock Device to aid with yer fletching, look me up.&quot;<br>
<br>
The half Elven warrioress, smiled, bemused.  &quot;I just might do that,&quot; she said.  &quot;My thanks for the offer.&quot;<br>
<br>
((I usually get home and online about 5-6pm PST .. if I read your note correctly, most likely you'll be in trader mode by then.  I am off on Sundays and Mondays.  So, hopefully we can meet up on one of those days, or perhaps Saturday evening.  *smiles* Thank you, I have never learned fletching before.  The Gearlock might come in handy.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tannym04>Tannym04</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(5/2/03 7:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A young Warrioress of Innorukk</span><hr size=1> Auryla smiled as she sat on her bed in her alternate living quarters in East Freeport.  She had been in contact with th people from the Hall of the Scythe for a few days now... and she liked them.  It seemed also, that the feeling was mutual.  Lord Damaste had requested she stop addressing him as 'Lord Damaste' saying his family called him 'Demaste'.  Master Ssakas had also said she could stop using the formal term when addressing him as well.  Family. Acceptance .. true acceptance for who she was, not what she was.  Very few people she had met had done that.  One of those who had, had ended up betraying her, when he led the party that had slain her father.  HE would die.  One other who had accepted her was gone...  Gods... she still missed Kirvellyn...   But in the hall of the Scythe, it looked as though she had found a home.  When she was ready to step foward and officially declared=re her desire to join them.  Her heart was ready, but she had a personal mission to complete first.  One that would likely see her to her 20th rank.  A mission of Vengeance.<br>
