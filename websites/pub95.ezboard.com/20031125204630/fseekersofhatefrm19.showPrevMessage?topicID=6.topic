No deaths, everyone stayed together, and it was an overall great experience for me.  Here's a list of what they did to pull off the raid:<br>
<br>
KILLING MOBS<br>
1.  The group stays together always!  The main puller gave all the directions.  He would scout ahead then come back and he would tell everyone to follow him and when to stop.  He did it in short runs to make sure everyone was together.  ABSOLUTELY NO WANDERING!  Wandering can cause trains and DEATH for you or the raid party.  A raid that STAYS together LIVES together.<br>
<br>
2.  The puller brought the mobs to the main tank.  The main tank had 2 hot keys set up for directions.  <br>
<br>
The first key was &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;GAINING AGRO ON ----&lt;%t&gt;----DO NOT ATTACK!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;.  At this point NO ONE should be hitting or nuking the mob.  Only casters are allowed to either Tash, slow, or Debuff the mob...anything that will not cause the mob to break agro.<br>
<br>
The second key was &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ASSIST ME NOW in killing a ----&lt;%t&gt;----ALL ASSIST ME NOW!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;.  At this point all the melees would run BEHIND or to the SIDE of the mob NEVER IN FRONT.  This is to ensure that the main tank keeps agro on himself so the healers do not need to waste mana on the other tanks.<br>
<br>
As for nukers, the rules were:<br>
Nuke once AFTER the mob dropped down to 80pct and a second time when it dropped below 40pct.  Again, this is to ensure that the mob does not break agro and go after the casters.<br>
<br>
Adds:  Enchanters handled adds by mezzing them when necessary.  If you do not have an enchanter in a group you can tank mezz by designating one, maybe two tanks to take on the second mob until the first one is killed.  That way the healers dont have to worry about mobs hitting people from behind and having to heal several people at once.  Healers need concentrate on healing only those who are main tanking and it helps conserve mana that way.<br>
<br>
LOOT <br>
There were also two main looters that picked up everything.  The puller did NOT get another mob until items were looted.  This is to ensure that if no drop items are on a mob there is enough time to roll on the item if you need it.  Two looters are also handy in case of lore items that may be dropped.<br>
<br>
We had evacers/porters in each group.  At the end of the raid we ported into the Nexus where dropped items were rolled on.  Need before greed:  If it's an upgrade for the character you are playing you can roll on it using a random 100.  Once all the decent gear is distributed the person with the highest charisma ran to sell off the rest of the items. Cash for the entire raid was then split evenly with all the groups.<br>
<br>
I have been on several raids before but by far this was the most organized raid I had been on.  The instructions were clear, and everyone listened and we all had a great time.  These rules ensured that we didn't have run-away mobs, people hitting things randomly, and NO DEATHS.<br>
<br>
They made it EXTREMELY CLEAR that if you did not listen to the main puller and main tank that you were going to be disbanded from the raid and forced to fend for yourself in the zone.  This rule is not intended to be cruel in any way but if you endanger yourself and the lives of the raid party you will be disbanded.  It is better to have one death than an entire party wipeout because some idiot cannot understand the simple rules that are posted above.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps out for future raids...this is just my 2cp's worth of information <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I have been a raid leader of Shadows of the Ebon Moon for close to 2 years now, and so have done my fair share of them. The above rules are on the right track, but there are some things that you really should not do. Will just go down the list:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. The group stays together always! The main puller gave all the directions.......<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Can't argue with group stays together. That is the way it should be, but more then that... when you reach camp you stay there. Don't follow the puller, don't move from that spot unless told to. It goes on to say don't wander, and that is right on the money.<br>
<br>
Now where this goes south is the part about the puller giving directions. That is something that really should never happen. First off, the puller is the one that is most likely to die... and quite often. If he/she dies and a fight occurs... the raid is now leaderless. It's not a good idea to have a back-up leader either as you may have the 2 of them speaking over each other. So only one leader and it should be someone in the group with the MA... but not the MA either. Also the problem with the puller calling the shots is that they are usually off pulling and don't know what's happening back with the rest of the force. If you have an LD, or a fight where a death occurs, etc. if the puller doesn't know about it they may say move up when you aren't really ready to do that yet. This causes confusion and that get's people killed. Just have the puller send a tell to the raid leader or if they are in the same group just say only in group that it's safe to move up. The puller just stands at the point where it's safe and waits for the raid leader to say &quot;move to up to XXX&quot; and to join him. Now I am a cleric so being that I'm always watching the action from afar I have an ideal position to run raids. I'm not saying it has to be a cleric, but it really should be someone that doesn't get into the mix of fighting so that they can see things occurring outside of that one kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. The puller brought the mobs to the main tank. The main tank had 2 hot keys set up for directions. <br>

<br>
This starts off right, yes the puller brings back the mob to the MA (Main Assist or Main Tank) and only the MA should attack. There isn't a need to say don't attack as it should be understood to just back off and give him room to get aggro. Don't run up next to him and get in position... just back off and give him room. However, that part about casters casting &quot;Tash, slow, or Debuff the mob...anything that will not cause the mob to break agro.&quot; is way off the mark. Those spells are very, VERY high aggro spells and WILL take aggro from the MA. The only spell that you want cast early is Slow and that should be done by a Shammy standing next to the MA. When the Shammy get's aggro from slowing they just stand there and take the blows till the MA can get aggro back. When the MA has gotten aggro off the slower then that means that they are very high on the hate list and it's safe to call the assist.<br>
<br>
Now call the actual assist and have melee move to the sides and back of the mob. This is not for aggro purposes as where you stand has nothing to do with that. This is because the mobs are weaker from the back, you won't get repost damage on other melee's, if the mob enrages then only the MA will take extra damage (as it should be), and if the mob does an AE (area of effect) spell then sometimes it only effects people from the front so best to not be there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
The next parts on nukers. Nukes can really be played by ear. 80% might be a bit early depending on the mob. Basically anywhere under 60% they can let fly. Not over kill and not chain nuking, but if they don't know how to nuke and not get aggro... then they have been soloing way too much and need to group more and learn. If the mobs you are going after have a ton of HP and take a while to kill even with all the damage you have on the raid then the MA can call a Melee Assist and later a Caster Assist. Depends on the mob though... so play it by ear.<br>
<br>
Chanters... yes the mez... however, if this is a Kael Raid then you can't mez giants. So Tank Mez must be used. Have a tank from a secondary group with a good healer attack the Add and pull him away from the other mob the MA is on. ONLY the TM (Tank Mez) should be on that mob and the one healer should be enough to keep him going till the MA's mob is dead. Have 2 or even 3 if possible TM's assigned before you start.<br>
<br>
Most of the rest looks good and is really whatever works for you as a guild... everyone does it a little different. The last thing though is: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They made it EXTREMELY CLEAR that if you did not listen to the main puller and main tank that you were going to be disbanded from the raid and forced to fend for yourself in the zone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now this, though good punishment for the crime, is not best for the raid. Get them out of the zone... give them an xloc or port the group out disband him and port back if need be but get them out of the zone. A disgruntled raider just left in the middle of a zone, may do anything in anger... don't risk the raid.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions then please feel free to ask. I'm always happy to help anyone when it comes to leading raids. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=331926" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bhoward3/images/dadalan.jpg" style="border:0;height:85;width:468;"alt="Dadalan Lyfrender"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bseekersofhate.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abarrach5>Abarrach5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#939393>(8/25/03 3:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fseekersofhatefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid rules from a raid I went to in Kael</span><hr size=1> I 'm very glad you have posted your raid exp, ty much.This is a post that all guildies should read and reread,for it will make all much better raiders and understand how to live and prosper.thx again..................<br>

<br>
Upon pulling you should have he shammy ( or mage) hit it with the Malo line first, ASAP. ( minimal to NO agro off that spell).<br>
This Debuffs the mob for slow to land, espo in Kael where Magic resist is high. Having the shammy ( enchy) cast slow right away is a bad idea  for a simple reason, if it resisted the mob , who is now pretty pissed off at the shammy/enchy is still swinging at full speed.......<br>
 that will be one dead shamy/enchy please... hold the cheese.<br>
Debuff upon pull, slow follows.<br>
