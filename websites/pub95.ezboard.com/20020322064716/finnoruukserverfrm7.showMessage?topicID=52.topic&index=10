She stretched and yawned, and stood up onto the cool floor.  She dressed in simple leather clothing today, as she was on a needed break from exploring.  She found a note on the table, telling her Choco went to the arena to spar with a few friends for his daily exercise.  She decided to fish a bit and make a fish breakfast for her husband.<br>
She had a few fish now, and prepared them before adding a few spices and frying them.  She crushed some fruit and made a juice from them.  She set more fruit into a bowl to go with the fish, and place warm sugary hot cross buns beside the plates.  She fixed some eggs the way Choco loved, and as she set the last of the food on the table, he entered.<br>
&quot;Good morning, my darling.&quot;  he took her in his arms and kissed her passionately.  He was damp from a bath he took after his sparring session.  His muscles rippled as he placed his equipment in a cabinet above another table.<br>
&quot;Breakfast is ready, my love.&quot; she smiled.  He smiled back, and sighed at her lovingly.  She was so beautiful, and he loved her more than his own life.<br>
Lenore glanced at her husband while they ate.  His hair had grown a little longer, and he tied part of it back in a leather thong.  The gold embroidered patch was eventually replaced by a plain black one, but he looked no less dashing.  She sighed.  She loved him so much.<br>
<br>
As the last of the breakfast dishes were cleaned and put away, Choco had dressed in plain leather clothing as well.  Lenore suggested they take a walk, maybe stop by the Fool's Gold to visit Blinza.  <br>
As they entered the establishment, Lenore heard a very familiar voice coming from upstairs. <br>
&quot;That sounded like Magpye,&quot; she said to Choco.  <br>
&quot;Yes, it did.  Shall we go see?&quot;  she grinned.  He knew her too well.<br>
&quot;Yes, let's.&quot;<br>
They climbed up the narrow stairs and into a small common room.  And there, at a table with her back to the stairs, was Magpye.  Lenore grinned broadly, and snuck up behind her.  She gently covered the halfling's eyes, and spoke softly.<br>

Magpye had changed.  Gone was the bright-eyed youth she met many years ago, and now here was a seasoned woman.  However, Lenore still glimpsed the flash of innocent wonder in her eyes.  It wasn't totally gone.<br>
&quot;Ah, it is so good to find you here, and such a surprise.  I had been thinking of you lately.&quot;  Lenore said brightly.<br>
Magpye looked at Lenore and noticed a happier look about her.  The last time they met, she had poured out her heart to her, and a sadness was in those beautiful violet eyes.<br>
Lenore ordered some tea for her and Choco, and joined Magpye at the table.<br>
&quot;So, tell me, old friend.  What have you been doing for all these years?&quot;  Lenore asked as she sipped her tea. <p>Lenore Bravehard

These last few seasons I have been exploring up on the moon...such a wonderous place!&quot;<br>
<br>
A brief sadness touched her eyes.  &quot;Many old friends have dropped out of sight over the years,&quot; she said.  &quot;Journeyed to lands unknown, or retired from adventuring, or simply vanished from sight.  Yet I have made many new friends as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have spent many long seasons in the frozen lands of Velious.  Many find the dirfted snows and frozen icey lands there too sere and empty, but I recall my youth in Everfrost and am exhilerated by the bright icey days and the wild wind-driven blizzards.  Iztariani, too, enjoys the calm emptiness of the frozen lands, though Snoww has a rather more...errrr..cosmopolitan nature.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;She is forever badgering us to make journeys elsewhere...the jungles of Kunark, the plains of Karana, the wild mountains of Odus.  And my feet do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> itch</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so, that I must admit it is not that hard for her to be convincing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some times I think of retiring to a quieter life, but then I meet a new companion for a time in my travels, or find a place to explore I've never been before, and the world is a new and interesting place again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magpye flashed a brilliant smile at Lenore and Choco.  &quot;So, tell me, what have you two been up to since last we met?&quot;<br>

Well, most of my journies were personal ones.  At the time we met, I was feeling despair about who I was, as you know about my circumstances, being an orphan and all.  I did manage to find some people to help me on that journey.  Found a grandfather I never knew I had, and lost him to his goddess shortly thereafter.  But I know dear Tunare watches over him now, so I worry not.&quot;  Magpye nodded.  She did remember that conversation well.  While her family life wasn't nearly as lonely,<br>
she really didn't have her parent to talk to, as he always seemed to be absent.<br>
&quot;I like the snowy climes of Velious as well, the stark beauty, and adapting to the harsh conditions of living there.  The city of Thurgadin is most unusual, and beautiful at the same time.  My daughter has recently relocated there for now, so at least she is away from Freeport.  I know she is a grown woman, but she will always be my little girl.  And I worry.  Her lifemate is good for her, and I know he keeps her safe, but I don't trust the militia as far as I can throw them.  Ever since my near execution, I seldom venture there anymore, and it is usually under extremely rare circumstances.&quot;  She shuddered at that distant memory, and Choco placed an arm around her.<br>
She touched his hand, and looked at him to assure him she was fine.<br>
&quot;Well, enough of those gloomy memories.&quot; she said brightly.<br>
&quot;I am glad to see you again, my friend.  Should you happen to see a human wandering around with a big ogre comapnion, you know it is my daughter.&quot;  <p>Lenore Bravehard

<br>
&quot;In Thurgadin I met her...both her and her ogrish friend.  Tis well that dear Gogak taught me not to fear all of ogre-kind many years ago, or I would have been quite terrified by Gug...he is most ferocious looking!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magpye laughed again at Lenore's startled look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, she is how I knew to seek you and Choco here, among my own small kin.  Many a long year has it been since last I visited here...the place teems with memories, and some few of them are painful.  Even the thought of returning to talk with my dear master Reebo has not been enough to lure me back.  But, hearing from Jolene that this was where you now nested, why, Snoww and I packed and travelled here forthwith...twas just last night that the four of us, Jolene and Gug and Snoww and I, lifted glasses together in Thurgadin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do think I will linger here a few days before I leave again,&quot; Magpye added.  &quot;There are as many good memories here as bad.  And I should seek word of my father, I have not heard from him in far too long.  Like my friend Snoww, he is a follower of not strickly legal ways, but, I must admit, he has not her fine touch with things.  I always fear that he will be found out, and imprisoned somewhere for his light-fingered habits.&quot;<br>
<br>
The concerned frown dissapeared from Magpye's face as she smiled at someone behind Lenore's back.<br>

She bowed gracefully to the pair, then slid into one of the small chairs, calling to the bartender for a halfling stouter.<br>

<br>
Around the noon hour, Lenore announced that her and Choco needed to be travelling again.<br>
&quot;We have been here 3 days, and got any supplies we needed, and it is time for us to go.  Oh, it was so wonderful to see you again.&quot;  She hugged Magpye.  It was nice to have friends, but it was special to have ones that mattered in life.<br>

&quot;It was also a pleasure to make your acquaintence, Snoww.&quot;  Lenore said.<br>
&quot;As it was mine, also.&quot;  Snow replied.  Lenore and Choco said their goodbyes and headed out of the tavern.  They made their way back to their little hut, and tidied things up, and dressed back into their normal travelling armor and clothing.<br>
They exited their home, and passed near the tavern as Snoww and Magpye were leaving it.  They said their goodbyes one last time, and Lenore called forth a portal.  Just before her and Choco stepped into it, he scooped Lenore into his arms, much to the amusement of Magpye and Snoww.  Then the portal closed, and all was quiet again. <p>Lenore Bravehard

&quot;Yes, to Halas...&quot; Magpye smiled.  &quot;Iztariani said she'd wait for us there.&quot;<br>
