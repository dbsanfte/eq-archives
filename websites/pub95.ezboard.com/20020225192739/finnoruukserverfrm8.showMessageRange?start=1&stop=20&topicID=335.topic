I don't know if anyone else out there feels the same way, and I couldn't really care less...but it will probably make me feel better to vent about it.<br><br>I really really really can't stand bandwagoning.  I'm sure there's probably a better word or phrase for what I'm talking about, but it escapes me at the moment.  Lets take the Lord of the Rings Trilogy for example:  In the wake of the movie release, all of a sudden there are Tolkien fans and self-proclaimed experts springing from the woodwork.  Everyone has to get their 2 cents in and one-up each other to prove that he or she knows more about Tolkien books than the next guy.  Even more disgustingly, every bookstore on the planet is wielding colorful LoTR picture books in the front windows, capitalizing on the rage.  I'm sure you'll see plenty of mass-produced &quot;collectors items&quot; like Aragorn action figures or super-sized Frodo beverage cups from Burger King (or whichever fast-food chain has signed on to endorse the movie).  And all the little human sheep flock to purchase them.  Collect all 5!!!!  woohooo!<br><br>The same phenomenon occurs all the time.  How many people had actually heard Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; before the movie Wayne's World?  Guess what!  It was written in the 70s!  I'd be willing to bet Queen had even forgotten about it until Wayne and Garth, MTV, and Blockbuster Video brought it into everyones living room again.  I can remember a day when comic store cashiers would scratch their heads when I asked for Magic: The Gathering booster packs.  Now there's 170238092384 different expansions with a billion different cards that just confuse what used to be a pretty fun game. The Magic rage has died out quite a bit, to be sure...but it only died for me because it was cheapened by the masses.  <br>Once the junior high kids get ahold of it, its all over.  Some rare fun or creativity appreciated fully by a select few slowly depreciates into fake plastic crap overrun and overproduced by John Q. Public. It gets boring faster than last years Christmas presents. My words are not effectively conveying what I'm trying to say...this probably seems a bit rambling and disconnected.<br><br>I see this bandwagoning or mainstreaming happen a lot with art, music, movies, books, games, and lots of other forms of creativity, and it pains me.  The same thing happens in Everquest, to an extent.  It used to be a rare treat for me to even fight down to the frenzied ghoul in lower guk.  Now you gotta get on a list to even be allowed to sit in there.  Maiden's Eye was pretty interesting when only like 12 people were in the zone.  Now its overcamped and overpopulated.  My guild used to chat about what a great thing it would be to someday go on a Plane raid, as if we'd all be dead before it actually happened.  Seems now that we can actually do it, its passe and commonplace.  Nevermind that someone else has usually saved us the hassle by clearing the plane out ahead of us.<br><br>Last summer I saw Bob Dylan appear at a music festival thing where I live.  Now if you've ever seen Dylan perform before, you have a general idea what to expect.  He doesn't sound very good.  Chances are high that you wouldn't even recognize him singing &quot;Knockin on Heaven's Door&quot; until the chorus.  I went there knowing this, but was still excited to see him in living color in front of me.  I mean, up there 10 feet in front of me stood what I perceive to be the single greatest poet/songwriter of the 20th century, and everywhere around me a bunch of bloodshot and drunken college kids smoking weed and looking bored.  Sure, I suppose from a certain point of view its just and proper to burn one in honor of the man who gave us &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35,&quot; but it seemed to me that they all missed the point.  After Dylan's 3rd or 4th song most of the crowd walked away, more interested in seeing Creed or something.  All that was left at the end of his set were some dizzied hippie chicks that had been spinning around endlessly in their handmade corduroy dresses, (presumably for the accompanying head rush) and a scattered assortment of thick-bearded Harley biker dudes who turned out to be the only other ones that gave a damn.<br><br>Maybe I'm just a misanthrope.  Yeah thats it.  I hate people.  There's waaaay too many of you, and over the course of time, you make things suck.  It is in your nature to do so. I have reduced you all to mindless automatic consumers of all things good.  You are the looters and usurpers that Ayn Rand spoke of in the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.  You are the Langoliers of Stephen King. You're hellbent on making our world quite like the Camazotz of Madeline L'Engle. (I'm sure you've all read those by now right!  Yeah I knew it!  You're cool like that!  You and the guy living next door to you!)<br><br>I know its pointless to babble on about this.  Its paradox and/or catch-22ish, (I never fully understood the difference) because I'm sitting here becoming what I loathe by further propagating popular culture.  <br><br>Anyway, quickly, someone convince me that the world doesn't suck, please.

After that, everyone is wearing and displaying patriotic symbols, some going to extremes.  Now, before this attack you really never saw many people with American flags on the cars, and hanging on houses.  Then, the attack, and now everyone is doing it.  I don't consider that to be a bandwagon so I don't think the Lord of the Rings phenomenon is either.<br><br>It kinda compares to the Star Wars, people were out buying new action figures and clothes, etc. because they are available.  Everyone just wants their own cut of the momentos and flashy decorations for many many different reasons. <br><br>Other people now have the opportunity to go back in time and talk about and discuss a story that meant alot to them, and now with the movie to compare it to and with, people will always debate and talk about the movie and the book.<br><br>As far as one-upping?  I am sure that some people are doing it for that reason, but who really cares?

If the world sucked you never would have had Dylan in the first place.  The Lord of the Rings never would have been written.

I had a Star Wars T-shirt as a little kid and I loved it, and even one of those Han Solo-blasters that made the screeching noise when you pulled the trigger.  Very cool at the time.  I guess now it seems to me that the stuff is being forced down our collective throats by the Agents of Good Marketing rather than through our own interest.  &quot;You are getting very sleepy, you feel your eyes getting heavy, you will buy the Aragorn action figure only $2.99 with purchase of any combo meal, at the count of 3 you will be completely asleep.....&quot;<br><br>like i said, bandwagon isn't really the right word.  I can't find a better one though.  I think its capitalism run amok, along with a healthy dose of Borg-like collective thinking.<br><br>As far as American flags go...it doesn't even compare imo.  Its a matter of pride rather than market competition or the bandwagon factor. Its a national symbol not a fad.  But i'm sure the makers of flags and automobile stickers are laughing all the way to the bank.  It makes me only slightly ill.  My sig line:  &quot;Radix malorem est cupiditas&quot;...from Chaucer's &quot;The Pardoner's Tale&quot;...loosely translated means &quot;the root of evil is greed.&quot;  I'm sure part of the flag thing is suppliers keeping up with demand, which is honorable enough in and of itself...but I think there's also a greed factor.  There's an awful lot of cheapo knockoff flags being mass produced out there.  /em looks around for the Made in China label on the back.  Just check your local Arab-operated convenient store counter.  <br><br>I suppose the free enterprise system doesn't provide for free flags and bumper stickers for Americans.  If that were the case, the flag in question would probably bear a hammer and a scythe.  Anyway I guess its a matter of how you feel about it, nevermind what anyone else thinks.  If you're waving the flag for the right reasons, then more power to you.  To me, the American flag is a reminder of people who died protecting the freedoms I enjoy daily.  But if you're waving it to drum up buzz for your flag-making business, or to draw attention away from your not-so-legal immigrant status, then you're the scum I'm raving about.<br><br>...and no, I don't feel as though I'm being one-upped.  The whole reverse-psychology thing doesn't work here.  I don't think I injected enough controversy into my initial LoTR editorial to spark any flames.

How many people had actually heard Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; before the movie Wayne's World? Guess what! It was written in the 70s! I'd be willing to bet Queen had even forgotten about it until Wayne and Garth, MTV, and Blockbuster Video brought it into everyones living room again. &quot;<br><br>I didn't hear Bohemian Rhapsody till the Mt.Dew commercial(I did hear it on Waynes world but I can't remember i was too young).Why?Because I never heard of queen really before theres lots of  &quot;old&quot; songs I don't know who did because I don't really look it up and I don't hear it all the time.So what if Bohemian Rhapsody was played on WW it let some other people hear it and then they might like queen.<br><br>&quot;I can remember a day when comic store cashiers would scratch their heads when I asked for Magic: The Gathering booster packs. Now there's 170238092384 different expansions with a billion different cards that just confuse what used to be a pretty fun game.
