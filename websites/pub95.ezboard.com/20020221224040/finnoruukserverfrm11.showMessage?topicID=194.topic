Besides, some soft hearted, but spineless  moderator is threatening me for posting in other threads.<br>
<br>
1) So to start, why do we care?  Reality is that people die every day.  Lots of them.  Hundreds of them even if it's a slow day.  The passing of someone we've come to know brings it home to us.  Again I will say, it's appropriate on a board about a game to lament how much we will miss these people.  It's something completely different to talk about how much someone's passing affects us when we never interacted with that person.  How many funerals went on around the world today?  How come I don't see posts about people talking about how much they will miss the former Mr. X?  How many people knew the now infamous Camillia on Innoruuk?  Wow, that many people knew someone who didn't play on this server?  How many other young women died in a similar situation in the same week?  Ah, you don't know off of the top of your head.  But yet you care and I don't if I read your responses correctly.  How many of you expressing sorrow on these posts went to the funeral or got in contact with the families?  For those who were personally involved, yeah it sucks.  And I do understand your pain.  But I didn't see anyone talking about how much they missed that person.  I just see people coming on here trying to tell me how much they care because they read some news story.  What universal truth about this am I missing?<br>
<br>
It's simple as far as I can see.  When Mr. X dies, you don't know about him.  You don't care about him (no matter how hard you pretend).  Maybe Mr. X put up with several months of excruciating pain.  But you don't know him, so you don't eulogize him.  How many innocent children went to bed battered tonight?  Well, if we don't know them, then to us they don't exist do they?  How many of you soft-hearted people hung around the cemetary today to console those who lost a loved one?  People who have no problem spending nearly every waking hour away from work playing a game on their PC's come on these boards and they're a cross between Mother Teresa and the Pope (uggh, what a picture, gonna be hard to sleep tonight, do you think a cross would be the Mother Superior as a Hermaphrodite, or the Pope with breasts?).  I never saw any of you at the funerals I went to.  Yet you expect me to break down and cry over someone that I never interacted with?  <br>
<br>
Tell me how I should care because we are human beings and I'll throw the names of those who died today in your face and ask you what you have done to ease the burden upon his or hers loved ones.  For those of you unaccustomed to loss, yes, it is hard.  But you learn to deal with it, it's not always as hard as it is at first, it will get better.  For those of you have lived it, perhaps you understand me.  I know some of you are gonna come on here and tell me what a saint you are.  Why didn't you save these people then?<br>
<br>
How many posts are there on these boards defending people being brutalized across the world, in our backyards and our neighborhoods?  Oh I see, YOU didn't know them personally.  So that makes their lives meaningless?  So that's the way it is, is it?  You care when I bring up an example, you say.  If you really cared, you wouldn't need me.  You would already care.  If the people on these boards mourning really had the love of life in their hearts, there would be no one person to mourn, they would be in mourning constantly for those who have died untimely.  But yet if I point that out I'm the heartless one.  Kill the messenger, and go back to your rose-colored world.  Who got murdered in LA or Chicago today that you cried for?  And yet somehow if I don't mourn the people you know, then I am the bad one.  <br>
<br>
I remember reading about some Internet scams where someone claimed to be dying, or had died.  They got tens of thousands of letters from people talking about how traumatized they were over it.  People talking about how they couldn't sleep or eat properly.  All over someone who didn't even exist.   <br>
<br>
There is one saying that I find appropriate here.  When we cry over someone's passing, we do not cry for them.  They are beyond feeling the pain and suffering of this world.  We cry for ourselves because we are weak and we will miss them.  But to say we are crying for the dead is a lie, because they aren't crying anymore, they are a hell of a lot better off then all of the people they left behind.  Or so they indicate at least.<br>
<br>
So go ahead and tell me &quot;Oh Ugle, you need therapy, you are such a bad person, maybe with a lot of work you can be a decent human being&quot;.  I don't see it that way.  I would like to think that I'm somewhat informed in what is really happening, and I have chosen my particular way to deal with this reality.  I criticize those people who tell me I should care more while they sit at home in front of their PC.  If you truly cared you wouldn't have time to play this game.  With all of the conflict going on in this world, this game is truly insignificant.  I'm pis sed at myself that it took this time completely away from the game with no chance of going back to realize it.  Maybe you somewhat care and do some work to help others.  But I feel confident in saying the majority of those who choose to flame me won't even do that much.  Or should I just stick my head in the sand with the majority of you?  That's the ticket, I'll just pretend that nobody is suffering anywhere in the world until it happens to someone I know, then I'll express outrage at how cruel the world is.  Nah, that would suck too.  I don't pretend to care, and my words emphasize that point.  I see too many people coming on claiming they care, and yet their (in)actions speak so loud I can't hear their words.<br>
<br>
BTW Sowl, very nice post you had, and the majority of the posts about it.  Very nicely worded, and very positive.  I remember when one of Chrisiana's family members gave me a tell in game about her passing.  I had to log immediately and couldn't play for a couple days.  It's funny how attached we can get to a virtual someone we meet.  It's not that I was never able to care, it's just that I can't care about someone I don't know, because if I did, considering the amount of death in this world, I wouldn't be able to function.  I'm sure if he had been a friend to me like he was to you Sowl I would feel differently.  <br>
<br>
But there are other threads I'm seeing inviting everyone into their pity party.  On the one hand I must say I enjoy seeing these posts.  It's like in the old days when people competed to see who could pray the loudest to prove how devout they were.  That's fallen out of favor over the last several hundred years, but it's nice to see things coming back full circle.  What was the point about starting a thread on the Innoruuk message boards about someone who didn't even play on this server?  From my jaded perspective it just looks like a way for people to come on here and tell us all how much they care.  And I must say I can't really see any coherent posts that would argue with that point of view.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) It must be nice to live in the world most of the people posting here seem to live in.  So let's be blunt.  Someone who is evil doesn't rawp someone else.  They don't have to murder someone.  Such petty displays of human lusts are signs of weakness.  And someone who is truly evil would never kill themselves because of something they have done.  Why would someone who is evil kill themselves over something that would have caused them no sorrow?  Sacrificial killings might qualify, as they were done for a purpose.  But killing someone in anger most definitely does not make the murderer truly evil.<br>
<br>
Does that make them someone who does these things a good person?  Hell no.  That makes them a wicked animal who should have vengeance poured on them in ways most people would hesitate to perform.  But does that make them evil?<br>
<br>
Read up on some of the horribly cruel people whose names have endured because of what they did.  Evil people?  Most likely not.  Petty, vindictive, cruel, hateful people most likely.  But evil?  Hardly.  If you abused a child would I consider you evil?  Do you feel a twinge at your conscience?  Then you aren't completely evil.  I might be tempted to take you out in the woods and fill the short remainder of your life with pain and suffering somewhat comparable to what you have inflicted on that innocent.  Perhaps when I have fully become I won't really care anymore.<br>
<br>
But I still do.  Hell, I still tear up when I hear the National Anthem.  I still have trouble watching &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;.  But yet I am &quot;evil&quot; in some eyes because I don't care about someone who meant nothing to me.  True evil is not about petty pleasures of the flesh.  &quot;Goodness&quot; isn't about how much you care about poor Sally.  Goodness is someone who cares about all people AND DOES SOMETHING TO HELP THEM.  Coming on these boards talking about how much you care just makes you a mugwump.  But that's great news for the opposition, because for all of the talk and intentions, it means you haven't chosen a side.  I'm not coming on here claiming to be good, I would have no right to make that claim, even if I wanted to.  <br>
<br>
Hey, wait a minute Ugle, I'm someone who cares, you must just suck Ugle.  No, you're not.  You're someone who wants to believe they care to make themselves feel better.  But yet the majority of the posters here who comment on the people who have done these heinous acts call these people evil.  I suppose if you can go to church once a week and call yourself a religious person, then to your warped idea of absolutes those people qualify as evil.  True evil is not about petty pleasures of the flesh.  It's not about power or money.  It's about hatred of the species known as Homo Sapiens, and bringing about their downfall.  As such, the people I'm seeing on these boards being called evil fall far, far, short of that mark. <br>

This should be fun, I had people who seemed to be frothing at the mouth telling me I needed to read Bible for myself over a post about SANTA CLAUS, so it should be fun to see the responses. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unatallia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natallia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/16/02 11:34:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fnurt.net/~alex/pics/ebay.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> What was your point again?<br>

It's not ok to express sympathy for someone you shared a common hobby, pastime with?  There was nothing in any of those threads that invited the kind of rhetoric you spewed yet you did it anyway so how does that make you any better than them?<br>
Very few people can be so passionate about something that it will exclude all else.  The local @#%$ crisis coordinator likes to read in her spare time, the grief counselor likes to water ski etc.  So what if we play Everquest AND show outrage that a girl was molested and shot to death by her father.  I'm pretty fricken outraged by it, I'm outraged by alot of things that happen in this world.  You for example have pissed me off pretty good today starting with your rant in a highly inappropriate place.  Try going to a funeral parlor where half the attendees barely knew the deceased and try this line of garbage and I'll post a message here hoping you get well soon.<br>
Any time a child dies, any child I'm affected, I even cry you see it reminds me of my own child who passed away.  Got a problem with that too?  I was actively involved in the organization that fights the cause of my daughters death and I still maintain an active interest in their activities.  As a result of my daughters death I almost lost my marriage, now I'm actively involved in an organization that helps people save their marriages.  You have no concept of what anyone here does yet you make sweeping statements about how shallow and superficial we are playing a Game and daring to make RL comments on the Game boards.  You tell us how smart you are all the time but man you must be a genius to know what we all do and think without so much as meeting us.<br>
It's your self righteous attitude that irks me not your opinions.  I'll even go out there on your limb and say I agree with you on most of your points.  People in this country do need to do more, myself included.  People also need better manners (put yourself in this category).  <br>
I could care less if you believe in Santy, or God, or Ronald McDonald good for you either way.  But I do care when you show blatant disrespect for someone's passing on a thread that was simply meant to show sympathy.  You ever go to a funeral or a wedding where some kids mess up the guest book for fun?  That is what you did. <br>

So many people here seem to be Robin Williams in &quot;Hook&quot; before he remembered how to fly.  Too many of you seem to have forgotten how to skip.<br>
<br>
I think it's virtually impossible to have anger or fear in your heart, when you are skipping down the road, one of your children holding on to each hand, belting out the Power Rangers theme.  A real shame is the fact that in order to get bubble-gum flavored toothpaste, I have to get a tube with Barney on it, who promotes Pagan practices by singing and doing chants to make Magick happen.  Gee, you're pissed at me for ranting in a Forum created for a game in which we kill Bixies with Maces and Swords.  Go ahead, keep your heart filled with hatred and anger.  I choose not to.<br>
<br>
Lal, where was your post about all the other people who used to play EQ that have died in the past?  Why does this person deserve more compassion then any of the others?  There may have been others who had similar things happen.  I'm NOT calling people out for showing compassion to this person.  I'm calling them out for NOT showing compassion to any of the others, if you can call posting on a message board a sign of true compassion.<br>
<br>
If someone comes up to me and says &quot;Your mother is so fat then when she comes over the hill in her yellow raincoat, it looks like the Sun coming up&quot;, should I rip their throat out with my teeth (dam, now I'm hungry)?  Naw, I'll just chuckle and move on.  I love my mother and would give my life for hers without hesitation.  But I'm not so small-minded that I'm going to get all bent over it.  Somehow I have this really bizarre, wicked, twisted idea that life is about living.  So I try to enjoy myself, and go to sleep at night with a smile on my face.  It must suck to go to bed with such heavy hearts and stresses as I see from people's attitudes here.  <br>
<br>
Think of this poor girl this way.  Do we cry when someone we don't know wins the Lottery?  Do we cry when someone we don't know gets a huge raise?  Why would we feel sorrow for someone who is far, far happier now then she was a few weeks ago?  I am not condoning killing people who have problems, and think those who commit these crimes should be punished far more severely then they are.  But I can't grieve over someone who I never knew so I won't miss, and someone who's better off now then they were.  It must be awful to have that weight on your heart and mind.  Guess life sucks for you heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uizlaaru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izlaaru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 11:43:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/candon/izlaarusmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> Ugle:<br>

Your opinion is your own, and may be shared by others.. BUT<br>
<br>
Most people tend to like to show respect to people that have past on.  Me personally, weather I reply to the post or not (on the net) I will still bow my head in respect when a death is brought to my attention.. weather I know the person, love the person, hate the person or whatever.  I personally know very few people in person that play this game, but when I hear that one of them has died, it touches me.<br>
<br>
Everyone deals with Death differently, please don't criticize people for the way they try to show their respect to their fellow human beings.<br>

I'm trying to follow where you're going here.  There's a lot to absorb.  Unfortunately, you force me to be a mugwump on what you contend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not &quot;outraged&quot; by your opinion.  I'm just not sure how your outrage at people's outrage or sadness is any more relevant than theirs?  I chose to view your opinions with no anger.  I sometimes think you split your hairs a lot more microscopically than most, certainly more than I am willing to.  But, I fully respect that your personal opinions, beliefs, and feelings belong to you, and far be it from me to tell you they are &quot;wrong&quot;.  Perhaps that's the only inherent difference I have with you.<br>
<br>
Does someone have the right to feel compassion for another human being's pain, even if they didn't know them personally?  Do they have the right to be outraged at the senseless death of another human being, even if they didn't know them personally?  I'd have to say about as much right as you do to be outraged that they do.  Note, I did NOT say more.  I hesitate to judge your subjective feelings about this, your motivation to feel outrage, or even question any &quot;hidden agenda&quot; that causes your outrage.  That is where our opinions part ways.<br>
<br>
I see a car hit someone's dog on the road.  Do I feel sad for the family who lost their pet?  Well, yeah.  Do I feel the sadness as much as if it were my own dog, Sparky?  Well, no.  A co-worker's Mom dies after a long, protracted illness.  Am I saddened?  Well, yes.  My best friend's Mom dies after a long, protracted illness.  Am I saddened?  Well, yes.  Perhaps more because it is my friend's Mom?  Perhaps even more because I knew their Mom personally?  Well, yes.  My Mom dies in the same way?  A different level of sadness?  Well, yes.  Are any of the three feelings any less valid because of my varied personal involvement?  You seem to be saying yes.  Is it a further stretch to feel a differing sadness because we share a common interest?  I don't feel suitably qualified to make that kind of judgement.  Understand, I don't recall giving you the right to validate or invalidate my subjective emotions about any event.  For the same reason, I won't judge your feeling about other's feelings.<br>
<br>
I totally agree with you about the sadness about death.  If someone subscribes to any of the myriad religious beliefs in the world, the person who has died has moved on to another, better place.  Hell(pun intended), even the true nihilist will admit that the dead no longer exist, and can not be touched by the pain and suffering in the world we inhabit.  We don't mourn for the dead, we mourn for those who still live, for ourselves.  You can argue that this is entirely selfish, IMHO it is.  I can't go so far as to say it's wrong.  For most of us mere mortals, death is the big meany at the end of the line.  There, but for the grace of God, go I?  Is this a bad thing?  Are we all evil, because this is true?  I don't think I am qualified to make that judgement, simply because I am mortal.  Yes, Ugle, somewhere in our heart of hearts, we are all saying &quot;I'm really glad it isn't me&quot;.  Your point?<br>
<br>
I think if you'll come up with a list of every EQ player who has died and post it here, you'll get many, many posts of sadness for each.  If you make me AWARE of each and every one, I will post, and it will be heartfelt.  Are you qualified to say mine, or each and every post, would not be?  I'm not.  Am I aware that almost every minute, maybe every second, of every day, someone in the world dies senselessly, or suffers needlessly?   Well, uh, yeah.  If you're expecting me to absorb all that constantly, feel that every moment, sorry.  Next thing I'll be painting my house black and closing the shades.  Yep, every one of us could do more to stop it.  Do we?  By and large, Nope.  We all get centered on our own problems, our own tunnel vision, our own very limited lives.  Contrary to popular belief, growing into consciousness is a filtering process, not an expansion.  Is this wrong?  Probably?  Guilty as charged.  Sue me.  I admit it.  Mother Teresa had to work without me.  I do what I can when I can.  Whether you are aware of that, or believe that, is not relevant, to me.  I will not find fault with whatever opinion you have about that.  <br>
<br>
I don't doubt that the truly evil are never seen by any of us.  This paricular father?  Hmmm, was he abused as a child?  Egg or the chicken? I would pull the switch gladly, with absolutely no anger, and get a good night's sleep.  Does that make me evil?  I don't know.  I simply don't want to live on the same planet as someone who would do this.  I can rationalize that I'd be ending the chain of abuse, even that I am ending his &quot;tortured life&quot;, but that would be defending my own subjective feelings about evil and good.  Until someone lays the ABSOLUTE Ultimate Truth on me, I'll go with my own feelings.  I think I'll go with Thoreau on that.  On his deathbed, he was asked if he if he'd made peace with his maker.  He replied, &quot;I hadn't realized we'd quarreled?&quot;.  I choose to go with my personal feelings about what is evil, and what is good.  I find it preferable to being ammoral, and not being willing to decide for myself.  I truly hope that, in the end, some power more able to judge will clue me in on whether I was correct or not.  I doubt that will be you, Ugle.  But, I may be wrong?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeah right, thats why you posted your diatribe in a thread meant to convey sympathy.  Cast no stones Ugle and I won't pick them up and throw them back.  Truth is I am not filled with hate and anger I have two living children and I know exactly what you mean about the joy of being with your children.  My issue isn't with what was said but rather with your choice of forum.  It's called respect and I just believe you should respect the deceased regardless of your personal opinions.<br>
I don't get holding people accountable for what they DON'T do either.  By your standard if I want to express sympathy I have to do it for everyone?  Thats alot of sympathy.  So I guess that explains why you can't show any because no one can live up to your standard including yourself.<br>
I'm glad you have such a prosaic view on life that you go to bed happy every night too.  So if you truly live by that philosophy why dump on other people does it make you happy?  I don't go to bed happy every night but I don't go to bed pissed every night either and you know what that makes me?  Normal.

<br>
<br>
I have 4 children been in the battered womens shelter and been other places I dont care to talk about anymore....<br>
I have since then DONE my part for society in that manner and raising 4 children to be productive memebers of society is a tough job in itself.... <br>
<br>
The only thing that was offensive to me with ugle's posts was saying that we are all basicly lazy cause we play EQ all the time and hide from what society is doin around us.... I play EQ to talk with my friends that I have made here and get lost in a fantasy world from a world I have been in all day dealing with low life scum like this man that did this Camelia.... So I do my part all I was saying is that Ugle needs to not turn this into a post of ranting on why we are wasting our time in EQ and not on the streets ridding the world of low life scum... I for one am Not SUPERMAN but with all of us looking a bit closer at what is goin around us yes we can all make a difference... I just dont want to be told im wasting my time playing EQ cause I deserve my time I play...... as do alot of others... <br>
<br>
Ugle you would be surprised at what RL Classes we have playing this game... Did u know there are @#%$ Detectives playing this game that deal with it on a Daily basis... did u know we have school teachers that play this game that are raising our children with us on a daily basis did u know that there are Attorneys that play this game that are locking up the low life scum? ETC ETC....<br>
<br>
All Im saying is that your generalization really makes alot of mad that DO a part and yes your right if ONE person wakes up that isnt doin there part with keeping there eyes open then your post was worth it but please dont make me lock this thread start a new one for this discussion and leave this thread alone for the Condolences That is all Im asking....<br>

First what exactly does it take to know someone at least enough to call them a friend? <br>
 If it is solely by personal contact then maybe you would have a point, but then that would exclude anyone who has had a pen-pal, been stuck in BFE alaska and whos only contact was using a ham radio, or anyone else who was unable due to circumstances to contact that other person in person, but would any one you passed on the street and said hello, or a neighbor you see once maybe twice a week but only when they are mowing the lawn or picking up the newspaper.<br>
 Relationships do not have to be in person in order to have meaning and their are various levels in relationships, any and all relationships. Personally I mourn for those who I knew either casually or intimatly because they have affected my life to a certain degree and that seems to have been the case with some of the people here. Their relationship with the young lady may have been quite extensive, you really don't know yet you seem to believe that somehow you are morally superior to them at least by the tone of your posts, your not.<br>
 As for the existance of evil in individuals, yea there is. How can I make this outrageous (to you) statement, well having had an extremely abusive step-father might be a start but thats not quite enough, I have seen the horrors that man has done to his fellow man up close and personal and much to the blight on my own soul have been a part of that evil. Ever killed someone and felt sheer joy at the act? I did while in the service of my country on more occasions than I wish to remember, the only thing that might help to have atoned for some of that was nailing an allied officer in the shoulder as he was trying to lay waste to about 8 kids under 7 years old solely because of their race. He certainly had no regrets for the attempt and only regretted that he was stopped. If you really want to know evil and at the same time try to aid the rest of the world then I would suggest you join the armed forces, my rec is that you try for marines (force recon/sniper) or army (rangers/sniper/black beret... oops they dont really exist anymore.... right). <br>
 I agree with you that more people should do what they can to make the world a better place but disagree that because they care about someone that they know only from cyberspace they are somehow hippocritical emotionally.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 5:27:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   actually RE: to another thread but Pali said to move it here</span><hr size=1> Apollohades, you are the rude one for not reading the whole thing.

As I said, when I found out someone that I only knew from EQ passed away, I felt sorrow and loss.  I felt Sowl's post about his friend that he would miss in this game was very touching.  But Sowl had interacted with this person, and I agree with you Brogun, that you don't have to have personal, physical contact with someone to become attached to them.  I didn't see any posts from someone who knew her casually OR intimately.  If one of those conditions applied then for me to comment on that persons feelings was at a minimum in extremely poor taste, and I apologize.  But from what I saw, it was people who read the news clipping, found out that she played EQ, and somehow felt that now thier lives were changed.  My post was about those who would not have known she had died, or the circumstances of her life without seeing that newspaper clipping.  Perhaps their lives did change, but it boggles my mind that a news clipping of one person could do that, especially when you can find a similar story in any major newspaper pretty much any day of the week.  It might not always be above the fold as they say, but it's in there.  Brogun, which post in that original thread should I look at to see someone who knew this person, I'd be just fine with you showing me so that you can prove your point?<br>
<br>
As far as the military, I'm too complacent now to take the cut in pay and the workload.  Kinda struck me as odd though, those fellow Infantry soldiers I knew who had gone to combat didn't feel any joy in killing someone else, I can't say any of them described enjoying it as you had.  I'm not sure what your point was about learning about evil by joining the armed forces.  As an NCO on active duty and in positions up to PSG in my Guard Unit, I always found that the military did not allow the kind of evil that I am talking about.  Yes, up to a certain extent I guess I can understand, you are in an area with automatic weapons and the ability to leave a place with no witnesses.  But then again, you have a more likely chance of someone finding out what you had done there then you would have if you waxed a few Wino's in a major city.  If I were to go back I'd probably get my stripes back and go SF personally.  Most of the people I saw who had a few years in one of the Batts end up barely able to walk from all of the abuse they put on their bodies.<br>
<br>
And for all of you bleeding hearts asking me what I have done for me to criticize you.  I'm not coming in here talking about how much I care for my fellow man.  As I've said before, I really don't care about those who are not part of my life.  So my inactions would back up my words more then most people's actions in this matter would back them up.  That doesn't mean as I'm sure most of you assume that I am a rude person to those I meet.  But it means I won't lose any sleep because someone I've never met will die in a car crash tonight.  Show me someone who has been damaged physically or emotionally, and I become a basket case.  Show me a newspaper clipping and I'll use it to start a fire with.  I don't *think* I don't have any compassion, I just don't have enough energy to show compassion for every single person that I can read about in print.  Frankly, you could spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week reading obituaries and newspaper articles about the cruelty inflicted by man.  I'd prefer to do something more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Now back to my favorite punching bag.  I agree, I have no problem throwing stones, and I have no problem picking up the ones thrown at me and throwing them back.  My feelings aren't hurt by your words, yet you act like mine hurt yours.  Respect the deceased.  May I ask why?  None of the other posters in here showed any respect for her Father.  Does he deserve any?  Not that I can see.  But yet I need to show him respect?  For all we know (and I'm only using this as an example), this girl for her part molested other children, set fires, stole cars, committed assaults, etc.  That's the problem with a news story, people jump on certain aspects without knowing the whole truth.  That's a big part of why I can't respect the deceased without knowing them in some way.  And why I can say I don't feel loss when they are gone.  How many people are going to see the men in Black Hawk down as heroes, and get attached to one of the main characters, whose real life model is in jail still I believe for crimes involving children?  Yet how many people who will see that movie will know that?<br>
<br>
Holding people accountable for what they don't do?  Someone posted about stopping some scumbag from @#%$ a girl.  So if I stood by and watched, maybe took some pictures and a few notes that would be ok by you?  Brogun talked about protecting some innocents from someone in a blood lust.  If he had stood by that would be ok by you?  Do you get it now or do I need to draw a picture?  Inaction in some cases is the same as condoning or participating in someone else's actions.  If you hear your neighbor beating his wife or child, and you do nothing, then you are allowing him to do that, and yes, in my book that only makes you marginally better then him.  If you see a person at work who is obviously depressed, do you at least say &quot;Hey, how's it going&quot;?  For every Shintou who cries out for attention, there's probably at least another hundred people who could have a great day if someone just sat and talked with them for five minutes.  It's those people who will just sit and pass by that person day in and day out, until one day that person isn't there anymore that I blast for what they don't do.  At least I'll call them on their inactions when they try to tell me how compassionate and what a great person they are.<br>
<br>
Somehow life sucks for me because I don't feel personal pain for every wrong done by one human to another.  As I've pointed out many times Lal, you don't either.  You claim to feel pain when you read about someone you don't know.  Yet you feel no pain for that person until it's brought to your attention.  So then is it a fair comparison for a Christian to say that Jesus didn't love someone until he met them?  Tell me how you feel about the two children that died in my city last night because of some jerk-off drunk driver.<br>
<br>
Pal, I have to laugh about one of your comments.  You talk about school teacher playing this game.  I remember one of my good jousts with DoW members in the past.  It was a post from someone talking about how I shouldn't make fun of their guild because it had good people in it like himself, as a school teacher.  Of course, his post was absolutely filled with typos, poor grammer, in all honesty my 11 year old would have gotten an &quot;F&quot; on any report she turned in looking that bad.  Detectives playing this game eh?  Sorry, known too many cops for that to make me think that just being a Police Officer makes them a good person.  That's like saying I need to respect Jack Kevorkian since he's a doctor, or saying that I need to respect Charles Manson because he's a religious leader. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugamiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 6:12:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> All those words, Ugle... and, in the end, you answered your own question:<br>
<br>
&quot;It's funny how attached we can get to a virtual someone we meet. It's not that I was never able to care, it's just that I can't care about someone I don't know, because if I did, considering the amount of death in this world, I wouldn't be able to function.&quot;<br>
<br>
So much of 'life' has become a numbing reminder of the insanity, the cruelty, the total callous disregard of people to one another. Its played out every day in a million different ways... in the calm, deliberate baiting of the 'nerd' at the local high school, in the political and malicious undermining that happens at certain levels in the 'corporate world', in the neighborhood parking lot where two complete strangers fling curses and gesticulations at one another over a 10 x 12 piece of asphalt, and so on and so forth until anyone who wants to keep their sanity just shuts it all off... pulls the curtain of obliviousness tighter around their mind.... or goes to the gym and works it out in repeatative exercise... or closes the doors, turns off the lights and chooses to be lost in their partner... or ... well... half a bah-zillion things that all equate to 'thinking of something else'... up to and including coming to play and escape in a virtual world.<br>
<br>
It isn't that one death is more or less a loss than another. It isn't even that we 'judge' a death and rank it with some 'official degree of horror' that makes it more important than some other death. Its simply that, on occasion, death sneaks up on us... catches us unaware... in a place or a way we weren't expecting... at a time when we were fairly certain we'd managed to find a single point of escape within which nothing could intrude. <br>
<br>
When this happens, and all our awareness is turned full on to death, or horror, or tragedy -- we either choose to acknowledge its impact upon us as people who live in a world where escaping it is *work* or we tells ourselves it doesn't affect us and sweep it under the rug of the impersonal... but however we choose to handle it, it is never less than a coping mechanism. <br>
<br>
To each their own.  <p><HR><BR>

I highly doubt anyone on these boards will ever see this happen again.  Gamiene, I really can't find a single thing to criticize about your post.  I'm trying, really I am, but I can't.<br>
<br>
I've also had a really hard time understanding a couple people's posts.  At least one person posted that I was a bit abrasive in how I posted, but that I had a point and hopefully people would open their eyes, take a look around, and maybe make a difference in someone else's life.  Then I see the posts from these people I offended talking about how they spend their lives working in abused women's shelters and such.  Seeing so many people for whom even a small intervention in the past could have helped this person.  But do these posters latch onto the most important part of my posts, about how people overall could be doing more to help their fellow person?  NOOOOOO, they post about how dare I insult them, look at all the good they do.  Which really only leaves me one conclusion.  That defending their pride is more important then trying to get people to look around and help someone else who might be in need.  Yeah, that's a brutal conclusion.  But re-reading your posts, I can't come up with any other.<br>
<br>
If I had posted in the thread something along the lines of &quot;Sad story, too bad more people don't intervene when they can&quot;, who would that have made an impact on?  How many followup posts would that have caused from people saying the same thing?  None most likely.  But I seem to have some people's attention now.<br>
<br>
Ever deal with hysterical people?  Someone really, really scared or excited?  Talking to them nicely, saying &quot;Please calm down.  Calm down please&quot;, doesn't do jack.  If someone's really hysterical, you slap them.  Not hard enough to do serious injury.  But until you shock their system, you can't get through to them.  So I slapped this community.  Some of you are slapping me back.  Others are listening.  I hope so, and not for my sake, because I honestly couldn't care less if you like me or not.  But because I'm very tired of seeing these stories over and over, whether it affects me emotionally or not.<br>
<br>
Pal, my comments were not only meant to make a point that we could do more as a society, it was also meant to point out people's hypocrisies.  If I talk about something I did to help someone, all that would be doing is trying to impress you with what a great guy I am.  The point isn't what I have done to help people, the point is what could each of you be doing to help someone.  I don't care if you're singlehandedly pulling a family from a burning building or giving someone a smile or a hug on the street who looks like they could use one.  But I do hope that the thought will at least cross more people's minds the next time they see someone who could use a hand or some comfort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoderrybadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oderry Badgerclaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 7:58:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clanbadgerclaw.homestead.com/files/face.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> I'm trying to understand your point of view Ugle... without reading all of this stuff, cause I'm way too tired for it atm. <br>
<br>
Someone people died. I don't know who they were. I read the newspaper sometimes, more people died. That's sad to here about. Sometimes I will open my heart and talk about it. There are so many sad things that happen all around us that we close ourselves from it, or we would be sad and unhappy all the time. Sometimes we need to vent our pain, anger, and sadness though. <br>
<br>
Someone posted in the news forum that someone who shared our interest in EQ passed on. And how they passed on. I don't know Salitana completely, I can say that I know her really well. I believe, though, that she wanted to bring to the community's attention a loss of lives of someone and her mother that shared our interests has passed on, and that maybe we would mourn for her and her's.<br>
<br>
I cannot tell you how to feel, nor judge you by the way you do. I don't understand why you feel the need to tell others what they should feel, how they should act or what they should do. <br>
<br>
I'll leave you with question though. If you were to attend this girl's wake, or anyone else's, would you say anything you said on your orginal post on the News forum, or would you offer your condolences to the one's left behind and keep in your feelings of them all being sheep? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kindly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 8:33:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> Ok, I went back and reread my post.  It would really depend on what I knew about the people I talked to there.  If someone said they were sad about how much abuse she had had over the years, I would ask them how long they had known what was going on, and if they had known and did nothing, yes, I would like to think I would criticize them.  For her family, that would not be the time or the place, even though I have been called a heartless bastard on more then one occasion, I am not a bastard.  <br>
<br>
If you stood by and watched someone abuse a child, and did nothing, how could you defend your actions?  I tend to be a quiet person, but have never been accused of being shy.  I might feel no emotional attachment to the person you abused.  Yet I would be unhappy about your behavior, and if it means I have to hit you so hard your clothes are out of style when you wake up, so be it.  Besides, taking someone deep into the wilderness with no witnesses around is so much more relaxing and enjoyable then in an area with lots of people around.  It can be hard to find isolated enough trails, but you'd be surprised how many private places can be found.<br>
<br>
People in stages of true grief will listen to their pain, not your arguments.  Talking to her family or friends at the funeral about why they didn't stop this before it got to this point helps nobody.  It just adds to the pain of people already emotionally shattered, which was not my intent.  If you really read my posts, my intentions were not to demean this person's life, it was meant to enrich someone else's life who perhaps you could help Oderry.  Look around at lunch for that person who always eats by themselves.  Look for that person taking yet another day off because they &quot;fell&quot; again.  The desensitizing that Gam is talking about creeps up on us.  So it's so easy to ignore the person dressed in black walking between her classes, head down, talking to nobody.  Or the guy at work who says &quot;You know, if I lost this job I would kill myself&quot;.  He's kind of tough to work with, because frankly I don't like him much, but damn, he'll sit and talk with ya for an hour if I let him.  And it shouldn't be about me, it should be about your fellow man.<br>
<br>
Besides, sure you can judge my feelings.  Does that give you the right to criticize them?  If you feel comfortable doing so.  I have opinions, and so do you.  Mine are no more valuable, even to me, then yours are.  But I believe in my opinion, so you'd have to convince me with yours why you were right.<br>
<br>
I can say with absolute surety that I would not give my condolences to her family.  I might agree that it was a pretty crappy situation.  But for all I know, the person I'm talking to used to beat or abuse her as well.  Hell, for all I know Oderry you used to abuse her.  For all I know Salitana helped him murder his daughter and then turned the gun on him and made it look like a suicide.  And since I didn't know this girl, how can I talk about what she meant to me?  It would be crocodile tears like those I saw that inspired me to make my post.<br>
<br>
<br>
I remember a guy I used to work with.  Nice guy, very quiet.  Had a very nice woman he introduced as his wife.  His &quot;wife&quot; gave horseback lessons to the owner's son.  I hadn't seen his house, but the owner of the place he and I worked for who grew to be a close friend said it was a very nice place.<br>
<br>
So when I'm in basic training I get a letter from my former boss with a newspaper clipping about my former co-worker.  He had been caught (again) molesting children, his &quot;wife&quot; wasn't, and the house was a rental.  We all worked with this guy for well over a year buying his nice little stories.  Only to find out he was one of the lower forms of life.  If I ever ran into him on the street I would express my displeasure with him, hopefully not enough to get me thrown in jail for more then a couple weeks or so.<br>
<br>
So I try to be a little more aware now.  You know what they say, fool me once - shame on you, fool me twice - shame on me.  I think to myself, if I had gotten to know this guy better perhaps I could have seen more into his psyche and saved this poor little girl from what she went through.  I don't blame myself for what he did, he did it.  But I do carry the feeling around that maybe if I had done a little more........   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 8:55:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> Ugle may I ask you this?<br>

<br>
The people dying in the WTC bothered me no more then the people killed in a bus bombing in Israel.  The people dying in the WTC bothered me no more then the Marines that died in the Beirut bombing (actually I could relate to the Marines more then I could the accountants).  The fact that those people died doesn't disturb me any more then it did when Randy Weaver's wife was killed by federal agents.  Or when those people died in Columbine.  Or Waco.  Or the tens of thousands that Pol Pot, or Stalin, or Hitler, or Mussolini killed.  Or the girl in this news story.  Or the people of Kuwait.  Or the civilian people of Afghanistan, or the Sudan, or through the corrupt policies known as Apartheid.  Or the people in Bosnia, or the Native Americans at the hands of the settlers.  The people in North Korea, or Iraq, or in Oklahoma city.  Or Ted Bundy's victims for that matter.  <br>
<br>
I love my country and believe I served it with honor.  But to lament about the loss of American lives and ignore the other losses of life would make me in my psyche truly heartless.  So what do I do?  Do I sit and cry over the American lives lost, while by ignoring the losses of life in the rest of the world spit on the graves of anyone not American?  Or do I treat all of these lives equally important?  I choose to treat them all equally.<br>
<br>
So, how do I cope with all of the loss of life?  I can sit in the corner and cry about how unfair life is.  Or I can accept that death and cruelty are part of this world, and while I can help where I can, accept that this will happen.  To shed tears for those people who died untimely in this suicide attack and not miss a beat when an Israeli or a Palestine dies to me is unthinkable and inhuman.  It is not my call to judge the worth of another persons life.  I accept that death is the way of this world, and with that acceptance I feel no need to grieve over someone I do not know.  Remember, I feel that you cry for the living, not for the dead.  And since none of these people were part of my life, I have no reason to cry for what I would miss about them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 9:48:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> I understand now, I think.

Americans: Here's a picture of my wedding.  Here's me and my hon.  Here's a picture of the bridal party.  Oh, and our wedding was ruined by someone writing a dirty limerick on our wedding book.<br>
<br>
A couple in Israel tonight: Here's a picture of my wedding.  Here's a picture of me and my hon.  Here's a picture of the 6 people's coffins who died at our wedding.  Here's a picture of the other 20 people taken to the hospital.<br>
