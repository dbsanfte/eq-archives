The vibrator alarm on his electronic matress had woken him up. The bed tilted upward until he stood on the heated floor. A tube opened up underneath his feet, and he fell in. &quot;I hate this part,&quot; he thought to himself. He landed on a moving platform. Robotic hands undressed him, and he went through a steaming shower of water. Next he closed his eyes, and a liquid corrosive foam rained on him. He was washed off with another hot stream of water. Then he was blow-dried as fast as he had gotten wet. Next he used the computer panel on the moving plaform railings to specify the clothing type. He held his hands up and he was dressed with formal clothes in a few seconds. In a matter of seconds the platform ended, and he was thrust down another tube, landing in his air-pod. A slot in the ship opened up, revealing a small tube. This tube was filled with pure calories and vitamins. He consumed it and sent the wastes to the garbage facility by means of teleportation. John set the coordinates for his work, and the pod lifted off of the ground. He would be to Cybertronix in a matter of minutes.<br>
     (I decided to try something new. This might be exciting, or it may be a falure.

She hated being a tool of the corporation, but it was the only way she could pay the bills.  During the day she was the secretary to a high up official at Cybertronix.  Mr. - or John as he insistesd that she called him was nice enough, he seemed like he could be really cool, but their relationship had always been stricktly profesional.  Mai folded her short black skirt under her as she sat down in her chair and started to play back the messages that had been left over the night.  John was aprently not at work yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mai was in her mid 20's.  She had frizzed punk red hair (which to her delight her boss at Cybertronix had not made her change).  She only wore black, sleek clothing that together with her makeup and hair made her look like either an ex punk turned buisness woman or like a deranged cheerleader.  when she was not at work she was at home at her computer, polishing on her hacking abilities or reading about all the new technological advances.  Whenever she got the oportunity she would go to a club and dance the night away.<br>
<br>
But today was a monday.  And that meant another boring mind numbing day at Cybertronix, answering phones and making coffee.<br>

A holographic projection showed the time in extremely accurate incriments. &quot;Hmm, I've gotta calibrate the alarm system when I get back from work...&quot; John yawned as he zipped by. The air pod slowed to a glide. He was at the Cybertronix facility now. His ship slowly docked inside of a parking tube. John pressed a putton on his control panel, and the side of the pod opened up. He stepped out and closed the door. The pod was taken by robotic hands and rushed off to the parking vault. John took the elevator up to the 24th level, where his office was. &quot;Morning Steve,&quot; he said to a passing co-worker. He walked passed a few cubicles and turned into his office. &quot;Hello Mai,&quot; he said to her. She was typing away, while listening to the automatic message system.<br>

He was the only Security Manager on night shift, and usually there were only three others that were in the department. Cybertronix(tm) was one of the most productive, highly advanced businesses to date. There were thirty-seven constructs, or buildings, all across Europe, or Eurasia as it's called nowadays, yet *I* still like to call it Eur-<br>

<br>
Steve's hands dropped all the screens as he frantically brushed away a small, white fuzzy on his black suit. The black slacks were made of the most durable synthetic cloth and leather products created by the company, and repelled most dirt and airborne objects, but there was one ON HIM!! He attacked the fuzzy savagely, and deposited it in a small box, where he watched sedistically as the fuzzball fried. He took in every last detail of the exposure; the beginning, where he could nearly see the waves of heat shimmer, the bright flash of light, the fuzzy texture of the ball, and the way the smoke's lines intricately danced and interwined as they rose off the charred piece of fuzz. With a dark grin on his face, Steve could even make out words and symbols in the smoke, only because *He* could, though. Only *He* was could see the details. Only *He* could hear the vapors, because only *He* was great enough to understand.<br>
<br>
Smiling smugly with what the stream of smoke that was whisked out a suction tube had told him, Steve professionally picked up one screen out of the amassed jumble, and saw someone pocketing a few of the high-end market chips from the electronics section. Smiling that They had helped him again, Steve sounded the alarm, and the gaurd-bots quickly apprehended him. &quot;Have a *nice* day!&quot; the speakers boomed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uparadisetheheretic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paradise the Heretic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Decay</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 5:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sci-Fi</span><hr size=1> Mai taped her finger impatiently against the hard surface of her glass desk.

What Mai knew and very few cavilians knew was that Cybertronix was under licence by the goverment to design most of the high end artillery to proved for the war effort in the Americas.

No matter how many times she would click her heels against the hard plastic floor she would never get used to the emotionless feeling that crept through her spine. Grasping a clipboard, she looks down and reads the top. &quot;Project Repe&quot;. Pale pink lips turn up in a half smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;hmph, Robots...&quot; ~Soon enough the damn things will take over the world. It's bad enough they're all over the place. But feelings? That's a bit extreme...

Her pace slows as she reaches one of the many doors in the expiremental part of the building. Printed in bold black letters on the door was &quot;8956-4398   Repe&quot;.  Pulling her identification card from her pocket, she slides it through the security check. With a beep and a green light, she is let into the room. Bright white lights set on motion detecters flicker on as she steps into the room. <br>

<br>
&quot;Umm... excuse me...&quot; <br>
<br>
~Did I just apologize to a robot? He only looks human. *It* only looks human. Come on now. The clipboard~  <br>
<br>
Orlaith picks up the clipboard. This was an interesting beginning... Looking back at Repe, she smiles. <br>
<br>
&quot;Alright. First off. Hello is the correct greeting. All of your other questions will be answered with this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pulling a plastic bag from the clipboard, she holds it in the air. Sealed tightly inside was a small chip no larger than a quarter. <br>
<br>
&quot;The information on this will be downloaded into your central memory through the hook ups in your wrists. All basic information that humans use in everyday life will be yours. However, as far as emotions go, you will still need to learn about them. That is why I am here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Orlaith dismissed his other questions. Hesitantly, she walks to it and grabs its left wrist. The lightly tanned skin of her cheeks darkens to a soft rose hue. Its blank, unknowing stare sent chills down her spine. A slender finger presses down on a specific part of it's wrist, and down sinks the artificial flesh to reveal a bubble of metallic liquid surrounded by blinks and flashes and shots of light, electricity, and metal. With one hand, Orlaith held its wrist up, and with the other and her teeth, she tears open the plastic bag and gently places the chip into the liquid. Grinning, she presses the same spot again, and the liquid and it's surroundings are hidden once more. Orlaith steps back. Sighing, she smiles. She was in charge of what could be the thing to change history. Robots that are nearly human. Not knowing whether it was a good or bad thing, Orlaith smiles at the machine that would make her name known in the technological world.  <p><Br> <Br> <Br> <Br> Your head will collapse <Br> But there's nothing in it <Br> And you'll ask yourself <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Wheeeeeere iiis my mind?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 2:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sci-Fi</span><hr size=1> .... okay..missiles.....hey..what the hell?<br>

<br>
&quot;The rumbling in your stomach means that you need more power to run on. You were designed to be as human-like as possible. Humans need energy in the form of foods to live. You need energy in the form of that red gel to run. The gel can be taken in either through your 'mouth' or through a hook up just above your 'belly-button'. You are able to choose which way.&quot; <br>
<br>
She smiles again. Already her cheeks were beginning to hurt. ~'Remember to smile. He is new to life and living. He can feel and we do not want those feelings to be hurt. This is an assignment you cannot fool around with. Smile. Be cheery. And for gods sake be nice to the poor fellow. It'll be hard enough to deal with new feelings let alone deal with *your* attitude at the same time.'    Does Dr. Rosenworth always have to lecture me? I haven't messed up a single project or experiment ever. I've done everything right every single time. What does he think I'll do this time? I'm a scientist, not a child. Dried up old windbag needs to find something better to do with his time than lecture a perfectly good employee~<br>
