Our guild methods of Madness has about 70 people the majority of which are level 60.  We are focused and a lot of nice loot flows through the organization.  We have developed over time a very fair and equitable looting system.<br><br>As you get into high end encounters life is all about aggro control.  The higher level your guild is the more you understand this.  Most encounters revolve around Chealing a main tank who everyone works to keep the MOB focused on.  This tank needs to have very high Armor Class, be buffed to the teeth and have the highest possible taunting weapons.  The recipes for this are endless but for the sake or argument a 60 warrior with EPICS and full warlord from ToV is a nice front man.<br><br>In order to fully equip such a warrior you will spend man many trips in ToV and endless work to get the components for the weapons.  Since most guilds have multiple classes you will have to make the following decision.<br><br>a: Do we focus our energy on equipping one warrior so that we can do the Uber encounters sooner.<br><br>b. Do we split loot and sacrifice AC an Taunt on out Master Assist to even out the warrior classes in our guild.<br><br>In Methods of Madness we went the A route about four times.<br><br>Over time in each instance we have ended up either <br><br>a. Burning out the Master Assist who simply gets tired of being a required component of every single raid.  <br><br>B.  Discovered that that cute little warrior who showed up looking like a level 30 rogue equipped in things he found in Lower Guk refuse dispenser and was so incredibly grateful for his first real BP suddenly is not so loyal once fully equipped.<br><br>No single class is so dependant on gear as the warrior.  Maybe this is part of the reason that their interest in the game seems to wane when they get a level of gear to which their are few upgrades.  <br><br>I understand that killing all the named in ToV can upgrade them but I mean practical short term upgrades.<br><br>What I find is that suddenly this class tends to lose interest if they are not likely to receive upgrades and that this is manifested as an interst in doing something new. <br><br>My point here is that you may see a shortcut to Uberdom by having one superwarrior but in the long term dont be surprised if you end up doing this process two or three times which leaves you with one uber warrior when you could have managed it a bit differently and had three or four.<br><br>Please understand this is not a bash on the warrior class and I know good ethical warriors personally who really are grateful for the things the guild has done for them.  I have just found that in managing a guild with a lot of warriors and a lot of loot over the last couple years that short term solution are long term headaches.<br><br>Just my little nugget of Wisdom.<br><br>Extreme Measure<br>GM Methods of Madness<br>&quot;Incoming couple of blues&quot;<br>60 Necromancer <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umentat1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mentat 1</A> at: 1/16/02 11:10:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uctuttle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ctuttle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/16/02 2:14:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.somuchtuttle.com/pics/eq/dorimhead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lessons learned from MA equipping a large guild</span><hr size=1> Actually this is a pretty solid piece of advice.

In order for this to work in your favor though, you need to have a higher dex for more procing power(I don't care what the naysayers say, I've witnessed it firsthand). Stamina is also important, moreso then AC. I take roughly the same amount of damage in Indicolite that I do in Warlords. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umizlil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mizlil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/16/02 3:49:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lessons learned from MA equipping a large guild</span><hr size=1> An excellent post.

It seems to work out better than other situations if you have a guild that battles over loot a lot, but loot whores will still find a reason to complain.  Even those who are interested in fairness will admit that good items drop rarely enough as to not be perfectly distributed, and one raid may have a dozen drops and the next 4 raids have nothing worthwhile drop.  If you go by strict random, someone who only hits the one good raid can get items, but the people who are there all the time and miss that one raid lose out.  (This is much more an issue with Velious quest armor drops, which are MQable, any no-drop items will of course only go to those present.)  You can keep track of who attended what raid, and set up an elaborate DKP system, but the only people who seem really happy with those systems are guilds who generally don't fight over loot in the first place.  Class reps and a well-defined chain of command work wonders, use them.  <br>Second, while racing to equip one person in whatever gear may push them over the sweet spot where their AC is greater than &lt;ubermob&gt;'s ATK, this doesn't happen very often.  It may happen if you are a new guild, made up of people in mid-level quest armor, but you will probably ramp up to these mobs anyway, and not just start off fighting them.  Equip all your tanks equally, and they'll all hit that sweet spot about the same time, and you might actually be able to kill the mob even if your main tank dies.  (Oh no, &lt;warrior_01&gt; down, now &lt;warrior_02&gt;, &lt;warrior_03&gt;, and &lt;warrior_04&gt; are down too.  We got a campout cleric?)<br>Third, if you're a new guild starting up, or an existing guild gearing up to do end-game encounters, expect to lose several of your better equipped folks to larger, more mature guilds.  It happens, especially if they're much better equipped than the rest of the guild.  Don't take it personally, don't hate the person or their new guild, don't let an in-game incident affect real-life friendships.<br>Fourth, Extreme's language in this post may be interpreted to be referring to a certain person in our guild.  I certainly don't think that is the case.  I've known Extreme for many, many years, and the phrase is one that he uses constantly.  I'm sure it was not intended to indicate anyone in particular.  <br>Finally, how can getting your epic or whatever piece of gear be an ending point?  Maybe I'm just weird, but I've been looking forward for my epic for so long because I know that it will make me more effective, making my groups more effective, making my guild more effective, making it easier to kill big mobs.  (OK, granted, bard epics are actually useful, and even the uberest of the uber bards still use them as off-hand weapons, unlike some other epics.)  I can see how you could burn out because you've killed all the interesting mobs in the game, but how many people in a guild that can awaken the Sleeper aren't epic?<br>Anyway, just the ramblings of a bard who still loves the game as much as ever.

Personally, I like the randoming method.  It doesn't penalize anyone for having to work or having to be at class.  I've never had things assigned to me and I'd like to think my gear is decent.  I've won it fairly, and no one holds any hard feelings to me (that I know of) for what I have.  Assigning gear is more likely to cause problems in my opinion.  Assigning means you have more people that feel they were better deserving of something or feels there is favortism being shown, whether its true or not.  Each guild has to decide what method is best for them though, and people need to know up front what that method is and not complain about it when the time comes. <p><b> <font color=#000080> <font face="Monotype Corsiva"> <font size=4> Jilanya <br>  60  Priestess </br> </b> </font><br><font size=1><font face="Symbol"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38752 ">© © © © © © ©</a></font></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=216.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=216.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=216.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=216.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=216.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.threadControl?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4>Innoruuk - Guilds</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
