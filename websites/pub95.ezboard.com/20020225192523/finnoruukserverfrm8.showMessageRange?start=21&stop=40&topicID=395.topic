A final word of advice -- relationship management is the core of all occidental business. If you own or regularly buy other Sony products, I would suggest you include that information (serial numbers, etc.) as evidence that you're not just a_random_complainer_01, but a bona fide, brand-loyal customer. <br>

This isn't going to affect the regular servers in any way, other than the possibility of losing a small percentage of the players.<br>
Verant has said quite clearly that the GMs on this new server will NOT be taken from the existing GM pool, and they will NOT be taking resources from the regular servers.<br>
I think this is a great idea, especially for those more into RP than hack-n-slash.  Assume that they have 8000 users at $40/month, that comes out to $320,000/month, or $240,000/month more than a similar regular server would pull in.  (I think we can assume that the generic server costs are the same.)  Now with this extra money they can easily hire 20-30 really good, active GMs.  If they do this right, on peak times you'll have 8-10 GMs online, and even at absolute minimum times, you should be able to have 1 or 2 GMs online.<br>
What will you really get for the money though?  It's not like they're going to be able to do custom campaigns all the time, or at least not without making major changes to the Norrath backstory.  I expect that you will get the chance to actually take part in the big, overarching changes in the story of Norrath, stuff like the plauge in the Karanas or the kidnapping of FV or the search for the Nexes portals.  These events happen on the regular servers, but it's pretty much luck as to who gets to take part and who gets the nifty items.<br>
On this new server I expect that they will really play out the events though, with several little events leading up to it, and a number of events which have very little to do with the evolving storyline, but are there more for entertainment.<br>
I don't see anything that indicates that Verant will stop offering these interactive quests on the regular servers, and the statements from Verant seem very much designed to assure people that they won't take away from the regular servers.<br>
I think most of the people ranting are doing so because they want Everquest to be something it's not:  a really big and intricate D&amp;D-type world with personal GMs and customizable content.  Verant asked if people would be willing to pay for an additional level of service, and enough people said yes that Verant is going to try it.  <br>
I'm personally not going to switch, unless my guild were to decide to move as a whole, because I like the Innoruuk community and I don't really think not having customizable campaigns is a big problem.  Maybe if there were no AA points, and once you made 60 there wasn't much more to do, joining a server where the GMs created content would be more attractive, but I don't think I'm missing out on that much.  For me going to Chardok and killing Sarnaks is fun, even if I don't have a GM telling a story about how the Sarnaks have been raiding the goblin villages, and selling the goblins into slavery, and how the goblins have hired my band of adventurers to help them in their battle with the sarnaks.  If I really want the backstory like that, I make it up.  <br>
(For example, I'm giant ally because no being should ever trust a dragon.  Those scaly bastards can't conceive of any other creature being anything other than a snack for them, even if they pretend to tolerate them.  I've seen too many dragons turn.  The only good dragon is a dead dragon I say, and the best dragon is one that's dead and rotting!)<br>
I really hope this server works out, though I'm afraid that if it does it will cause more discord than good.  I look at it as an equivilant to the personal shopper service that high-end stores offer, where you pay extra to have someone assist just you, and pick stuff for you and you alone.  Nobody @#%$ that Nordstroms doesn't offer good service to regular customers just because you can pay more for personalized service.<br>
I hope those to whom the backstory is important, and those who like being able to effect the story go to the new server and are happy there.  Who knows, this may be the perfect server for those who actually do have a problem with powergamers and not just with everyone who might have slighter better equipment.<br>

Its the execution that is lacking. This is, IMHO, the crux of the complaint many have with Verant and the delivery of EQ. <br>
<br>
Promises were made via marketing materials, posts at the EQ site, etc. that portrayed the game in a certain fashion - one which a  considerable majority feel has yet to be realized. For some time now, many have preferred to take a 'wait and see' perspective and that's really very commendable. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Verant and Sony Online Entertainment have taken a fairly nonchalant view of complaints and an all but non-existant interest in actually providing the level of service and interactivity (i.e., events, etc.) they promised would be an integral component of this product. <br>
<br>
This has but contributed to the underlying dissatisfaction of their customers and the latest news of the product people *thought* they were going to be receiving arriving with additional fees is considered by many to be a slap in the face... perhaps even the last straw.<br>
<br>
I have been surprised people haven't pursued the matter in a more logical and effective way. Perhaps this is the beginning of something along those lines. Personally, I believe there is a case to be made that EQ has failed rather significantly to deliver the product promised to its customers. <br>
<br>
Is anyone interested in making such a case? I become more and more interested in doing so. Not because I hold any personal vendetta against Verant or Sony Online... but because I believe it is inherently wrong to allow a company to get away with 'bait and switch' tactics, and in my personal opinion - that is precisely what has occurred.<br>

<br>
The fansites were all featuring interviews and spoilers in which things such as the Bazaar function were discused(not implemented so far, but HEY, the premium server already has an automap, and it's not even LIVE yet!).  The point most folks seem to be choking on is that Luclin CONTENT isn't even all live, let alone interface upgrades, but resources have been apparently devoted to this Legends program.<br>
<br>
For instance, one of the high level raid zones in the new expansion isn't live.  The places are all there, and there's a quest to get the key to the zone, and the big boss MoB is already rendered and pacing in his little sanctum, but the key quest is broken.  It's intentional.  Triton, a guild on Povar already HAS keys to this place.  They've received confirmation from server GM's that this was indeed the key, but it doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Here's a little insult for you to sprinkle on the injury:  a few guilds have gotten in with various tricks and killed the guy, and they took the time to code in loot for him....JOKE LOOT!  He drops a breastplate that's -200ish to most stats called the Curiass of Sad Exploitation, and a tremendous sword that nobody can equip.  Not only have they not finished the content, they've taken the time to put in surrogate content to deride the folks who can bypass the broken bits and get to it!<br>
<br>
Now we see that while they couldn't implement a great deal of what they were promising with SoL, they DID have time to code new interfaces, and add features to the game that we paid for, but will never see.  We see that the content and service that we were promised when EQ went live, and arguably have yet to see, is available for an extra thirty bones a month?!  I don't know who coined it, but the sentiment seems to be:<br>
<br>
&quot;You're in our world now, and the rent just went up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I'm having fun with Everquest, and will continue to, but I'm not paying any more for the service than I am now.  If'n I ever feel that the level of service I'm rendered isn't worth what I'm paying for it I'll just stop playing.  I don't have any shares in Sony stock, so I don't care what they do with the money I send them for EQ.  I would, however, like to see them finish the product I bought afore they start making new'uns. <p><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/39/2383739.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarkusebonblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arkus Ebonblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 12:29:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darkretribution.homestead.com/files/hobs_anm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: EQ Legends servers.</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to comment on Verant's answers to some concerns about the Legends server up at EQ Casters Realm<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We get a ton of great ideas from players. We're more than willing to use the good ones.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, you do - and taking those ideas and then putting them into effect on your &quot;elite&quot; server is just downright wrong.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Having said that, it's important that you understand that the addition of Legends server(s) will only have positive effects on Live servers. Some of the content designed for the Legends server(s) will eventually be moved to the Live servers. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong, but if you recode the existing game on these servers so that it's different from the norm, won't that make it more difficult to work on? Couldn't different code on servers cause myriads of problems when new content is added?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As I said above, we can't afford to provide all of these services for the current monthly fee. I would argue that we're doing a very nice job providing the existing services for the low monthly fee that we currently charge. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Uhm, I don't quite buy all of this answer - sure the char pages might take up some room (though websites I've seen such as Magelo, do some of this same thing for no monthly fee) but how server memory intensive would the ingame map be? Seems to me, that it would be pretty simple to set up and maintain when you really think about it. For example: for the map a simple 1 or 0 for if its been visited and whats been seen there... Dreadlands 1 (yes) Zone info: Karnor's Castle 1 (yes), Burning Woods Zone line 1 (yes), Druid Portal 0 (no), etc etc - add those numbers into a program that would be part of the game itself and it doesnt look like much to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The dedicated team that is mentioned is indeed something that requires an additional fee. This is a dedicated team of content designers and GMs, a large number of GMs for a single server so that they can provide more than just customer service (answering petitions). We've been hiring new GMs just for the Legends server. The customer service level on our Live servers is great and it will continue to get better. But for the Legends servers we're providing extra staff to handle things like events, quests and other content items that we can't afford to provide on the Live servers based on the existing fee. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can't believe they even had the nerve to say that customer service on the regular servers is great. Nevermind, the tech support - I'm still waiting for even an acknowledgement of a tech e-mail I sent in december.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The Live team and the Legends team are two different teams, though these teams work together and keep very close ties. The Live team has done nothing but grow over the last few months and at the same time we've also built the Legends content team. We have also been hiring new Customer Service people incrementally to cover the Legends server. <br>
What all of this means is that we now have a service for people that are willing to pay for a more active server, one with more live quests, more dynamic events and a bunch of web-based features (and tons of other stuff I'm surely forgetting to mention). <br>
<br>
 <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, if you've already hired them, theyre working, and Legends servers aren't working yet (or collecting revenue), who exactly is paying for this launch? Where's that money coming from? That's right - from the current subscribers who wont have access to it. Further, if this server doesnt work out as intended (let's say only 5,000 people sign up for it) are we going to see a price increase on the regular servers to cover the loss of expected revenue that these people are being paid from?<br>

Anyway - its something I'm thinking about - if my core group of friends (People I know in RL) decided to all do this I would probably go as well.<br>

I will probably wait this first round out and see how it goes and what the reviews of it are...<br>
<br>
If the content and such is what they are claiming it would probably be worth it to me. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29713"><img src="http://www.somuchtuttle.com/pics/eq/soulshieldbanner.jpg" border=0></center></a>

<br>
What the heck is wrong with a private company wanting to make more profit?  Greedy?  I suppose, but it's the oil the runs the engine of our world economy.  It's how folks have jobs, and get raises, and can buy entertainment like, well, EQ.  When profit doesn't happen, folks lose jobs, don't get raises, and have scale back their entertainment expenses.  <br>
<br>
Is EQ a food, or medicine that folks are reliant upon for survival?  Even those items are sold based on their market return.  <br>
<br>
If they see a potential source of extra revenue they aren't supposed to seize it?  What's the basis for your sense of this entitlement?  <br>
<br>
Alternatively, they could simply jack up the monthly subscription price.  Would you like that better?<br>
<br>
If you disagree with their business model, then that's a more legitimate argument, but they don't owe anybody anything more than what they already provide.  I've made the decision as a consumer that it is a great value, and I love their product.  <br>
<br>
Certainly they've analyzed the business model and determined they will make more money.  Attacking the &quot;morality&quot; of their business determination for assigning *game* prices is nutty, imho.  I don't buy the &quot;bait and switch&quot; argument either.  Simply because a premium service is offered doesn't mean the non-premium service is illegal.  Hello first class travel v. coach travel.  <br>
<br>
In the end that's good, because hopefully the folks on the Legends servers will pay for extra content that will work its way onto the regular servers.  I won't be paying $40 a month for EQ, but god bless the folks who do.  <br>
<br>
If you disagree, then cancel.  Folks do have an odd sense of entitlement at times.  <br>

<br>
The simple reality is this -- Everquest was introduced and marketed as the 'premium service'. It isn't. Now they're offering the premium service many thought they were signing up for initially... and they're going to charge you more for it. <br>
<br>
Offering a premium service, taking subscriber's money, providing less than the agreed upon premium service, then announcing the actual premium service as an add-on with additional fees *is* bait and switch, Gart.<br>

They never said we are never going to make a premium service available, and actually foreshadowed this happening by having the &quot;Would you be willing to pay xxx dollars for a premium server&quot; survey months ago (maybe a year?).<br>
<br>
When you subscribed, you agreed to pay $10 a month for the service as is. Nothing is changing here except they are offering an even better service. The current one is not changing, and will not be changing. <br>
<br>
If you thought they were providing less than the agreed upon service, then you are free to cancel your account, and have been free to do that (if you didn't think you were getting good enough customer service or enough GM events) since you started playing. <br>
<br>
It would be bait and switch if they had said this was the premium service, and it is not going to get any better, but I don't remember reading that anywhere. They just had one plan, and you could either pay for that or not. Now they add a second one which offers better service, which will not effect those who do not sign up *at all*. <p><table style=filter:glow(Color="#0050FF")><td>Camedil Chaosweaver<BR>Phantasmist</td></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udshazzarinsoulstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dshazzarin Soulstalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 7:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  EQ Legends Server</span><hr size=1> I'm not fond of this at all.  However, business is business, and since Sony has apparently conducted enough marketing research to support the numbers and potential profits, then I'm sure there is a profit waiting to be made.<br>
<br>
However, what angers me is that there are many bugs and features that haven't been worked out.  On one hand, no software company fixes *all* of its bugs before moving onward; however, features such as &quot;The Bizarre&quot;, et al, should definitely be top priority since Luclin was just released.  I think if anything, this Legends idea should have been postponed until some of the major things were worked out with Luclin.  <br>
<br>
Also, 40 bucks a month is too steep.  Several of the features they're offering you either don't need, or can get freely off the web.  Take Magelo, for example.<br>
<br>
I have done a significant amount of reading on many of the EQ fan sites, and no doubt, this has left a bad taste in many peoples' mouths.  Here we have Verant boasting about the features of this new server - many of which were promised in the original release of Everquest.  As a result, many are crying foul.<br>

The only time I have ever had CS was in year one.  After then not a darn (edited) GM has ever fixed a problem of any nature.  Not to mention you hardly ever see GM's logged on anymore.  Used to be atleast 3 Gm's on at all times. <br>
GM's have been useless for the last two years.<br>
<br>
Not bitching about the money cause if you are foolish enough to pay $480 a year that is your choice.  Personally I don't care if I have the money to pay that or not I will not pay that for just a game.<br>
<br>
Oh and did I mention CS?  Ha what a joke that has become.<br>
<br>
As for limiting the server population the servers where only meant to handle 1500 people max.  Before they pulled off the numbers for the login screen for the servers I was seeing 3k people on some servers including Inny.  This is their way to hide the numbers from us so we won't know how overcrowed our server has become.  This is one reason for the increased LD's over the years.  Take care of the $5,000,000 a month you get on the regular servers before you take care of a server that is only going to bring in $60,000 a month.  Come on simple math will show you where you should be.<br>
<br>
BTW did I mention CS?  Ha!  What a joke. <p><span style='filter:glow(color=#0000FF,strength=1);width:100%'>

The coach vs. first class analogy is perfect. If you are unhappy with your EQ, log out. If you think the CS is bad, log out. If you can't wait another minute for GMs to offer you a dynamic quest and they won't do it, log out. There are other games out there.<br>
