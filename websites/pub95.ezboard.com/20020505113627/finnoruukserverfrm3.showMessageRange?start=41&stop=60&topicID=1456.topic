As far as my lack of experience in HoT, you're right, I've only got my observations of the game in general to go on and one lone night in HoT, and over a year in the rest of ToV.  However, the fact that someone from The Pantheon, who has in fact spent quite a bit of time in HoT, agreed with me, and states that their guild also believes this is true, leads me to believe I am, in fact, correct.<br>
<br>
Regarding the EQ genious that posted you can Hail a mob anywhere in zone.  Have you logged into Everquest ever?  In a simple test in front of 20 Fortress of Honor people yesterday in Ssra I targetted one of the Temple Patrollers at zone in, closed the door, and hailed him.  &quot;Hail, a Temple Patroller.&quot;  Humm, ok that works!  Now to the next part!  Run around the corner 1 step away, look in the direction that the mob is in and hit hail.  &quot;Hail.&quot;  Sorry friend, but you're quite incorrect, you cannot, in fact, hail any mob from anywhere in the zone unless you have line of sight.  Keep arguing though and I'll be happy to post screenshots when I get off work! <p><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="4" color="#800000"><b><i>Tolstoy Wyldefyre</i></b></font><BR><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"><b>Wood Elf Warlord of Innoruuk</b></font><br><a href="http://legionsofdarkness.org"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"><b>Legions of Darkness</b></font></a><br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uneochosen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neochosen</A> at: 3/26/02 7:39:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhalbred2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>halbred2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 7:57:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: HoT Door and other mysteries of life explained.</span><hr size=1> I can hail mobs anywhere inside agro range without having line of sight ....<br>

That being said, I don't know what determines the range at which you can be from a targetted mob and get their name when you Hail them.  I don't know if it's aggro range based (seems to be much larger than that) or if it's simply some fixed range from your position. <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

Ask any engineer and they'll tell you what looks all nice and neat on paper generally isn't so neat in the field.  <br>
<br>
Knowledge of game mechanics aside, practical experience from countless hours of hunting in HoT have shown that if you fight a mob in front of the door and it's closed there's no aggro.  I've even been the last man standing directly in front of the door and getting hit by aoe which didn't aggro the drakes.  <br>
<br>
As for scientific method:<br>
<br>
Experiment after experiment, observation after observation the same thing is observed...fight in front of the door and open it, Zemm and pals assist the mob.  This is called confirmation of the phenomenon or PROOF that a condition exsists (ie it happens the same way each time).  Feel free to test it yourself...pull a wurm, drake, rancar, whatever right in front of the door and fight it then have someone open the door (I'll volunteer) and see what happens.  Then do the same thing while the door is shut, march the mob right up to the door, as long as it doesn't pop it's head through the door (thereby opening it in my theory of why this causes aggro) Zemm and friends couldn't care less.<br>
<br>
In a program as buggy and unstable as Everquest you can count on one thing, the unexpected.  It seems that by it's very nature Everquest behaves much like the real world in that there are exceptions to every rule...whether it's intended or not in this instance only the programmers at VI know for sure.<br>
<br>
So please, keep that door shut unless you want to be considered inconsiderate at best and a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> potatoe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> at worst.<br>

Take Ssra for example, right when you zone in there is a corner and then a door straight ahead.  If someone is fighting a mob just within the door and you are standing on the other side of the corner not only would you get the &quot;You cannot hit your target from here&quot; message, but you will also not be able to Hail the mob, even though if the wall was removed you would be able both melee and hail the mob.  Anyone who fights in Ssra would realize that mobs there have an extremely large melee range (bounding box), and that were the wall removed you would be within melee range of said mob, therefore, the problem is not that you must be standing on top of the mob to hit it (this holds true for other zones).  I can't count the number of times that when we were fighting in the old NToV safe spot I would run around the corner for a heal, yet still be well within what would normally be melee range, be facing the direction of the mob, and yet not be able to hit it nor hail it.<br>

Even if you have 3 walls in between you and the mob, if your close enough and your in an outdoor zone you can hail him.  <br>
<br>
Now to be able to actually cast a spell on him is another matter as that requires line of sight typically.  Line of sight in EQ is typically determined by being able to &quot;hail&quot; a mob while facing it.  <br>
<br>
Now hailing a mob means you have clear line of sight to its geometric center.  But that doesn't mean you can hit it.  (e.g. Attempting to harmonize black reavers in Rak reaver room from the bottom of the room.  You can hail it but you can't harmonize because you are not really in line of sight and are too high/low to cast on it (&quot;You cannot see your target&quot;) which it doesn't say.<br>
<br>
Now back on topic, outdoor zones typically do not consider any wall/door as a solid obstacle and ignore them when casting spells on mobs.  (e.g. you target a mob in the giant fort in Dreadlands, go around the walls to where mob will not path through other giants and pull with a spell)  There are exceptions to this case.<br>
<br>
In indoor and dungeon zones, doors and other obstacles are almost always considered solid objects which you cannot cast through.  There are of course exceptions to this rule which supports Toystory's theory of invisible doors (e.g. the door in front of the Golem Master spawn point in NWing of Charassis).  I can cast through that door like it wasnt there to pull the mobs.  Perhaps doors aren't all made the same and that some of them DO in fact block the range of assist aggro from the drakes outside HoT.  I know doors INSIDE HoT do not block the assist aggro if a roamer is right behind it and were engaged on a mob.<br>
<br>
But I digress, hailing a mob doesn't necessarily mean it will aggro through a door when you engage another mob near said door. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19830"><img border=0 src="http://rykar.home.mindspring.com/rypic2002.jpg"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uneochosen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neochosen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 10:09:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqitems.com/tolstoy/aoshi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For you uninformed</span><hr size=1> Actually, I knew someone was going to bring up that point Rykar.  You're right in that walls in outdoor zones (ex: inn's in WC) and some indoor zones (ex: walls in the bazaar/thurg) are transparent and you can hail mobs through them.  This is due to the fact they aren't part of the &quot;zone wall&quot; geometry.  Only objects that are part of the zone wall gemetry can block casting/hail/ae dmg (ex: The afore mentioned wall in Ssra).  Probally the easiest way to see if a wall is a zone wall is if you can sit/look through it and see no world beyond (ex: sitting the wall at zone in to Sirens).<br>
<br>
This can be tested by sitting just outside the HoT door while an ae'ing wurm was inc and getting hit by the AE (I know several people who have done this and it was part of what led to this (and it has been stated several times in this thread), though I was too busy myself to do so). <p><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="4" color="#800000"><b><i>Tolstoy Wyldefyre</i></b></font><BR><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"><b>Wood Elf Warlord of Innoruuk</b></font><br><a href="http://legionsofdarkness.org"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"><b>Legions of Darkness</b></font></a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhalbred2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>halbred2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 10:40:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For you uninformed</span><hr size=1> Why are you so determined to be right Tolstoy ?<br>

Only way they can get hit by mob AE in ToV is to be in line of site. So essentially whoever did the fighting was in line of site of the door, and someone else was outside the door and was hit by the AE. The raid INSIDE didn't aggro Vemm and friends even though they were in LoS? If the door was as transparrent as some beleive they should have aggroed the attackers since the AE proves at least the mob was in LoS of the door and people/mobs behind it. <br>
<br>
Out of all the banter I've seen, the post about an invisible mob that triggers aggro (like a trap) so far best explains what we are all seeing here. Now I will go stand in the HoT doorjam trying to find it like Spawn Master <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  guessing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the friend(s) that got hit by the AE didn't open the door, or he/she would have seen Vemm and friends start cracking skulls in HoT.<br>

That might explain why the mobs outside dont a agro when the door is closed. <p>WalkNot SoSoftly<br><br> Heyokah Duhara<br>"I am not sunshine, I am dark and grey, for this life of sins I live, each day I pay".</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugnimwit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnimwit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 11:05:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=54>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For you uninformed</span><hr size=1> Walknot: <br>
I have seen similar things happen with other LoS AE mobs. I remeber a particular raid where the raid guild had pulled Trak out of his lair and everyone who was stuffed in a prep room got hit by his AoE, out of LoS.<br>
<br>
We all had the Poison icons, but we took no damage the entire time the icon remained.<br>
<br>
It is as if EQ knows you are in range for the AoE, but your client decides LoS? <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=23336"><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gg.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uneochosen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neochosen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 11:09:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqitems.com/tolstoy/aoshi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For you uninformed</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Halbred:<br>

<br>
However unless my memory fails me, if I stand on the other side of the door and look into Hot (with the door open so I could see of course) because of the small size of the prep/break room and the narrow cubby that holds the door you cant get LoS of the stairs on either side of the room that lead down to the two wurms in front of Doze's door, if that is where the mob was engaged.<br>
<br>
So the only way I can figure that someone was getting hit by the AoE was if the mob was dead center in front of  door, if that were the case that is more than close enough to aggro Vemm when engaging the mobs if they didn't care about the door triggering aggro.<br>
<br>
Being at work, I can't go refresh my memory for myself of exactly what perspective I have when standing at the door, but I am pretty sure you will only have LoS of the immediate entryway into the room, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong hehe. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=23336"><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gg.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usogaardwildweed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sogaard Wildweed</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 11:32:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1456.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For you uninformed</span><hr size=1> Everyone knew the Earth was flat.<br>

What &quot;everyone&quot; knows is often proved incorrect by science.<br>
<br>
Everything in EQ happens for a reason.  Tolstoy is simply trying to find out why the HoT door <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  seems</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to agro the hub drakes.  It can not be simply because the door opens.  Doors don't exist to MOBs, they are invisible.  If opening the door does indeed trigger something that causes agro, that would make sense, however, just opening the door can not be causing agro.<br>
<br>
If you have no interest in finding out &quot;why&quot;, stfu, because you are adding nothing to this discussion.<br>

Deep enough to keep a mob and players so close to the wall that they wouldn't aggro Vemm and pals by being in /yell range? Hmm good question.<br>
