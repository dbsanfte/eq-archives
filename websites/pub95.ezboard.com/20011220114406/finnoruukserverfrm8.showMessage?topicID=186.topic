I don't respond to generic &quot;paying&quot; or &quot;will donate&quot; auctions because I've found through long experience that those usually net me 1pp, if I don't get stiffed altogether.  And I'm not willing to get into arguments with people and having them call me names because I don't want to port them for 7g plus a rusty scimitar.<br>
<br>
If someone wants a port, they can name the price up front.  Just so you know, when someone names a price up front, I often do THOSE ports for free.  The fact that the person asking named a price that recognizes that my time is valuable is often all I really need.<br>
<br>
Conversely, I always name a price when I'm looking for a ride.  Price varies depending on how much time I'm willing to spend waiting.  100pp almost always guarantees a quick ride.  25pp gets one usually, if I don't mind waiting.  You get what you pay for.<br>
<br>
If you don't have 25pp, take the boat.  I did.<br>

I generally don't have to wait for rides unless it's someplace like Seb or VL and they would have to leave their groups.  Asking them to port you for free is like asking someone to come tank something for your group IMO.

<br>
It gets old.  VERY old.<br>
<br>
You want rides, you can do two things:<br>
<br>
1. Make sure you have lots of druids and wizard friends.  I go out of my way to help out my friends.<br>
<br>
2. Offer hard cash.<br>
<br>
Bluntly, neither druids nor wizards are the first classes people group with.  It gets old being wanted as taxis, but not good enough for groups.<br>
<br>
I personally realized that I was starting to lean this way.  If the choice was a wizzie or wait for a rogue, I'd often leave a slot open for a rogue.  I don't do that anymore, assuming we have 2 meleers in the group already.<br>

I had my druid there, so I tried to PL him at the derv camp. FYI, wizards suck at PLing 8c) Fortunately there was a high level druid there with a warrior she was PLing, so my druid made his level too. But.. while I was doing this, there were countless requests for ports and TLs, both on open, and via tells. The least I made anyone do was come to the derv camp, and twice I made a certain announcement I'll make below...<br>
I didn't pay any attention beyond that, concentrating on the druid.<br>
Today when I logged in, I was 100 plat richer. Last night when I started PLing, I had 27 small portal fragments. Today I had 19. 8 ports *minimum* for 100pp. Not bad, considering I was busy anyway.<br>
But... here's the kicker.. I have to go to temple of sol ro in lavastorm to get more shards, at 1.25pp each (roughly) That's the part that annoys me.<br>
I encourage *everyone* to go to the temple of solusek ro in lavastorm, talk to the gnome on the balcony and get at least 1 portal shard. That way even if a wizard has run out of fragments, you can get your port.<br>

<br>
I think the point is that druids/wizards are too busy for 5plat but will make the time for larger amounts of cash like 100pp.<br>
<br>
I do CR TL's for free, I port my guild for free and often leave what I'm doing for them. I rarely ask for plat when porting but when I see an offer for 100pp and I can make/have the time, hell ya i'll send a tell. you would too.<br>
<br>
People ask me &quot;how much?&quot; I say &quot;whatever you think is fair&quot;. I've gotten from rusty weapons to 500pp (for a group to IC).<br>
<br>
When I'm soloing, I'll port when I'm medding/healing but not when I have 2 giants snared and I'm aoe'ing them. so don't be so quick to bundle us all together as &quot;diqheads&quot;.<br>

<br>
If you want to be able to easily and instantly get rides, then you need to work on being the sort of person that druids and wizards want to help.<br>
<br>
Because EVERYONE wants rides, and it GETS OLD.<br>
<br>
If you're the sort of person people like to help, then you probably won't have to sit around waiting for rides.<br>
<br>
But no druid has some need to give you a ride.  We didn't become druids 'cause we want to spend all our time porting people who don't take the time to get to know us.  We generally enjoy helping our friends, our guildmates, and our groupmates.<br>
<br>
When you say, &quot;I need a ride,&quot; then you're saying, &quot;Does anyone like me enough to spend several minutes doing a favor for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
When you offer cash, then it's simply a business transaction.  That's a different relationship.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong if I decide I don't want to do a favor for SomeStranger01.  And there's nothing wrong if I decide I'm willing to enter into a business transaction with that person.<br>
<br>
It's not greed.  It's life.<br>
<br>
And if you think it's greed, then maybe there's something wrong with your perspective -- assuming that we owe you something.<br>
<br>
You want free rides on demand, make sure you have plenty of friends.  That's not a negative attitude.  It's actually a very positive message.  Be a decent person who people like to help, and people will help you.<br>
<br>
And maybe you'll feel better about yourself at the same time.<br>

That's great if you're different, but experience has shown me that most people know exactly what they want.  They're just hoping for that and more. <p><p style="line-height: 10%"><font face="Monotype Corsiva" color="#0000FF">&quot;A<font size="4">rmor

Long story.  :-)<br>
<br>
And I don't think you're right about that.  I think most people don't have any more clue than I do.<br>
<br>
When I have stuff, I might go to the web sites and check prices, but I know the prices I find will be high.  So I might &quot;taking offers&quot; on something that used to be 5k.  If someone offers 500, I know it's low.  If someone says 2k, that's probably reasonable.<br>
<br>
I think that's typical. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umarttog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marttog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#778899>(11/30/01 10:08:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: opposite buff beggers</span><hr size=1> I agree with Wolfy on all the points she's made so far.<br>
<br>
I never respond to a &quot;looking for port&quot;, only reponse to a &quot;donating for port&quot; when I have nothing better to do, and will always respond to a second &quot;offering xx for port&quot; (I assume &quot;greedy&quot; people will jump at the first one).  Why?   I want to at least know that the person feels my time and mana are worth something, not to mention the portal fragment for a TL.<br>
<br>
When Velious came out, I just *just* into levl 30.   I bought my IC Gate spell from the gypsies and gated into IC.  About a minute later I as sitting at my bind point, naked, and level 29.  Since the gate spell was level 30, I was stuck!<br>
<br>
What did I do?   I scrounged up 100pp, and 2 shouts of &quot;Looking for a port to IC for 100pp&quot; later,  a ride from a fellow wizard. <br>
<br>
I could have looked for a charity port for CR, but I was in a hurry (I needed to log) and knew that I would find a port faster and easier for 100pp.   Simple economics.<br>
<br>
As for Wolfy's other point, I often don't know the &quot;going&quot; price for melee items so I /auc for offers.   I always take the first reasonably sounding offer I get.  If I do look up a price first, I accept anything above 50% of the eqprices quote.  A couple of times, someone offered me well above the value stated on eqprices, and I sold it to them for the eqprices value because I don't like ripping people off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#778899>(11/30/01 10:39:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: opposite buff beggers</span><hr size=1> If I have a real price in mind for selling, I won't take higher.

<br>
I've been told time and time again that my jewelcraft prices are lower than others -- yet I'm making a nice profit for what I charge.  (I occasionally have had people suggest I'm trying to rip people off -- I don't respond very well to these people.)<br>
<br>
Most people are pretty decent people.  The not-decent people just leave a longer-lasting impression.<br>
<br>
I think I'm the norm, not the exception, when it comes to the decent things I do.  (We won't need to get into those parts of my personality some people don't like.)<br>
