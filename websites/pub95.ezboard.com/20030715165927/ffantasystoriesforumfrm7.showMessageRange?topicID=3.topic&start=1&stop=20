Black claws tapped against granite walls. The pedastal that held the gargoyles were starting to chip and wear away with the weather- well, what weather made it through the canopy. This wasn't a gargoyle, though. Night time did make this creature more active, but wasn't necessary by any means. Darkness enveloped the creature wherever it went, as it was part shadow, part goblin; a Darkling.<br>
<br>
The first approached. Oh well, one meal was as good as the next... The only real question was this... How far to let it into the temple before decapitation and mutilation? Or should we go with combustion? Disembowling, filleting, or maybe just skinning and torture? Oh, the possibilities... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udahnyella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnyella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 10:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  crused memories</span><hr size=1> She stood in the dark waiting, her demon wings folded under her cloak, her midnight skin leaving her invisible to the eye. They were here... Yes, she could taste them now. Blood it awaited her, it was time to dine. Aqua eyes flared crimson, in success, chesnut hair wisped about her hair in the wind. The trap was set, except HE was here too. He looked for survival, much like herself.<br>
<br>
Movement caught her eye, it was time... Pushing her muscular but elegant form to its feet, she sneaked to the temple. Inside, she thought, I'll be there, he would never wait there.<br>

His axe came at them but she parried with her tail easily, she was quick.

Aqua eyes turning onto the cloaked man, anger swirling in their core, &quot;And you stop this foolishness,&quot; she warned as her tail latched onto his axe and ripped it from his grasp.

Black, corded muscles snaked their way around her throat as I put her in a headlock. My feet wrapped around her stomach, and I latched on like a wolverine. I nibbled softly (welllll, as softly as one can nibble with miniature daggers for teeth) on her ebony ear, and whispered, &quot;Why is it that I always find the beauties...&quot; Arcane energies swirled around him. A paralyzing aura of shadow engulfed them both, taking them deeper into the temple. All of a sudden, the shadows parted, and massive spikes of gold all along the wall were digging into her stomach. The wall stopped moving when small trickles of liquid oozed from her midnight skin.<br>

She was light headed from the kneck hold she had been in and decided the man above her looked too strong to grapple with at the moment, so she decided to end it quick.  putting her weight on her arms, she lifted herself up and swung her feet high in the air before doing a back flip and hitting the man square between the eyes with her powerful kick.  He went flying back and landed with a loud clash 20 feet away.  Before he had time to react Creepy had run into the darkness of the tunnel, leaving only the sound of her giggles behind.  &quot;alone.&quot;  she thought to herself, &quot;no one to betray you if you're alone.  not like paradise betrayed you.&quot; <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 11:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Play with me?</span><hr size=1> Creepy ran into the same tunnel the figure yet to be seen was looking for. ~she know my tunnel! hehehe, I follow.

<br>
Jerking my head away from the lovely gargoyle's neck, I stared through the walls of illusion I'd constructed. I forgot all about that little shadow-walking child and the pale woman, *and* the man in the armor, for that matter. Looking back at him, he seemed like a dark elf- this was getting dangerous if Menzoberranzen or Neriak were sending their scouts! If these elves knew of the tomb...<br>
<br>
But no, he was the least of my worries. He was still outside the temple. If anything, I'd have thought that it would be *him* that passed through the correct corridors. At least I had supremecy in this place- the very foundation was a spell form that enhanced my innate darkling abilities. I was near omnipotent in this fortress of shadow!<br>
<br>
Letting my legs and arms fall from the lovely gargoyle, I dropped and scurried away. With me off her back, she had enough room to back away from the golden spikes, but that was little comfort. I could almost *hear* her sigh of relief when the illusion faded; thankfully, the wounds remain from Mind Traps. Besides, it's not like gargoyles can even touch the Tomb without being fried- they're supposed to stay *out*side the compound.<br>
<br>
Speeding through the shadows, I translocated to the trip wire spot; the exact place where I'd placed strands of mana to alert me if someone crossed. Two had crossed- two would die. Melting into the shadows, my body sped along like darkness itself, and I finally came across the easier to spot of the two- a pale, sleeping woman with a knife in her hand. My face emerged slowly from the shadows along the wall, and I gazed down at my next meal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 12:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ^.^</span><hr size=1> ~fun, fun, fun, fun~ popping out of the shadows partially, a small girl studies Creepy's face. ~pretty!

Her eyes twiched open and she was on her feet.  She took a fighting stance and peered into the darkness around her.  She whispered a few words to herself and her eyes glowed red, allowing her to see in the near blackness of the tomb.  That was one of the few spells she had managed to master from Paradise.  She heard a faint giggling coming from the shadows behind her and a heavy, dark breathing, from the shadow in front of her.<br>
