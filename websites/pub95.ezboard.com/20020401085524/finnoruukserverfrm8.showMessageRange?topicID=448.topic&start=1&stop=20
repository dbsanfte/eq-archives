Usually guilds complain that their 'dirty laundry' should not be aired publically but posted on their own boards, but in this case the player was not allowed a voice on their board even.  Posts like this happen as a result.  <br><br>Personally, I believe that a guild officer should have had the courtesy to discuss the guild's position with the player in game, even if they had to wait a month to catch the player on to do so.<br><br>I myself am hardly able to play like before, due to RL demands, and each time I am able to log on, I am proud to see my guildtag above my name.

It wasn't any officers logging aliya on we assumed it was her sister logging aliya on.  Really what we do in av is none of your buisness.  And fwiw Aliyas post was moved into the members only section of our messege board and wasn't deleted.  In the 2 years av has been around only a handful of people have been removed.  so i guess you can believe what you want.  I'm sure this thread will be filled up with 1000 reasons of why av is evil.   <p><BR><img src="http://www.ashenvendetta.com/analia/analiasol.jpg"USEMAP="#Analia" Border="0"><Map name="Analia"><area shape="rect" coords="118, 137, 195, 168"href="http://www.ashenvendetta.com"><area shape="rect" coords="118, 180, 194, 196"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8387"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unatallia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natallia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/22/02 7:21:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fnurt.net/~alex/pics/ebay.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I hurt inside</span><hr size=1> Beamishperson...<br>I think his point is that 7-day players have to leave AoW not because they are asked to, but because their crappy dial up connections can't support 60+ people.<br>It's therefore unfair to them to not get a shot at AoW because of the sheer number of weekend warriors and so the weekend warriors are being asked to leave the guild in order for the guild to focus on its goals.<br><br>At least, that's what I got from Solinar's post.

Not that occasional players should be shunned, but it makes sense for a guild to do raids to equip their core players. Just my opinion.<br><br>And here's more of my unsolicited opinion, because I am avoiding work: keeping a raid to lower numbers benefits everyone, not only by reducing lag but by forcing attendees to play their best. In my experience having more than three groups in one place at one time reduces the fun, overall.<br><br>About AV and guildremoving particular members I have no opinion and no reliable basis for forming one.<br><br> <p><img src=http://iseult.sidhe.freewebspace.com/images/samira.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unatallia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natallia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/22/02 7:50:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fnurt.net/~alex/pics/ebay.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I hurt inside</span><hr size=1> Good luck doing AoW with 3 groups~~<br>teehee<br><br>(yes, I know that's not what you meant!)<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=samira>Samira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/22/02 7:56:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I hurt inside</span><hr size=1> Three groups of rangers like you could take him.
