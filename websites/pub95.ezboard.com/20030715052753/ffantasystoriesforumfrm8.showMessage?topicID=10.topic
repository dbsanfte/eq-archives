The drawings were his creations; not something that's gonna screw him over in the end, JUST like the rest of them... They all screwed him over. Now they won't have another chance...<br>
<br>
&quot;Your artwork is great!&quot; Jacquie told him. She was always kind. Understanding. Sweet, caring, all the things that they weren't. Good thing she didnt know where they came from.<br>
<br>
Vince set down the pen. He picked up the piece of charcoal, and began shading and darkening all over the paper. A bit more blood here, and more shadows there... recreate the scene. The dumpsters were always drawn perfectly, the bed posts were flawless. Every time he made a work of art, he could redraw it, time and time again.<br>
<br>
A knock came at the door. Vince grabbed the cup of coffee at the desk, and shut the reading lamp off. Too much heat anyways, the paper would catch on fire again. The entire apartment was spotless. White walls were perfectly clean, the white carpet was soft and plush, without stains at all. The tile in the kitchen was black and white checkered, and the bathroom had none of the classic stenches that most men tend to leave in them. Vince smiled to himself as he looked through the peep hole. It was the pizza man, Tom.<br>
<br>
~Tom. We hate Tom. You *KNOW* we hate Tom.~<br>
<br>
{I know.}<br>
<br>
~So why does he come now? Why does he seek entry to the Palace?~<br>
<br>
{Will you stop calling it that? It's a fuckin apartment!! And besides, he's just bringing me pizza, that's all.} Vince shook his head to clear his thoughts. Back on track now...<br>
<br>
The knob turned, and Vince's sour expression at being interrupted instantly dissipated. In it's place was a big smile, one that he wears any time people are around. After all, they may feel the danger if he wasn't friendly, and fear can ruin a good thing...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey hey, what's happenin, Vincent?&quot; Tom moved inside with his black slacks and Pizza Hut(tm) ((&lt;---I am NNNNOT gettin sued)) shirt stinking of cheap cologne. Aqua Velva. Vincent knew the scent by heart after the trip through Wal-Mart. Then again, he knew all the fragrances he came across... because *HE* was special...  <br>
<br>
Vince shuddered at the improper usage of his name. It didn't matter. Tom would be gone soon enough. He sat down on the white couch, propping his feet up on the glass coffee table that sat in front of the 40&quot; TV set. Sure. He'd be gone soon...<br>
<br>
The thin man clad in fishnets and baggy leather pants moved into the kitchen, trying not to think about the dirt that revolting guest was tracking on the carpet. He filled a plain glass full of water, and plopped in three ice cubes. &quot;Tom,&quot; he said. &quot;Uhh, how much is my pizza?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not now, Vincey, tha game's on! Damn, son, what's wrong with you, this is the match of the century!&quot; The pizza box was sitting on the white leather sofa. The sofa. The SOFFFFFAAAAA! Vince emitted a low growl, but stifled it as he smiled at Tom. Vince sat in the chair next to him, and sat down his glass, smiling as politely as possible.<br>
<br>
The young man with back swept black spikes picked impatiently at his calf-high leather boots. The steel soles were perfectly kept; after all, it wouldn't do to have any dirt soiling his beautiful PALAC- apartment. He turned to the TV; golf. GOLF. Few sports were as excrrrrRRRUTIATINGLY *boring*! &quot;TOM!&quot; Vince said, trying to keep his cool. &quot;Dude, just let me eat my damn pizza. I'm in the middle of another piece, man, I gotta finish it tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tom had his hand already inside the pizza box. ~Don't dooo it, Tom~ the little voice kept warning. ~He's gonna beat ya... hard... don't dooo ittt~ &quot;Vincent. The only person you show that @#%$ to is that Jackelline girl or whatever. C'mon. Is it *really* that important?&quot; The pizza was halfway to his mouth by now...<br>
<br>
Chomp. Chomp. Vince watched the muscles in his jaw chew the pizza. Pepperoni and sausage were ground into the man's black mustache as he chewed. Chew chew...<br>
<br>
Tom's fingers reached for Vince's glass. &quot;Damn, I'm thirrr...&quot; The fingers were a foot away from the glass. Half a foot. Five inches. Four. Three. Two...<br>
<br>
Vince was up on his chair, standing with knees bowed. He drew a blade from the sheath at his left hip, and hissed. The Italian's fingers dropped to the glass coffee table shortly after, small pools of blood flowing outwards to the upturned edges. &quot;Yyyyyyyou *ATE* my PIZZAAAHHH!&quot;<br>
<br>
His 24&quot; blade was serrated on one side, with a black hilt, dazzled with interwining gold strands. It was his preeecciouss.... ~You damn Tolkien freak...~ {NOT NOW!!} Vince's hand was under the rude man's throat in a matter of seconds. He didn't even have time to scream in pain, as he was stunned. Shock really *was* a psycopathic, homicidal creature of the night's best friend...<br>
<br>
He slammed the pizza man down onto the glass table. Vince made sure to import the strongest glass, and have the edges upturned. It wouldn't *do* to have blood on his carpet... Tom tried to scream, and Vince stradled the man with a knee on each shoulder, pinning him down. Every time so much as a cry came from his mouth, Vince pounded his jaw with the set of brass knuckles that so conveniently never leave his pocket. Always be prepared, they said... Tom shouted, and his jaw was quickly broken. Vince smiled as he watched the blood trickle down from his new friend's mouth. Tom spat a tooth at him, and he smiled again. With the blade, Vince cut horizontally from one shoulder to the other. &quot;YA WANNA KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE CLASS WAS IN SCHOOL? HUH!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vince grabbed the scalpal from his other pocket. The rest of the weapons were too far away right now... DAMN! From the base of the throat, all the way down to the navel, he made a light slice. Experience stayed his hand when he wanted to plunge it down into the revolting human's stomach... After all, Vince needed more skin. His coat was decaying. ~Lecter is GOD!~ {GOD DAMN YOU!!! Go make biscuits or something!}<br>
<br>
Tom screamed again, and this time Vince unhinged the pizza man's jaw. With another swipe of his scalpal, half of Tom's jaw was hanging out. He was STILL SCREAMING, GOD DAMN IT!!! One slice, two slice... easy glide upwards... THERE! Vince removed the Tom's tongue, and waggled it in front of his face. The pizza man's eyes were wide with horror, his shirt (or the remains) stained with blood, and his entire abdomen was gushing. He got an arm loose... *BAM!* Vince was decked in the head by the man. Oof... strong mother fucccc...<br>
<br>
The little freak rolled onto his side, and the room stopped spinning. Tom was crawling to the door, suffering from massive blood loss... and... and...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BUTTFUCKKIN COCKKSUCKER'S GETTIN BLOOD ON MY GOD DAMNED FUCKIN ***CARRRPEEEEETTTTTT!!!!!*** &quot;RrrrrRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!&quot; Vince howled through the air like a devil cat, swinging around the blade he drew previously. The hilt spun in his hands like a top as Vince sailed through the air, two feet above the dirty, bloody mess that was stinking up HIS domain! He grabbed the hilt with both hands, and cleaved off the left arm just below the elbow, cutting clean through the bone. Vince cackled wildly, standing above the helpless victim. Tom looked up with fear in his eyes. DAMN! There's that fear again... Vince wiped the blood from his eyebrows where it splattered up onto his face. Time to end his fear. He gripped Tom's hair and pulled his head up with one hand, and drew back the blade with the other. One clean slash, and the pizza boy's head was severed from his body.<br>
<br>
Vince looked at the scene as he dropped the head onto his floor. {Never killed someone in my own *apartment* before...}<br>
<br>
~Ain't it great?~<br>
<br>
{................................<br>
<br>
.........................<br>
<br>
...............<br>
<br>
.......<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Yea!}<br>
<br>
He wiped the blood from his hands, and touched the paper he'd been working on. Mmmm... red... Well, a dash of color won't hurt, will it? Vince crumpled up the previous drawing where he massacred seven people who let their dogs urinate on the lawn outside the building, and set to a new sheet of paper. The first thing sketched out was the head.<br>
<br>
Quickly followed by the pizza, which was devoured after the drawing, but before the carpet cleaning.... &quot;Hey, Jacquie, guess what?&quot;<br>
<br>
From the other end of the phone came, &quot;.......Vince?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm... Nice to hear from ya! .....but it's 3 in the morning. What do you need?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I finished another drawing...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=10.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8>Stories by:  Mindles Kali</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
