Her black hair was plastered on her head with sweat and blood. Large black and blue bruises covered her body. She had been bleeding from several open wounds and sours, but now the blood had thickened and formed hard crusts over her hurts. She was laying in the bottom most level of the ship. Heavy chains ran from her wrists and ankles and fastened on blots in the floor. The room was pitch black, and the only sounds that could be heard was the crash of the waves on the sides of the ship and the occasional squeek of a sea rat. She moaned as she tried to roll over on her side but the chains held tight and prevented that movement. She was dreaming. This dream however was unlike any dream she had ever had before, because it wasn’t really a dream. She was reliving a moment in her life, over and over again. She was dreaming of the events that happened just a few weeks prior; back when she was safe and happy. <br>
<br>
<br>
She had grown up in a small cottage just outside of Qeynos. She lived there with her mother and father and they were happy. She would help her mother during the days and wait for her father to get home to tell her stories. One day her mother had sent her into town to buy a few supplies, and when she came home her life ended. Well, the life she had known ended, the life of peace and happiness and fantasy. Her life of misery, pain, suffering, and hate was just beginning. When she came in the front door, there were men waiting for her. They had slain her mother and father, undressed them, and posed the corpses in a very unflattering and sick manner. The men beat her and raped her and took her with them aboard their ship. Every time she relived this day in her head she felt guiltier. She was young and there was nothing she could have done, but she didn’t think that was any excuse. Every time she opened the door, she screamed louder then she had done before.<br>
        That had happened three weeks ago. The carefree girl who had lived in the little cottage just outside of Qeynos with her mother and father was now rotting away in the bottom of a boat, an orphan and a slave. Her wounds had become infected and they smelt bad. Under any other circumstance this would have been a bad thing, but ever since that had happened the men had stopped raping her. Now they just ignored her. She hadn’t eaten for days.<br>
        Thunder cracked loudly in the sky and as it did she opened her eyes. Briefly she wondered how long she had been unconscious for but then realized that it didn’t really matter. She prayed and implored all the gods she could think of to let her die. After three weeks of constant pain, she found that it didn’t bother her much anymore. It was the emotions that ate away at her soul. Anger, hate, guilt, and every other imaginable dark emotion plagued her mind. She would amuse herself sometimes by thinking of all the ways she could kill the men who had done this to her. She was actually imagining crushing their skulls with a hammer when she heard the voices coming down the stairs.<br>
        “What’ll we do with the bitch?”<br>
        “I say we kill her.”<br>
        “Wait, don’t be too hasty.”<br>
        “I’m surprised she isn’t dead already.”<br>
        “Lets kill her.”<br>
        “But lets have some fun with her first.”<br>
        “Give her hope that she’ll survive!”<br>
She pretended to be asleep as the laughing men approached her and gathered around. They kicked her several times to wake her up. Her vision was foggy, but she strained her eyes to memorize the faces that gazed down at her. “Good morning little lady!” said the man with the thick beard. The girl remained silent. “Oh, don’t want to talk do ya?” he reached down and slapped her. The girl had no more tears to cry, so she laughed. “Why you little bitch!” The man proceeded to kick her with such force that her wrists and ankles began to bleed again as they strained against the metal cuffs. “Feel like laughing now?” The men all laughed, and several of them spit on the girl. “We’ve decided to let you go at the next port.” The girl had heard their conversation and knew this wasn’t true. She wanted to speak, to tell them to go to hell, that she would see that they would all hang for this, but she found that she couldn’t muster a sound, her mouth and throat too dry. “You wouldn’t go reporting us to the authorities would ya? I mean we are nice enough to let you live.” The man sounded utterly unconvincing, but he was amused by his jokes. <br>
        “Let’s make sure she doesn’t tell anyone.” Suggested another man.<br>
        “Yeah, and I’ve got just the thing to make sure of that.” Said another man.<br>
The girl’s body contorted and squirmed as the men held her mouth shut. A needle was slowly pushed into her lower lip and then out again through her upper lip. This proceeded until her entire mouth was sewn shut. The pain was too much and she began to choke on her own blood. The world dissolved into darkness as her mind once again slipped into unconsciousness. The men stood by admiring their work. “She looks kind of creepy eh?”<br>
        “Yeah. Let’s throw this bitch overboard.”<br>
<br>
When she hit the cold dark waters, she revived. Her wrists and ankles were still bound, this time with barbed wire. She could not swim, and sank quickly beneath the waves. The ship disappeared in the foggy night.<br>
<br>
        The girl died in those waters. The currents carried her body a great distance and washed it up on the shores of the beech near Qeynos. The girl had returned home, but no one was left to bury her body. She lay on the beech under the cold night sky, with the stars twinkling and shining above her. Although this was the end of her life, and of this story, it was not the end for the girl . . .<br>
