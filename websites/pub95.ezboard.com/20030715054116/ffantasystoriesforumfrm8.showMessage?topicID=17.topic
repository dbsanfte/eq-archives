Most were Mexicans, and they almost tasted as bad as the other drugged up Caucasians. The one African just screamed like a girl before he bit the dust, but then again...<br>
<br>
They all did. Hahah!<br>
<br>
There were three dead bodies laying on the ground. Granted, the pale undead man didn't care much for the taste of valium and lsd in the blood stream, but it made for interesting dining anyways. Anything that made the colors stand out, eh? Crawf, with a limp wrist, rose his fingers delicately to his nostrils. &quot;Care to repeat that first comment, little man?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;L-L-L-Look, ese, we got no beef wit yoo! Jus... juss leave us alone, man!&quot; The small Mexican with sunglasses ((at NIGHT, mind you!!))'s little cronies started nodding in agreement. As if.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was it you called me?&quot; Crawf caressed the intricate detail of the silver-grafted plate on his chest. Being immortal, he found it quite amusing to infuse metal into his body. He had a few steel beams reinforcing his neck, a few vital ribs, the whole left ribcage &amp; pectoral muscles, and even his fingers and hands. Those silvery pegs jutted outwards, though... The brown canvass trench coat swirled out with the wind he created, for a bit of added effect, and it swished back his silvery gray hair. He licked another Ag+peg on his finger, and went back to tracing the eye on his chest plate.<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I said you were da man, man!&quot; This was pitiful. How awfully accented and out of character all these kids seemed... how painfully obvious their fear was. Crawff was nearly sick with the stench of it, and slowly grabbed the little Mexican's throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, 'ese', I'm not here to play games, and neither are you, what do you not GET about the question?&quot; Crawff's thumb depressed harder and harder with each passing second on his wind pipe. He snarled as he remembered the gunshot wound on that arm; it stung like hell to choke someone with the right hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ach-  urg... urk!&quot; was all that was left to be said. Crawff dropped the pitiful teen to the ground, chuckling merrily. Another tried to bolt, a caucasian. A carefully placed piece of trash intercepted him in mid-flight, and Crawff heartilly dug his hand into the spinal column, ripping muscle, tendon, &amp; sinew out along with the bone. The screams were deafening...<br>
<br>
A lead pipe to the back of the head made the vampire halt for a moment. Instead of stopping the mutilation, he sped it up, ripping the bone from the young man's body, and swinging it like a mace to catch another in the cheek. Utterly revolted, he staggered back with bits of his friends's bone fragments embedded within his cheek. Showy.<br>
<br>
Crawff really did love this; it was what he did best. Horribley mutilating the dastardly youth of America... and other such nations. A bullet became all too acquainted with Crawff's chest plate, and he hurled his attacker into the gun wielder. Three more attempted to mob him, and he suffered two fist blows and a chain laceration before apprehending the knife from another. With inhuman agility, he leapt into the air, and came down on the gun wielder's head. A quick slice spilled blood all over the concrete and trash in the alley, and four gunshots rendered the other assailants incapable of anything over crawling for their lives. &quot;Now, the fun begins,&quot; he mused.<br>
<br>
There was one fresh leg on the nearest one. Crawff bent down and bit off the knee cap with titanium tipped fangs; it wouldn't do to have them chip, would it? With a twist and a yank, followed by sickening tearing sounds, the leg came off, as well as a few sinewy tendons that slided out of the thigh muscle. Grabbing hold of these and boot laces, Crawff proceded to suffocate the life out of the kid with a boot to the back of the head and the leg under the throat.<br>
<br>
The next wasn't so lucky. Two spiked, sharpened hands with centuries of experience dove into a soft, human body, and retrieved two organs; a kidney, which was bit for the last bit of adrenaline from the glands and then discarded, and a line of small instenstine. Whether or not this one was dead yet didn't factor in to the third one, who wasn't more than two feet away from him. He began tying the young man's hands and feet together with his buddy's intestine, and strung him up on the fire escape. Blood stained Crawff's perfectly pale chest, as well as burning gastric juices, as he strung the man up to hang from his neck; but something was missing.<br>
<br>
A board. A two by four that was just about the armspan of this kid... would do perfectly! Two nails... well, a railroad tye from a dumpster and a rusted icepick from the kid's jacket sufficed as nails to pound through the already suffocating child's wrists, pinning them to the board. Only problem was that the board was a little short, and he had to bend the elbows back a bit to compensate. It wasn't a pretty, or even natural, crucifiction, but it would do for now.<br>
<br>
The fourth was leaving a bloody trail as he struggled down the street, and he turned left as he rounded the alley. There were sirens coming close- too close. Crawff spun the 8mm on his finger as he strolled outwards. He saw the kid about ten yards away, using the wall and various structures as a crutch to make his slow, hobbling get away. Fukk it; Crawff aimed one shot that took the kid down, directly to the spinal column... or somewhere near it. He preferred the former, so as to keep his vampiric pride.<br>
<br>
Two squad cars came racing down the street on both sides. The one on the left had a passenger, the right, none. Two shots, and each driver had a hole in his head. One crashed into a deserted newspaper stand, and in the other, the riding officer attempted to guide the wheel. He was doing a good job until he hit the garbage truck... guess he didn't get to the breaks in time?<br>
<br>
Crawff didn't care. He was full. The adrenaline on his tongue was burning, and little angelic emanations with their heavanly orchestra were playing for him; yes, quite a job well done, eh little Cherubs? Ohh, how he lusted to perform upon them, as well! They would see exactly JUST how precise and skilled he really was when the subject had a pain threshold of more than....<br>
<br>
