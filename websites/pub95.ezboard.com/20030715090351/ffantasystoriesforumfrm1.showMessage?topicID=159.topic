She arose early. Needing to perform the Waltz of Blades. A calming ritual she was taught to develop the correct instincts for a warrior, uncanny speed and a kinship with their weapons. Andareil was very skilled with the trance like state it brought.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it took hours to do properly and was done with fewer clothes than is normally okay. She preformed it anyway. Her body swaying back and forth holding a ornate long sword between her hands her head lolling around her shoulders as her upper body swayed suddenly as if to some unknown tune as she snapped upright drawing her sword into her right hand. She was ambidextrous, but favored her right.<br>
 She spun around her ponytail trailing as her blade whipped out at unseen attackers, doing an impressive melee of slashes, ripostes, parries all possible sword movements.  A dance of death, fitting to her soon to be title.<br>
*    *    *<br>
<br>
(On the rooftops 100 miles away)<br>
  Great ivory wings spread out from atop a cross like protrusion. Long raven locks blew back in the cold winds of Underdark. Various long white plumes mixed in. his upper body was bare. Revealing a toned torso and arms. At his forearms it seemed he became quite metallic at the cruel looking gantlets encasing his arms long bladelike fingers going long past a human’s normal length. His face was very attractive. A tribute to humanity if he was even that. His eyes where those of a bird of prey. Lacking all emotion being fiery amber. A loose black sash was tied around his waist keeping a pair of hakama on. Moving down to his bare feet nearly covering them. He brushed his overly long bangs and feathers out of his sight<br>
<br>
“Andareil is it?”  He mused silently, crossing his arms at his chest.<br>
<br>
“The Death Angel…Hahah” he laughed softly shaking his head.<br>
<br>
“ A long bloody road…. Why do these damned marks even exist?” he reached his metallic hand behind him caressing the damned thing softly<br>
<br>
  He flared his wings upward crouching low as he propelled himself forward catching the wind in his wings as he flapped hard flying easily.<br>
<br>
*   *   *<br>
(In the Ka’Ryusa Compound-Andareil’s home)<br>
<br>
“Andareil hold still!” her maids nearly yelled at her, placing and buckling the final assortment of her armor, crafted of flawless adamanite bands, attached together by thin chain mail. The largest bang around her bust. A chain mail looking corset going down her torso. And like that adamantie band chain mail. A thick leather belt slung loosely around her hips weighted down on one side by a finely crafted long sword.<br>
<br>
Andareil rolled her eyes as the maids busied themselves making sure he was fully inside of her armor it was buckled properly her sword was okay, hair and that crap.<br>
<br>
So very annoying…all she needed is one other person to help,<br>
<br>
“Go away!” she waved her hands at the maids as they scurried repressing a growl.<br>
<br>
“Heh” a masculine voice laughed softly at the doorway’s direction smiling softly she turned around seeing her friend from the other day. A slim violet robe was around him keeping his lithe figure well, he was attractive she guessed. He was such a loner thou, she suddenly smiled and crossed her arms   slanting her body making her left hip a lot more obvious ”How do I look?”<br>
<br>
“Beautiful as always Milady Ka’Ryusa” he smiled lightly<br>
<br>
“..Heh, Shall we?” she held out a crooked arm to him as he interlaced his walking with her.<br>
<br>
Smiling lightly they removed themselves from the palace moving toward the colliesum, the holding of the accession ceremony, for those who become full reavers.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *  *<br>
<br>
 The speech finished made by the high priestess of Lloth. Andareil was the first on the battleground, the dim smell of blood was everywhere, the sweat, pain, confusion and the ecstasy of triumph, she closed her eyes, all of the noble families where watching as well as a few of the lesser,<br>
<br>
A test. Life or death, against a creature that matched your strength and skills exactly.<br>
<br>
 Her eyes snapped open   a muscular demon woman stood before her, draconic like heritage. Hair like ice flowed down her back, moving to her waist. Her face was set in a calm expression, expressive sky blue eyes reside, peering at Andareil with some interest. Her skin was very pale, sliver scales dotted every now and then. Her forearms where home to many of these as they became large cruel looking claws, she was attractive if not for the claws. The Bra like human skin top, And a loincloth   pristine bandages where wrapped to her mid thigh, and around her upper arms.<br>
“Now, for the first match of the day we have Andareil Ka’Ryusa and the Dragoness. Kra’Valevis. Dragon of Storms.<br>
Lets see what our Death angel can do!” the announcer cheered on them both as Andareil and the Dragoness bowed to each other. Andareil drawing her long sword keeping it low at her side the tip touching the dried gore of the earth.<br>
<br>
The dragoness didn’t move at all, she stood their awaiting andareil’s move, they where both studying each other closely, trying to find weakness in their stance, Kra found one as she dived forward into a roll, blazing forth leaping up high into the murky air, her gigantic claws held high as she came down slamming her arms down as Andareil used the flat of her blade as a block. Growling as she twisted the blade and her torso around sending the dragoness into the earth face first, as she twirled the blade around she began to circle. It weaving between both of her capable hands. In a blink of an eye the dragoness ran forward performing a diving kick connecting hard to Andareil. Spinning around she raked her claws across the adamantie breastplate creating sparks.  Landing hard on her back she rolled backwards quickly avoiding a stomp of her foot. Dancing backward blade in hand. She raised it to the heavens. Raising her right hand blade in the air, pointing her left palm open as the blade glowed a bright blue. As it flowed down into andareil’s arm creating a trail of electric blue energy. Gathering up it all up into a tight ball,<br>
<br>
Kra stood tall. She smirked softly revealing a row of startling sharp teeth.<br>
As she spread her arms to her sides, spiraling ice colored mana began to gather at both of her claws. They stood like that, gathering mana, the lifeblood of the universe. Until there were both ready, the air around Kra was nearly sub zero her breath came out like mist as she raised her claws high, Andareil stood their her palm outstretched, static energy making some of her hair spike up. They launched their spells at the exact same moment two icicle spears launched out flying toward Andareil, as she screamed out an arcane word of power sending a blue shockwave out blinding light followed, energy crackled, the force of lighting flew out from her hand sending her flying backwards it ripped the icicles apart and hit Kra dead on. Her body convulses with   the electric charges firing off inside of her brain charring her flesh, as she hit the earth hard.  Her body twitching at random intervals. Heart stopping after a final gasp. Andareil got up softly gasping for air. That was a very. Very powerful lighting spell<br>
“Sweet Lloth! That was  Blue Dragon Strike!” he announcer blinked, many of the mages looked up knowing that was one of the few dragon/ high mage only spells…they turned there   sense to Andareil, realizing she had almost broken a rib from that fly back.<br>
<br>
“Ow…” Andareil sat up with a groan, a bad migraine bringing to build up at the use of such a powerful spell…wows!<br>
<br>
 She held her head between her hands as two guards helped her up to the healer’s room.<br>
<br>
The dragoness was picked up and taken to an opposite healer’s room.<br>
<br>
 (On a spire nearby the colliesum)<br>
<br>
Ivory wings spread wide, darkened visage showing out, hawk like eyes peering down from atop the impossible large spire.<br>
<br>
“…Blue Dragon spell…Interesting, Very few mages can master any of the Dragon line of spells.” he smiled lightly, closing his eyes<br>
<br>
 * *  *<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Andareil shot up awake in the healer’s beds. Her banded armor removed gauze like wrapping around her chest<br>
“!” She scanned the area as she slipped out of the covers blinking, at her nakedness as she hopped right back in.<br>
“Sorry!”  A lowly male healer said, bowing to her ”We took your clothes to make sure you wouldn’t hurt yourself again…. Please forgive me,” he said worried that one of her sisters was a priestess…they loved those snake whips so much. He shivered visibly as Andareil smiled lightly<br>
“No its okay, Just, Um did you see a Male in violet robes?” she asked hopefully<br>
“Yeah…He said he was a friend of yours named, Kor’arachne?”<br>
<br>
Andareil smiled softly” could you find me some normal clothes and let him in?” she asked softly tilting his chin up to look at her.<br>
 He blushed hotly breaking away from her grip as he walked off, Andareil sighed lightly as he turned with a simple white robe. She put it on half glaring at it<br>
<br>
“I can’t see my legs” she sighed softly as a very familiar laugh made her look up<br>
<br>
“Hi Kor” she smiled lightly<br>
“Hey Andy, Heh I just had the scariest image. You as a priestess…” he smiled rather darkly as she walked very close to him<br>
“Oh I know how much those snake whips turn you on,” she laughed evilly as she learned into his shoulder to nip at his ear, they both broke into soft laughter stepping away.<br>
<br>
<br>
She blinked, as the jovial expression was lost, she stood still, her eyes scanning around<br>
“Andy? -“<br>
“Shut up Kor,” she said briskly, a commanding tone that remember him of his sister shivering softly<br>
<br>
“…Do you here. Wings flapping?” she asked softly her ears twitched very lightly<br>
<br>
“. @#%$!” she tackled him down pinning him underneath her they both cried out in unison as the top half of the room disenigrated.<br>
<br>
<br>
A winged man flew past spinning around energy trailing from the tips as his wings flared out landing, a strange eldritch wood handle and skin wrapped handle was in his hands a crackling energy blade, like harnessed lighting thundered sending sparks everywhere the man’s predator like eyes narrowing as Andareil leaped up in a crouch, growling heavily. Wanting her armor badly, her eyes flashed violet for a second as her armor suddenly mineralized on her sending out various sparks as she crouched low, drawing forth her long sword, its mithirl shined brightly in the darkness<br>
<br>
“Who in Lloth’s name ARE you!” she growled out her eyes flashing deadly at the winged man, which she found oddly beautiful. As her wing marks throbbed<br>
<br>
“Death” he said in a dramatic whisper, raising the blade high. As she did the same, their stances matching perfectly<br>
<br>
 Kor stood again, blinking, the Angelic man and Andareil are stood there. He was scared for her. He could sense the raw power emanating from the man’s skin. And that sword. Ether harnessed like that was simply impossible!<br>
<br>
“Andariel BECAREFUL!”  He shouted cupping his hands around his mouth in an attempt to strengthen his yell.<br>
<br>

You're action scenes, although sometimes hard to follow, are excellent. Now I really want to see how the fight between the angel man and Andariel turns out. <br>
<br>
You mostly use active voice verbs which many writers find difficult to do, but it makes the story so much more interesting. <br>
<br>
You only need to improve on your grammar, and use the spellchecker more often. You'll definitely improve as you go along, just takes a little practice. You'll eventually get the feel of how to make things flow smoothly together.<br>
<br>
Anyway, you have me wanting more.
