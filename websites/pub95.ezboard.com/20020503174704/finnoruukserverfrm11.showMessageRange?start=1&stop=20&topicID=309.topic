The game may change but the people are what Id like to see the same. Innoruuk.com to me doesnt stand for the server rather the people who play the game EQ on that server.<br>
<br>
That said alot of people still dont understand &quot;Shadowbane&quot;. Its not going to be a &quot;EQ Slayer&quot; that will destroy EQ and take away all its people/players. EQ/innoruuk is non PvP and a style alot of people like. DAoC and Shadowbane are PvP RPG games in a differant class then EQ.<br>
<br>
Point of this post is to give you guys some info on some stuff I found out about what you can do in shadowbane and hope that anything anybody else finds/knows shares on this thread.<br>
<br>
My personal opinoin is Shadowbane is gonna be awesome and a sistergame to EQ. For me it means no EQ twinks anymore just my main Chubbies and replacing my twink time in a charecter in Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
Well to the point here is the info I found about how some of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          Building</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          Siege</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> work:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>          A guild starts by collecting massive amounts of gold, enough for a Tree of Life and hopefully a few buildings around it. Anyone with enough money can build a building -- not just a guild leader. <br>
<br>
The guild continues to make revenue, spending it on advancing their buildings in &quot;ranks&quot; just like players, from ranks 1 to 7.<br>
<br>
Each rank gives the owner of the building (who is the one who built it -- not always the guild leader) more NPC trainers/shopkeepers, more options and more &quot;production slots.&quot; More on that in a minute.<br>
<br>
Barracks allow you to create several different types of Guard Captian. A few examples being Captian, Archmage, Master Archer and so on. Each guard and capt, just like buildings, are ranked 1-7, (which is level 10-70 remember) increasing the rank of the barracks increases the level of your NPC guards.<br>
<br>
Guards can be given options such as waypoints/patrol routes, KOS/non-KOS lists, and will only act under the authority of who owns the barracks. (again not always the guild leader) This could even lead to civil wars in less disciplined guilds.<br>
<br>
Other buildings, such as the forge, has shopkeeper/production NPCs. They gave us this example of blacksmithing:<br>
A character with the blacksmith discipline builds a forge. The character then accesses the NPC(s) within and tells him, for example &quot;make me 4 swords.&quot; Each item takes up a production slot -- I beleive the starting level is four.<br>
These items will take time and gold to produce. When the owner comes back, the NPC gives the building owner a report of what could be made. So let's say he makes a &quot;Sword of crappiness,&quot; a &quot;Sword of Uberness,&quot; and a &quot;longsword.&quot; The quality and the frequency of good items depends on your smith's level, and your forge's rank. The owning player could then choose for the NPC to make (and therefore buy) the good items and discard (and not be charged at all) the low-quality ones.<br>
<br>
Now, how to seige!<br>
<br>
A Tree of Life does two things: allows you a place to respawn, and literally is the heart of your city. It works by providing a HP/second healing on all buildings within the radius of the tree. Like all things in SB, this can be upgraded to improve both the range and amount of building healing. This tree can be controlled at anytime by the guild leader to redistribute the healing. (and during a seige it would act as a &quot;fire hose&quot; effect) If the guild leader dies by any cause, he loses this ability for one hour.<br>
<br>
Attackers may build a war tent so they may also work in shifts. A seige attacker that dies still respawns at his ToL, but an attacker may go to the tent and log out. (if he needs to leave the game for awhile) Providing the tent is still standing, when he/she logs back in, they will be at the war tent.<br>
<br>
In addition to this, attackers may build a seige tent, which will produce an engineer. This NPC builds seige engines (catapults, trebuchets and ballistas) at the owner's command. There is nothing to stop the beseiged from doing this and firing from inside the walls, either. A seige ends when either the attackers are driven off or the tree is destroyed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  -You pick a Race<br>
-You pick a character Path<br>
-You pick a Class<br>
--These things will determine your starting Attributes, Skills, Combat Powers, Special Abilities, beginning Weapon Specs, starting equipment and equipment availability, starting safehold city<br>
<br>
Then you begin play in your starting safehold, which is a place you can live out of for your 1st 20 levels, and is adjacent to experience and hunting areas that are safe from PvP warfare. Or, you can venture to your Guild's main city if you wish at any time. Or explore deeper into the dangerous world, though survival would be doubtful.<br>
<br>
As you level you will earn Character Points that can be spent to increase all qualities of the Character.<br>
<br>
Eventually, at certain key levels (the exact levels have not been told to us yet, some people speculate at levels 10, 20, 30, or perhaps 10, 25, 40) you will have the chance to enhance your character in many ways through training in a new Discipline. A Discipline is almost as important a choice as your Class. It will open new things to your Character that your base Class never had (new equipment options, new skills, etc.).<br>
<br>
Consider taking a Discipline to be like guiding your Character down a certain new branch of development; like a new career that adds to your Character. Each available Disc is very specific in nature.<br>
<br>
You will, however, need to be careful how you spend your Character Points. You will not have enough CP to master all available skills from all 3 available Disciplines that you can take during your Character's life.<br>
<br>
Some people are of the opinion that taking more than 1 or 2 Disc is foolish since you could spread your Character too thin...and know many skills, but at a lower level of proficiency. Others, myself included, will tell you to take all 3, because they will probably provide certain bonuses automatically; and then you will just have to be careful not to spend your points all over the place.<br>
<br>
Some Classes, Disciplines and other things are restricted, locked and hidden from the players as they begin the game. Only exploration and questing will open these up to you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Will each “world” be a mirror image of each other?<br>
<br>
No.  In Shadowbane, all of our worlds (gaming environments) are completely unique. When the Turning occurred, Aerynth was literally torn asunder, broken into an array of fragments great and small. Each “world” or “server-cluster” in Shadowbane is one of these fragments, a portion of the original world. Rather than the identical &quot;mirrored&quot; worlds presented by other games in the current market, Shadowbane will consist of many interlinked &quot;world fragments&quot; scattered throughout a universe, each with their own unique feel and flavor. One fragment might be almost entirely jungle, while another could consist of frigid Arctic regions. Imagine the different worlds that might result if the Earth were to shatter, and you'll get the idea. Unlike most other online games, individual characters will be able to travel between world fragments through magical gates and portals. The traditional model of distinct, discrete &quot;servers&quot; will not exist in Shadowbane. <br>
<br>
<br>
2.08  Are there &quot;zones&quot;? <br>
<br>
No, not in the traditional sense: the landscape of each “world” is seamless. We may refer to various areas as a “zone”, like a Desert Zone or an Elven Ruin Zone, but there is no “Stop and Load” time associated with moving between them. Instead, the world is constantly loading around you as your character moves, keeping a preset circumference of terrain loaded around you at all times.  Further, this area is larger than your character can “see” - so there won't be blind spots as you travel around the world. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Is there Permanent Death?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No.  When your character &quot;dies&quot; in Shadowbane, they are brought back to life at the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; to which they are bound (usually in a nearby City.) <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Are Names Unique?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, character first names are unique on a server-by-server basis.  Characters who travel from one world to another will have their &quot;home world&quot; name attached, in order to allow other players to recognize them.  (For example, if Catherine the Great were to leave the World of Viriang and journey to the World of Dalgoth, her name would be displayed as Catherine from Viriang.)  This also allows players to easily recognize &quot;foreigners&quot; from other Worlds. Last names in Shadowbane are not unique: players can create entire clans of the same last name if they wish. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are Character Points?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At the beginning of Character Creation, you are given 30 points to help customize your Character.  Character Points are used to select your Race, obtain Talent and Trait Runes, and to modify your Character's Attributes.  Unspent Character Points are saved for later use in game (at no penalty to the player.) <br>
<br>
The following races are available to starting characters: <br>
<br>
Aelfborn: The Half Breeds, Children of Two Worlds <br>
Dwarves: The Shaper's Sons, Born of Stone <br>
Elves: The Firstborn, Kings in Exile <br>
Half Giants: The Brutes, Pillars of Strength <br>
Humans: The Sons of Men, Heirs of the All-Father <br>
Irekei: The Outcasts, Devil Men of the Burning Wastes <br>
Shades: The Pale Ones, Born of Darkness <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> RESTRICTED RACES[b/] that you must earn to play as:<br>
<br>
Aracoix(birdmen): The Wanderers, Born of the Wind<br>
Centaurs: The Horselords, Masters of the Plains <br>
Minotaurs: The Beastmen, Born of Magic<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are Base Clas</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Choosing your character's apprenticeship (also known as your &quot;base class&quot;) is perhaps the most important choice to make during Character Creation.  Players may choose one of the following four apprenticeships:  Fighter, Healer, Mage, or Rogue.  Bear in mind that some Races are restricted from taking certain classes.  A Dwarf, for example, cannot become a Mage. <br>
<br>
Choosing an apprenticeship will determine the base set of skills and powers available to your character.  In the course of gameplay, characters will be able to also choose a Specialty Class and a number of multi-class kits (or Disciplines) to gain additional skills and powers. <br>
<br>
Apprenticeships are selected, as with Races, by choosing a Runestone from the table of options.  There is no cost to obtain an Apprenticeship for your character. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PROFESSIONS<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
<br>
Fighter Professions:  Barbarian, Crusader, Huntress, Ranger, Templar, Warlock, and Warrior<br>
<br>
Healer Professions:  Channeler, Confessor, Crusader, Druid, Prelate, and Priest<br>
<br>
Mage Professions:  Assassin, Bard, Channeler, Fury, Warlock, and Wizard<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are Disc</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Disciplines are a form of multi-classing in Shadowbane, and represent a distinct area of expertise that a character can pursue. Some Disciplines focus on specific styles or types of combat, while others represent membership in specific groups, study in a particular school of magic, or even inborn supernatural abilities. While every character has only one Class, they may follow up to three Disciplines. As with their Specialty Class, a character joins a Discipline by attuning themselves to a Runestone for that Discipline.  <br>
<br>
All Disciplines convey some sort of benefit to those who seek to study or practice them. Some provide skill rating and attribute bonuses, and many also grant access to new Powers and Skills that would otherwise be unavailable. Some disciplines are specific to certain races and classes, and still more are hidden within the game and can only be found through gameplay.<br>
<br>
Note, however, that characters will always receive the same number of Practice Points to spend on Powers and Skills, including those obtained from Disciplines.  Thus disciplines provide more options to players, but not necessarily more power!<br>

<br>
Yes, there are no level restriction for grouping. As stated above, the larger the Group, the larger the Experience Bonus for the Group.  Each member gets experience based on what they would have gotten &quot;soloing&quot; the target (killing it by him or herself with no assistance), but it gets divided up based on how many Levels there are in the Group.  High level characters who travel with beginners may get 0 experience for a low level monster, but lower level members will still earn Experience from the engagement<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> GUILDS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How are Guilds different in Shadowbane?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Guilds within Shadowbane are more than a collection of players banded together for the sake of camaraderie: typically, the members of a Guild share common in-game goals and aspirations. There are several distinct Guild templates in Shadowbane, each built around a common profession, set of professions, field of mastery, or World view. Shadowbane Guilds also allow for the formation of dynamic City-States, Kingdoms, and Empires.  In Shadowbane, player created and controlled Guilds can claim and own territories within the virtual world, building entire Cities, strengthening their defenses, and increasing the effectiveness of their City's shops and buildings.  City building and territorial conquest are the primary activities of most Guilds. Because Cities are notoriously difficult to pack up and move around, Shadowbane Guilds tend to be more local and stationary than the player organizations seen in other games. A Guild's fortunes are bound to the health of its City and its territory within the game. Guilds may wander around initially, but after gathering enough power and resources, a Guild or an alliance of Guilds will usually settle down, founding or conquering a City-State to use as a home base, open marketplace, or military stronghold.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Shadowbane's game mechanics allow Guilds to pledge fealty to other Guilds, creating an entirely new realm of possibilities for political maneuvering and tactical warfare.  A dynamic, constantly changing political landscape will arise, with Guilds expanding into Kingdoms, Kingdoms merging into Empires, and Empires splintering under the strain of revolutions. Alliance, betrayal, and war will be commonplace, and the winners of this deadly game will be the shrewdest leaders, not the best fighters.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Are there different types of Guilds?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, as stated above, Shadowbane offers different Guild templates, each designed to favor certain professions, fields of mastery, or world views.  There are currently 13 different Guild Templates to choose from.  In order to found a Player Run Guild, you must choose and purchase one of the following Charters: <br>
<br>
Amazon Temple <br>
Barbarian Clan <br>
Church of the All-Father <br>
Dwarf Hold <br>
High Court <br>
Mercenary Company <br>
Military Legion <br>
Noble House  <br>
Ranger's Brotherhood <br>
Temple of the Cleansing Flame <br>
Thieves' Band <br>
Virakt <br>
Wizard's Conclave<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What's the difference between each Guild type?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Each Guild type has it's own unique view of the world, its own set of knowledge and lore.  To demonstrate this in the game, each Guild type has a set of 'Preferred Classes or Races' associated with it.  Note that these types of members are Preferred, not Mandatory: there are no Class or Race restrictions for any of the Guild types, and Shadowbane players are free to assemble and congregate as they see fit. There are, however, benefits and incentives for joining a Guild type that caters to the needs and ethos of your class. Guild Members who are members of the appropriate Race or Class will receive a bonus to all earned experience, as long as they remain members of that Guild.<br>
<br>
Each Guild type also has its own unique set of Titles and Ranks, allowing the Guild leadership to assign different ranks to different individuals, and award members for their loyal service.  There are no pre-requisites or in-game requirements for any of the lower Guild ranks: the leaders of a Guild are free to assign them however they desire. When dealing with the highest Guild ranks, however, there are some restrictions and prerequisites. The highest ranks in each Guild type are reserved for Guild Leaders who control a City and Guild Leaders who control a Nation.  Guild ranks and titles have no bearing on the powers and statistics of the characters who hold them - they are used for roleplaying and managerial purposes.<br>
<br>
Make sure that you do not confuse Guild rank with character Rank - the two are entirely different.  Guild rank (little 'r') denotes a character's status and position within their Guild. Character Rank (capital 'R') is a measure of a character's level and relative power (as described in the Character Development section of the FAQ).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Are there Guilds that are formed around Races instead of Classes?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, four Guild types grant Guild bonuses to members of a specific race as opposed to a profession.  The guilds and their respective races are:<br>
<br>
Dwarf Hold (Dwarves) <br>
High Court (Elves) <br>
Noble House (Humans) <br>
Virakt (Irekei) <br>
7.06  Will every character be a part of a Guild?<br>
<br>
Yes, but to account for players with more 'individual' styles, there will be a number of Guilds in the game that are not controlled by players. These 'GM-run Guilds' will be loose-knit organizations, whose members may or may not play cooperatively, as they choose. They will be tied to a common City-State (usually a Safehold) where they can train, purchase equipment, and heal.  These organizations will make up the oldest (and likely the largest) Guilds in the World of Shadowbane. GM-run guilds will not participate in territorial conquest or &quot;Guildwars,&quot; and can neither grow nor decline in power. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How does guild leadership work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
There are four levels of authority within every guild : <br>
<br>
The GUILD LEADER is in charge of the guild. He or she is ultimately responsible for all areas of guild management, including initiating and banishing members, promoting and demoting members in Guild rank, and controlling their City's Tree of Life. <br>
<br>
Depending on the type of government chosen during Guild formation, a Guild Leader can, at their discretion, appoint worthy members to their guild’s INNER COUNCIL. Inner Council members can be granted the same powers and responsibilities as the Guild Leader. <br>
<br>
Most players within the guild will be ACTIVE members. This gives them the right to use the Guild communication channel, preferred access to Guild shops and facilities, the power to invite new players into the guild as petitioners, and (depending on the type of government chosen at Guild formation) the right to cast a vote on important policy matters. Active Members also receive the protection of the City Guards while in their Guild City.<br>
<br>
Finally, members with PETITIONER status occupy the lowest echelon within a Guild. Whenever a character accepts an invitation to join a Guild, they are awarded Petitioner status until the Guild Leader or Inner Council officially approves their membership and formally initiates them. Petitioners are given limited access to guild facilities. <br>
<br>
Players who are not currently in a guild are considered ERRANT.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will Guilds have a Coat of Arms to differentiate themselves from other Guilds?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes!  During Guild Creation, the Guild Leader uses an interactive interface to create a custom heraldic Coat of Arms (also known as a Guild Crest).  These Guild Crests will appear in various places in the game. The most obvious use of the Guild Crest is its appearance in the Character Information window. Whenever you select a character by left-clicking on them, their Guild emblem will be one of the most prominent pieces of information displayed. With a few exceptions, players will never be allowed to hide their Guild affiliation, making all Guilds ultimately accountable for the actions of their members. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Does every Guild stand on its own?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No, a Guild may join in an alliance with another Guild or Guilds by using the Fealty System without losing its identity.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How does the Fealty system work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A Guild that is landed (that directly controls a Tree of Life, and a City-State) may take pledges of fealty from other Guilds. These Guilds, like players, begin as PETITIONERS and can be later initiated as a fully active, SWORN Guild. Sworn Guilds are considered extensions of the guild itself, and are given preferential access to City facilities in return for their loyalty and support. This system allows for large coalitions of players to arise that consist of several different Guild types allied together. Characters from different walks of life can therefore all receive the bonuses for their Guild's preferred classes.  <br>
<br>
In addition, members of Sworn and Sovereign (landed) guilds receive a bonus to their recovery rate, subject to the health of the Tree to which they are bonded.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CITIES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will all towns be owned by a Guild?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No, not all of the Cities or towns in Shadowbane will be built and owned by players. Some static communities will be managed and run by the Game Administrators. <br>
<br>
Player-run Guilds have the ability to close their towns off from strangers, declaring them to be &quot;members only.&quot; For defensive reasons, many Guilds will. There are also, however, a large number of in-game reasons to keep a City as open as possible. Well-stocked Shops with competent Vendors and Tradesmen can become a tremendous source of income. Guild Leaders can also levy a tax on all buildings within their City, taking gold in exchange for access to the powers of the City's Tree of Life. The Guild leadership and the building owner must both agree on the level of the tax, and the Guild Leadership also decides how much access non-members will get to their Town's resources. These economic  policies will be important decisions for the Guild Leaders and Inner Councils to make. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What is the difference between a Guild Run Town and a GM Run Town?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At a purely structural level, they're identical. Both types of city-states can include all of the things you would normally expect to find in a fantasy medieval town - weapon shops, armor shops, guard barracks, city walls, guildhalls, you name it. The only inherent difference between the two is that Guild-Run City-States allow players to set the policies (and tax rates) and can grow or decline in power over time. Also, some GM run towns are designated as Safeholds, areas in which PvP combat is absolutely prohibited. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What exactly are City-States, Provinces, and Nations?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A City-State</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a city controlled by a player-run Guild that stands on its own, owing allegiance to no one. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A Province</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a city controlled by a player-run Guild that has pledged fealty to another, and now exists as part of a larger Nation. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A Nation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a City controlled by a player-run Guild that has one or more Provinces who have sworn fealty to it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will there be enough towns for every Guild to have one?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
While there will likely be a relatively large number of Guilds in Shadowbane, there will be a limited number of player controlled City-States in the game. Most player Guilds will have to swear fealty to another Guild or Kingdom initially, until they can amass enough wealth or strength to take their own town. <br>
<br>
City-states will remain in short supply by design, promoting competition and conflict among Guilds. Of course, if City-States become too few, we at Wolfpack can always add new world fragments to the game, each with a new quota of player City-States. Shadowbane's random world generating features make this process particularly fast and easy. <br>
<br>
*This would be a good reason to start forming a strong guild early <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How do I protect my Tree and my City?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are a large number of defensive measures and structures that can be acquired in-game to help defend your Town or City. NPC Guards can be recruited to patrol your streets, and alert Archers can man your ramparts. Castle walls can be raised to fortify the perimeter and Runemasters can brought in to nurture and protect the Tree of Life. Guild Leaders will also generate and control a “Kill on Sight” list, informing the Guards which players or player-run Guilds are be considered Enemies of the State. <br>
<br>
The best defense of all, though, is a Guild's relationship with other players. Diplomacy can be a far keener weapon than any sword, and intrigue can often accomplish more than conflict.  Banner men and political allegiance will weigh heavily in the balance of feudal power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> t type of structures can I build?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Players can build a wide variety of potential structures, from Barracks to Guild Halls.  Each building has a specific purpose, providing City dwellers with goods or services, and the Building owners with wealth amassed through the profit made in each sale.<br>
<br>
*Details on buildings here <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com/worldinfo/citybuilding/index.shtml">shadowbane.ubisoft.com/worldinfo/citybuilding/index.shtml</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  are Buildings classified?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Every Building in Shadowbane can be classified by three basic attributes: the Building's Type, Rank, and Stage.<br>
<br>
Type refers to the Building's ultimate purpose, and determines which types of Tradesmen and Hirelings can be assigned to it. A Weaponsmith can't produce his wares in a Tavern, for example.  He requires a Forge.<br>
<br>
Rank is similar to the Rank characters have: think of it as the rough measure of a Building's &quot;level.&quot; Rank measures how well-outfitted and equipped the building is, and the basic characteristics of a Building (structural hit points, etc) improve each time its Rank increases. All Buildings begin at Rank One, and take time and money to upgrade. A Building can hold one Tradesman for each rank it has, and as the Rank of a Building increases, any Tradesmen within it will work more quickly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
Stage is a byproduct of Rank, and along with the Type, determines the actual appearance of a Building. Most Buildings in Shadowbane have three distinct Stages, and at each successive Stage the Building grows larger and more ornate. Buildings change to Stage Two at Rank Three, and transform into Stage Three buildings at Rank Five. Guild Halls are the only Buildings that lack distinct Stages: they are built at the peak of their beauty, and their appearance never changes, regardless of their Rank.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How do i build a structure?<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
<br>
To build a Building, a Character must commission and purchase a Deed from an Architect (a specialized form of NPC Hireling), then activate the Deed to place the new structure. The purchaser of the Deed is thereafter the owner of the Building, and has total control over the production of the Tradesmen assigned to it. In the future, a character can relinquish ownership of a Building to another character if they so desire. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Who owns the building me or m</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Whatever character activates the Deed is the sole owner of the building.  The Owner's Guild has no direct control over anything the building produces (although members are always well advised to follow the wishes of their Guild).  Note that the owner of a building can direct the Tradesmen who work there to give special pricing to fellow Guild and Nation members.  In this case, the benefit is received by members of the building owners Guild, not necessarily the Guild that controls the city. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How does item production work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Once the owner of a Building installs an appropriate Tradesman, the owner can then direct the Tradesman's activities, giving him a list of items to create and setting the profit margins for all goods and services sold at that building.  There are three different profit margins available; one for Nation members, one for fellow Guild Members, and one for everyone else. Once again, Nation and Guild refer to the affiliation of the Building owner, not necessarily the Guild that runs the City. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Can I lay siege to another guild’s town?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Yes, you can. A word of warning, however – as you might expect, the burden of work definitely falls on the aggressor. It’s much easier to defend a castle than it is to attack one. Sieges are long and arduous affairs, potentially requiring days or even weeks of real time before any significant headway is made.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How long does it take to Siege a City?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It depends, of course, on the size of the force attempting to take over or destroy the City and the size of the defending force, coupled with the City's defenses. Successful sieges will normally take 24 or more hours to accomplish.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Why do Sieges take that long?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
First, Buildings are hard to destroy, and a Tree of Life can heal buildings, in some cases as quickly as attackers can damage them.  Don't forget, all the while you are trying to take over or destroy a City, the Guild and/or Nation who owns it will be fighting back - a complete City is a monumental investment of time and gold, and any Guild will fight tooth and nail to defend it.  The final reason is playabilty. It would hardly be fair (or fun) for the city a Guild has invested so much in to be taken over or destroyed overnight, while all its members were offline or asleep.<br>
<br>
*that is exactly why I hated DAoC only took 15min ot take a keep and while you take someone elses they are taking one of yours then when you run to take yours back they have theirs taken back too and you really never accomplished anything lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What happens if the defending Guild Leader is killed during a Siege?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
He comes back, winded, and possibly with fewer of his items, just like any other character.  Bear in mind, however, that a Guild Leader comes back from death &quot;enshrouded&quot; by the Shadow Beyond. As long as the Guild Leader is enshrouded, he or she cannot adjust the powers of the Tree of Life. The distribution of a Tree's healing energies will stay however the Guild Leader last set them, until the effect wears off. Attackers can then shift their attack to structures without any healing, destroying them before the defenders can adjust their defensive tactics. <br>
<br>
*The &quot;rez effects&quot; on the GL after death last for 1 hour<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How is a Tree of Life neutralized?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The besieging force must construct a Bane Circle within a certain distance of the Tree of Life.  The Bane Circle gradually leeches energy from the Tree of Life until the Tree has no more power, in effect neutralizing it and removing its healing power from the target City's defense.  If the Bane Circle is destroyed before the process is complete, the Tree of Life will gradually (not instantly) reclaim it's lost power. Sorties out of a besieged City to break a Bane Circle will be an essential part of any City's defense, although once they leave the shelter of the walls, the defenders will be fair game for the attacking force.<br>
<br>
Other spells and powers can poison a Tree of Life, diminishing its energy and reducing its effectiveness for a long period of time. Usually, these spells are unleashed upon a Tree of Life just before a Siege begins, and are a sure sign of imminent attack.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How can I destroy a Building?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Attack it. Buildings are extremely durable and a Tree of Life can heal them as quickly as they're damaged. Without truly devastating firepower, most Building are beyond a character's power to destroy.  That is why many Guilds attempting to besiege a City utilize Siege Engines.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are Siege Engines?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Siege Engines are medieval devices, essentially primitive artillery used to hurl heavy projectiles at a target or to batter down walls and gates.  In Shadowbane, Siege Engines can be built by specialized Hirelings (known as Engineers), and are used to batter Cities into rubble. Guilds will have access to four different types of Siege Engines:  Ballistas, Battering Rams, Mangonels, and Trebuchets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What Role can Guards and Archers play during a Siege?<br>
<br>
Although they cannot leave their home City as part of an attacking army, Guard Captains, Magisters, Master Archers and their minions will defend the Town they belong to, acting as additional Guild members for the defenders.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Without Permanent Death, how can you hope to win?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You can destroy the Tree of Life, taking the Guild with it. If you manage to destroy a Town, you've crippled them economically. Remember - slain characters don't come back at full strength. Guild Sieges are wars of attrition. Eventually something has to give…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If attackers restart all the way back at their home City, how can they hope to compete?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
They don't necessarily have to. Special War Tents can be built that allow besiegers to log out or back in or near the besieged City (a function similar to that of Inns).  Death, however, is a different matter, and carries harsher penalties. If an attacker is slain, he will still respawn at his or her Guild's Tree of Life.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If defenders respawn at their Tree as soon as they are killed, how can they lose?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
People &quot;reclothed in flesh&quot; at a Tree of Life don't come back at full strength: at the very least they will need to recover their Health and Stamina, and will function as if they were lower level characters for a period of time (the &quot;Shroud of Shadow&quot; mentioned above). They may also lose some of their equipment, as the number of bondable items is limited. The effect of the Shroud becomes more severe if a character is killed a second time before they recover: people killed over and over again become practically useless. Also, even a minute can be a long time to go without the powers and skills of a powerful Guild member. Death in Shadowbane is not permanent, but a timely death can turn the tide of a battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Isn't it too hard to destroy a city?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Remember, a City is a massive investment on the part of an entire Guild - if they were easy to destroy, wars and conflicts would lose their meaning. Defenders definitely have the advantage, and &quot;total wars&quot; to the death should never be undertaken lightly. It would probably take a coalition of Guilds working together to topple a decent-sized city. Smaller raids, to destroy one or two strategic buildings, are much more feasible. Of course, even if such a raid is successful, the injured Guild will certainly retaliate... <br>
<br>
*unlike DAoC in Shadowbane when you destroy/takeover a city or even just 1 building its a BIG deal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What happens when the Tree of Life is destroyed?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Guild that controlled the Tree of Life and any Guilds that declared fealty to that guild become &quot;Errant Guilds.&quot; All members of these guilds will respawn to a Tree of Life in a Safehold until they can bond to another Guild Tree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What is an Errant Guild?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
An Errant Guild is a Guild that is neither a Landed Guild (directly controls a Tree of Life) nor a Sworn Guild (extensions of a Landed Guild and are given preferential access to City facilities).  An Errant Guild does not receive any of bonuses that a Landed or Sworn Guild receives from its affiliation to a Tree of Life. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are my chances of taking over the World?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
To be honest, no one knows.  It’s certainly possible.  Can one Guild do it?  Maybe.  A coalition of Guilds working together?  More likely.  What’s the best recipe for world domination:  Coercion?  Political ruthlessness? Economic might? Real life philosophers and James Bond supervillains have been asking that question for centuries. In Shadowbane, as in the real world, the answer remains unclear. It's up to you, the players, to try and find out...<br>
<br>
You can certainly change the World, but taking it over is another matter entirely.  One thing IS quite certain, however. In Shadowbane, for the first time, you can actually try.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will there be Player-versus-Player (PvP) combat?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, Shadowbane has been built from the ground up to support Player-versus-Player combat (in fact, some might say that the game's backstory actively encourages it).  In addition to PvP, we have also implemented many game mechanics to support Guild-versus-Guild (GvG) and Kingdom-versus-Kingdom (KvK) combat.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say, however, that our PvP Combat is unrestricted -- The game is territory based, with lands ranging from completely protected (such as the Newbie Areas and Starting Cities) to extremely dangerous (hostile advanced areas and land held by enemy nations).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What about Player Killing?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We have worked very hard to ensure that the combat system fits within the context of the game world.  Pointless violence is not the purpose of Shadowbane: but we also assert that it's hard to tell a gripping story (especially a gripping fantasy story) without conflict or battles at all. We remain firm believers that not only can PvP and Roleplaying go hand in hand, but that, in fact, the pinnacle of each can only be achieved when the two exist in tandem. Without the power to back up your words, what good is a well-acted swagger? And how much more meaningful will your character's victories be when firmly grounded in an epic or mythic context?<br>
<br>
Various game mechanics have been put in place that enhance combat while deterring gratuitous or random PKing.  For instance, experience points gained from victory are based on levels, and only a peer or higher level character will yield any significant gain. <br>
<br>
The traditional PKs of other games are outsiders who wander from region to region in search of prey, vanishing when their victims come looking for revenge. In Shadowbane, however, all players will belong to a Guild, run either by GMs or Players. Guilds are highly territorial, and you can easily learn where a character is from by viewing their Guild Crest when you click on them or by simply viewing your &quot;Recent Attacks&quot; log. Wanton murderers will be held accountable for their actions by the Guilds they serve, and the penalties for being expelled from a Guild are severe. Furthermore, trying to operate without the fixed home base that a Guild provides is asking for serious trouble. So, you may ask, what's to keep all the PKs from forming Guilds of their own? Nothing, but there's nothing to keep you and anyone ever troubled by them from forming your own Guilds, banding together, and battering the PK Guilds to dust. It's hard to hide a city, or a Tree of Life. Also, the reliance on Guilds means that every would-be victim has a Guild full of supporters to help them get even.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What is &quot;Bonding&quot;?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A character is allowed to &quot;bond&quot; various items of equipment; these items must be equipped on the character's body (as opposed to being held in inventory).  Once bonded, a character cannot lose these items, even upon death.  When the character dies, the items will re-spawn with them at their Tree of Life.<br>
<br>
Banks also provide a mechanism for storing a limited number of items while not in use.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PKers can loot and keep any UNbonded items you have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are the penalties of death?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When a character dies, they will lose carried equipment (except for bonded items ) and experience. The amount of experience lost will vary based on the level of the monster (or character) that killed you. At low levels, or when a character is killed by an entity more powerful than themselves, the experience penalty will be slight. The opposite holds true as well: experience penalties will be higher if you are slain by something weaker (lower level) than yourself.  <br>
<br>
Players will always be able to keep  bound items when they die.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> When a character is killed, who has the looting rights?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
A character dies the items they had (other than those bonded) will remain on their corpse and can be taken by anyone in the area.  Don't worry, though, most equipment should be easy to replace, and in Shadowbane your character's combat effectiveness will be based far more on their skills and attributes than their weapon of choice. Finally, we've said it before, but it bears repeating: you'll always get to keep the three items bonded to your character. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will there be custom moves and animations in combat?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes! Not only does each weapon type have it's own unique animations, many of the Powers (including special melee attacks such as Burning Blade, Piercing Strike, Reign of Steel, and Sword Song), whether Class or Discipline based, have their own unique moves and animations. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Does combat take any Player Skill or just Character Skill?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Anyone can level a character, equip some weapons and attack someone; this requires little skill. Effective use of Combat Maneuvers will determine the outcome of a fight. A higher level character with better equipment will lose to a player that uses his Combat Maneuvers more effectively. The basics are pretty obvious; there are a ton of these Maneuvers (with unique animations) that become available to different Classes at different levels and can be developed by investing skill points. Here are some important points: <br>
<br>
Maneuvers include one-shot moves that damage, blind, cripple, or otherwise hurt your opponent. Examples of these include: Kick, Backstab, Crippling Strike, Slam, and Power Strike. <br>
Maneuvers also include combat stances that affect the overall way your character performs in a fight. Among other things, these can modify Attack, Defense, and Damage ratings, and the rate at which Stamina is expended (or recovered). Examples include: Aggressive, All-Out Defense, Hold, Stand Ground, Recover, Withdraw, and Evade. <br>
Maneuvers cannot generally be stacked, so players must chose when and how to use them. <br>
Maneuvers either have a direct Stamina cost, or affect the way Stamina is lost in combat. This means that less robust or tired combatants need to end a fight quickly or disengage while they still have the energy to run away. <br>
Maneuvers have recycle times. This means that some moves can only be used once or twice during a given melee; knowing when to use a Maneuver is part of what makes a skilled player. <br>
Given experience, a player should be able to identify what Stances and Maneuvers his opponent is using, has used, or is about to use and change his tactics accordingly. <br>
