class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heh</span><hr size=1> once again Orphius opens his mouth and displays his ignorance.<br>
<br>
here's what happened since it's being dragged out , i know nobody but those involved care but whatever , it got brought up here so here we finish it.<br>
<br>
we were in ToV with FoH.  FoH brought 12oN as guests.  it was a mutual thing that DoW/FoH were doing it together and we had no idea 12oN was going to be there.  we said we'd play by FoH rules and random on everything that dropped but we didnt know the 5 12oN with an average of level 30 were going to be there to win the only 2 plate bps and the only silk robe to drop.  it was still pretty early in velious when that @#%$ wasnt on everyone and their twink.<br>
<br>
enter 12oN <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> dumb</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> warrior to NToV.....<br>
<br>
Belric asked Felonian to drag Ghalaan's (i think this was the Ogre Warrior's name) corpse from WToV.  anyone hunting in HoT is going to be ally to CoV so we were all laughing at the fact that dumbshit was dead in WToV.  turns out he trained the corpse camper NToV wyvern to WToV.  anyway Felonian is trying to drag Ghalaan's corpse and Belric and some FoH cleric are close by.  Belric gets too close and the wyvern aggros and kills him.  i defend my guild like a dragon watches it's nest , @#%$ up and you die.  anyway , Belric proceeds to bitch at Felonian because Belric is a stupid @#%$ , so being the naturally mature nice person i am i told Belric to go eat a @#%$.  Belric didnt like this and asked me to leave.  i said &quot;sure thing @#%$ sucker~!&quot;  &quot;/gu we're leaving&quot;<br>
<br>
Belric asked Baaz to stay and help them CR from under the corpse camping wyvern , which was pointless seeing how it was a corpse camper and he was going to have to summon corpse 5 hours later anyway.  Baaz thought since he'd won a leather bracer he owed FoH.  there were like 20+ DoW in the zone and about as many FoH.  we'd all put in the same effort and took our randoms with everyone else.  i thought this was horse @#%$ and he was turning his back on his guild because he wanted ToV loot.  being as pissed as i was and having said we were leaving i explained to Baaz why it was pointless for him to stay and that we needed him in PoG.  he refused to leave.  i told him if he didnt leave he was to never ask the guild with help on anything again (my maturity kicking in again) so Baaz got pissed and /guildremoved.  i was under the impression that helping the guild that got him his epic and basically full thurg armor (monk armor is ass anyway , you get it for the procs not the stats) he at least owed it to us by his own reasoning to leave when we left because nobody @#%$ at my gimps but me , which i had already explained to Belric once before on this very same raid.<br>
<br>
enter Quirk...<br>
<br>
Quirk is the one that set this up with FoH and they'd planned to be there til i think like 10 PM.  that's what Quirk said when he logged on.  anyway when he got on we were in PoG and i was like &quot;gnome get to PoG need another tank here&quot; cuz Zath has to log at 10 PM (hahahah) and he's like &quot;what?  @#%$ that we're supposed to be in ToV.  FoH is still here , why are we in PoG?&quot;  i explained the story and he was like &quot;dude i plan on being here til at least 10 PM&quot; and i was like &quot;hey @#%$ for brains it's 11 PM now&quot; (me and gnome live in the same time zone) to which he replied &quot;they asked you to leave but said the rest of DoW can stay...&quot;<br>
<br>
You tell the guild, &quot;you have 10 minutes to be in Plane of Growth.&quot;<br>
Quirk tells the guild, &quot;i'm not leaving&quot;<br>
<br>
then me and Luldaas/Sonice and Quirk got into it.<br>
<br>
i quit the guild.  yes grown men cry.  i cried like a baby for the first time in a LONG while when Golen /guildinvited me and /pleaded and i hit &quot;no&quot; , it made me feel like @#%$.  (yeah even i got feelings , alert the media)  we sat in PoG for a good 40 minutes without killing anything but the Protectors that spawned.  i finally accept guild invite and asked Quirk and Luldaas to leave the guild if they werent going to come back to PoG.  they were invited to FoH within the minute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
as pathetic as it sounds i love this guild , hell some days it seems it's the only reason for me to wake up.  go ahead , laugh , judge me , flame away but nothing will ever make me quit enjoying leading my guild into whatever battle the new day brings and nobody will ever take what we have here away , nobody.  i dont care how many times we die to moss snakes or how many stupid flame wars we get into in guild chat , we're still better than you because we have pride in who we are and there's a lot of guilds on this server that cant say 100% of their members are proud to be in their guild.  i can honestly say that.  who'd stay with a guild with a rep as bad as ours through , @#%$ , 4 disbandings now? unless they loved being here as much as me and unless they had full faith in me to get us to where we want to go and unless they had pride in who they were?  that means something to me , that's why i log on.  so to ever say i would drive away members to make my guild go to @#%$ is like saying i'd cut my own <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &lt;insert something round here&gt;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> off.  i love playing with my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &lt;insert something round here&gt;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> too much to ever get rid of them.  =(<br>
