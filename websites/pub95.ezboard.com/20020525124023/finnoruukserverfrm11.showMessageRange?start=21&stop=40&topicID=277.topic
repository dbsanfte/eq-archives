The people in the lives of children instill morals, not religion.  If religion does, why is it fairly common to find the most unruly, deceptive, sexually active children to be the children of &quot;power&quot; or stature in church ( ie pastor, deacon, etc ).<br>

<br>
And one would be entirely wrong. Electric generators are not 'natural resources' (well they are, but only because everything that exists is natural.) A desire to use electric generators does not prevent one from being materialistic because they're not 'natural resources', however.  Egypt, Mayas and Incas did exploit 'natural resources' as best they could. They were quite materialistic. One might argue that sacrificing children to some imagined diety made them less civilized, too. But that would violate the holy PC dogma of religious relativism, wouldn't it? <br>

Give them a chance to clear their soul of wrong doing that otherwise would not allow them into Heaven. So, if they paid enough cash, when they died, they would go to pergitory for that chance to clear their soul.<br>

Sometimes it's not just a whammo smack in the face from text, but a personal realization as you build your relationship. Sometimes I claim to be right, and claim to know everything, and then minutes later I get kicked in the @#%$. It's almost humorous. On the subjects of confession and purgatory, maybe its not in your bible. I know I have four extra books in my bible, than little suzy q who attacked such issues back when I was in high school.<br>

You counterdict yourself.  You state that Cultures are destroyed by Natural disasters, but then say those that try to civilize others destroy cultures.  You say that a culture is destroyed if they have the wrong philosophies, but some would say that about communism and yet you say that destroyed civilizations but they are not necessarily more civilized than a socialist or capatialist society.<br>

Egyptians, Mayans, and Incan civilizations live more in &quot;harmony&quot; with the environment than we do today.  They did not desstroy entire ecosystems to mine gold, silver, coal, or oil.  They did not wipe out other cultures so that they could have their gold ( to my knowledge ).  What resources were you talking about to begin with?<br>

--&quot;Affirmative Action, and other laws were passed to protect the abused African Americans, yet we're pretty blind to Native Americans.&quot; <br>
<br>
Civil Rights laws make things for all races equal. Or atleast as equal as far as legality can change things.<br>
<br>
--&quot;There's communists still in Russia, regardless if the nation declares itself a republic.&quot;<br>
<br>
I hate to break it to you, but the United States has communists too. They even have their own political party that actively participates in elections every year. Does that mean we are not a republic?<br>
<br>
--&quot;Organized religion has *NOT*, I repeat *NOT* done more good than bad in the history of this world. Otherwise, why do most civilized nations have laws or outright exiling of religious institutions from politics or from their countries?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ohhh, I don't know, maybe so that their is no legal biase? Maybe so that a government doesn't offend its own people? How about simply that in the modern day, Theocracies have tended not to work?<br>
<br>
EDIT : Misread your text. Response to your question as asked... most civilized countries do not exile people because of their religion. The ones that do are certainly not on par with the way the world is turning, and that would make them less &quot;civilized&quot; than others, now wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
I just read down and saw that Aldrin has summarized quit a few of my other points I was thinking so I will not continue this any further.<br>
<br>
PS : Just because you read more about child molestors in catholic churches does not mean that the catholic church is where the &quot;majority&quot; of child molestors are. That is simply such a shocking case that the media eats it up. There are child molestors everywhere. <br>
<br>
PSS : Just because you feel this way, is it absolutely 100% appropriate for you to post this on an everquest board? OOC Segment or not, I suggest re-thinking your decision to share these opinions with the people that you know only over the internet. <br>

Mokshi, I don't contradict myself; I said &quot;...have been...&quot; I did not in any way suggest that any of the ways that cultures were destroyed were the *only* way cultures were destroyed. But I suspect you knew that....<br>
<br>
Again, I said one might <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> have to</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> destroy a culture in order to civilize a people. I never said that the wrong philosophy automatically destroys a culture. But the wrong philosophy can prevent a culture from advancing.<br>
<br>
Of course there's mysteries of the past that we can't unravel; we lack the data. We'll probably never know what the flesh markings of a Tyrannosaurus Rex were... not because of some magical knowledge or capabilities the dinosaurs had that we don't, but because there's no evidence remaining for it. Unless <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Jurassic Park</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> becomes real...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Egyptians, Mayans, and Incan civilizations live more in &quot;harmony&quot; with the environment than we do today<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Only to the extent that they were less able to manipulate the world than we are today (less knowledge.) There was no particular bond they had with Mommy Nature. We live in just as perfect harmony with the enviroment as do beavers, deer, elephants, or any other animal. You think an elephant carries a bag around to collect his poop out of fear of &quot;polluting&quot; his enviroment? (btw, if you don't pick up or scatter horse/cow pies, it kills the grass. Very environmentally sound.)<br>
The Mayans did fight wars, over what topics, I'm not sure. They did quarry stone without particular concern for the enviroment. They did clear the jungle away for their crops, and slash-and-burn agriculture wasn't brought to the new world with the coming of the Europeans.<br>
As for the Egyptians... uhm.. N. Africa wasn't always a desert. Even in classical times there was talk of the cedars of Lebanon which were harvested to the point where they became almost unknown. <br>
<br>
A civilization <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> cannot</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> live in harmony with nature; nature's way is filth, murder, starvation and suffering. No civilization can tolerate such a relationship. Deer live in harmony with nature, a harmony established by them breeding as much as they can, eating whatever they can without regard to supply, and then either starving or being eaten by the predators whose population has increased with the increase of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> their</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> food supply, and starving of course causes the starvation of the predators, too. Wholesale death and suffering. Deer don't wear condoms or practice abstinence to control their population. So much for harmony.<br>
<br>
Entire ecosystems haven't been destroyed because there's only the one ecosystem. Tell me how the mining of coal, silver, gold or anything else brought about the wholesale extinctions and destructions of habitats that have taken place long before man climbed down from the trees, stood on his hind legs and said &quot;Enough!&quot;? Species come and go, habitats change, and you either change with them or become extinct... unless you're civilized. Perhaps in our pursuit of a better lifestyle for our own kind (you know, babies who live longer than a few months, the luxury of a full belly, the disovery of grey hair due to living long enough to actually develop some, medicines to cure diseases, technology to discover the medicines, that sort of evil, unnatural thing) we've destroyed habitats, driven borderline species on into extinction... but we also caused others to exist, and prevented the extinction of still others. We've fought the very climate itself, to the benefit of ourselves and other species. Not that they deserve it.<br>
<br>
This &quot;harmony with nature&quot; nonsense reminds me of the &quot;appropriate technology&quot; I sometimes hear from technophobes. As if there's some level of technological development that's good, but any further is bad. Easy to preach if you're living in an air-conditioned home with access to preprocessed food within a short drive, medical care to cure such <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> otherwise lethal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> disorders such as a broken leg or headcold, entertainment at the touch of a button, leisure time of any kind to enjoy that entertainment... <br>
We didn't invent the laws of the universe, the same laws that control tree growth or snowfall apply equally <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> naturally</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to hydraulic brakes and computer chips. Arsnic in the groundwater? Check the periodic table; we didn't &quot;create&quot; Arsnic, we merely relocated it, at most. Oil spills unnatural? Where do you think the oil came from in the first place? Oh, the poor duckies can't handle it? Adapt or die, that's the gentle, loving law of Mommy Nature. We're bastards for spilling some oil we really could use? What's that make Mommy Nature when she upchucks enough poison gases from a vulcano to cover a State, enough ash and soot to block the sun for days and destroy entire habitats beneath the rubble?<br>

Unfortunately what it causes is a crutch for people to use.  It hinders some people.<br>
<br>
Imagine a baby bird that the mother bird does not kick out of the nest and feeds indefinitely.  Would most want to learn to fly, hunt, explore the world?  Some might but too many would be complacent (sp?) with what they have and settle for nothing less that mediocrity (sp?).<br>

It's a big thing to some of the more spanish/portugese influenced South American countries, because there's some racism that occurs. Some in Brazil and Argentina views anyone with native blood as more prone to violence, alcoholism, poverty, etc etc.<br>
