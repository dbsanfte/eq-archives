Screams of laughter came from the air on all sides, surrounding him in the maddening laughter. He did nothing, did not even act surprised, but for the flick of an ear in irritation. This was what the beckoning had called him out for. He believed it was from his Goddess, Erollisi Marr.<br>
<br>
  He was wrong.<br>
<br>
  She appeared, the female from his long-ago vision. Multiple races melded into but a single form, her mouth parted in laughter. She was the source of the laughter, the maddening sound that would have driven a less disciplined creature to the brink of madness, and then pushed them over without a second thought.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;What do you want?&quot; His voice was nearly drowned out by the laughter, but he knew She heard him. And He, too, knew in that moment that it had all been fake. A facade.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;Want?&quot; The laughter heightened, drowning out all sounds of Shadow Haven about him, and it seemed he was the only one who heard the shrieking, high-pitched laughter. &quot;It is what you want, cat.&quot;<br>
<br>
  With that, the female was no longer formed. It was twisting, turning, flowing through multiple shapes, all the while the laughter continuing. From form to form the odd God-creature shifted, until settling upon a single one, a tall human-looking male with a scraggly beard, dressed in clothes that seemed of Gypsy make. Chaes knew who He was. And his entire world came crumbling down with the realization.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Don't look so glum, chum,&quot; came Bristlebane's voice, having the pitch of a halfling yet at the same time, the timbre of a laughing human. A smile adorned Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane's lips, more of a grin, really, his entire being seeming to radiate mirth.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;All a lie, was it?&quot; Chaes' arms crossed over his chest, his hands looking oddly out of place - one bare, the other with a fist wrap tightly wrapped about it. Chaes' demeanor was sunk below anything he had ever felt before; he had been tricked by the Gods themselves into believing he had a place in this world.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Not a lie; a ruse, a scheme, to draw you from the unearthly squallid airs you beam.&quot; Fizzlethorpe considered the Vah for a few moments before continuing.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Far too boring a life you led, before the priestess drew you from that dread. Without a place one moment, in perfection with another, protecting she who is twice mother.&quot; Bristlebane's words seemed to gain momentum as he rhymed, the words drawing at the reality about them, which seemed to have come to a stop, the two of them frozen in time.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;Power you wield, power you gain, power you give, time and again. Nothing but a kitten whose not realized his path, this alone would have brought my wrath. To you I gave the perfect excuse, to open up and stop your recluse.&quot; Faster came the words, warping Chaes' sensibilities as his mind was drawn to the lull of the rhymes, beginning to see sense one moment then lost in the changes in direction Bristlebane was making.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;Yet you draw further within, away from the world you've gained a place in. Nothing but a kitten with no life, no humor, no laughter, not even strife. With you I try once more, to pull you from your shell and open the door.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 Chaes was lost, then found, over and over again, staggering under the weight of the words as Bristlebane spoke, trying to make sense, and succeeding before losing it. Chaos was closing in on him, the very defining essence of Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, the Rogue, the Jester, the King.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;Now we open your soul, tear away your current role. You'll become a chaotic creature, my very own cattish main feature.&quot; With that, Chaes felt his soul being opened, and his fears and defensive mechanisms that had kept him so closed up exposed. Bristlebane was chaotic, yes, but He was very, very methodic as he casually stripped each and every one of them away.<br>
<br>
  Chaes felt his skin being ripped from his bone, as each of his seemingly sensible fears and reasons were torn from him, and the final blow came when Bristlebane ripped the medallion from about his neck, which felt as if his heart was being torn apart. The Vah Shir fell to his knees, groaning, growling, the world about him spinning faster and faster. Then it stopped.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Rise, my truthful worshipper. Sleep and recuperate and groom your fur. Tomorrow is a new day, and this won't seem so bad; after all, Mithaniel's sister is merely a fad. I am forever, always shall be, and there is nothing that'll ever change me.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 Chaes was staggering, as the world returned to normal, and to others, it would seem as if it had happened in a blink of an eye; one moment, he was walking, the next, staggering like a drunken fool. His mind was reeling from the assault on mind, body and soul, and he managed to half-stumble, half-stagger his way down to the lower levels of Shadow Haven, finding an empty hole and collapsing into it. He knew, as he passed into unconciousness, tomorrow he would be different..how people would react to such, he didn't know..and suddenly, didn't care, as he passed out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=143.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.threadControl?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm1">Announcements<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm11">Recruitment<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm8">Public Roleplay area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm7">OOC area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm16">The Twilight Harvest<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm9">Members forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm10">HoD Events<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm12">HoD Vault<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm15">Harvester Histories<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm13">IC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm14">OOC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm17">closet</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8>Public Roleplay area</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
