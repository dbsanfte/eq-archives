<br>
replying to the many sundry jabs Aldrin has made aginst women-<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, so I don't expect modern females to be able to cook a tasty or even nutritious meal themselves, but cripes, go to a restaurant once in awhile!&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm a kick ass cook.<br>
<br>
&quot;The immature, foolish females wanted to play like the boys, and the boys didn't mind prostituting their wives for the added income to buy vacations and nifty toys.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those &quot;immature foolish females&quot; were answering a call to help their country at war.  <br>
Don't you demean that.  <br>
These women were patriots who answered the call and helped the factories of America continue to function while the men were at war.  They broke tradition- likely something hard to do back then and they did the job.  When it was over, some went back home and were happy.  Some came to the conclusion that for them there was more to life than staying home and keeping a man happy.<br>
<br>
We are not living in a time whn the men are in short supply due to a war, but I am good at the job I do.  I am a paramedic, and that is frequently considered &quot;men's work&quot;.  But lemme tell ya- if you are in a wreck and need help- I'm one you would want to help.  I am good at what I do, and I have not given that up even though I had a baby two years ago.  I also manage to not feed her lunchables thank you. Just because I'm a working mom, doesn't mean I'm so dim as to believe every stupid commercial that claims to make my life better, easier or faster.  <br>
<br>
/em hands aldrin some sun-screen  <br>
Here's for your neck hon- it may help<br>
<br>
When you buy a wife from Russia, let us know how it turns out eh?<br>

<br>
I agree with aldrin on alot of points and some i dont really agree with the way he said em but still pretty much agree. Alot of &quot;Equality&quot; is just bs and no im not a redneck i dont need sunscreen thanks tho lori! <br>
<br>
I think from the way it sounded in the begning of aldrins rant is that basically to be a Mother ya do the old traditional cook clean and the like and ya RAISE yer kid. Now if dad does that he can be mother to right? /shrug dont know dont care personally if you take care of yer kids properly then you can call yerself a King or queen for all i care as long as yer kids dont grow up to call love line and tell adam and dr.drew about How they were abused as children.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for all this feminazi stuff i stopped reading it lol i dont even like talkin to feminists they have an innate hatred of man and really only wanna see one thing<br>
<br>
WOMAN where MAN was considered to be In the middle ages.<br>
<br>
Never meet one that didnt secretly desire this and was willin to argue cause as much grief as they could. <br>
<br>
Any way cookin is a acquired skill that everyone should learn just so you can feed yerself. Being a Mother father is something everyone needs to do so we dont Leave this World To People like us LOL<br>
<br>
I probly can never have kids but if by some miracle i can you can be damn sure ill go outta my way to raise em right.<br>
<br>
Any way i forgotten half of everysingle post and dont care much cept to say I dont hate women i hate how most think. <p><img src="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/affliction/ebola.gif" title="I am Ebola.

I haven't read the entire thread in extreme detail, and I'm not lookin to flame you anything you've said...but I don't think working moms are necessarily bad moms.  I don't think that women should be corralled in the kitchen their entire lives.  I think they oughta get off their arses and get a job.  If anything, its because I, as one representative male, am so sick of cowtowing to them for nookie that I'm ready to go postal.  (your favorite cliche, right?)<br>
<br>
I do agree with your distaste for the toaster streudel-marketing pigs of the world.  The way I see it, capitalism is screwing the world over, because corporations have overrun the individual.  Big companies have to baby-sit their bottom line so much that advertising has become a crucial part of doing business.  Hey, I too would spam everyone if I was CEO of a big company that marketed food widgits--there are bucking fillions of vegetative idiots out there who will buy whatever slop you want to produce if you market to them.  It makes good business sense, but it f-ing sucks.  I hate marketing so much it brings me physical pain to see a goddam fabric softener commercial, or to hear the monotone ravings of Joe $19.95 on every voice mail system of every massive telecommunications company in the U.S. (yeah all 2 of them...competition indeed!).  Anyway I'm raving so I'll stick with the stream of consciousness format....take Home Depot or McDonalds for example.  These hosebags have modified their employees' psyche to the point that they become simple drones in an ant hill.  Mindless automatons working diligently for the benefit of the Great Corporate Brain.  Their robotic commercials keep you slugging down the high-polymer toilet seats and super-sized fries while mesmerizing you with pictures of the fantastic Ward &amp; June Cleaver home you can build, or the ever-present allure of the Collect all 5 Happy Meal Toy.  Home Depot keeps up the supply chain of low-cost prefabricated particleboard furniture so well that the mom and pop hardware store goes out of business.  Grandpa can't afford to keep his own hardware store because the lumbering corporate giant can beat his price point through volume.  Grandma can't afford to stay home and bake flaky apple pies for Grandpa because she's too busy working overtime at a Medicaid-funded nursing home to pay down the No-Money-Down-No Payments-til-2002-Super-Orthopedic-Mechanical Bed that Dr. Quack recommended for her osteoporosis.   Meanwhile she's also paying off the &quot;free long distance&quot; cellular phone calls to her son Ward who is nearly bankrupt after taking a job as a systems analyst for that HotDomains.com company.  Ward is a great programmer, but the steering committee heads got tired of looking at him after he grabbed the last $2.39 Einstein's sundried tomato bagel during the last LCD projector PowWow Joint Application Design session and slugged that sumbiscuit down with his grande latte.  And Ward's performance has been slipping lately anyway. You see, Ward has been in and out of counseling for his chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and virility problems for some time now--partially due to the fact that his wife June left him for Fabio the personal fitness trainer who is much more sensitive and knows how to treat a woman.  Ward just doesn't understand why he can't just buck up and shake off the pain like Dr. ScrooYoo, Ph.D said in the Chicken Soup for the Laidoff DotCom Worker book that Ward's been reading.  His ex-wife June drops the kids off at KinderCare on her way to the tennis courts in between meeting with her divorce attorney to find out how to extort more alimony payments from Ward, who has been slipping lately.  She's also devising a scheme to get Ward to eat the bill for the Soloflex that she saw on QVC (oh my doesn't Christie Brinkley look hot after using that thing! Check out those abs!) and slapped on her 26.99% APR Visa card along with the lobster bisque, ragout of field greens, and Montrachet lunch that she and Fabio had during a scandalous little rendezvous at Aqua last week.  Ward just might end up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anyway, because he really wants to keep the 60&quot; high definition Sony television that he bought with his 401(k) loan last fall.  Ward's neighbor Bob talked him into that and a subscription to AT&amp;T Broadband for $49.95 a month.  Ward has a real weakness for 6 channels of CSPAN and the Hindu Variety Channel.  Hell he even said F it and got four channels of Showtime for $15 bucks extra, but dammit Showtime hasn't played a movie he's heard of in six months, except for that one fruity skin-flick that was subtitled in Italian (that chick did have some nice hooters), and the fifteen-times-a-day reruns of black &amp; white Charlie Chaplin flicks.  But he really does like the way the local access channels show those nice rainbow color bands for 24 hours each day....they really show off the liquid crystal resolution on the TV...and holy jumpin jesus!...he can set the VCR to record it while he surfs Monster.com for another Sr. Executive Administrative Engineer job at DotBomb.com!!  But Ward is feeling better now...he's given up Prozac and lithium for marijuana and is really starting to not give a damn about anything, although he thinks a lot about his sailboat that was repossessed last fall.  Oh and did I mention the phone bills?  Ward bought the Complete Choice Plan!!!  He's got Caller ID, 3-way calling, star-69, 1-900 call blocking, automatic call forwarding, anonymous call return, and anonymous call reject for only $44.95 a month!!!  Holy Sheeit Dogs with Pickle Relish!  For $4.50 extra he can keep the telemarketers from calling him during his Swanson's Fried Chicken Dinner with a side of Everquest for $9.89 a month. Ward thought that the phone thing was pretty outrageous, but the Bell Corporation sales representative Alexis couldn't seem to transfer him to the Loser Line where they just have basic telephone service for cheapskate schmucks who can't get women. (Alexis is a half-wit liberal arts student who gets free drinks at every bar she goes to, because she's cute, and guys like a girl who wears tight, black, bell-bottomed polyester pants and drives a Jaguar.  She also has a nice apartment in Haight Ashbury!) So Ward just gave up and figured he'd pay for the Complete Choice Plan, the inside wire line maintenance plan, the FCC communications tax, the state communications tax, the high-cost communications service charge, and the FukYouPacBell re-connection deposit off later when his stock in WebVan was fully vested.  Unbeknownst to him, Ward has been calling Alexis' roommate Lacey for a few days now...he bought her a couple cosmopolitans at the Bubble Lounge last week and things are really starting to look positive.  (He had to get a $150 cab back from Pittsburgh/Bay Point because he passed out drunk as a skunk and missed his stop on the very last $2.50 per trip Bay Area Rapid Transit train back to Walnut Creek.)  The real drag of it is that Lacey lives in 415, and Ward is in 510, so he pays a bit extra by the minute to talk catty with her.  And even worse is that Lacey is a transvestite with a bigger organ than him!!!!<br>
<br>
What does that monstrous ration of baloney have to do with the price of tea in China you ask???  Absolutely nothing.  The mere point I'm trying to make is that directed marketing and fluffy services that the world doesn't really need have made it impossible for the otherwise well-to-do, college-educated American family to survive without two incomes.  You can shrug it off as frivolous materialism all you want, but trust me...I never went out looking for the $19.95 special for anything.  Those bastards came looking for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You see, there's a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.  My raving examples are just a few...some of them are quite true and personal in nature, but most of it is exaggerated stuff I made up.  (I really did pass out on the BART train once,  heh.  damn that cab was expensive, and I really hate PacBell)  In spite of the exaggeration, it really doesn't even touch the tip of the iceberg.  In today's world you can get yourself into some very deep financial hell before you can snap your fingers.  The single male is really screwed.  If you don't meat (er...meet) your perfect June Cleaver in college, then you've gotta delve into some very scary gene pools to even have a decent statistical chance of meeting the mother of your children.  If she's been living in the same propaganda-blasted world as I (you) have, then chances are good she won't fit the Happy Housewife Mold that Aldrin is presenting.  It all costs a fortune, and if she wants to carry out the delusional American Dream with you, then she better get off her ass and get a job....cuz I'm not paying for her drinks forever.  Screw it.  Nintendo can raise my kids...I'm too busy trying to keep this sinking ship afloat. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17550">Laelia Jadebreaker</a><BR>

His viewpoint of what a &quot;mom&quot; should be is in a traditional sense (stays at home, cooks, cleans, etc).  His viewpoint of anything else would be a female &quot;parent&quot;.  That's his personal viewpoint, and as with anything else anyone posts on these boards is subject to criticism and debate.  But that's his opinion, and telling him you need to treat someone who drops their kids in daycare in order to take more ski-trips is as &quot;motherly&quot; as a stay at home mom isn't going to change his mind.  Anymore so then him telling you you aren't being a &quot;mother&quot; to your children if you &quot;raise&quot; them that way.  String him up for holding onto traditional values, shall we?  Some of his perceptions don't seem to be reflective of the current social environment.  But then again, just because &quot;Everyone's doing it&quot; and &quot;It's the norm&quot; doesn't necessarily mean it should just be blindly accepted.  I think not all of the changes Women have made in the last 30 years Aldrin have been all bad, but everyone is entitled to their opinion about how things &quot;should&quot; be.  <br>
<br>
And the Women's movement having a man-hating Lesbian talking about how oppressed and demeaned housewives are has not helped their cause much.  And OMG, how can you seriously take Hillary Clintons claims that women need to be empowered when you look at how much crap she puts up with from her philandering husband.  I don't know anyone whose husband has that much political power, but I do know that none of the women I know are so morally bankrupt and have such low self-esteem that they would let their spouse publicly treat their marriage (and them) as such a joke.  But yet she seems to be held up as an example of a strong woman.  The problems women have had with career discrimination and such needed a spokesperson (or several), and if a woman chooses to work outside the home, she should be compensated equally, and I know as a country we aren't quite there yet (getting much better though).  Unfortunately, if a woman would choose to be a housewife as a career, most &quot;feminazis&quot; scorn her.  It again gets back to people claiming to be tolerant, and then showing they are only tolerant when you believe the same things that they do.  If some of the more vocal women's rights groups were more respectful of a woman's right to stay at home and raise her children, Aldrin would have much less ammunition to use in his rant.<br>

While he might have swayed in and out of topic through the course of this thread, he at least didn't start talking about cheese or something, so you've been better about that then most of my rants : P<br>
<br>
Anyone got any crackers to go with this old MRE cheese I found buried in my garage though? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 10:20:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xtimports.com/data/graphics/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ooc: &quot;Lunchables&quot; aren't food</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Those &quot;immature foolish females&quot; were answering a call to help their country at war. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A call that wasn't necessary and did as much harm to the nation in the long run as if the Japanese had won.<br>
And I wasn't referring to the terrible policy of putting women in factories during the 2nd world war; I'm talking about the ones during the 60s and 70s. <br>

You're not a mom, Laurelai... you're a dad. <br>
<br>
Btw, I'm curious.. does she still use a pacifier at 2? Have you placed her in Huggies or whatever they're called today instead of real diapers? (one of the most shameful products ever created)<br>
