class=title> Warmth</span><hr size=1> Sleep.  Finally, sleep overtook Ssakas, his breath slowing, snippets of dream washing over him as he welcomed the sweet release of sleep, his weary muscles relaxing.  To sleep, perchance to dream.<br>
<br>
It was gone all too quickly.  Ssakas sat up in his bed, and turned his cold eyes on the fire across the room, still leaping in it's brick prison, images swirling in the flames, memories flickering.  He swung his legs away from the bed and stood, eyes locked, transfixed, he approached the purifying flames.  Warmth.  He knelt before the hearth, feeling the heat on his scales, the visions of the flame scorching into his soul.  Absently, he reached deep into the pyre, through the haze of the heat and shooting embers, ignoring the pain scorching his hand, and removed a blazing piece of kindling.  He brought it up, closer to his face, little flames dancing, reflecting off of his cold black eyes.  Deep into the fire he gazed, hypnotised, searching for it's warming touch.<br>
<br>
The pain finally shocked him out of his trance, startled him back to his room, back to the hall, back to Shadowhaven.  He looked at the inferno he held, and tossed it back to its home.  Ignoring the ravaged scales on his hand, he sighed deeply.  Neither warmth nor sleep would visit him on this night.<br>
<br>
He wrapped his shield hand lightly with gauze.  He flexed his fingers, opening and closing his hand, testing it.  Pain.  Satisfied, he looked back over his armor and weapons, hung proudly on the wall.  Where he was going, they would not be needed.  He opened the door to his room, and silently stole into the darkened hall.<br>
<br>
Harvester Hall was asleep.  He crept down the hallway, past the rooms of his sleeping brothers and sisters.  He stopped in front of Sarhea's door, staring at the darkness he knew laid behind.  He sighed as he thought of the half elf, of the way her eyes saw past his scales, the way she had accepted him.  &quot;Where is she now, &quot; he thought, &quot;to what ends of the worlds does the Empire...my race, pursue her.&quot;  He tried to focus his mind, grasp the hatred lying dormant, deep within, and for a split second it took control, his detestation of the Empire ruling his mind, but his mind was like a sieve, and the thoughts were lost, almost as quickly as the came.<br>
<br>
He tried to distract himself as he walked down the stairs into the common area.  His thoughts touched many places, but they would not hold.  Paineel, guk, the plight of the trolls,the Empire, of Cyzek and the way Kiyda's departure had affected him.  Ssakas knew that he was of no use in this state, already today he had almost cost Thenic his life, when his thoughts overwhelmed him in deadly battle.<br>
<br>
He startled the gate guard awake as he left the hall, the guard stuttered in fear, &quot;Master Ssakas..., please..do not tell the Ilharress I was..&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas cut him off gently, attempting, and failing, to bring a warm tone to his voice.  &quot;Do not worry, although I am envious of your rest.  There are too many other things weighing on my mind, to worry about a guard asleep on his watch.  I trust you will not fall into the arms of sleep again, this dark night?&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard dropped to his knees at the words &quot;dark night.&quot;  &quot;No sir, I will not my lor..&quot; <br>
<br>
Ssakas cut him short again, this time more curtly.  &quot;That is enough.  Now listen.  I will be in the Caverns of Echos.  I do not wish to be disturbed.  You do not know where I am, or when I left the Hall.  Only if Mistress Kerridwynn has urgent need of me, are you to admit to seeing and speaking to me.  If any but her....if any but her or Mistress Sarhea pry these facts from you, I will personally see to it that your new job for eternity will be to remind future guards the painful consequences of sleeping on watch.  Do you understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, master Ssakas.  I will do as you wish.  But...your armor, your weapons, should I get them for yo..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will have no need of them this night.  Now stand.  I have no more time to waste.  I have feel...I have emot...I have something that I must deal with now.  I will be back at dawn.  Be ever vigilant, my friend, and remember...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas reached out his cloth covered hand slowly, gently brushing his scarred fingers across the guards forehead.  At his touch a vision filled the guards mind.<br>
<br>
In the vision it was night as well.  Two guards stood outside the Halls front gate.  They talked quietly together to pass the time til morning.  &quot;So what is with the stiff anyway?  Lawn ornament?&quot;  the first guard, noticably younger than his partner said, motioning towards an rotting corpse, impaled upon a spear rising from the earth.  The second guard did not look, but replied, &quot;Lawn ornament?  No, just a reminder for us.  A reason to stay awaken on these long night time watches.&quot;  The corpse gurgled out a small painfilled voice, &quot;h..e.l..p..m...e&quot;  The younger guard looked at it shocked.  &quot;My gods...It's still alive!&quot;  The elder guard shugged, &quot;Calm yourself, rookie.  You will get used to it, in a few years....  the vision ended as the words trailed off.<br>
<br>
Ssakas looked deep into the guards terror stricken eyes.  A slight smile crossed his face, and he turned away began to walk once again.  Over his shoulder he hissed, &quot;you have not seen me.&quot;  The guard, brought back to the present at the hiss, stood unmoving, stalwart in his duties, no longer tired.  <br>
<br>
He would never sleep again.<br>
<br>
Ssakas moved through a sleeping shadowhaven quietly, troubled.  The fear he had shown the guard did not bring him even the slightest pleasure.  He reached out and opened an unmarked door, stealing a glance over his shoulder at the inn across the way.  He sighed deeply, and entered the room, turning til he faced a wall, and then walked through it, through another, and he was in the Caverns.<br>
<br>
The guards posted barely took notice of him, as he turned to his right and walked deeper in the cavern.  At a great stone wall, he reached out, fingers feeling the stone, searching for the trigger, sucess, as the wall slid open, revealing a deep cave.  He entered the place, the wall sliding shut satisfyingly behind him.  He looked down over the tents pitched, at the fires that slowly died down.  He walked along the walls of the caverns, until he found the flat outcropping of stone against the wall, over looking the camp below.  There was still a small amount of blood that he could see, still wet with life.  He knelt on the rocks, his hand touching the blood and bringing it close to his face.  Was it his....or was it hers.<br>
<br>
The stone still held heat, unexplainably it was warm to the touch even as the cold cavern air whistled around it.  Ssakas settled into the heat, melting himself into the stone, absorbing the fire coming from the rocks, finding comfort in the ungiving stone.<br>
<br>
His unburned hand found his neck in the darkness, his fingers tracing lightly over the fresh wound, finding the exact location of the puncture, the penetration.  A small stream of blood escaped from the wound, trickling over his fingers, down his wrist, burning his arm.<br>
<br>
Warmth.<br>
<br>
Sleep.<br>
<br>
Ssakas had found both.<br>
<br>
