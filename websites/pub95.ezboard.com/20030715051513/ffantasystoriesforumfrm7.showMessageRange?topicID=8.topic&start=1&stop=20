<br>
The sky was deep. An empty void that extends far into the heavens. How lonely it must be for Luclin to hang without a sing star to keep it company tonight... The moon shines down on Miriam. It knew her pain. Night after night left alone, crying the same tears over and over. How many days had it been now? More like how many years... Miriiam hugs her knees to her chest. @#%$ them; @#%$ all of them to hell! Who needs them... who needs anyone! Her thoughts were pathetic coming from a girl dressed in full black leather, her face made up with makeup and nowhere to go. Alone she sits on a rock at a forests edge, over looking an empty and slowly dieing field. Everything took on a majestic glow under the dim moon, even Miriam. Why was she here? She really meant why was she still alive, but it was all the same in her mind. Her eyes are blood shot, her cheeks forever stained from salty tears that have slowly begun to stop. Where were they now? Her 'friends forever’? Now, when her heart aches and her soul screams for someone to care, there isn't a single person for miles who could hear... but that was her own fault, she wouldn't let them hear. Bastards, everyone single living-breathing person was a pain waiting to strike her fragile mind, her scarred spirit. What was left? Barely anything. What did she start with? Not enough... The days have been getting longer, and the nights lonelier, and everything harder to bare. <br>
<br>
&quot;Miriam?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hands shake as she wipes the tears from her cheek and tries to hide any sign that she was crying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, Del?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be fine, Delshad. Don't worry about it&quot;<br>
<br>
Delshad rubs Miriam's back and hugs her gently. &quot;Alright... Don't stay out here too long, its cold&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't&quot; Forcing a smile, she watches him leave. She wanted to cry out that everything wasn't all right, that nothing was, that she needed him here, needed anyone here. She wouldn't let herself trouble anyone else with her problems. Besides, Caelestis would be home soon. She could tell him everything, and if she couldn't, he would know anyways. Some how, Miriam knew Caelestis would never come home soon enough... Nothing could come soon enough with her hating herself the way she did. She hated that her hair color wasn't her own, that her eyes matched her fathers, that her clothes weren't how she wanted; that she acted like everything would be ok when she knew it wouldn't. The only thing that could come soon was her release, and even that wouldn't be as soon as she needed it... <br>

Probably drunk, and with another whore.  He was handsome now, but in another couple of years, with all that beer and all the women he'd be obese and diseased, or, thats what Saeran told himself.  For years he had lived in his brothers shadow.  He was the younger brother.  He had the hand-me down clothes, the hand-me down things, and the hand-me down genes.  He wasn't tall, he wasn't handsome, and he wasn't all that bright.  For that he hated his brother.  His brother the @#%$ jack ass who treated him, his younger brother by ten months, as if he were a child of two.  He hated his brother for being loved for his good nature, but he wasn't good natured.  He was a @#%$ bastard who gave nothing out of the spirit of his heart.  Saeran heard their giggles through the thin walls of the room.  As he tried to fall asleep, he heard his brother's name being screamed by the whore in between pantings.  @#%$ dumb bitch doesn't know a @#%$ damn thing. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1> OOC  (I hope you don't mind I gave Caelestis a brother Bell, if you do I can change it.) <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A> at: 7/9/02 2:01:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 6:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1>  he had been wacthing her from the shadows<br>

Delshad walked out of her house in a slump. His shoulders went down every time he left her presence. It made him feel drained. If only he could reach her somehow, he felt as if everything would be all right. Only problem was that she couldn't ask for help. He shrugged; the priests had been telling him that no one can be helped unless they want to be. Even healing didn't work on those who didn't want to be healed, and charms wouldn't work on those who didn't, in the very most miniscule least, want to be.<br>
<br>
He thought about the way she'd been acting lately. He knew that Cealestis(I FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT, WOO!) was more of a @#%$ ingrate than she'd like to admit, ore maybe she already knew that... Why someone would subject themselves to such torture was beyond Delshad. He just wished there was some way to make her happy, to make her see... But none of it mattered. It wouldn't happen; nothing mattered.<br>
<br>
Time for more sparring. I can't take this sitting around bullshitt. To the guildhouse. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A> at: 7/10/02 10:47:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usuedydar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suedydar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Souls</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1> ((Bleh, Mindles beat me to Delshad! &gt;.&lt; Oh well..I'll go think of someone for Miiam to kill...))<br>

<br>
What? He... he caught the counterattack! How did he....?<br>
<br>
No matter. The ranger tapped Delshad's own blade to the left, and the warrior-in-training spun towards the blade, counter-clockwise, and brought the mace in his right hand up high, to knock the elf's head off. Quick, that ranger.<br>
<br>
The elf ducked, and came up towards Delshad's chest with both his war blades together in an X. Delshad dropped his mace, and dropped down, arching his back, and allowing the blades to come up harmlessly without contacting. From the position of two legs and a left hand on the ground, he thrust his legs forward, putting all his weight on his left hand. As his legs went to the outside of the elf's, it looked down, and his eyes widened in fear as Delshad legs close around his own, and as the warrior pulled back, never touching the ground, he brought the elf's legs out from under him with Delshad's own.<br>
<br>
On his back, the ranger crossed his blades up in an X to stop a killing blow from Delshad. His foot was brought up, and he kicked Delshad a few yards back in the arena. The elf was already on his feet by the time Delshad was up again. He charged, roaring in rage.<br>
<br>
With fluid arm movements, Delshad pressed harder and harder on the ranger's blades. Each parry was nearly faulty, and after a few attempts at blocking the mace, the elf's primary blade was sent flying. The elf chanted a few words as he backed away from the onslaught of Delshad's weapons. Roots sprang up, and entangled his feet. Nearly falling on his face, Delshad watched the elf pull a bow from half the arena away. Delshad ducked one well-placed arrow that would have killed him, and launched his mace. It smacked the elf directly between the eyes, and Delshad immediatley cut the vines loose.<br>
<br>
He charged full speed, and let his left shoulder be thrown back as flames slammed into it. No more chanting elf.... you're MINE! Delshad grabbed the elf's other hand to still his blade, and bashed him in the mouth to prevent chanting. Delshad's short sword came up and bit into his stomach. &quot;TIME!&quot; called the referee.<br>
<br>
&quot;TIME! *TIME*!!!&quot; Delshad screamed in rage. &quot;*NOW* YOU CALL TIME!? How about when he used MAGIC, HUH? That was a PENALTY! And what about aiming for my KNEECAPS!?&quot;<br>
<br>
The burly elf in a striped tunic growled, &quot;I. Said. *Time*.&quot; Delshad threw down the training weapons and casted off the arena plate mail. Stupid elves. If it was a human, he'd have won a *LOT* sooner...<br>

He pittied her, while pittying himself more.  He had to live one room over from the bastard who would soon leave her.  The night sky was clear, without a star to be seen.  The moon, Luclin, was full and bright, bringing light to the shadowy streets of Freeport.  The whores were out, their faces painted such unnatural gaudy colors and their breasts sagging.  In another hour or two, the one with his brother would go out to join her sisters, back on the street.  He had most likely promised her a new life with him, dumn broad.  A woman who could have easily been his great grandmother winked at him seductively as she wiggled her hips.  &quot;Not today hon, but thanks.&quot;  He threw a few copper coins in the street.  None of them moved to grab them, but as he walked away he heard the scuffle for the meager money.  He saw a dark elf, hidden behind the shadows.  A guard passed by, and Saeran knew he had seen the elf.  This was the protection his platinum went to provide for.  Nothing would be done.  Nothing was ever done.  He tripped upon a poorly placed brick.  This wonderful craftsmanship was what his gold went towards.  He walked for another few minutes before he noticed the blood dripped slowly from his busted nose.  Quickly, he tore a strip of cloth from his shirt, worn so thin he swore he could see through it.  With a shrug, he placed it on the wound hoping the drying blood would serve as an adhesive for the bandage.  Life really sucks. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1> Miriam taps her feet on the always wet ground.

Delshad wiped residue sweat off his brow when he heard Miriam's shout; she was calling to Cealestis's little brother. Delshad didn't know this man very well, and was already more than a little on edge; after all, this was Miriam we're talkin about, not to mention Ceal's blood. That sick, sedistic, vindictive...<br>
<br>
With his blood set on low heat just below boil, Delshad crossed the street with a bottle in hand. The honey mead was only half gone, from the massive bottle, but he'd smash it if he had- &quot;Hey. Noticed you walking alone,&quot; Delshad said, nearly ignoring that punk kid who's name he couldn't remember. He acknowledged him with a grunt &amp; slight nod. His hand came up, and gently squeezed Miriam's shoulder. &quot;You seem cold,&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 1:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1> Miriam hugged Saeran and smiled at him warmly as she pulled back. <br>

&quot;Huney, you're freezing, here, take this&quot; She wraps her cloak around his shoulders. Turning to Delshad she smiles again, &quot;Hay stranger. Yea, if it gets any colder my ass is libal to fall off.&quot; Grabbing the mead from Delshad she bumps her hip against his and slams back a good portion of it. Ah, it felt good to have something other than her crappy genes running through her blood stream. &quot;Either of you seen Aino?

Her comment was all in good fun. Although next time she would see Aino, she would give her hell about it. Miriam didn't like being out in the city, it made her nervous, but more than that she hated being cold. And it was very cold. Glancing down at her dirt caked boots, Miriam sighs and looks back up. Her expression was a sad sort of blank. Whenever she didn't paint a smile on her face she looked troubled. She'd admit to her dieing day she wasn't, but she was. Glancing over at Saeran, she forces a tiny smile before returning to the never-ending gaze at her shoes. ~Why did you even come here...~ <p><Br> <Br> <Br> <Br> Your head will collapse <Br> But there's nothing in it <Br> And you'll ask yourself <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Wheeeeeere iiis my mind?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Rainbow</span><hr size=1> Delshad rubs Miriam's back, and hugs her from behind.

As he neared his home, he heard another screaming the name of Caelestis.  It couldn't have been the same from before, this voice was more nasal, and higher.  No, he had found another to snare in his love net.  @#%$ bastard.  The cold chilled him to the bone.  The only thing he had ever found the warm cold bones was liquor, and in large quantities.  He made his way to the pub which, was convieniently right across the street and entered.  The barkeep poured him a mug of ale.
