It's not worth it at all. I just got done camping Rage (a bugged Rage at that) that didn't spawn for over 115 hours (6 days). When he did spawn I got as many as I could to come help me and I thought we had plenty. We still managed to lose anyway and during the CR Methods of Madness came in and took the kill. Sure this is legal and entirely within their right but it shows no compassion at all on their part as I repeatedly asked for them to help or at least to let us have another go at it. I think I was might be more deserving for wasting that much of my life starting at the monitor with minimal sleep for some other cleric to just walk in and say hey, he's up! and get his piece so easily. Yeah yeah that's the way it goes sometimes but that doesn't mean its the right thing to do to a person who has devoted so much time to it. Well that didn't work and here I am a week after going through that hellish camp with nothing to show for it. That was my last free week that I had time to do this. So that basically means I'll never get my epic or at least not for a long long time. This is a huge disappointment, I'm still somewhat in shock and feel totally disgusting. So for any clerics who plan on a camp in the future don't. It's not worth it.

The cleric who got the epic drop is certainly deserving, and has been waiting on that one drop for quite some time, but is no more deserving than Rikisihi.<br>There was a discussion about Rikishi being camped there from the minute we knew Ragefire was up, and nobody was willing to overrun Rikishi, but it was decided that if he attempted and failed, Ragefire was fair game.  Even with all that, we were in zone for a fair amount of time after the attempt failed.  We made no move to engage until we saw other guilds porting into the zone.<br>Nobody likes how this Ragefire change is working out, but I don't know how guilds are supposed to work out a compromise.  If we didn't engage, another guild would have, and there were other guilds massing their forces.  If we had let Rikishi take a second attempt, we would have most likely had to assist him to ensure a sucessful battle (not doing any uber weinie wagging here, Rikishi just didn't have many people in the zone to assist him).  If we had told Rikishi he could have this one and we would take the next one, we would have trampled all over the cleric next in line, who has been helping Rikishi camp since Wednesday.  <br>I wish I had an answer, and I wish that I didn't have conflicting feelings of happiness and disappointment.  I don't know Rikishi that well, but I do know several of the people who were helping him camp Ragefire, and they are great folks.  I know the MoM cleric who got the drops is a great person, and I know that MoM is full of great people.  <br>Would anyone be willing to come up with some sort of rotation for Ragefire?  Something like the old planes bookings?  Sign up, when it's your turn you and your crew camp it, you have 1 hour from the time he's up until he's FFA.  It would be nice if it were to work, but it would only work until the first guild decided not to honor the system.<br>I don't know the solution, and I don't know that there is a solution.  Maybe move Ragefire back to SolB, at least then you had a dungeon full of mobs to buy you some time.<br>I know that MoM did nothing wrong, and I know that I did nothing wrong, yet I still feel terrible for Rikishi.<br><br>Arolpin <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarolpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arolpin</A> at: 2/10/02 6:36:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ualtarasotterkin01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>altarasotterkin01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/10/02 6:41:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waste of time.</span><hr size=1> Rikishi did the 6 day camp, if the MoM cleric was so much more deserving of his epic, he should've been at that week long camp too.
