<br>
I see DAoC as the natural progression of a better game and I see some mighty flaws by Verant followed by a hasty, ill-prepared recovery.<br>
<br>
For instance, Verant asking for feedback on customer service too late; the on/off status of the various EQ boards; releasing of premature SOL screenshots that just looked horrible; and the hyping of horses when this feature has already been offered in DAoC.<br>
<br>
The turning off the numbers per server, resignation of one of the EQ's founders and last plea for feed back on customer service are just signs of Verant's mistakes.<br>
<br>
I am sure there are some internal conflicts and will be some management shake-up in the ranks at Verants, but this will hopefully make them more competitive. They will have to listen to customers and re-evalaute their game engine, business model and organization if they hope to flourish, let alone survive. Anyway, just natural evolution of a market...<br>
<br>
Whoops. Sorry if this got a little too strategy like... heh<br>

I was always against changing servers and things like that because I never wanted to leave behind my old characters, even when everyone on the server hated me. EQ was a cool place and I had a high level character to play around with, I mean, why would I want to leave right ? All these DAoC messages about how it's such a great game must be wrong cause how could EQ be worse than that game ? Right ?<br>
<br>
<br>
WRONG. I've played DAoC for about 4 days now, haven't even thought about EQ except for what will I do with all my EQ stuff. The graphics in DAoC are about 10 times better than the EQ ones, and their characters don't all look like men. There are two very strict ruled Roleplaying servers which is great. One of them I currently play on. Almost none of the characters are over level 25 so it's a good time to join if you want to get in early and be a &quot;poineer&quot; of sorts. No zone lines, which is great, the maps are really diverse, so it's not the same old desert here, forest here thing like EQ. <br>
<br>
Now, there are problems with the game just like EQ, but in some respects it runs SOOOO much smoother than EQ and it's only been out for a few weeks. And customer service, on my server I sent in an appeal ( petition in EQ terms ) and they let you see how many petitions there are it looks something like :<br>
<br>
Checking status of appeal for charater, __________,<br>
There are 408 current appeala, you are in 1 queue,<br>
The average wait time is 167 minutes<br>
<br>
Which is bad, cause there is no one to answer the appeals on most of the time, probably cause they haven't hired any &quot; GM's &quot;, but, they do have a /advice command where you can ask other adventurers who have volunteered, questions about how to play your class better, fashion tips, stuff like that in game.<br>
<br>
The horses in DAoC aren't like the ones for EQ but they are still fun. DAoC horses remind me of a train, you buy a ticket, you ride the horse to a new destination, no control over it and it kicks you off, granted horses in DAoC are cheaper than the EQ versions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
<br>
SOOOO....I think it's a good time to abandon the ship. Most people will move to DAoC because it's an all around cool game. The graphics and interface are better than EQ. The classes and races kick ass, the cities and wilderness rock, not sure about the frontier though.<br>
<br>
My tip, run from EQ as fast as you can. Be one of those people leaving EQ for a better game. Verant can only screw over people so much before they lose most of the customer base.<br>
<br>
In truth, I wouldn't even be posting here except I accidently clicked the wrong link in my favorites menu and said &quot; What the hell, lets check out the forums to see what's going on &quot;<br>

<br>
Yes... the graphics are better.... score 1 point for DAoC<br>
<br>
But... If you like being locked into a 3rd person view all the time, I guess that is ok... I personally would hate it...<br>
<br>
As far as huge leaps in gameplay.... they just arent there...<br>
<br>
Yes some things about the gameplay are different, but not vastly so.... sure it would be cool if you could buy your Thurgadin quest armor in an armor shop... for a price... but that would probably just take away from the thrill of actually EARNING it.<br>
<br>
I for one am not cashing in over 2 years of time, and my high level character for a marginally different (not better) game.<br>
<br>
This is all just my opinion....<br>

It's fun for me because I have very limited time to play now.  If I have a long stretch I hope onto EQ.  If I only have and hour or two to play I hop on DAoC.  <br>

A lot, sure.  But a lot more will buy into EQ, too.  Bottom line is that the impact of a single game on EQ is just not going to be that big.<br>
<br>
Steelhammer Soulforger  - 1st person, 3rd person attached, 3rd person detached view modes.  I live in 1st person.  But I use 3rd-attached quite a bit when I want to sit still but see all around.  Detached mode is great for looking behind you, and setting up screenshots with the &quot;photographer&quot; in the picture.<br>
<br>
VI made an error in hiding the server number, IMO, it made them look worried.  And I can't believe they really are.  Nothing, and no game, lives forever, but this one (EQ) has a lot of life left.<br>
<br>
I love the graphics in DAoC, but they eat computers right up.  In the &quot;heavy&quot; areas, near towns or, for example, Adribard's Retreat, my framerate drops badly.  Very playable, but I miss that &quot;liquid smoothness&quot; I get with this system in most zones in EQ.  *shudder - Wakening Lands*<br>
<br>
For me, the big thing in DAoC is the lack of &quot;just sitting and medding/healing&quot; downtime.  Travel downtime, groupforming downtime are quite similar.  I usually play 2 accounts in EQ when soloing, so I can fight one, switch, fight the other.  Not needed in DAoC.<br>
<br>
All that said, and I love the game, I still don't plan to stay.  I have spent literally hundreds of days developing Lorax and Sinneed and The Twink Herd.  They are just resting.  They will wake up one day.  :0)  At one point, I think 1 year into the game, when I could only play one at a time, I had spent 6 of every 24 hours in Norrath.<br>
<br>
I hope most folks will not destroy/delete or *gasp* sell their accounts...because I fear they will regret it badly.  They will mostly be back, eventually.

Funny thing is, every time a new game comes up, someone is crying &quot;The Death of EQ!&quot;. <br>

<br>
I beta'd Ashron's for a couple of days... couldn't stand it. Seems many of the players that stopped EQ to play AC, found out the same thing.<br>
<br>
Diablo II held my attention for 2 days (that is how long it took me to beat both Normal and Nightmare).<br>
<br>
Anarchy Online... hahaha <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  *Hrmmph Mmm* Sorry</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> could have been a contender, if they waited another year to fix all the bugs/lag issue's. (Beta'd this for a week)<br>
<br>
DAoC... Didn't Beta this one, but I anxiously awaited its arrival. I bought 3 copies when it hit the shelves, and started up a character when I got home. I've since returned 2 copies. Don't get me wrong, DAoC is a fun game, however imo it doesn't have the immersiveness that EQ has. I think DAoC will make a good part time game, and I feel as time goes on, you'll see more of the &quot;rats&quot; that jumped the &quot;sinking ship&quot; coming back, and playing DAoC part time, and EQ full time. Why do I think this? DAoC numbers are down since the first couple of days after it went live, and zone populations are going back up in EQ. (Guess the cloaks weren't enough to keep everyone away from EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
One can say that my lack of &quot;many hours&quot; in any particular game, gives me no knowledge in the ability of a game that will make it or break it. Bah I say, bah! If a game can't hold the attention of someone willing to give their attention to it so freely, there's gotta be something wrong with it. Also, you can't argue with fact (Ashron's - Anarchy). DAoC is a guess at best, but one I'd be willing to bet on. The only game I can see stealing the majority of EQ players will be Horizons.... and that is only *if* they ever get it done.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ushaethius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaethius</A> at: 10/23/01 10:07:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uravantasuffer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravanta Suffer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#778899>(10/24/01 11:25:59 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.users.qwest.net/~morbid909/patrickflame.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: DAoC...they will be back</span><hr size=1> Couple misconceptions were posted here in this thread about DAoC.<br>
<br>
First off, there is a bug with the appeal system, everyone is showing as being #1 in the list.<br>
<br>
Everyone has learned by now that appeals are not replied to unless your character is stuck in the world somewhere.  Instead of sending you a message, they fix the problem.<br>
  Personally, I like mythics fresh approach to problems with games, because there CSR staffs have a realistic look on things.  They even have the balls to shut people down for saying stupid things.<br>
<br>
I have been playing DAOC lately, not because I think its a better game, but because it takes 8 freaking hours to get anything worthwhile going in EQ.  Whats there to do in EQ when your level 60 with good equipment and don't want to play twinks?<br>
<br>
However, I don't see people throwing the amount of time they did in EQ into DAOC.  Maybe 25% of it.  DAOC has a lot of great things about it, but it is *NOT* designed to be a time sink game.  Lets face it, for time sinks, NOTHING comes close to EQ.<br>

<br>
I would reasonably say that people that have a lot of time on their hands will probably prefer to be completely sucked up into a game (EQ) .. others that have less time to put into a game will prolly go for DAoC ... <br>
<br>
No game is another game killer. EQ did _Not_ kill UO when it came out. DAoC will not kill EQ ... but will be a valid altrnative.<br>

There is no downtime, some people equate this with no challenge, the challenges come from the battles themselves, not from being OOM from before the fight. (How many times have we heard &quot;Cleric is OOM, why did you pull it?!?!&quot;) Since groups can hold up to 8 people, every class is valid to have at least one in your group. Unlike EQ where its usually warrior, cleric, rogue, enchanter and the other 2 are just scraps. I enjoy the fact that I can play DAoC for an hour or two each day, and still keep up with my friends without having to put in a work day in EQ just trying to level. Some people think that because each class can solo, means that groups will never be formed. Not true, while everyone can solo productively (ever class can solo in EQ, some are just waaay better at it then others) grouping is a blast. In a world where mesmerizing and clarities aren't the key to fast leveling and having a lop sided group tends to be fairly effective too, most groups take whoever is at hand and willing.<br>
<br>
Another nice thing is leveling, you outgrow hunting grounds at a nice rate meaning you'll see the dungeon 3 or 4 times for a few levels, then you'll be ready for something new. And if a hunting area is crowded, in every single case, I've found a comparable or better spot just a walk down the path. <br>
<br>
Will I be canceling my EQ account? Maybe, I believe Camelot is in its infancy, and the game will continue to grow, if it does, well, one less LFG ranger in the world, but thats at least a few months off.<br>

<br>
However, I think it is appropiate to talk about the differences.<br>
<br>
In small groups of RVR, archers are GODS.<br>
<br>
In large groups of RVR, they are DEAD.<br>
<br>
Everyone thinks archers are overpowered in RVR, its not that at all.  Usually archers hunt in pairs or groups, and that massive amount of damage you thought you took to one arrow was actually being dealt by 2 or 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is to easy to die in RVR however, and its a long walk back (accomponied by a wait to port back into the realm) so I don't know how fun this would be on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
The defining 'gem' of this new game, seems to be less entertaining then the game itself.  Unless of course, you are an archer, and can rack up realm points by yourself consistentlly.<br>
<br>
I'm an enchanter, and I don't think I could do it.  What are the odds of me walking up to a class I can defeat solo in a frontier, when he has no friends around?  Not bloody likely.<br>
<br>
Eq is still where its at for right now. <p><img src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~morbid909/ezboardsig.jpg" border="0"><BR>
