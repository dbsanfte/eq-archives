Thnx for the reply <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Oh, and sorry if i sounded like i came off hot-headed.. i often write these late at night.. and after much booze! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
( check the pst time on the post its my time zone heh)<br>
<br>
I'm sorry your GF at the time lost her job to a f'n paper tech, that just sux. Personally in the tech field.. people like you  are people whom i want to work under while i get to know things better... no really.. there needs to be more people in the tech field who know the shiznit than the people who have just gotten thier certs. i am the type of person  who beleives in this little fact.<br>
<br>
The only *STUPID* question is the question u didnt ask.<br>
<br>
And by that i mean.. if it takes you 15 times to ask me how to make a user acct.. i'd rather you do that.... than make a user acct.. and inadvertantly give that user full access to the network.. and thinking you did a good job.<br>
<br>
<br>
And as for cash?.. well.. i was in a near critcal motor vehicle accident.. so i wont be commanding any 60k+ a year job..however i'm not going into security because its the *trend* so to speak..... i'm a White-Hat hacker.. which means.. i tell people they have a big-a$$ gaping hole in their network... why do i do this?... well. simply put.. i'm a consumer.. i pay my bills online.. i shop online.. i surf online... and so do most of my friends and family.. therefore, i feel that if the internet community as a whole fixes these holes it will make poeple feel safer and  able to spend more freely... let me give you some examples.<br>
<br>
As a child of the early mid 80's i saw a whack load of mini-malls explode into the industrial development scene..... while we all know what purpose they provide now.. eg: a food mart.. clothing mart.. pet mart.. etc.. bank.. etc..<br>
<br>
we didnt see the entire scope of the posiblilties when they were being formed... mostly they were small local outlets of trendy and famous major outlets.<br>
<br>
<br>
i forsee the E-Commerce as the same thing... you will see banks.. your local utilities etc..... and why did the Mall/Mini-Mall come into being?.... one word<br>
<br>
Convenience.<br>
<br>
 and the same will happen to internet shopping. <br>
<br>
in todays society *TIME* is the most precious of comodities.   so if buying something online... or paying bills rather than taking the time to drive to pay the local phone bill is easier.. the society will pounce on that.<br>
<br>
so in that respect.. i'm not trying to hop onto the *new bandwagon* however i LIKE what i do.... i think that breaking into things is fun.. well.. not fun.. challenging... making a user accounts all day... or phone support isnt my idea of a good time.. however.. if this will get my foot in the door... and me under some good tutalage.. then fine.. np.. i'll be there at 6:30am!  but i really feel that security is where its gonna be for the future... furthermore...  i also want to get into forensics with the computer... eg: for all you U.S users... Linda Trip had information about the monica lewinsky incendent on her hard drive...she deleted most of the nasty inciminating info.. however... they were able to retrieve the information off of said hard-drive with tools speciallizing  that area.<br>
<br>
As far as finishing school?.. yeah.. close.. early Feb.. then i start to write my certs. as i said earlier.. i dont need to make the big $$$.. and your right about the 3 jobs to every 1 security dude.. its just something that i foresaw as a consumer.. and thought u know what?.  i bet this is gonna take off...<br>
<br>
and when everyone is offering their services as a security consultant.. i'll move onto the next boundary... routers or whatever,..<br>
<br>
you have a fine example there Ugle.. however.. what i meant in my example is this.<br>
<br>
Dial into router and compromise secruity with lame-a$$ log on name/pass  ... you DELETE all routing entries.. and change  admin pass/log .. and log out of router... therefore... that router has ZERO entries.  a minor pain in the a$$$ ... but if you get enuff peopel doing it at the same time.... you can have some serious probs... lemme give you another example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kevin Mitnik<br>
<br>
A now world renown hacker .. known for breaking into  the AT&amp;T(or someone big like that) phone structure... after said biga$$ company said they were bulletproof. he got in.. and caused much havok. he was/IS told not to use computers.. for a LONG time(5 yrs?)  and stay away from public telephones.. save emergancy.. cause he know's how to crash the system... and they arent going to change it.. so they have a tight leash on him.<br>
<br>
Furthermore,<br>
<br>
The U.S. Senate summoned Mitnik to give some insight on internet security (circa 2000-01 just before Sept 11/01)and how to protect major U.S governament installations and Military installations. <br>
I have heard many an outcome of that proceeding. and basically it came down to the fact that.. unless you want to disconnect from the internet.. your not safe... the Senate was not pleased with this response.... so .. good ol Kevin.. said.. fine.. u wanna see it?.. gimme  3-4 hours.. and i will bring the internet as we know it to a grinding halt..<br>
<br>
<br>
The Senate refused his invatation.<br>
<br>
so for my final say..<br>
<br>
I'm into security.. once i get my MCSE.  There will prolly be a Senior Admin to me.. but thats ok.. he's more concerned with.. network function stuff.. etc... as a JR Admin.. and focus'ing on security.. he can afford to hire someoene on to take care of  that portion of the network.. hence a fully integrated IT/Admin network... everyone needs to talk to someone.<br>
<br>
like you said.. get an edge now... i  really like breaking into peoples system.. then telling them  that they have a prob... and then sending the fix to them..<br>
<br>
Ugle:<br>
&quot;Personally I would suggest trying to find the kind of work you enjoy most. While I don't mind working on the security stuff, going through 20 pages of rules on your routers gets old after a while. Too many people pick what they see as the &quot;hot&quot; opportunities, only to find that either they just plain aren't great in that type of work, or that that field has gone more cold then hot. &quot;<br>
<br>
Your ABSOLUTLY correct on that statement... YOU have alot of field xp as you have dont HAVE to do that.. as for me.. Mr Jr Admin.. i DO have to do it.. cuz you prolly told me to look into it.. heheh.<br>
A Recent Poll for Sr Admins told the following: (on a security minded site)<br>
<br>
Weekly Hours:<br>
<br>
Time Spent on Virus Containment and Control 9 hrs.<br>
Time Spent on Network Intrusion attempts and control 11 hrs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ugle,<br>
<br>
