<br>
This Saturday at 10:30pm central, we will have a Fayadar raid for Ninolan (his last epic piece) in Timorious Deep. We will meet in the nexus near the POK book (our usual spot) a fifteen minutes before then.<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS:<br>
<br>
51+. You'll get creamed with his Fire AE otherwise.<br>
<br>
High fire resists. We'll prolly have mages/bards/etc there to help you, but you need at least 50-60 unbuffed (if not, get some cheap resist gear)<br>
<br>
20-30 PEOPLE. Aye, he is a toughie. We need about 20-30 people to take him down (less if the people are 60+)<br>
<br>
I'll post more on this raid to come, and hopefully Droth will have something in the motd about this.<br>
<br>
FRIDAY NIGHT:<br>
<br>
I'd like to have a Seb raid, like we were supposed to last week.<br>
/rant on<br>
We did UP last, and were supposed to take Seb last week, but apparantly Sly and Droth were the only people altruistic enough to make it. Ok people, here's the deal: you're NOT all going to like every raid we do. Some of them, good stuff will drop for you. Others, nada. But you need to come to them EQUALLY. No more being selfish because &quot;nothing good drops in Seb&quot; and yadda frickin yada. We all went to UP with you folks, and nothing for us dropped there. Its a GUILD RAID. Not a grouping session. The location was PREDETERMINED, but when Droth started talking about it, people started complaining and Droth almost caved in, but went LD before that happened (thank God for small miracles). People, he is the raid leader. If he says we're going to seb, that's where we're going. If you dont want to come, fine, but dont expect that you'll get loot dibs on the next raid, which may benefit YOU.<br>
Fact: many casters, including myself, are missing many spells. Without them, we cannot function, and are no good to the guild.<br>
Fact: our guild spell bank is almost empty. To prevent constant seb farming, which you all hate so much, we need to do a few in a row and bank the extras, so we dont have to do seb for a while.<br>
I agree with Sly on the timing issue as well. When a raid is set for 10pm central, its a safe bet we wont get moving till 10:45.<br>
I'm sorry for sounding so frustrated, but I am. When the leaders say we are going one place, and then cave in because people dont want to go (lack of people is a good reason to do so, but not because people dont like it), it frustrates me. We do something for tanks one week, and casters another. Quid pro quo.<br>
/rant off<br>
 UP is good for tank armor and Seb is good for spells. We can alternate to make everyone happy. I would like to see teamwork here. I am not angry, but after seeing the complaning, I'd had it. I am not an angry person, and many of you know this. Good luck, and I hope some of you understand what I'm getting at.<br>
<br>
Peace (and by god, I mean it),<br>

Just let me know when and where to meet.<br>
<br>
 Slyssf Silvermists 53 Pathfinder<br>
<br>
On the spell issue... Yes I need a few spells also one that drops in seb. But I also found out that there are only 3 listed mobs that drop my spell. <br>
<br>
 Tolapumj<br>
 Emperor Chottal<br>
 Sebilite Protector<br>
<br>
All of which are lvl 60 mobs and never are metioned as possible kills. My spell does drop in other locations just like most of the spells you want to find for guild bank and whoever needs them. lets think about Chardok sometime maybe or even Skyfire and get our clerics some shards for their epics while we are there. If you still insist on Seb... I will go becuase I want to help others. But just think about the mobs that drop my spell also. Can we take them?? I dont know. I know very little about seb.  OK, later all cya in game. <br>
<br>
The good of the guild does come before the wants of anyone. I firmly believe that and think that we can all work toward a very talented guild and even a powerful one eventually. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bdefiantheroesmessageboard.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lethdorreq>LethdorrEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(5/13/03 3:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fay Raid for Nin</span><hr size=1> Those other places would be an idea, but however, I suggested Seb because all different kinds of spells drop from the juggs, and they drop ALOT. Chardok Royals drop them too, and the Skyfire named cycle is an idea. Royals? I dont know, but SF nameds are an idea. However, these mobs only drop a few spells, while juggs has the largest drop table. I'd be up for a few other places. Many of the spells that I need are dropped only by high lvl dragons, heh, but I'm not worried about them atm.<br>
<br>
Our priority: find the place that has the largest number of spells and the most drops. If that place is somewhere other than seb, screw seb and lets go there =)<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>

The idea was brought up, but it was never finished or anounced to everyone. Droth and you(you mostly) tried to put one together and not enough people were interested(raiding is most definately not mandatory). If a lot of people complain and don't want to go to an unplanned event, it will probably not happen. Had the raid been well planed I would give more credit to your rant. I personaly was busy and you need a chanter for juggs. The best way to do Seb is to put together a well balanced high level group.<br>
<br>
As for the spell drop rate,,.. yes Juggs have a large spell drop table, yes they drop some valuable spells, but 95% of their drops are about as common as water and sell for 5pp to a vendor max. There are also other drops in the area you neglect, they drop Undead Dragon Sinew(for the Spirit Wracked Cords, awsome melee item if you're up for the faction work), the nearby Reets drop the Reet Crown for the woodelf illusion quest. If you wish for a well planned event in Seb, I recomend posting in the raid ideas and getting some feedback as to people wanting to go there. We are trying to get more people posting and reading these forums.<br>
<br>
Will there be a seb raid this friday night? Maybe, maybe not. I will be busy friday night and most of saturday, so I probably won't make it.<br>
<br>
I would have loved to help you guys out last Friday night, but I was busy, many people didn't come because they didn't know about it before hand,.. quite sorry for those who waited around a while. Pick-up and unplanned raids take a while to get started and sometimes fall through. Yes the guild needs more planned raids, we're working on it. Getting more people posting here is the first step.<br>
<br>
As for Fayd? I've seen a group of 30 wipe and a group of 9 own him, I would say hes similar in difficulty to King in Chardok, which we raided with 13 and had no deaths. A lot of people were afraid to go, Chardok is a known deathtrap and one bad move can cause a very quick wipe and an expensive or painful CR.<br>
<br>
Our guild priority is what people want and as soon as more people start posting here we will figure out better what people want. Ask the question in the next guild meeting, your priority isn't necessarily the same as the guild's.<br>
<br>
Your spell 'facts'? yes a lot of people don't have all their spells, but our guild spell bank is far from empty. A good solution? I will start a thread in one of these forums for people to post what spells they're missing, so when we pickup a spell we can quickly decide wether it needs to be saved or not, people can also post what spells they have laying around there too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=9.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=9.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.threadControl?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="defiantheroesmessageboardfrm1">Members General Discussion<option value="defiantheroesmessageboardfrm4">Questions, Comments, Concerns<option value="defiantheroesmessageboardfrm17">Ideas For Raids<option value="defiantheroesmessageboardfrm18">Planned Raids <option value="defiantheroesmessageboardfrm20">Accomplishments of DH</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bdefiantheroesmessageboard>The Defiant Heroes Message Board</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fdefiantheroesmessageboardfrm18>Planned Raids </a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href="http://www.thedefiantheroes.com">Defiant Heroes</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
