<br>
<br>
As the clouds drew together in the sky guarding it with menace, it was clear something of great importance would occur this night. Lightning slicing the evening sky like blows from a great sword followed by the howling of a fallen foe. It was this night that a prophecy was started on it’s path and two boys were born. There was Ryvian, Gerial born in the grand city of Delnor. He was a small child with black hair and wondrous green eyes. The doctor was instantly shocked and horrified that a Gerial could have green eyes and not the fiery red like the rest of the race. His mother though held him close to her as he cried. In a city far to the south of Delnor another child was born with glorious white feather wings. His name was Mala Havoc, the great menace. He was born to lead the darklings back into power and open paths for the once beautiful messengers of the gods, to regain their might rule. This was the beginning of the foretold ware of wars. It is said to live in peace one must prepare for war, and the war is coming, but will the peace be restored?<br>
“Ryvian! The wisp is moving. We’ve got to catch it or it will get away,” shouted Amy. She was a fair skinned Gerial with long beautiful red hair and burning eyes to match. Ryvian had always admired her eyes and hair. He thought they made her look like the goddess of fire, Drephia. He poked his head out of the shrubs as his finely pointed ears twitched in the wind His tail swung back and forth above his head as he looked back to Amy.  “Amy, if you yell at me all the time you’ll scare it away.” He shushed her. The bright fairy floated on the breeze. The wisp with its small delicate wings and silvery hair drifted on an unfelt wind indifferent to its surroundings. The light emitted from its small form was bright enough to fill a room with its glow. The wisps were used as a source of light for the dark mountain passes. Ryvian pulled a jar from his pocket and crouched in the shrub ready to pounce. He saw the wisp get close to him and he waited for it to stop moving. He had told his father he could catch one and told his sister Amy that he could. The boys at his school had told him that he couldn’t, be he knew he could. There it stopped! Ryvian could feel every small muscle in the back of his neck grow tight. His green eyes burned with a passion as he leapt through the air; head first, for the wisp. He didn’t seem to see it but before he could do anything his instincts slammed his hands together closing the lid on the top.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Amy! I caught it! Look I did it!” Ryvian jumped up and down with glee as he looked into the glass. The young Gerials were one day away from reaching their next season. Ryvian and Amy were born on the same day one season apart. The seasons lasted for a span of five years, and were used as a way to tell maturity instead of age. Ryvian was turning his fourth and Amy her third. Ryvian was 5 years older than his sister and loved her more than anything in the world. He looked after her and protected her from some of the boys at their school who harassed her. Ryvian knew all of them and out of most of their school three boys gave her the hardest time. Joseph, Adam, and Nicholas were the meanest and roughest boys with her. Ryvian always stood up to them, but they were 3 years older then him and they would insult him for his eye color. They would call him Darkling and half breed even though he wasn’t. He was from the Avi bloodline and he knew his mother was not a Darkling and his father being the Warlord of the town, charged with the protection of Delnor. Delnor was to the north of the peninsula that the Gerials owned. It was cut off from the rest of the world by the natural mountains that peaked over the opening. Ryvian was just nineteen and was starting to look more like his father then a boy, with broad shoulders and black hair. He had a muscular tone to his shape and was strong for his age, but his eyes were still different from everyone he knew. All the Gerials were born with red eyes and he was the only one without them. He had started to feel so different that he was secluding himself from all activities, until his sister convinced him to come and play with her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ryvian was going to be an Avi like his father. The bloodline of the Avi was very well trained. They were the elite fighting force of the land and sea. The reason for this is the trait that no one really understands other then the Avi, not even their counter part, the cleric. The Avi serve as a shield and sword for the cleric who will heal the Avi when needed. The Avi and the cleric are bound after their graduations. If one graduates before his cleric then they wait for each other. The two are soul mates and cannot be separated. If one of the two are placed with someone other then their soul mate, they will go insane and destroy each other. The Avi and cleric would eventually have two children, a son and daughter. The Gerials are allowed only two children if they have more then two it will be born with the power of the Avi and the magic of the cleric that would overwhelm the poor mind and push them past the boundaries of a sane mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Ryvian and Amy were dancing around now with the caught wisp. Amy gave Ryvian a kiss on the cheek and Ryvian smiled and winked at her. “You’re so brave Ryvian. I’m glad that finally came out of that hole that you call your room! I was beginning to think that you had forgotten me and left all alone in this boring town.” she smiled at him and giggled. Ryvian threw his arm over her shoulder as they walked back to his home. “I’ll always be there for you, I promise.” <br>

Just as he looked in the jar the three heard a horn played and Ryvian’s father strapped on his armor, sword, and grabbed his shield. He looked over to the weapons rack with the swords and spears passed down the ages and saw the family spear resting there along with the other swords and blades from his forefathers. He turned again to his children and smiled at them tussling with Ryvian’s hair and kissing the top of Amy’s head as he pushed out the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Ryvian threw his hat down and slammed the jar on the counter. “All I want is to make him proud of me. I have one more day until I go off to training. He doesn’t even talk to me, just runs off whenever those damn horns of off I wish that we weren’t born in this family! I don’t want to be the son of an Avi and curse him for giving this gift to me! I caught a wisp for him.” Amy knew it was hard for Ryvian to go through this, but he was an Avi and this is what their lives were like. The two had lost their mother when they were young and never got much time with their father anymore. Amy had to leave to make it to her lesson with her teacher to be taught about healing. She felt bad for leaving Ryvian in his current mood. “I’m sorry Ryvian, but my Delphra is waiting. I’ll be back later.” Amy smiled as she shut the door behind her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She was going to get yelled at and maybe even a swatting if she was in enough trouble for being late. Amy had stayed back for just a few minutes to be with Ryvian. To her it had been worth the time. She didn’t know if it was the same for him, but it hurt her heart to be without him by her side. So she ran to get home to get the lesson over with as soon as possible. In the dead sprint she was in, Amy had tears in her eyes as the wind stung her with merciless gusts. She couldn’t see well and missed the three boys from her school that were ahead of her. They were smirking as they watched her running up towards them. The three were training wards, another part of the army; they were more or less the meat shields for a cleric as she battled her way through to help the wounded. Infantry was their job. They had been born 3 years before. They had lived for the honor of the military and to live up to their father’s life, but that didn’t stop them from pouncing on her as she ran by. Amy screamed as they grabbed her hair and punched her hard in her middle forcing the breath out of her lungs. She let out a small squeak as their hands roamed and groped at her body. She saw their eyes, filled with hate and malice, flash as they forced her to her feet and held her for each one to take a hit. She threw up as they let her fall to her knees, her long hair blowing in the violent breeze. She sent her thoughts to a far away place, the place she held on to her most dear ideas, thoughts of Ryvian and her love for him. She thought of him as tears fell from her perfect face, she felt no pity for herself, but for the three men that would feel the repercussions. She saw a box being dragged up and it looked that it could fit a person about her size very uncomfortably. They crammed her inside and kicked it a few times before covering it and running off. Lily’s world had gone from black of the box to white with pain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Amy was brought to the forest that was used for hunting grounds when the town needed a food supply. The boys took her out of the box and shoved her out onto the ground. She bounced up ready this time for what was happening. She threw a punch just like Ryvian had taught her to, and caught Adam in his nose and another on his chin. Adam screamed out and fell backwards from shock. The other two grabbed her hair again and pulled her head back causing Amy to scream, she tried to kick, but they only grabbed her legs and pulled her to the ground. Adam still was rolling on the ground holding his face as Joseph and Nick started to tie her hands up and bind her ankles as well. When they had her tied down Adam got up and helped to carry her to a tree that was almost as wide as a house. Once they had dragged her up to the top the three opened a door that was made out of branches leading into the trunk of the tree. They shoved her in and laughed again as Joseph, the oldest of the three, walked in after her and closed the door of leaves. “Well if it isn’t my little butterfly. Well Amy where is your big brother to help you this time?” Jo smiled at her and knelt down to slowly start unbuttoning her shirt. “He’ll be here to save me, and you all will be sorry.” Amy said trying to sound strong, but failing. Jo laughed and lifted Amy’s chin. “I’m sorry to say, but if you bastard of a brother does show up then I am sure that my friends will be able to handle him. And as for the saving thing, why would you need saving? We all love you here, do you doubt us?” Jo smiled again as he took his knife from his belt and started to cut open her pants. Amy spat at him and tried to squirm. “Now, now darling, just settle down there I will be gentle I swear.” Jo leaned down next to her ear and whispered softly, “That is until I feel that you’ve been thoroughly broken in.” Amy tried to blink back her tears and put on a strong face as Jo wormed his strong hand in between her legs. With a smile he pulled her legs open as much as he could with her ankles still bound, and held them there with his knees. “I hate you! My brother is not a bastard and is not a half-breed! He’s a Gerial just like you, and he is an Avi!” Jo laughed as he unbuckled his belt. “I am sure he is. But we aren’t talking about him are we? No we are talking about you and me.” Laughter was heard from inside the trunk as well as the shouts of rape and pain. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Are you sure that this is such a good idea?” Nick asked Adam as he threw the tiny stones off the bridge of the tree fort that they had created as smaller children. Adam worked his sore jaw and pinched his nose, “I leave the thinking up to Jo and you should too. It pays off.” Nick swore as Amy’s shouts tore through the forest again and looked back at the trunk. “He’s really rough isn’t he? Well I think that his turn is over!” Nick swore again as he ripped the door open. “Jo! Get out now, you’ve had your fun, now it’s my turn!” Nick shouted with his sword pulled. Jo was inside the trunk between Amy’s legs sweat running down his back. “Damn you to the Dark Forest!” Jo said as he pulled his pants back up glaring at the sword as he shuffled out. Nick walked in with his sword still in his hands and was almost horrified when he turned to Amy. She was laying on the pull out bed with her legs twisted and tangled in the bloody sheets. There was not that much blood, but enough to make it visible. Nick shut the door, sword still in hands, and was enraged with himself when he saw the look of fear on Amy’s face. “I’m not going to hurt you, I’m not even going to touch you.” He said as he put his sword back away and walked to the bed. He laid a hand down on her leg as he took in her body wincing at some of the wounds that Jo must have delivered. “I’m sorry we did this to you. I just want you to know that it was never my idea, I always adored you, that has never been in question, but this is over the edge. I’m sorry that I can’t do anything but spare you any pain that I might pass on you.” Nick smiled as Amy visibly relaxed just a little. Nick had been a friend with Amy before he had fallen into the group of Jo and Adam. Nick was an Avi and the only one of the three friends. He had often played with the idea of Amy being his cleric. As he sat there covering Amy with a sheet he let her sleep with her head in his lap as he stroked her hair telling her how sorry he was. She had always trusted him and he was sure that she still did. It was now on him to protect her from the other two. If it cost him their friendship then so be it. He would not let them do this to her anymore. <br>
<br>
Ryvian had decided to go down to the beach north of his home after Amy left. The city he lived in was far to the north of the hutting peninsula that the Gerials owned. Mekings was the middle of the land where the King and his children lived. The old king of the Gerials had fought to protect their lands as his father and past generations had since the dark wars with the Darklings. That was before the gods took the messenger’s wings and forced the Darklings to become conquered. His wife had been killed by a raid on the fortress town by the Karz, a barbarian race of animal element worshipers. They lived far to the north and had a very strange way of life. After this he had turned around his sadness by making a truce with the northern foxes and restoring an edgy peace. Ryvian was thinking about this and his other history lessons when he got a terrible sense that something was wrong. He couldn’t quite decide what it was, only that it was important and it was tearing his heart out. He turned to the woods not looking where he was going. He walked his way absent-minded until he walked in to a branch and ended up on his back. Almost immediately he felt stupid and heard the laughing from a near tree. “Stupid Darkling can’t even walk!” the two boys in the tree fort ridiculed, pointing and laughing. They both had brown tunics on and looked to be playing a silly game where they had paint all over their faces and held a large fire near the clearing of the grove. Ryvian felt his ears grow hot as he glared at the boys, “Stop it guys. Jo, Adam, I’m not a Darkling and you know it. I was born right here in this town; you know my father.” he said. The boys laughed again and pointed. “Then where did your evil eyes come from!” they spat at him. Ryvian went through this everyday at school from the other children. His eyes weren’t the color of the others. He knew it and it would soon be at an end when he had a chance to prove himself. All the Avi started their training at their third season. He was going to show them all. He looked at one of the boy’s neck and saw the necklace that he had given Amy on her birthday. He instantly forgot his hurt pride as he searched the fort for the third boy. These two always had a third with them, always. He looked at the door of branches and listened carefully and heard what he thought was Amy crying. He clawed at the tree trying to climb up it. He made it half way when he was struck with a rock. He fell and looked back up to see two boys, grins gone, with their blades in hand. Ryvian swore as he ran off into the woods. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Amy had heard Ryvian outside the trunk of the tree. She thought about what had happened, the boys would be paid back for their games. She just hoped that she could tell him not to hurt Nick in time. She smiled as Nick held her hand and stroked her hair, and nuzzled against him again, he had not heard Ryvian outside she was fairly sure. She felt save enough with him, but was now worried about his safety. <br>
<br>
Nick nearly jumped at the shouts from his friends, as Adam wanted his turn. Amy was gripping on his hand tightly as the door was torn from the trunk. “Nick get out it’s my turn now. You’ve wasted your time I didn’t hear anything in here.” Adam smiled as Nick looked to the sword in his hand. “But this is wrong! Adam, I can’t let you do this, you can’t do this.” Nick stood freeing his hand from Amy. Just as his hand went for the hilt of his own sword, Nick was struck with an arrow in his shoulder and was knocked to the back wall. Adam rushed forward so Nick could have no room to pull his sword free. Amy stood up and tried to hold back Jo with a stick she had picked up from beside the bed. Jo grabbed it from her and smacked her across her face with it and lifted his bow nocking another arrow to the string. Amy cried again as she tackled him. Jo finally grabbed her again and threw her back to the bed tossing his bow he started back on her. Amy cried out and Nick with cuts on his arms and chest, and an arrow in his shoulder lunged forward with sword arm ready charged past Adam and pulled the blade free. Jo laughed again with a crazy gleam in his eyes as he yanked an arrow out of the quiver and took the sword blow in his side as he thrust the arrow point into Nick’s throat. “NO!” Amy screamed with tears falling from her face she kicked and punched and even tried biting Jo to get to Nick. He gurgled blood and fell forward. Amy broke free of Jo and held Nicks’ head. “Nick! Please don’t die, please, hang on for a moment let me fix it. I can fix it trust me I can.” Amy closed her eyes as she struggled with the door of her mind that held her power. She had to open the door and use the light on the other side to heal Nick. She felt the door start to open and let her mind travel over Nick’s wounds. She felt his life leaving and screamed as she kicked in the door in her mind letting the light rip into her mind flowing through her hands that were held above the gash in his neck. The wound started to fix itself and the muscles mended and intertwined again. The skin finally closed over the wound leaving no trace of the cut. She let her hands fall as she let out a sigh of relief as she closed the door. The light was dimmer and almost like a dark room when she was finished. The boys stepped out of the room as Nick struggled to sit up. “Nick don’t move, please just lie still. I’ll take care of you.” Amy smiled her special smile that she gave only to her brother and Nick and held his head. Nick chuckled and Amy leaned over to hear his whisper, “I thought that was my job.” She laughed as he tried to sit up. The other boys were shocked and scampered down the tree to make a plan of what to do. They had heard of a cleric’s power to heal, but never seen it. They had to get rid of her soon.<br>

He was not angry with Amy more concerned. He knew they had her up there, he knew what they had been doing to her. At last he even knew why he felt that pain. He was near tears at his worry for his sister. He just hoped that she hadn’t lost faith in him and still believed that he could do something about it. He was so taken up in his thoughts of how he was going to get her out of this mess he missed his step and was thrown onto the ground. He swore and lay there for a while in pain of knowing he could do nothing to help his little sister and had broken his promise. He then started to roll over when he felt a sharp pain in his back. He sat up and looked at what he rolled on. At first the shiny object made him think it was some kind of polished stone that had jutted out of the ground. He then tugged at it and pulled a long sword from the ground. It was residing within an elaborate scabbard with intertwining dragons on the outside. He pulled the blade out and found more dragons engraved in the steel of the blade as well. He ran his finger down the edge of the sword and found it razor sharp. He replaced it into its scabbard and looked into the hole he had made. There was something else down there. He shoved his hand down the hole as he shuffled around pulling back a large shield with the scales of a lizard all over the front. He stood up with new fire in his blazing green eyes as he threw the scabbard over his back fastening it there by the belt it came with, and then slinging his new shield over the scabbard making sure it was strapped tightly and that the hilt was clear of any obstacles. He ran back to the fort with a mission, to kill all of the boys. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Amy had held her ground when Adam tried to get in and Nick was in no condition to fight to protect her. Jo, and Adam had made their plans and started them into play. First, Adam hid behind a pile of tree branches next to the door. Jo had worked on a rope system and had it set up right in the path of the doorway. They called and begged and then decided to just let her think they had left. In a few minutes it had worked, Amy had started out the door when Jo pulled the rope tight catching her legs and Adam pounced on her pulling her by the rope out onto the clearing of the tree fort. She had pulled together most of her clothes and was again stripped of them as she screamed and tried to kick. Jo moved fast and grabbed her hands and tied them to a post that they had readied. Nick was asleep trying to regain his energy and was so deeply sleeping that he heard nothing as he dozed. Amy screamed again as Adam forced her knees open and smiled at Jo. The two snickered and Amy tried to pull her legs together. They laughed at her efforts and Adam loosed his pants down wormed his fingers into the squirming Amy. “Please stop!” she cried as he smiled again licking his fingers. “We’ll stop after one last ride, we swear.” Adam snarled as he stopped her wiggling by grabbing her hips and plunging in between her legs. She let out a scream that rendered their ears as the blood began to flow anew down her legs. <br>
<br>
Hours later after the two had raped her many times they tied her to a pole that was hung between two tripods down next to their fire. She was covered in sweat and blood out of tears she looked at the two move about as she felt her body ache. Where were her protectors, she thought as the boys moved her closer to the fire setting up two more posts to hold the pole she was tied to. She looked at the boys working her sore jaw where Adam had hit her a few times, and tried to talk to them. Her voice didn’t work as she cried and felt something in her break. The boys stopped their working and turned to her looking at her body and smiling again. The oldest one, Jo opened his mouth to say something, but instead his eyes rolled to the back of his head as only blood and no words came out of his mouth. She looked at the body fall to the ground and the bloody blade that stayed where the man once stood. She followed the tip of the blade finding the dragons engraved to be very intricate and beautiful, to the hilt with fingers wrapped tight. She saw a strong Gerial with hair as black as the night robbed it’s mistress moon. His face was handsome and jaw set. She looked at last into his eyes, burning with a fire that could be matched by no flame. Eyes that could melt any warrior’s temperance, and make her heart soar all at once, green. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Adam shouted in fright as he saw his friend fall to the ground, he quickly picked up his sword and looked from Ryvian to Amy. He decided he would have to kill her first to have any chance to make it out of this forest alive. He ran and kicked over the structure holding her near the fire knocking her into the flames. With a bout of flame the fire that had been fed and fueled all day consumed Amy. Ryvian was almost too shocked to react to the action as the blade swung toward his head. Ryvian shouted as swords met and Ryvian blocked and quickly stuck again. Having his blow parried Ryvian ducked under a swing and spun. The boy’s sword struck the shield on Ryvian’s back and as was knocked clear from his hands by the recoil. With an upward motion Ryvian thrust his blade into his enemy’s chest. The blade went effortlessly through his ribs as Ryvian picked the boy off his feet. He gritted between his teeth to the boy, “This is for my sister you gods forsaken son of a whore!” he snarled and flung him towards the tree. The boy shouted as he flew and let a grunt from his throat as a branch impaled him. “You wanted to play war with me! Boys! I was born for it!” Ryvian shouted<br>
<br>
In his rage Ryvian had killed Adam and was rushing over to the flames to where Amy had rolled. She was badly burned and nearly gone by the time Ryvian got there. It had happened so fast he hadn’t even gotten time to save her from it. She opened her eyes and looked into her brother’s face. Ryvian leaned over as she kissed him on the cheek. “Brother, I want to go home. Please take me home. Ryvian, don’t hurt Nick, he’s up in the fort and tried to protect me as much as he could. Ryvian I bonded to him, they had cut him badly and I had to do it. I had to in order to save him. I had to heal him for his help. Tell father that I was going to training. Ryvian please promise me that you will keep your head up, whatever happens don’t let people get you to doubt yourself.” Ryvian was choking on his tears as he held his sister’s bloody hair. “Amy please, please don’t leave me here.” Ryvian cried to no avail she was already gone. Death had not been anything like he had thought, he thought he could swoop in and save her but it had happened too fast and he had waited too long. Ryvian cried over his sister and lifted her after a time to take her home as he had promised. <br>

He had lost his cleric. It was his fault too. Everything he could have done and yet he did nothing. Nick sat at his desk looking at the piece of parchment in front of him. He began to write,<br>
 <br>
&quot;Dear Ryvian, <br>
I know you can never forgive me for taking the sister that you loved and adored, but trust me when I say that I did not mean to do this, I loved her closely and she healed me when I was near death. We were perfect for each other in the situation and I would have made it my life's intent to make her happy for all of her days. I know the pain you go through for Amy as I go through a similar feeling, only I must take mine further than yours. Tomorrow’s sunrise will be my last as I look at the sun that Amy will never see again and take with me the images back to the gates of the Dark Forest, where she wait for me in the afterlife.<br>
Avi Nicholas.” <br>
<br>
Nick left the note on his desk as he went out to look at the sky. He had left the note addressed to Ryvian and hoped that he would get it. He wished that he could go back in time and change the way things were, but as he began to wonder why life played this trick on him Nick thought he saw flames coming from the dock and a winged creature fly off into the sun. Nick spat at the ground as he ran back into the house grabbing his father’s spear on the way out the door. He now had one last mission to finish before he left. He felt that if he killed that monstrosity with wings that he would be allowed to enter the Dark Forest with his love Amy. He only prayed that she wait for him there.<br>

Ryvian was instantly on alert, “Sirs, I’m surprised to see you in my house. I hope you haven’t been waiting long. If you were wondering about the girl here, she’s my cleric and slept the night. We had a long few days so I let her sleep in my room.” Ryvian said smoothly hoping not to have gotten her, or himself, into any trouble. The three men looked at him, and then amongst themselves with frowns. “Son that’s not the reason we are here. Although we have also hear from her about the adventures you two have had in the past two days. I am Major Baltur, I was an officer with your father on his ship Nartaz. I hate to have to give this news but I was the only survivor. Your father valiantly gave his life for the cause of keeping the enemy at bay. It seems that a fleet of Darklings have made it past the two outposts blocking off their river from the ocean. Lesica has made no reports of any escapees, and we have had no word from out own post Zefi for some time now. Ryvian I’m sorry for your loss.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ryvian had caught some of the news but had stopped listening when he heard his father had died. “How?” The three men looked at him, “A darkling was leading the charge on out naval fleet and seemed to have taken us by such surprise that he managed to take out several ships on his own. This Darkling started such uproar that it took us three large formations to finally get him to run. He had wings Ryvian. Your father and him battled on the deck and Destri lost. It was a close battle, your father pulled him down on the deck and lured him to fight him on the ground, but after he had inflicted many wounds on him the Darkling took off and came back throwing his sword down at your father who caught it in his chest.” The major said as he unbuckled a sword from his belt and set it on the table. “This was his. I’m sure he wanted you to have it. Me and him go way back you know, we fought together in the fort of Zefi.” The major said eyes cast down. Ryvian looked at the blade and saw the three lions and two tigers engraved on the scabbard of his family crest. He knew that the blade itself was of such a fine metal that it was a sword that almost never dulled. He lifted it as the men stood. “We have many more messages to give, I’m sorry lad.” The three men started to walk to the door, “Wait, one of you are the head chief of the Avi, after my father, right?” Rvyain asked looking from his chair. The man that turned was a strong built Gerial with long hair pulled back into a knot. “I’m of my forth season and am joining today. I have nothing here to keep me back so I will go with you.” Ryvian stood as the men waited for him to gather his things. He walked back out of his room with his chain mail armor, his father’s sword at his waist, and the hilt of the other blade jutting over his shoulder, the shield strapped tight on top of the scabbard. Ryvian looked at his house once again spotting the spear that was passed down from generation to generation he grabbed it from the wall as he shut and locked the door. All his memories were nothing and he was about to start his life.  He would now do what his father always wanted him to do, take his place with honor. His mission in life was to take the wings of the monstrosity that killed his father and have his vengeance.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Years went by and Ryvian had moved to the top of his class. The students didn’t make fun of his eyes and he grew to understand that the Avi were leaders for a reason. They didn’t have to relish in the mocking of others to get ahead. Instead they fought hard and long all their lives. In all the missions and activities Ryvian had gathered more spirits then anyone else and had ventured higher into the mountain passes then anyone in his class.  He had broken records set many years ago in his efficiency. He had gathered yet another blade when he killed a Griffin with his bare hands. They took the blood from it and used it to dye his sword a reddish hue with the tigers and lions on the blade adding it to his back. He had grown to a position of respect and honor. As he grew, so did his experience and his armor. They made the armor out of a special material found in the passes that made it very strong and dyed it with the blood of the cobalz to give it a green hue and protection against the most powerful spells. The color green was to help determine an Avi from his wards. The days of work were beginning to pay off as he strolled the city of Mekings where he would gather the last part of his armor and receive his honors and graduate. He had waited for one hundred years to finally get to where he was. During the many seasons of his training he had gotten many letters from Lily, only reading one or two and burning the rest. Distractions would have hindered his learning. The two things he did on his leave were to see Lily graduate, although she didn’t see him there, and to attend her mother and brother’s funeral. Both times he hadn’t talked to Lily, or even let her know he was there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ryvian had grown strong not only in arm, but in mind. He knew of every race in the documented world, and even some more. He learned from them everything, including the way of war. He had made his style from the many forms all combined.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He had been in the grand city of Mekings for five days now and didn’t even notice the crowds of people that seemed so natural in such a large area. In all his life, Ryvian had seen wonderful places and large cities and forests, but   the people made this town look all that much bigger. The city was constructed during the times of the Darkling rule. It held three sections in the main walls, the slums, making the outer section surrounding the rest closest to the walls, then the market and upper class residential circled with a wall blocking out the slums and the fort. The fort was were the King and his royal family resided. The walls were higher then the rest of the town, and in the center stood the tower of the Avi guard piercing the heart of the clouds with its height. Cutting the first two sections in the middle, the merchant road was made up of all of the working class and was the life of the city. The road ran all the way up to the main gates of the fort. Ryvian was amazed at the beauty of the city and the sheer genius of the town’s structure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the first few days he stuck to the middle section of the city wandering around looking at all of the people and the merchants. After that he decided to take a trip into the slums, but as soon as he got there he found himself out of place and quickly left. Then on the last day he decided to take a look at the fort, after all this is where his bloodline all started. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He woke up that morning and looked out his window to see the walls towering over his inn and made his mind up that he would go and see it himself. As he wandered to the gate of the fort he saw the arrow slits in the twin towers sitting on either side of the thick wooden gate. It was surrounded by a moat that was not large, but would certainly put doubt into a mind trying to take the fort. The guards standing on the bridge at the fort stared at some unseen foe with faces set. Ryvian strode to the men and looked at them. He had been wise to wear the armor of the Avi today and smiled, as the guards moved aside quickly not looking him in the face. Ryvian chuckled to himself as he moved past them into the open gates of the fort. Even though he was not a complete Avi yet he was allowed past them into the fort due to his armor, only and Avi could gather this armor and only an Avi would even dare to wear it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ryvian had been in the fort for a few hours looking at all the grand towers and banners. He had even seen part of the armory. The day’s sun was reaching its full glory when Ryvian knew he had to be getting back to his inn and ready for the graduation. With the sound of all the people and the many turns in the path, Ryvian was not paying attention to where his surroundings as he turned the corner and ran into a girl. “I’m sorry I didn’t see you there.” He offered his hand to help her back to her feet. After she stood up Ryvian noticed that she was glancing over her shoulder nervously. Ryvian eyed her age, she could be no more then 2 seasons younger then he, and she had extraordinary eyes. They burned with a fire that seemed to consume everything, looking deeper into them, Ryvian found not only fiery defiance, but also intelligence. He was caught off guard by her eyes and it took him a moment to gather his thoughts. He was wondering why a girl like this was in street garb, dressed like a peasant, although there was something about the way she held herself, straight backed, head high, and chin raised. She didn’t seem the type to be left out in the road. Again his smile faded at his thoughts, but seeing the nervousness in her eyes changed his stare into a grin. “I’m Ryvian the Surefooted. I’ am an Avi and am glad to be at your service, lass.” He bowed with a smile. She looked over her shoulder again. “I’m Rylena. I seem to be lost.” She gave a little bout. Ryvian grinned, this girl was more then she seemed to be. She would not have been able to just wander this area of the town. Ryvian was about to say something witty when he was knocked to the ground. “In the name of all that is good and holy!” Ryvian shouted as he drew to a standing position with his hand wrapped tightly around the hilt of the sword that jutted over his right shoulder. His eyes finally found his assailant. “Sister! What are you doing talking to him? Why are you dressed like that? Why are you not with your guards? Damn it!” the boy shouted. The boy’s eyes moved to Ryvian once again. Rylena was standing with a frown on her face and the look of a defeated escapee. Ryvian finally took in the boy’s appearance fully and saw a young Gerial, finely dressed. He wore a small blade at his side and a tilted hat on his head. The boy saw the hand on the hilt and instantly drew his sword and stepped between Ryvian and Rylena. “You dare threaten my sister with your sword! I’ll have you head for that!” The young boy charged at Ryvian. Now really confused Ryvian drew his sword as the boy struck. The blade struck his cloak and slid harmlessly off his green armor underneath. Ryvian took the opportunity to fight back. He struck with sure moves and ease of experience. The boy dodged most of the swings and blocked the others; he was very energetic. Finally putting an end to the young boy’s foolishness, Ryvian quickly hit the hilt of the boy’s sword knocking it into the air where Ryvian snatched it in his other hand. The boy moved to pull a dagger but his sister stepped in between the two. “Will you two stop this!” she shouted at them. “I’m not in danger Talidon, I was in perfectly good hands.” The boy moved his hand away from his dagger and outstretched it to Ryvian gesturing to his sword. “No, first I want some answers. What was that all about? I’m Ryvian Surefoot, head of the Avi class, and Warlord to the town of Delnor. Who the hell are you!” Ryvian was very unnerved as he slowly lowered his own sword. “I am Talidon Darkwind, this is my sister Rylena Darkwind. I am Prince of the Sword and the royal heir to the throne of the Gerials!” he snapped back. Ryvian dropped the boy’s sword in shock and saluted. “I’m sorry sir, but you attacked me.” The young boy glared at him and then his sword. Ryvian picked it up and placed it in the hands of his prince. “Well sister, it is time we get back to father.” He said as he slammed his sword into his scabbard and hooked his arm with Rylena’s. She was hauled away but still looked back with a smile to Ryvian. After they were out of sight Ryvian could only let a sigh of relief and lift his sword with a slow hand.<br>

After roaming aimlessly for the rest of the morning, something caught his eye. It was a beautiful ring that was thrown in with dusty ruble and knickknacks of the merchant. Ryvian pushed his way over to the stand and looked at the seller. He wasn’t even a Gerial! It was a Drul, the best metal workers in the land! The Drul had the look of a wild dog only with the body seemingly like a man. He sat in the chair with his eyes half closed and ears flopped over his face. Ryvian lifted the ring from the tangle of other items and blew the dust off of it. “Ah sir, I see you have taken a liking to the ring of frost! Why no one has seen it for what its worth in many a year. Well I’ll sell it to you for only 5 of your countries gold coins. No I know it doesn’t look like much, but,” the seller leaned in closer whispering now, “it once belonged to a queen from the lands of the Karz. It was of the times of the council, and the queen was the leader of those tundra foxes. She had helped her land grow to more then just a rabble of tribes, and into a strong nation. It was her father that gave her this ring before she was betrothed to the king from the far away and mysterious isle of the Naltraz. Strangely the week before the marriage she was assassinated in her own bed. Well it had passed hands and some how ended up with me. It is worth well over my asking price, but a fool like me will sell it for this cheep. A man has to make money to feed his family though. What do you say sir?” The Drul sat back and smiled lazily as Ryvian fished around in his money pouch for the right coins. As Ryvian handed the money to the Drul he heard in the distance a bell marking the middle of the day. Ryvian quickly gestured a salute and, with ring in hands, ran off toward his inn<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking into the mirror, combing her hair Lily smiled at herself. She was so exited about her meeting with Ryvian. It had been so long and she hadn’t received any mail from him though she sent letters everyday. Lily had sensed him with her when she needed him. After Ryvian left she was more or less shocked with the events and felt abandoned, but ever time this came over her, she felt a surge of pride and the feeling she got when she was around Ryvian, held close and protected. She had her family there as well to back her when she felt as if she couldn’t make it. <br>
<br>
Her family was just like the rest of the Avi, cleric pairs, one son, one daughter, both born with the gift that in the war of Light was given to them. Valin had fought the Darklings in the passes that blocked off their peninsula from the mainland of Nevil. When he had witnessed so many of his countrymen die he prayed to the gods to give him the power to save his people. The god of life and the goddess of death both agreed that they would help him. They gave Valin the ability to spare the souls of those he killed the journey through the Dark Forest by harvesting their souls in his own, allowing them a small area to dwell in. He learned that after death every creature would become benevolent and be at peace with their passing. The souls and spirits of the deceased would then be given the power over the body of its host. Valin would hand over the power of control to one of his souls in the libraries of them so that he could fight for longer periods of time. His wife also asked for help, the power to heal her husband came from the power and glory of the moon. When the moon reached the full glory of it’s height in the night sky the power of the cleric would be strongest, although always there. A room filled in their heads with the power of the stars and moon. The light in the room would be used and then eventually refilled again as the moon rose and fell. The power was passed onto five Gerial generals that became the warlords of the five powerful cities of the Gerial lands. The power was then passed on from father to son, as was the power of the cleric. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
It was shortly after her leaving though, for her academy, that her mother died of in an accidental fire that had taken her house at the night. Her brother had been home for a visit and was killed trying to save his mother from the burning house. Lily was torn inside and was hoping that Ryvian would be there to hold her and keep her safe, but he didn’t show up. She sunk even lower, but she felt his will pushing her on with life and she went back to school to finish up after the funeral. Her brother had been sent off to the mountain by the Avi class, so she could not attend his funeral, but her mother, they sent to sea on a raft. She had graduated as planned and was ready to see Ryvian there, but again he didn’t show up. She could sense he was near though and wondered if he was avoiding her for some reason. By then she had come to trust in his love and assurance, and in this she felt his love come through. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shaken from her thoughts by the midday bells, Lily quickly braided her long red hair and smoothed her purple silken dress. She was hoping not to disappoint him and hoped that he would recognize her still after these long years. The Gerial birth rite of longevity was at times tiring, but she felt it gave her just enough time to fully enjoy life and its wonders.<br>

The bells had run long before he reached his inn, and he was very late. Finally he pushed through a crowd and joined his classmates. He got in his place just as the commander was announcing his name. “And now I’d like to present a strong young Gerial that will honor his father’s name and life up to his blood rite’s rank, and lead many brave wards into battle. I am deeply honored to introduce Ryvian the Surefooted, Warlord of Delnor.” The crowd cheered as Ryvian walked up the podium. The commander stood in front of him as Ryvian took a knee. His head bowed Ryvian was ready for the finally piece of armor. He had long since journeyed into the Lithesium caves. Here the Avi knowledge of sword and wisdom is put to the test. They travel deep into the rock of the mountains to find the lost stocks of Lithesium ore. This is what is used in the making of their armor. Ryvian had gathered his supply so quickly that he was granted scaled armor over the plated and chained showing his rank. The old caves used to be mined by Gerials, but after they were shut up in the dark away from the ocean and sky the miners grew into something different and began to surface every once and awhile to kill a some of the herdsmen cattle and plagued the mountains it was dangerous to travel it for any normal civilians. Many that go in unprepared become lost in the caves from the sun and their minds. The Avi finds the ore by the lake of the lost stars in bar form. The miners created their forges by the water to create the bars of highly durable and very light metal. Not only is there danger from the miners but there are also creatures called Milthis, lurkers of the shadows. It is believed that the miners had been testing on some creatures to find a suitable opponent for the Darklings. They called this the project of forgotten souls. The Avi gain most of their knowledge from these creatures if found. They have been on Nevil since the beginning of time and lived through the wars of the Light as well as the early wars with the Naltrans. After the ore is collected it is brought back to the surface to be turned into the armor of an Avi with the help of the instructors the student creates it with the seals and the blood of the cobalz to make it impenetrable to magic. This process is done the student is allowed to wear his armor to protect him as the pieces only get harder and harder to collect for. There are three different styles of the armor that is created to show rank and ability. The scaled being the topmost ranking as the design is much more intricate then the others; the plated armor that is worn by most of the Avi and is a symbol of hard work and dedication, and finally the chained armor is the sign of a more or less skilled Avi. They are the ones that are assigned as lower officers to run the ships of the mighty ocean fleet of the Gerials. Ryvian was receiving the scaled armor for his research in the caves of the lost, and his many adventures that brought him fame and respect form many of the other Avi. He bowed his head as he took his helm that his Commander had created for him, the scaled dragon’s head that resembled the dragons on his sword. He had three swords, his father’s sword strapped to his back, the dragon’s blade strapped crisscross to his father’s and then the blade that he was gifted from the Griffon at his hip. He wore them with pride as each had given him a part of the arsenal that would be needed in his future battles. The Griffon blade not only gave him another weapon, but also granted him the power of sight. He could see far away as if he had eyes in the blue sky as well as the ground. Ryvian stood with his new helm and smiled to the crowd and took his place standing next to the Commander as he handed out the rest of the armor, none of them scaled, as the crowd cheered them on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the ceremony Ryvian started his walk away from the crowds. He was very proud of himself to have gotten the high honor of a scaled helm to go along with his armor. He was now the noted Warlord of the city of Delnor with the sign of his graduation. His job was to protect the people of Delnor from any force that might pose harm. As his road took him to a intersection a wave of anxiety washed over him and it was not his. “I see the dashing man I once knew and loved walking down the same street as I. You’re just as handsome if not more then when I last saw you.” As the familiar voice reached his ears he stopped but did not turn. “Thank you very much, I worked very hard for this day.” His head dropped a little, “I heard about your mother and Henri. I’m sorry.” He turned around to face Lily and caught his breath in his throat. He was surprised, and at first Lily thought he was disappointed and gave him a small pout. She was wearing a purple dress of the finest material that made her appear to be floating. She had grown taller and her hair was long and braided. Ryvian smiled again as he moved closer to her. Already feeling the draw to her Ryvian stopped a few paces from her. “Well, you certainly are looking as beautiful as ever. My imagination of what the pretty little girl I once knew would look like was not near as beautiful as you are now.” Her face was that of pure joy and she let out a small giggle that was like drops of dew in a crystal pond. “I was sorry to hear about your father, I didn’t see you after that day and couldn’t tell you how sorry I was. I also lost my father to that horrible day. I sent you mail everyday, but I guess you didn’t get it. I told you about my graduation and how I cried because I didn’t see you there. I also wrote you that I was coming to see yours and where I would be staying.” She smiled again faintly. Ryvian took her into his arms and held her as she rested her head on his shoulder. “It has been too long my sweet flower.” Ryvian said as he listened to her soft tears of joy. Then she backed away, wiping the tears from her eyes, “It has indeed.”  The two hooked arms as they walked down the road to the ball being held at the King’s court.<br>

Err; it’s your eyes. They are, well I might just be foolish, but do you have brothers or sisters?” he asked and moved his eyes from under the gaze of the Avi to his lady. Her stare was worse than his. “I’m Ryvian the Surefooted, Warlord of Delnor. And yes I did have a sister once, she was killed many years ago though.” Lily gave the guard a look that took his breath away and was clear that he need change the subject fast. “Well I’m sorry Master Ryvian, I was just curious. Well if I could get your invitation I would be much obliged to let you and your lovely lady through.” Ryvian sighed as he handed over the tickets. The guard opened the door and as the pair walked through gave a small salute, hand over heart, bowing deeply. “Honor and might, sir.” He nodded to the lady and closed the door after them. He made sure his sword was clear in the scabbard, there was going to be blood tonight. As the normal guard took his place and saluted him, Mettrich walked off towards the stables to check in with the guards there. He was a cautious man, and patient; he did not obtain the position of Commander of the Royal Army for being foolish.<br>
<br>
Ryvian walked through the main hall after a servant took his cloak. The pair walked into the grand ballroom, Ryvian leading with his hand guiding the small of Lily’s back. The surrounding room was filled with tables and Avi. There was a grand space open for dancing and there was even an orchestra playing. Ryvian was on edge about the place, he couldn’t tell why, but the amount of people made the hairs on his neck stand on end. Taking in the surroundings the room was beautiful. There were grand tapestries hanging on the walls of the great wars, of heroes, and of enemies. He was so taken by the room that he nearly missed the music coming to an end. He looked back to Lily with a childish grin, “Almost as enchanting as you, but not quite.” Lily smiled as Ryvian swept her into an embrace as the music started up again.<br>
<br>
The two danced for a few songs and when Lily grew tired the two moved to a table. As the guards moved like silent stalkers in a great jungle, a man in a suit walked to the table to pour wine for the two of them. He nearly missed the cup when he saw Ryvian’s eyes. “Sir, was your mother of a different race than us? Did your father dilute the blood of the Avi with your birth?” The waiter said awfully rude. “No my mother was of our race and my father was the Warlord of Delnor, and he knew not to do such a foolish thing. And if you have a problem with me then please don’t skip around it and tell me now.” Ryvian said growing more agitated. The man fumbled an apology and staggered off into the sea of people. Ryvian shook the encounter off and lifted his glass. “Well, may we life happy lives, long and together.” Lily smiled and Ryvian saw the reason he loved her. The red eyes flashed and all her beauty and intelligence, and splendor shone through. As the two started in on the steak that had been set for them Ryvian felt the hair on the back of his neck really stand on end. His hand went to the hilt of his blade, his father’s sword, the one he wore for this occasion at his hip, to see if it was clear in the scabbard. The music started up again with a fast movement when a familiar voice sounded at his back. “Well, well. If it isn’t the half breed.” Ryvian moved his chair back and looked at the speaker. “Thomas. I see you still have the same misconception that plagued you in school. You just can’t understand that I’m better than you.” Thomas pulled his sword free and kicked over a nearby table, “That’s it Ryvian! I’ve had enough of you and your stubborn attitude. I had to live with you from day one and now I’m going to end it.” Ryvian smirked as he stood up motioning for Lily to stay seated. “Well if you want, I’ll gladly take this outside with you and see who really is the best.” Ryvian patted his sword and gave Thomas a lazy smile. “I suggest you bring your cleric. I hope she’s had enough training to put you back together when I’m done with you.” Thomas turned red, “No, Ryvian this time I decide the place. Here now.” Ryvian smiled and turned back to Lily who had a worried look. “Darling this won’t take long, I promise.” Turning back to Thomas, “Let’s take this into the open area.”<br>
<br>
Ryvian stood back turned to Thomas as a crowd circled around them on the dance floor. He was watching Lily give him a worried and somewhat concerned look. Ryvian turned his attention back to Thomas. “Well let’s get this show on the road. Ladies and gentlemen, I am Ryvian the Surefooted, Warlord of Delnor, and this is a friend of mine, his name is Thomas. Sadly Thomas here has no cognomen and has no current role. He has challenged me to a duel to the death, and as a Gerial of good will, I will fight this without the use of my cleric.” Ryvian again looked at Lily who looked more than worried at the moment. “And please one more thing, this is a duel, please do not interfere. Thank you all, I hope this will bring you some entertainment.” Ryvian bowed to the people as he pulled his sword and knelt. “Father be with me tonight.” He said quietly to himself. Thomas drew his own sword and the crowd was tingling with excitement. This was not a normal event; the Avi rivalries were usually not seen and very covered up. The ring of the blade told Ryvian it was time and he stood taking his stance. Both Gerials glared at each other in perfect stance from across the space. Ryvian smiled again as Thomas broke his stance to charge. Blades met and Ryvian was forced back. The two struck and parried blows with styles that made it look more like a dance of deadly proportions. Lily hid her face as Ryvian was struck in his sword arm. Thomas was pressing all his strength into the blows and exhausting his energy quickly. Ryvian was more reserved in his blows and had struck in places that were slowly bleeding Thomas of his energy. Thomas’ cleric was busy healing away as Ryvian swung with the sure strokes that took their toll on Thomas.<br>
Across the room watching the two fight, were two children, one gazing with eyes that could not be broken from Ryvian, and the other imitating the moves he saw. The two Gerial royalties were standing in front of their father. The guards standing around the King and his children were taking bets on the winner. While the crowd cheered and groaned at the strikes, Lily was slowly opening the door to her magic while the moon was still most powerful. <br>
<br>
Ryvian had still not given his mind over yet as Thomas switched back and forth trying desperately to stay in the fight. Finally scoring a shot that was near fatal Thomas grinned. “Ryvian it seems that I will go home with your woman tonight!” he snarled through gritted teeth. Ryvian growled and swung his father’s sword slicing Thomas’ blade in two. The force of it took Thomas off his feet and on his back. Instantly trying to sit up he met a blade at his throat. “I told you that I would kill you for this.” Ryvian gasped trying to regain his breath. Lily was at his side in a heartbeat, “Ryvian, you’ve beaten him. Leave him be now, you have beaten him.” Ryvian was on his last nerve when he sheathed his sword. He turned to Lily and held her in his arms for a moment. He was exhausted and sore from the fight. Lily helped him back to their table and he smiled at her once again finally able to take a full breath. She smiled back at him, eyes sparkling. Ryvian was at peace again and was gazing into Lily’s eyes when he noticed something. They had changed from her dazzling red to a deep hazel. He was shocked and he noticed that the smile was also gone from her beautiful face. He was about to ask what was wrong but he knew. He turned again and saw the fire blaze as Thomas dropped the dagger and fell to the ground in a roar of flames. Ryvian looked again and saw Lily’s eyes change back over to the red that he always remembered. He was about to say something, but decided not to. Instead he smiled at her again and kissed her hand. <br>
<br>
The crowd had fallen back form the Gerial on fire with gasps and then moved back together as the King himself moved towards Ryvian’s table. “Excuse me. I was wondering if I could have a word with you.” Ryvian was shaken out of his thoughts as he turned to find Justin the Large, King of the Gerials. He was standing behind his seat with a smile on his face. Ryvian fell out of his chair landing on his knees in a bow, “Sir.” The King chuckled and put a large hand on his shoulder. “You may stand. What is your name?” Ryvian shuffled to his feet standing straight. “I am Ryvian the Surefooted, top of my Avi class and Warlord of Delnor, by birthright. Sir.” The King smiled. The crowd again parted and Ryvian saw two Gerials come running to the King’s side. Ryvian smiled as Rylena and Talidon hugged their father and looked towards him. “So tell me Ryvian, what did this man do to provoke you into the fight?” Ryvian smiled and looked to the still smoking body of Thomas, “Well, sir, I have known that Avi from the moment we started school. He was determined to be the top and refused to recognize my superiority, not that it bothered me, but when he pushed it to mocking and insulting, I could do nothing else but defend the name of the Avi and kill the weak link that threatened the chain of centuries of strong Avi.” Ryvian said confidently. He was sure that he was not in any kind of wrong for killing Thomas. “Well I totally agree. The Avi have always been the elite of this land and will always be that. To be elite we must rectify the weak. Well spoken indeed. Ryvian I want you to meet my children. This is Rylena, and this is Talidon.” The two children stepped forward and Rylena smiled at Ryvian. “These are my most precious treasures, and I want you to train them. You and your cleric that is, I’m sorry to have been so rude, but I didn’t catch your name.” The king said as he kissed Lily’s hand. “Rylena smiled again at Ryvian. “Sir, I don’t think I understand. You want me to train your son? Why not send him to the school of the Avi, and same with your daughter? They would get better care and much more efficient training. Also sir, if Lily, and myself are called off to a war then what of your children? Sir.” The King smiled. “Listen, since you are going to be my children’s teacher, then you should call me at least by my name. And Justin works just fine.” With that the King turned and started to leave. “I have trusted in you now, Ryvian the Surefooted, as I did with your father, I expect to keep that trust.” The King then walked off into the crowd. <br>

He looked around and saw the room in a complete mess. Things were thrown around like a whirlwind had hit. He looked out the window to see the tower of the Avi guard standing out in the white clouds and blue sky. Ryvian started to open the other eye when the headache hit him like a tidal wave. He was nearly taken out of consciousness; he had never had a hangover like this before. He looked around to see if he had drank anything else after he and Lily had returned to his room, finding only her dress over the back of a chair, his armor thrown around, and her foot sticking out from under the covers. Ryvian finally closing his eyes again felt Lily’s hands move across his chest and he felt his headache go away. Smiling he dug around in the covers, finding only the top of his head he kissed it and let his mind wander that night. He had gotten home after the party and Lily and him had gone to his room where they had made love into the early hours of the morning. He smiled at the memory of her and crushed a pillow down here he thought her head was. He heard giggling under there somewhere and started to tunnel down into the bed. <br>
<br>
 Just as he had found her and started to kiss her, there was a knock at the door followed by the sound of the door being opened. Ryvian was out of the bed in a rush and already had sword in his hands before he knew who it was. He was within a span of a feather of delivering the killing blow to the neck before he looked into the face of the young runner. With a growl he dropped his sword back into the mess on the floor and walked back to the bed where Lily was just sticking her head above her cave in the covers. The runner was white with fright and was shaking when Lily looked at Ryvian with a silly grin. “You big jerk you scared the wits out of the messenger. Look at him he can’t even get a word out now.” Lily giggled and Ryvian threw another pillow at her, Lily ducking back into the bed. “Sorry about that. I wasn’t sure who you were and you just barged into my room.” Ryvian smiled trying to ease the frightened runner. “Well, sir, I was just out of breath. You caught me off guard, sorry.” Ryvian grinned, “You’re joking right? You caught me off guard, I should have known it was a messenger, but I was kind of sidetracked.” Ryvian smiled nodding back at the bed. The runner grinned, “Well sir, the Commander is calling everyone to the main hall. You have until the bells ring for midday.” The runner smiled back at Ryvian looking to the bed, “You’re a lucky Gerial, she’s beautiful.” Ryvian smiled again and thanked the runner as he showed him out. <br>
As Ryvian opened the doors to the barracks that served as the main hall of the Army, he saw hundreds upon hundreds of wards walking around and in the center of them all one green clad Avi. He was looking at the weapons on the walls when he stumbled into a man who was shouting orders to a group of nearby Avi. “You boys be careful, I need you to take the wards and move them down the map to here. Then stay put until you are met by the side fleet before proceeding to Zefi.” The Avi nodded and took their maps off the table and turned back to their wards to walk out the door. Ryvian caught the Commander by the arm before the crowd ate him into the folds of people. “Sir, Ryvian the Surefooted reporting.” The Gerial turned and Ryvian was nearly shocked. It was Mettrich, the guard from the other night. “Good morning Ryvian.” Mettrich smiled at the surprised Avi. Grinning Mettrich lead the way to the table with a large map of the world on it. “We are in some trouble young man. The Darkling fleets are proving more and more dangerous with the use of the winged fleet as well as the navel.” Ryvian grabbed the Commander’s shoulders and pulled him around to face him, “You said winged? I only knew of one winged Darkling!” Ryvian nearly shouted. The Commander chuckled, “You are far behind in current events. The Darklings have produced more then two fleets of winged generations, and our sources tell us that they are in league with the Humans of the south. They have taken out our post Zefi and taken to building ships for the Darklings to help them move around. Our scouts tell us that they have already brought great damage to the northern lands of the Tundra Foxes. They have fought them off so far, but also have taken large losses. We need you to take a Galton of twelve wards and your cleric to the human city. There you are to remove the central government and replace it with yourself until our ambassador gets there to take control. You might find some resistance along the way, so I suggest you bring the spear that your father used to own. It can be used against a winged Darkling. I’m sure with your background, as a child in the fishing town Delnor, you will know your way around throwing a spear.” The Commander handed Ryvian the papers of pass through Valin’s pass, and maps of the areas. Ryvian was still in a state of shock as he looked at the map on the table. “You want me to travel all the way across the world away from my home to go on a stupid mission that could be carried out by a mere ambassador?” Ryvian was past shock as his temper rose. “Ryvian. I am not sending you for that one mission; I am testing the strength of the Human-Darkling alliance. I want to see the reaction when our race takes the city on not just this war, but with the entire of the world. If we find that the people hate the rule and will make war on us we take out the human royalty and leave it for the council to decide. That is why I’m sending you. You are of vital importance to the safety of our way of life. If you do not succeed in the objective, then we will have no information and the Humans will still be at the back of the Darklings.” The Commander looked at Ryvian, and then behind him to the awaiting wards. “This is your Galton, Ryvian lead them well.” With that the Commander was swept off into the crowd followed by Avi and wards that had lined up next to him awaiting orders.<br>
<br>
The wards lined up in order from rank, the badges of battle were adorned above their right arm. Ryvian looked from the first one to the last one with a keen eye. He noted their reactions as they looked into his green eyes. “We move out at dusk. Gather your things and say goodbye to anyone that knows you because we are heading into a dangerous area. I will meet you at the front outside the gates after the bell has struck three more times today, midday has just pasted. I will meet all of you and I expect you to be in your armor and with lances and swords.” Ryvian looked again at the wards and sighed. This was what he was given to take a whole city! This was ridiculous to take a small Galton that doesn’t even fit up to a royal guard for the King’s son and take over a city. This was madness. <br>

I think we’ve got ourselves a half bred Avi to deal with.” Alec said with a concerned tone. The rest of the Galton looked at him with looks that were filled with annoyance. Alec was never accepted well among the others. He was from a wealthy family and that is how he was allowed into the school, his father was a great war hero from the Karz conflict and so like father like son. Only this son was not living up to his father. The others looked again to the doors of their barracks. “He did have different eyes, but Alec he is our leader, Avi and not to mention a bloody Warlord. Even if we didn’t like him what could we do?” Maternic asked. He had been the leader of the small group in training camp and was up for the job of second in control. He looked again at Alec and snickered, “At least he has a sword and not a dagger like you were given.” The rest of the Galton had a laugh and walked into the barracks leaving Alec and Maternic glaring at each other.<br>
<br>
As Ryvian watched as Talidon danced around with sword in hand fighting an invisible enemy. Ryvian threw advise to the young Avi as his sister giggled with glee as she watched her brother practice. Lily had her hands full with the questions from her own charge. Rylena was constantly asking questions that were about magic as well as Ryvian. The young girl was almost obsessed with her curiosity for the Avi. Lily smiled when Ryvian sighed out frustration showing her that she was not alone in this. She loved the two like her own children, but this was ridiculous, they were trained for war and duty, not teaching. <br>
<br>
Ryvian told his two new charges that they would need to pack because they were moving on a mission to take the human city. The two were so excited that they ran off into the streets knocking over a stand. Talidon asked if he could bring his cleric, as he already had one. It would just make things easier for the both of them if they could be together. Ryvian agreed. He would have to loan him some proper armor, and Lily would have to teach the cleric some things if she was not already through her school. This was getting complicated. Ryvian sighed again only with relief when he was finally alone with Lily in the room to get their own things together. “Those two will be the death of me. By the time we get to Ibium I will be begging the humans to kill me then.” Lily chuckled. “I think Rylena has fallen in love with you. Now I’ll have to find myself another Avi.” She said in a playful pout. “Ha, that child could not take your place, in my heart, not even a glimpse.” Ryvian snickered. “She is too young to understand the ways of life.” Lily smiled again as she looked up from her packing. “You have to admit that she does resemble her just a little.” Ryvian stopped with his lance in one hand and bags in the other. “Yes she does.” Ryvian said shortly and walked out the door.<br>
<br>
Lily looked back at her bags and remembered back to their childhood, to that night that Amy was killed. Ryvian was hurt by the memory, and with Rylena, a striking resemblance to her, this could grow complicated. Lily shed a tear for the memory and walked out after Ryvian. This would indeed be a hard trip on them all.<br>

Well you are still my children’s teacher, and you will take them with you.” Ryvian was nearly shocked. “But sir, I have but a Galton of twelve wards and we are bound on a very dangerous objective. I do not think it a good idea to take children on this journey. I was hoping you would side with me on this issue, them being your children. I don’t’ want to endanger them with them following me.” The King nodded again and looked down at Ryvian, “I have made up my mind. You gained the name Surefoot for a reason, and now you will prove you are worthy of your name and title.” With that the King walked past Ryvian and towards his chambers. Ryvian nearly swore but held his tongue until the King had left. <br>
<br>
The bells rang out over the peaceful city of Mekings as Ryvian and his Galton marched out of the city.  The troop was adorned with armor and lances rested in the loop in the saddle of their horses. Ryvian had taught Talidon to ride with his lance locked securely in place. Lily was riding next to Rylena talking about how the bond could be felt when she had chosen her Avi, and how the healing for the first time would be done. Talidon’s cleric was also listening intently. Ryvian had listened to the Galton’s complains about taking untrained recruits, but when told the King had insisted they each grumbled less often and quieter. <br>
<br>
“Ryvian, how does an Avi know that the soul he has control of is trustable?” Talidon asked as the Galton started to set up camp. The troop had made it half way out into the plains that lead from the main city of Mekings, to the mountain pass that would lead out into the world. Ryvian smiled as he watched the sun slowly set behind the mountains. “Well, in death the souls of those that we take into our own, become peaceful and all resentment and loathing or hatred that was once the driving force is replaced with a peace that only death can bring to one. In a way the Avi lets a person become longer lived through our own life. That way the souls we hand over our trust to are glad to help the living. At times though we encounter a soul that is deeply dangerous to our safe being; a person so filled with hate that they can not be soothed in death and must there for be sent on to the afterlife without a chance, you will learn how to let a soul pass through you instead of enveloping it and making it part of yourself.” Ryvian finished. As he stood up he saw Rylena gazing at him from inside her tent. When he winked at her she blushed and retreated back into the tent. Ryvian was confused, but he soon forgot his thoughts when he caught Lily’s eyes following him as well. He smiled her direction and she smiled lovingly back to him. He started to cross the expanse when he ran into Maternic. “Sir I was just looking for you. I wanted to talk to you about some of the others; they have problems that need to be brought to attention, mainly yours.” Ryvian nodded and started to walk to his command tent. Once inside Ryvian had the ward’s full attention. It seemed to Ryvian that this Gerial was the leader of the Galton before they were assigned to him. “Well,” Ryvian asked as he poured a glass of yaltin, a sweet wine. “Well sir there are some of the Gerials that are more than loyal and willing to fight, but there has been some disturbance in the wards. Mainly with the one called Alec. Well sir the problem is with the color of your eyes. They feel that you are of a different race and not truly a Gerial. They do not feel a loyalty to an outside race that has moved among the ranks to gain a title larger then their own.” Maternic said taking the glass offered to him. “And you? Where do you stand, Mat?” Ryvian asked as he downed the rest of the glass. “Sir, it is my honor to serve under the son of the great Destri. My father was on his ship when it went down, although me and my mother was living back at Mekings, he was stationed out there. I am with you all the way, but I believe that the others, all good soldiers, are being riled up by Alec and his treason.” Mat said placing the glass down on the desk. Ryvian nodded to himself as Lily opened up the door of the tent. He smiled at her and she walked to sit next to him. Mat stood up and nodded to Ryvian, “Well I’d best be getting back with the rest. I can’t keep my eye on them if I’m here all night bothering you.” He started to walk out when Ryvian stood, “Thank you for the information, it will come into use.” Mat nodded again and walked out.<br>

She couldn’t sleep with her dreams of Ryvian. For some reason she couldn’t get his face out of her mind. Rylena had never felt this way before and didn’t know what she should do, Lily was very nice, but she wanted to be near Ryvian more. She also didn’t want to break up Ryvian and Lily. They were prefect together; he was just a hand span taller than Lily. When the two were together their eyes shone and almost made them look like they weren’t Gerial. Rylena was growing suspicious of Lily’s heritage. She almost seemed like she was constantly hiding something. Whenever they talked about the history of their race, mainly the Darklings, Rylena was sure she always heard a tone of sadness when she heard of the Darkling’s fall from grace. Rylena thought of all of these things when she thought she heard footsteps coming up the grassy knoll to where she was laying. <br>
<br>
Ryvian was on watch and wanted to get a good spot to watch over the camp. The Galton was currently up against the mountains that he had grown up in. He felt more then safe, and was not afraid of anything coming on the Gerial lands to attack a small Galton. As he spotted a good high place with plenty of the soft grass that grew in the coastal breeze he started his way up the slow easy climb. Just as he reached the top of the hill, Ryvian thought he saw move over the top and around the other side. Without thinking, instincts taking over, he pulled the sword of the griffon from his shoulder and raced after the shape that crested the hill. <br>
<br>
Rylena was just scampering over the hill when the glint of a sword caught her eye. Instantly she was terrified and wished that she had an Avi to protect her from this. Looking around finding that there was no place to run in the flats of the plains, Rylena flashed an image of that sword running her through. Almost in tears Rylena was shaking and the last idea of survival rose to her mind. She had to fight back in order to survive. She was a cleric not a ward or Avi; she was full of doubt. Doubt for everything but her need to do this to save herself. Finally with a tear falling from her small face she charged over the hill.<br>
<br>
Ryvian was ready for whatever it was that he heard coming over the hill. He was already in his stance and swinging when the red hair burst over the top of the hill. He saw in slow motion as Rylena came charging over the hill straight to his sword. He shouted as her beautiful eyes turned large with fright as she saw that it was Ryvian and that he had his sword drawn at her. Ryvian tried to pull back his sword but could not move it enough and Rylena fell right on the blade. Ryvian had already dropped the hilt and caught Rylena in the air, the whole thing had happened so fast that he hadn’t the time to think what he was doing. Rylena was wailing and Ryvian looked back to the camp to find that with the wind that the sound would not reach the camp. He yanked the cloak off his back as he tore it and set it beside Rylena, and started to look closely at the wound. He saw the blade in one side and out her small back. Swearing to himself Ryvian looked down at Rylena’s sweaty brow. “Sweetheart I need to get a closer look at this wound, I will try to do what I can for you.” Rylena tried to smile up at Ryvian. Nodding Ryvian started to cut away the materials of her shirt with his knife that he pulled form his belt. As he cut the rest of the blood soaked material away, Ryvian started to mop up the blood with the strips of his shirt. “It will be alright dear. Does it hurt here?” Ryvian asked as he pointed around the areas close to the wound. Rylena cried out and nodded. He started to point further away from the cut and his hopes sunk when it ended at her waist. “Dear I am going to take out the sword, it might hurt, but it needs to be done, I will do my best to stop the pain after I have done this, I will work as hard as I can.” Ryvian was sweating with the effort of not screaming and running back to camp to get Lily. Rylena’s back arched up as she screamed in pain while Ryvian pulled the blade out. Tears streaming down Rylena’s face, she looked up at Ryvian. His face and eyes with their panicked reassurance kept her from falling out of consciousness. <br>
<br>
The black night without the moon was still as Rylena’s panting breath became all that Ryvian could hear. He had watched her eyes closed more than the first half of the night ago. He held her head in his lap as he stroked her hair listening to her labored breathing. He had bandaged the wound up as much as he could, but knew that if he didn’t do something soon she would pass on. He also knew that if he went to find Lily he would come back to a corpse, and moving her might kill her as well. Ryvian cursed the stars as they looked down lazily at them from the heavens. He looked down at Rylena and remembered the night that he lost his sister. He let his tears fall to the ground as he cried. Then he looked again to the stars; he would not let her die. He had lost one sister, and now that he had finally found someone that could fill her place after all these years he was about to lose her as well. He shouted in his rage and looked back to the wound. He had covered Rylena with the remains of his shirt. He tore it away and pressed his hands on the wound right below right breast. He focused all his energy on the wound. He pulled from the souls that he had collected thus far. He pulled his strength that he saved and tapped even his connection to the moon. He shouted as the power came from above and surged through his back into his hands. Ryvian shouted as the light enveloped him. He wrapped his arms around the girl and felt her body start to squirm under his embrace. He let her go and held her out at arms length to get a better look at her. He pulled the bandages that wrapped her small form and found that the gash was just a small line of pink. He smiled as Rylena touched the place where the wound was and smiled up at Ryvian. “How?” <br>

Ryvian’s shift had just ended as the two walked back into camp. Ryvian had given Rylena the shirt he had worn under the vest and the armor, and kissed her head as he saw her into her tent. On entering his own tent Lily was still asleep and sat straight up when he walked in. Her eyes had a strange hazel color but quickly glazed over as she looked at him. “Well it seems you have had one hell of a night.” Ryvian sighed as he laid his armor on the ground. “You have no idea.” Ryvian slouched in his chair with the bottle of yaltin. “Ryvian I know that you had a run in with Rylena. I am a trained cleric, and I can practically smell her on you.” Lily said as she threw an empty bottle towards him. Ryvian looked to the ground.  “I hold my love for only you, not the sun, not the moon, not anyone or anything.” Ryvian nodded lifting the bottle. “Bottoms up.” Lily stared at him and then to the bottle that Ryvian had just emptied. Lily looked as Ryvian took his sword and threw it on the ground. Lily saw it was covered in blood. “Ryvian? I know what has happened, and I’ve known it was going to happen for some time now.” Lily stood up with understanding on her face. Ryvian was confused at her response and looked for his other bottle of yaltin. Lily stood behind Ryvian in the chair and leaned down resting her head on his shoulder. “Ryvian, I know this is going to be hard to take in right now, but I need to tell you something; well I need to give you something.” Lily went to her bags and shuffled around in them for a moment grumbling. Ryvian watched in silence while she pulled a small parchment. “This is something that your father told me to hold for you until you either needed to see it because you had stumbled onto it yourself, or when I thought that you were ready to take this.” Lily handed him the note and went back to her seat. Ryvian unfolded it reading it to himself. When he had finished; he sat there in silence. Lily was looking at the light from the fire outside their tent when she heard Ryvian speak. “I had a brother. And you knew all the time what I was?” Ryvian looked up with his eyes dazed and frustrated. Lily nodded, “Yes Ryvian I even knew your brother before he left. He was just like you, acted just like you, and even looked like you. Ryvian I’m sorry I never told you, but there are some secrets that are not supposed to be told.” Ryvian watched her eyes as they changed again to a hazel and back to red. Almost as fast as she could blink Ryvian had his sword out and tipped right at her face. She stared at it off the tip of her nose as Ryvian’s face twisted in a growl. “You are not the girl I once knew! What kind of demon has taken that beautiful girl and given me this in return!” Ryvian snarled as his fist turned white at the hilt. Lily looked at the sword and back to Ryvian’s eyes. She nodded, “I am the same Ryvian, but you must ask yourself, do you remember me the way I am or the way you thought I was?” Ryvian grabbed the hilt with his other hand as he moved it back to swing. Lily felt tears fall from her chin as she looked at him. At the back of the arc Ryvian stopped, “Tell me the truth and not twisted words with cunning puzzles.” Lily nodded once more and started to take off the blouse that she was wearing. <br>
<br>
Ryvian watched with his face set and sword arm ready to take off what looked like Lily’s head clean off. He snarled as she started chanting in the Darkling tongue. He had studied it in his free time at school. He didn’t understand the words, but knew the language. She chanted and chanted and then was surrounded by a soft glow. He stepped back a step wondering if he was making a large mistake and if the yaltin had fogged his mind. He felt that if he were wrong then Lily would kill him with her power, which she was building. He moved back further when she started to growl with effort. Then with a flash of light he shielded his eyes from the sight. Looking back he didn’t see Lily as he had expected to, she stood with the same long red hair and the same face and body, but different eyes and now with the addition of the wings of a Darkling! She stood with her arms out in front of the white feathery wings. Ryvian almost couldn’t believe he was standing there; he had to fight the urge to slap himself to see if this was a dream. This made the fact that he was the third child of an Avi bloodline born with the power of cleric and Avi. Power that would eventually tear his mind apart, seem like nothing. He was shocked and horrified and yet thrilled all at the same time. He looked at Lily’s hazel eyes and the wings. He hadn’t realized that he was on his knees and had dropped his sword. “Ryvian, my father was a Darkling, I never knew that until my mother told me at her death. I have learned to hide it though, my mother had a way to hide it and was constantly drained by the power of keeping the disguise up and now that she had died I have to hold it myself. This is what I am, but I want you to know one thing, I have learned much about both my histories and learned that even though all the Darklings fell, they were not all evil. I was born of the last Skyfire male Magjic, their king, and was given the great responsibility to find the scythe of the Skyfire gods, forged by the Drul in the days of light, to take the seat of power and eliminate the bad from the good in the Darkling race to let our true name be known once again” Lily pulled a light purple dress from her bags and threw it over her shoulders as her wings shimmered and then disappeared behind the veil of magic once more. Ryvian was stunned and all her could do was stand, turn, and walk back to his seat to sit down to think about what he had just heard. This was indeed going to be a hard trip for them all.<br>

He remembered the last night with the hangover from the yaltin. Staggering up to a standing position, Ryvian saw that the Galton had not yet risen and the fire was nothing but smoldering ash. Sore from his night on the ground Ryvian started to wake the camp. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rylena rose from the cot that she had slept in. She looked out the door to see Ryvian starting up the Galton for the day’s work. He turned to her, but instead of turning away this time Rylena smiled back at him. He looked tired and distanced from the activity that was going on around him; he did what was needed but nothing more nothing of his usual splendid morning canter. She noted to herself that Ryvian seemed different when Lily moved out of her tent, but still kissed her on the top of her head as he held her close to him whispering something into her ear. Rylena couldn’t hear what was said but saw Lily relax and return the kiss. This was becoming a strange morning, she thought. She quickly dressed herself and ran out to get whatever food was being cooked for the morning meal. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With Ryvian’s accepting her lineage, Lily was more than happy, she was wonderfully lightheaded as the Galton ate their morning meal. The group was getting to know each other better and the grumbling of the few that Alec had rousted were growing less frequent. The time seemed to pass as they mounted their horses and started to move towards the pass. The Galton should reach the pass by midday, and Ryvian would have time to start to learn his special gift, less he destroy his mind with the pressure. Lily would see personally to his training. At this thought a smile came across her face and she looked at Ryvian while he rode just ahead of her talking with Talidon. He was listening like a puppy with eager anticipation for the next lesson. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ryvian, when you release a soul from your mind does it hurt?” Talidon asked looking at the clouds letting his horse follow Ryvian’s. “Yes and no. When you let one part your mind feels the loss and pain of it comes to you, but the pain as a pain from a cut or a gash is different. It feels more like you’ve lost something that you know you can never replace.” Ryvian said gazing into the mountains. He knew all to well the feeling of loss and regret from his childhood days. The day was already reaching the middle as the Galton rode up to the sheer wall of the mountains. The rock seemed to stretch all the way to the heavens. In the rock face was a door carved during the days of the wars of light. Ryvian had seen these doors before but never what lie on the other side. He knew of the famous keep on the end of the valley that waits behind these doors. Ryvian felt the hair on the back of his neck start to rise when the knowledge of the evils that waited in the valley flooded his mind. He lifted his swords in the scabbards to make sure they were clear. “Lets ride.” He shouted back to the Galton when the doors opened to the trotting horses. Valin had sealed these doors many years after the war to keep out all of the evil that wait in the valley and only an Avi had the special powers to open these doors. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The day was growing humid as the sun beat down on the moving Galton without mercy. Ryvian had made sure that there was enough water to sustain the horses and the others. With many breaks to drink and rest Ryvian was feeling quite sure that they had made it clear any dangers that would harm them when he heard the roar of the Bellitors and the Griffons as the crazed beasts plummeted down on them. The Galton formed the circle with spears loosed and lifted to protect Lily and Rylena as the Gerials surrounded them. Ryvian looked to Talidon and was surprised to see such control of emotions. Smiling he pulled the lance loose from the ring in the stirrup and looked to the sky. He had fought with a griffon once but never with bellitors. The creatures were fierce looking with long wings of golden feathers and a wickedly curved beak. Talidon’s cleric was franticly running around trying to find a safe place to hide as Ryvian studied the moves of the wings and the force of the flight through the air. Ryvian loosed his lance up towards the sky and watched the reactions of the bellitors. He had read once about how the creatures had powerful arms and could catch the spears and lances thrown at them. Almost believing they would catch his lance Ryvian was looking for his extra short sword. The lance flew and caught the first bellitor in the chest knocking him clear from the sky. Riding to the place it fell Ryvian jumped from his horse and landed on the beast pulling his lance from the dead body. He watched the sky as one ward tested his throwing arm and lose his spear to one of the flying creatures. Quickly Ryvian jumped on top of his horse and rode hard back to the circle. Lily had taken Rylena aside and was showing her the way of healing a Galton without bonding accidentally to one of them while the Gerials were standing with the horses in front of them as shields. Ryvian was just reaching Talidon before he threw his spear. “STOP! Don’t throw your spears yet!” he shouted as he saw the heads turn. Talidon’s tail was waving around with energy as the adrenaline ran through his veins. “Use the topes from your tents to tie on to the end of your spears so that if they catch them you can drag them to the ground!” Ryvian shouted to the Galton. Quickly the Gerials rushed to the saddles and tied off the ends of the spears. The griffons were flying in but they tended to land so they could fight with their claws and beaks in close combat. Talidon had stuck his spear in the ground and pulled his sword turning back to look at Ryvian do the same. The two would have to take out the griffons while the Galton would take care of the bellitors. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Talidon had never been in a battle before, not even in a fight that ended in blood of any sort. He was almost overwhelmed with the idea of killing something, but the thought of protecting his cleric, his Rachel, brought a sense of duty to his mind and made him ready for this. He followed closely behind Ryvian with his sword ready. Ryvian charged right into the large beast griffons and slashed without any mercy and without any time for thought or choice. The mind was made up when the two charged into the fray not in the middle. Both Gerials fought with an efficiency born of the Avi kind; Talidon was nearly giddy and becoming very confident when a three of the large monsters rammed him knocking the blade from his hands. With a shout he pulled his boot knife and tried to defend his throat from the talons of the griffons. He kicked and slashed, but was knocked around like he was a small child instead of an Avi. He threw the knife into one of the griffon’s eyes and kicked, but it was not enough to keep the third from ripping a gash in his middle and tearing at his arms with an effort to reach the neck. He was about to give up and let his mind wander to the other side when he felt a wave of blood rush over him. Thinking it was his Talidon relaxed and waited the dark gates to appear, but instead he saw Ryvian’s face through the red sheen of his vision and a hand reach out to his. Taking it, Talidon stood up as much as he could and looked back to the Galton, the troops had pulled out large shields and had covered the women as the bellitors dropped rocks on the small group. Then with a shout the shields were pulled back and the spears were launched into the fleet of creatures. Many fell to the sharp points, but a few caught the spears and tried to fly off. With a tug from the ward and a quick knot to the saddle horn of the horse the bellitors were pulled to the ground and landed with a sickening crunch as the winds and skull crashed to the rocky bottom of the valley. The flying creatures were making for another pass when lightning from the sun it seemed laced out and cut down many of the bellitors from the sky. Lily stood with her arms spread wide, her light red hair being tossed in the wind with the lightly shaded purple dress she wore tugging at her body.<br>
<br>
 The shields went back up and the remaining creatures flew off towards the crags higher in the valley wall. The griffons quickly took off to follow. Talidon looked and saw many more dead griffons than he could remember killing, he had only taken a few before he was knocked over, Ryvian must have killed the rest he though. Stumbling and leaning heavily on Ryvian’s arm Talidon made it back to the rest and Rachel rushed to his side placing her healing hands to his side and arms. Talidon felt the power surge through him and the wounds close. In the back of his mind he felt the feeling of someone else watching him. Surprised he tried to find where the feeling came from. He searched and cried out to the ones watching him from inside his mind. Then they spoke to him. The words were slow and broken but he could understand them; they told him he had fought well and they were proud to have been taken down by a warrior and not a poacher. Realization came to him when they spoke to him; they were the fallen griffons. He had his first souls; he was finally a true Avi. This was his first day as a proud Gerial and Avi. Smiling to himself he looked over to Ryvian as he held Lily in his arms letting her tend to a gash in his scalp. The attack had come quickly and he hadn’t had time to dawn his helm. The gash was very large and the blood ran down his face. After lily healed him she kissed him and he held her closer. Talidon kissed his own cleric and looked to Rylena, she was looking out into the sky with a look of longing on her young, pretty face. Talidon looked over to the Galton as they slowly went about checking each horse. They still had a long ride to the keep, but now they seemed more on edge and ready for another attack or ambush. Neither came and the day ran out with the Galton just arriving at the keep. They would have warm beds and a safe place to sleep for one more night.  <br>

The night was a restless one for Rylena as she roamed the Keep. She was enjoying herself as she walked from room to room gazing at the giant paintings that adorned the walls. They were pictures of the Great War of light and of the heroes from the time of war. The keep was being lighted by some sort of light orbs that floated above pillars of granite. As the moon rose to the top of the sky Rylena started to grow even more restless half running through the keep looking for something to calm her spirits. Following the winding hallways and endless rooms she finally came to a place that held the sword of Valin. It was in a case that seemed to float on the air and illuminate from the inside. She was amazed at the beauty of it and stunned to see someone else standing beside it admiring the ancient blade. She was about to introduce herself when she saw him pull a small dagger of glowing red and start to pry open the case. Without thinking she rushed over to him, “Just what do you think you’re doing?” almost right after speaking she regretted it. The Gerial turned to her dagger pointed towards her neck. Rylena saw a long scar that ran down his right eye cutting the handsome face in two. She stared at him and his long gray hair as the blade came closer to her throat. He broke her trance when he spoke in a voice that did not seem to fit his image; it was soft with a kindness to it that made her go weak at the knees. He was handsome and rugged at the same time that gave him a mysterious mist around him. “What are you doing up so late? Aren’t you supposed to be in bed with your Avi little cleric?” Taking the dagger away from her neck he stepped back and look up and down her. Feeling her ears growing red she lowered her head and looked at his feet, “I do not have an Avi, I have yet to meet one that has not been taken already.” The Gerial smiled and reached for her hand. “Well, I am called Dean the Quick by my friends, but you can call me Wade. That would be my given name and the one my family and very old friends call me. And I do not have a cleric, anymore.” He said kissing her hand. Rylena was feeling lightheaded and watched him return the dagger that he had pulled. “I would not have taken the blade, I just wanted to feel the weight in my hands.” Rylena smiled and let him hook her arm and lead them away. The feeling of unrest in her had finally left and she felt at ease. Walking back towards the rooms for the Galton and warriors, Rylena asked Wade what he meant when he said he did not have a cleric anymore. He simply pointed to the scar running along his brow that was previously covered by his wavy hair, and the one across his eye. “She was taken from me a very long time ago.” That was all he would say. <br>
<br>
Reaching her room she smiled at him again and his kissed her hand once more and bowed slightly. “Are you leaving in the morning?” He asked her as he slowly moved closer towards her. “Yes. My Galton is going to the human city of Ibium.” She whispered as she felt her back hit the door. “Sounds dangerous, humans. I have known a few in my day; they are not a very open people nor are they kind.” He whispered in her ear as his hands moved to Rylena’s small waist. She felt his breath on her neck as she closed her eyes. He softly kissed the base of her neck and shoulder. She leaned forward, but he pulled back. “I will see you in the morning. I will be waiting outside your door when the sun shines through the window. I feel it is my duty to protect you and keep you safe from the evils of men.” She nodded her head, feeling dizzy, she let him pull her close to him once again and let out a small moan as he kissed her softly at first, growing more passionately on her lips. She felt like something was being torn away from her when he broke the kiss. She opened her eyes to find that he was gone. Almost sad and giddy at the same time, Rylena rushed into her room for the night.<br>
<br>
“Lord, I understand that our fighters are being drawn up from the far corners of the sealed lands. We will soon have to plan a way to take the wall down.” Voltik said to the handsome man sitting on the chair carved from stone for the Lord of the Darklings. The head nodded and waved a hand for his highest general to enter. Voltik shuddered as the Darkling walked into the room like he owned the world. He was an arrogant warrior and devious General. “Master Mala Havoc, I’d like you to meet Voltik, the General that took Zefi so many years ago.” Nodding and shaking hands the two walked over to a map that was placed on the table in front of the throne. “As you both know, the paladins are making themselves open once more, claiming to have a Magjic that is rightfully king. But they cannot be allowed to give the mass this knowledge. I want you to seek out this Magjic Voltik and kill them. I will not be overrun by my own people!” The deep voice shook with a rage that was clear. The Darkling was always in a shadow and never could anyone get a clear look at him. From the depths of his shadow, a hand rose and pointed to the map. “Mala Havoc, I want you to go to the docks that cover the bay and start to train the army. You are the only one that can teach them the old ways and how to regenerate their lost wings. Go there and as soon as the troops are formed I want you to tear down the wall that has kept us secluded to this swamp for the last ten thousand years!” Mala Havoc moved his fist over his heart and bowed. “Consider it done Lord.” With another wave the two bowed again and turned to go see to their duties. <br>

Rylena stretched in the large bed yawning and looking out the window at the grand expanse of plains that seemed to go on forever. Smiling at the new day she quickly jumped out of bed and dressed for the day. She had all of her things packed when she remembered Wade promised to be at her door when the sun rose. She opened the door in a hurry and looked outside expecting to see the tall Gerial standing there waiting for her. Instead she saw the wall on the other side of her room. She let out a sigh of disappointment and started to close the door. “I’ve been outside for most of the morning and you just now remembered me?” Rylena’s eyes jerked back up to see Wade walking into her view. She smiled at him and he bowed slightly. “Good morning Rylena, you’re looking as beautiful as the sun today.” Wade grinned and looked down the hall where Ryvian was talking to Talidon about picking up an extra sword. Rylena blushed and waved him into her room. After Wade had entered she looked down the hall and closed the door. Wade had started to look around the room and the bag of Rylena’s things. “You are a Aviless cleric with no sword?” Shaking his head, Wade pulled a short sword from the belt of dangerous knives and blades. He placed it with its scabbard on the bed next to the bag. “Carry this everywhere you go. You will never know when you might just need such a thing.” With a sigh he lifted the bag off the bed with the sword and flung it over his shoulder. “Shall we be going?” He asked while looking over the room once more. She nodded and started to open the door. Before she could get it open a hand pushed it back closed. Surprised she turned and found Wade gazing into her eyes. She felt a shudder go through her of excitement. Wade was standing so close the two were touching, “First tell Ryvian that I am going with you, but do not call me Wade, call me Dean the Quick. He will understand and it will make my life easier.” She nodded and he kissed her again, like the kiss last night it left her weak and dizzy. She felt his arms go around her middle and pull her closer; she wrapped her arms around him as well. Then Wade picked up the bag again and let her open the door. <br>
<br>
Ryvian was busy talking to Lily about the use of magic and how it was powered when Rylena pushed her way between them. “Ryvian, I need to talk to you.” She said grabbing his arm and pulling him away from Lily. Confused and almost angry Lily turned back to the Galton to talk to them about the formation for protection and that they must also keep the new cleric Rachel inside the circle as well as keep things from getting to her. She walked over to Talidon and started to talk to him as well about combat tactics. She was trying to let him know that he shouldn’t always follow in his teacher’s steps because Ryvian had a power that Talidon was not born with, something that a Warlord was given; she made that up of course, but was trying not to frighten the young Avi.<br>
<br>
“Ryvian, I needed to tell you something.” Ryvian turned back to the Galton as they impatiently waited on their horses. “Yes Rylena?”  Ryvian looked around and thought he saw someone wandering around the troop. He figured that it was just another Avi that was waiting at the Keep for his Galton to arrive. “I meet someone last night. He, well he is an Avi and one without a cleric.” Ryvian looked back to her with a grin on his face. “Ah! Well if our little girl hasn’t got charm.” He said grinning. Rylena blushed a little, “Well I wanted to know if he could come with us; Talidon got to bring his cleric. So I was just wondering, his name is Dean the Quick.” Instantly the grin from Ryvian’s face was gone. “What did you just say?” Rylena was shocked at his reaction. “Dean the Quick.” She repeated. Ryvian looked back to the Gerial walking around. His mind traveled back to the time of his childhood.<br>
<br>
“So this is the job of the crew. I have seven Avi and their Galtons on this ship. My boat is more of a transport than a fighter.” Destri said as he pointed to the large underbelly of the ship at the towline. “See, it goes far below the surface of the water so that it can carry more Gerials for transport to outposts like the one in the Darkling territory.” Ryvian looked at the giant boat and saw the many wards and deck hands running about like an anthill that had just been kicked. The Avi all started to come down off the boat to the dock and line up in front of Destri. “Well son these are the Avi that are going to the outpost Zefi. There’s Fredrick of the Surf, Dean the Quick, Robert of Mekings. All of these young lads will be heading to make sure that the Darklings never get past the might Gerials.” Ryvian was glad that his father had let him follow along with him to the docks to oversee the loading of the boat. “Dad, I need to get back to town!” he shouted as the sun caught his eye. He was supposed to be back in town so he could take Lily to the beach and show her how to fish with a lance at midday, but it was long past midday. “Going to see your lady friend right? Tell her since her mother is going to Mekings for the next few days she can stay at our house. I wouldn’t want her to slow down her mother’s important duty in the city now.” Ryvian nodded and ran off back towards town.<br>
<br>
Ryvian then remembered hearing how there was a rogue in the outpost that lead to the fall of Zefi from Mettrich. Looking back to Rylena he half smiled and walked off to meet with this Dean the Quick. “Sir, I’m Ryvian the Surefooted son of Destri the Warlord of Delnor that ferried you to Zefi all those years ago.” Ryvian watched intently on the face as it turned to face him. It was the face of a battle hardened Avi, holding the signs of experience and sporting two scars to prove it, one ran directly down his right eye, the other just above the brow. The Avi bowed and Ryvian took in the armor he wore. It was not the Avi armor, instead of the green metal; this Avi Dean wore leather that seemed to be thick enough to deflect a blade, but still light. The Gerial nodded with a slight bow. “I understand that you will be coming with us as Rylena’s Avi. Well if that is true, then I welcome you to our troop, but let me get one thing straight.” He said leaning in close, “That girl is in your protection, and if anything happens to her I will personally see you fall on my sword. Do we understand each other?” With a nod Dean grinned, “Just like your father, and your brother. I will keep my eyes open, but you be damn sure to keep yours open as well. After losing one cleric,” he said pointing to the scars on his face, “I will be more careful. I hear we’re going to Ibium. You watch that pretty young lass of yours. The humans are more than just devious, they are cunning and also they are gutless backstabbing son of whores the lot of em all. So you watch your back as well as those of your Galton and family.” Ryvian was shocked and stepped back. This Dean seemed like a worthy Avi to have ride with him, even if he was not very trustable. Ryvian left Rylena and Dean to themselves as they saddled up so he could go and mount his own horse. They had an objective to attend to.<br>

They had entered the plains of the Hunt. Long ago after the battle of light, the peoples of the world were thrown into the dark of chaos. The humans had decided that the finest coats of fur were made from the hides of the Clerg, a race a large cats with two paws of a cat and two hands of a man. They were hunted for their pelts and for many years the plains were open ground for the humans to kill freely. These plains had been secluded from use by the grand council that was formed to protect those of less strength from those with the most. After that the Clerg were very protective of their lands, the only race allowed through were the Drul. The Drul city was on the edge of the plains on a cliff that bordered the sea. The Galton would have to stop at the city Lib before moving on to the wall. Ryvian had planned a swift move from the wall to the city. They would have warm beds and a roof over their heads for most of the journey. With the good weather and the pace, the Galton should get to Lib in about two days, estimated Ryvian. He had a deadline to meet and a city to secure. Glancing back over the wards, Ryvian noticed that they had grown more together, and were becoming more of a team everyday. The battle had forged them together and now they were determined. Smiling Ryvian caught the eyes of Dean. His smile was gone. He remembered the face, the voice. There was something about the whole thing that made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Thinking he was just being overprotective; he pushed the thought of Dean from his mind. But the feeling of anxiety would not leave maybe it was something else. <br>
<br>
“General Sir! I have no idea where we are!” shouted a cleric to a commanding officer of the Ibium defense unit. They had been out in the wilderness for more than three weeks and had lost their way through all the forest. The cleric had found the small group moving quickly, after the destruction of the outpost Zefi. She felt alone in the fact that she was the only female in the unit and the only Gerial left from Ibium. “Sir! I repeat, I do not know where we are!” The General looked back with a small grin. The forest cleared up ahead and there seemed to be some huts. “We’ve made it! Now men grab her! She is finally yours to do with as you please!” Emily did not understand what was happening as the humans grabbed her ripping the dress from her body and hoisting her up on their shoulders. She screamed and kicked but the men were taller than the Gerials and had longer arms. They held her up higher so that she could not inflict maximum damage. They carried her to a tent where Darklings poured out. “NO! Traitors! I should have known better than to trust human scum!” the men dropped her and she fell face down in the dirt. Not shy about her nudeness she stood up to face the Darkling in front of her. “Die Bastard!” she spat as she raised her hands. The smirk on the Darkling’s face made her a bit unsure, but she continued on with her spell. The sky darkened and fire rose from her fingertips. The humans around took steps back and gazed with swords drawn at the sheen of sweat that had formed on her tan skin. The effort of the power was almost at the peak and the air felt thick and heavy. She screamed as the fire built into a smaller compact ball. Almost about to release it almost about to gain the full power, the Darkling laughed and spread his wings. Emily focused the power and was about to fling it at the Darkling that moved closer to her with every forced breath, when she fell like a wall she had been pushing on had just given way, right into the open arms of the Darkling. “Come my sweet. I shall show you the pleasure of my tent.” He said as tears ran down Emily’s face. He licked them off her cheeks and started to lift her up by the bas of her knees. He picked her up and seemingly in a trance Emily wrapped her legs around his waist as he moved back into the tent. Outside the air grew back to normal and the men started to set up tents among the Darklings.<br>
<br>
Inside the tent Emily felt completely exhausted, yet unable to sleep. She relaxed and let the hands touching her move her body in anyway that they wanted. Mala Havoc set her down on the bed and spread her legs wide. He grinned at the lightly tanned skin and the delicately pointed ears. He leaned down and kissed one. “Darling, you will soon feel the delight of a Darkling.” He whispered in her ear as he licked the inside. Emily shuddered and seemed to come back to herself slowly. She felt the hands moving over her breasts and tummy. She moaned and was drooling with her pleasure when pain tore through her body. She couldn’t breath and couldn’t scream out. After what seemed like an eternity of the searing pain air was allowed back into her lungs and she could only cry with the air she gulped. Her senses had come back to her and she felt a body next to her. Turning her head she saw the Darkling eyes closed with an arm over her. With a quick glance outside she realized she must have passed out and the time had gone from midday to midnight. Trying to move she felt the pain rip through her lower body and had to bite her tongue not to scream. She rolled out of the bed landing on a floor covered in furs and maps. She stifled her shouts and went about her work. The moon was out and radiating through the tent flap that was left open for air. She felt for her magic and slowly started to heal herself. After her work had come to a finish she looked around for her clothes. Finding nothing but an oversized coat she slipped into it and hurried out the tent and for the trees before anyone would know she had gone. Running into a human she gave a quick spin of her magic and collapsed the sentry disappearing into the darkness. She had to just make it to the wall and she would be fine, everything would be fine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crawling in the swampy moss and still water, Emily had long given up her cloak for the ability to blend into the surroundings better. It seemed every breath she took was stilled quickly as a group of Darklings would trudge past her. When she could see the sky she looked to the stars seeing the moon. Falling into a deep puddle of muck water she pulled herself up onto the shore. Gazing up at the sky and moon she wished of all the people in the world that her brother would come and save her. She knew that it was just childish feelings, she had seen him killed at the fort and knew he would not come back. Tears fell from her eyes as the memory of the Darklings dropping him onto the roof of the compound she was in resurfaced. She closed her eyes and tried to think of a time when they were little living in a small town. They were in the province of Delnor, and were very poor. Her father was a ship captain in the city and helped patrol the coasts. Back then she was too young to remember well the memory of her parents. They died in an accident fire that broke out to the north of their home moving with the wind engulfing their home. She was sinking in the mud as well as her horrible memories when the voice seemed to come from above like the voice of a god. “Lass! What in the name of Drelphia do ya think yer doin’!” a gruff voice asked. Snapping out of her thoughts she looked up to see that the wall she had been searching for was right behind her and covered in thick moss. She had thought there would be a plain that would lead to it, at least that is what she remembered, maybe she was further west than she thought. With a wave she remembered that the she had not had water or food for nearly four days. She tried to stand up but failed and instead blacked out on the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sunrays broke through the tent and Rylena woke up with a yawn. She felt like staying in bed and sleeping for another day. That night she had barely gotten any sleep and was tired from her activities. Wade on the other hand was up and ready to go. “Sweet pea, it is time to wake up; we have a full day ahead of us.” Wade smiled when she threw a pillow at him. Ryvian ducked his head in to get a face full of pillow. “Reminds me of a few days ago when I graduated and Lily and I spent our first night together.” Grinning Wade started out the door of the tent behind Ryvian. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily was sleeping fitfully when she woke, sitting up. “Sorry to disturb yer sleep lass, was just tendin to yer wounds.” The stranger said. Emily looked at her surroundings and found she was still without clothes. The Gerial like creature sat next to her on the bed with a bowl of water and a towel cleaning the cuts and scratches she had gotten from her crawl here. She also found herself clean from all mud and muck with her hair cleaned. Slightly smiling she remembered that she was naked and blushed. She noticed the creature that was tending to her had the same ears of a Gerial and the same build, but his hair was light pale like sand and his eyes were pale blue. This could not be a Gerial. Surprised and slightly embarrassed Emily just laid back and closed her eyes again, she could think of worse places, and even worse company. At least here this place was warm and the fellow had a kind smile and a gentle hand. Soon she felt his tending to her wounds stop and he started to massage her shoulders and arms. Feeling absolutely blissful she fell back to a sound sleep.<br>

There seemed to be water over the hills but as soon as they came close the water disappeared. This confused Ryvian and Talidon asked if they had crossed over into the spirit world. Still they traveled on and towards the city of Lib. The day was full of dust and heat. Ryvian was feeling very good about bringing the extra water supply with them. The Galton cheered as soon as the sun went down and Ryvian heard a sigh from Dean. The troop moved towards the sea. They camped over a dune that signaled where the tide would stop. The night air-cooled everyone down and the breeze from the ocean brought some comfort. Yet Ryvian still felt restless and wandered out of the camp past the sentry towards the ocean to sit and think. He was watching the moon and felt the feeling of anxiety return. He was not sure what was happening inside of him, only that he had started to scratch the surface of his full ability. After one or two lessons with Lily he had started to sort of feel things before they happened. He couldn’t explain it very well. Now he felt that something was going to happen and the sense of waiting for it to happen. He was deep in thought when a light caught his eye. There seemed to be light coming from the ocean and moving slowly onto the beach. Ryvian was curious and pulled the griffon sword so he could gain a closer look. Peering into the distance he saw what looked like at least a hundred people that resembled Gerials, moving out of the water. They were armed for battle and they were moving towards land. As he followed them he saw their destination, his camp. The Galton had already spotted them closing in and roused the camp. The camp was set up for attack; tents in a circle closely set together, fire in the middle and the wards tents outside the cleric and Avi tents. The wards were forming a semi circle around the tents first line swords second line spears and lances. Talidon was positioned in front of them standing beside Dean, with the clerics behind the wards next to the fire. Ryvian was in a full sprint charging towards the on coming battle. These people must have come out of the ocean he thought. He had remembered hearing about a race that had moved to the seas during the war of light. They were called the Teniols. Supposedly they were great fighters and could live under water. Ryvian was trying to remember their tactics and just as his memory kicked in he saw the second and third fork of the offense come out of the sand dunes behind him and further beyond the camp. Ryvian pulled his sword and readied himself for the battle. He would have to do this without Lily. <br>
<br>
With a shout the Teniols were on them. Lily had studied them at school and remembered their strategy, a forked attack, three prongs the first and largest then flanked by two smaller offenses. Terrified that they would be out numbered and surrounded, she started her summoning. The moon was waning this late in the year and power was fading, Lily hoped she had enough to force them to attack straight on. She felt pain in her right arm and remembered she had been looking for Ryvian; she was turning her thoughts on this when the power enveloped her forcing its way out. Shouting, Lily raised her hands to the sky and saw the ground to either side of the camp in a v give way and fall creating a large trench on either side. This would force the Teniols to attack straight on, maybe it would give them a chance. <br>
<br>
Ryvian shouted as another spear tore into his shoulder. Rolling on the ground to dodge any more spears, Ryvian felt his power fade, he hadn’t even started to fight yet. The main fork broke off and headed to the camp leaving about ten Teniol warriors to finish the job. Big mistake thought Ryvian as he drew his other sword. The Teniols pulled their long curved blades and started to advance. Ryvian felt a power grow inside him as he started in. Battle! The heat of the night and the attacks were fueling Ryvian to act. Swinging he blocked and started on his killing path, nothing would stop him, only blood would fill his need.<br>
<br>
Talidon screamed as a blade forced its way between his armor. He must fight to lead the Galton, Ryvian was gone and Dean had moved ahead of him. Fighting for air to fill his burning lungs Talidon focused on the power of the Avi, he handed over the reins to a Teniol he had killed and relaxed his mind to rest. Watching as if outside his body, Talidon fought and defended himself better than he could if he were controlling it. Almost giddy with the new insight Talidon began to shift through the mind of the other Teniols he had killed. Interesting, he thought as the history of the race unraveled before his eyes. <br>
<br>
Rylena tried to open the door to her power as Wade slumped in her arms. He had been moving in and out of the Galton’s ranks when a stray spear had caught him in the chest. Lily was standing next to him trying to coach Rylena through this ritual of her first healing with the Avi that she would spend the rest of her life with. She struggled to open the door and was growing frantic when Wade started to relax his grip on her hand. “No! Stay with me!” she cried as she slammed her mind against the closed door holding her magic. Screaming she tried again and again until she opened it slightly. The wave of power rushed out, but the door would not open the rest of the way, just a crack. She screamed as the power was tearing through her. Trying to focus it onto the wound her right hand lay over she gritted her teeth and slammed into and through the doorway. The power was blinding and overwhelming. She screamed in pain as the force rushed through her hands, fingertips and finally into the wound. <br>
<br>
Light burst from her hands and Lily smiled proudly as her student had bonded herself to this Avi. With tears of joy Rylena pulled Dean’s head next to hers and kissed him. “Don’t ever think of doing that again!” she cried. As soon as he nodded he lifted himself up and held the cleric close. Lily turned her attention to the battle, the wards were taking a beating and could only hold the shields up while the few that could rested only to throw themselves back into the fray. This was bad, Lily thought to herself. Where was Ryvian when she needed him?<br>
<br>
Staggering back into the camp Ryvian held his right shoulder as blood gushed out between his fingertips. He had done what he could do to fix it himself, but felt he only complicated the matter. He fell next to the fire and saw blood all over the wards lying next to him. “Sir, we can’t hold like this forever, these bastards are tearing us to pieces.” Shouted a ward that had a gash in his chest. They all wait for the clerics to get to them patiently holding on to what they had left. Ryvian looked up when a hand touched his shoulder and the pain numbed and left. Expecting Lily he looked up to find Rylena smiling down at him. He smiled back, but couldn’t hold it as the pain from the other gashes in his back flared. Rylena saw the blood from the shirt that he was wearing and shouted for Lily to hurry over. <br>
<br>
With a shock, Lily covered her mouth at the long gashes in the back of the Gerial she loved. “Ryvian! Don’t move I’ll fix it.” She cut the rest of the shirt away and placed her hands on the cuts. They quickly stopped bleeding and started to close. Lily pulled him around and hugged him. Ryvian mused with her hair as he started to stand. “Darling that was close, remind me never to leave you again.” He grinned as Lily smacked him on the shoulder, “I’ll never let you out of my sight again that’s for sure.” <br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Standing up, Ryvian saw the sun had already started to rise. Looking out over field of dead bodies of the Teniols, Ryvian felt a tinge of pity strike him. He started to look for the remains of the force, but they had already dissipated back to the sea. The Galton had not lost a single Gerial. Proudly Ryvian started his rounds among the wards telling them what a good job they had done and to sit by the fire to rest. Ryvian was just pulling on his armor next to the fire when he heard snarling and bitter curses coming from behind a tent. Curious he started to move to get a look at what the noise was about. Turning the corner of the tent he was shocked to find a Teniol girl tied to the post. She could not have been more than Rylena’s age. What could she have been doing out here, he thought. Looking at her clothes, she was dressed in armor and armed to the teeth by all the scabbards that lay empty at her thin waist. Searching the minds of those he had killed in the battle, Ryvian found one that recognized her. She was the little sister of one of the commanders, and the last living heir to the throne of the Teniol kingdom. Confused as to why they were out here, attack him, Ryvian searched deeper. Watching the events of the briefing Ryvian gasped and dropped the link to the commander’s mind. This had been a mistake! The entire operation had been a mistake, the Teniols were out on a training mission meant to be four leagues away from here, but carried by the current. They hadn’t even known they were in the wrong spot! Ryvian felt guilty and turned back to his tent. This had been a night of blood and death for no reason and he felt guilty for it all.<br>

Ryvian stormed out of his tent grumbling and swearing until he reached the location of the screams. “What the hell is going on in there!” he shouted into the ward’s tent. A head poked out of the tent door and looked around. Finding Ryvian fuming at the entrance, Alec stumbled out. Ryvian tried to peer inside the tent to see what was going on. “Sir, it was nothing, didn’t mean to wake the camp.” Ryvian nodded and stepped by Alec into his tent. <br>
<br>
Tied down and blindfolded, Marian could do nothing but cry out and kick at air. She was the daughter of a King and this is how these people were treating her! She was outraged, but even more, confused. The patrol was supposed to be at a training mission last night, but instead they had stumbled across this little group of what seemed like Gerials on the beach. She thought they were Gerial because of their eye color, but they did not act like any of the Gerials she had ever met before. All the ambassadors she had talked with were kind and gentle people. These Gerials acted like the Karz barbaric and rude. The Gerial’s tent she was in had grabbed her out of her sleep in the middle of the night and dragged her into his tent. She kicked and screamed, but it didn’t seem to matter to him. She heard someone enter, not the one before. She had grown used to the breathing of the other one. She tried to keep the face of a warrior, like her brother had taught her. She bared her teeth and snapped at the intruder. Hearing him stop and stay still not moving for some time her thoughts began to wander. Her platoon had been formed to be the last prong and show their flanking ability. She had met a Gerial that her brother had nursed back to health that was with her. Marian wondered if she was still alive. Emily, that was her name, Emily. She was nice and perfectly enjoyable, unlike these monsters. Thinking she was probably dead the blindfold was pulled back from her eyes. She could see. She also felt the binds on her hands and ankles loosen and break. This was a stupid Gerial if any. After the way they treated her patrol, she was now being cut loose. <br>
<br>
Ryvian, knife still in hands, offered his hand to the Teniol. “What is your name?” he asked as she looked up at him. “If I tell you, it will be the last name you hear pig!” she spat at him. Stepping back some Ryvian turned back to Alec. “Then let’s have it, I hope it is worth my life.” Ryvian said sarcastically. “Marian.” She snarled at him. Leaping off the ground she smacked Ryvian in the side of the head with a rock that had been on the ground next to her. Growling with pain Ryvian stood back up and deflected the rock that was thrown at him with his arm. Blood ran down the side of his head. Running his hand through his hair he felt the blood, pulling his hand back he saw the wound was much worse than he had thought, blood covered his entire hand. Starting to feel dizzy, Ryvian felt the power start to fill his hands. This was a feeling he was growing more and more comfortable with. Returning his hands to his head he clinched his jaw shut and his eyes closed as his scalp started to mend itself. When he was done his eyes opened and he was mad. He looked back to Alec and then back to Marian. “Do you know who I am?” he said calmly giving the room a creepy air to it. “I am an Avi! I am Ryvian the Surefooted! Warlord of Delnor! I am the one that killed your brother! And if you kill me you kill him too! Well what is left of him.” He snarled. <br>
<br>
Marian cried out and sank to her knees. “So its true, you did kill him.” Sobbing she looked up to find Ryvian’s unforgiving eyes glaring back at her. “Did you kill Emily too?” She looked to the other Gerial; he must be a ward. He did not seem that bad compared to Ryvian. The Avi even healed himself, which was impossible! Looking back to Ryvian, Marian was surprised to find what looked like compassion in his strangely green eyes. I will let you live, if you promise to not hit me with a rock or anything from now on. Now just tell me what happened? That is all I wanted in the first place.” Looking back to the ward Marian was going to have to be cautious, this could be a trap. “He tried to rape me. He pulled me in here before you came, before I screamed and started to take off my armor. Then he, licked me.” She said disgusted and worried, would Ryvian side with his own ward and hurt her more, or would he turn a deaf ear to her screams, or maybe he would spare her anything else they could do to her and help her, although that seemed like a small chance. Her people feared the Avi; they were stealers of souls. He would most likely rape her himself and then leave her to the rest of his troops. Laying back Marian decided to take the pain and disgrace so that she could escape when the time came and come back to kill them all. If nothing happened, she might have to stay near to this Ryvian just to study his people, if he protected her then he would set a new standard for the Avi. <br>

She had been with the army of the Teniols, taken in and nurtured back to health by a kind family. She decided to follow the Teniol Jake, to protect him and maybe pay back the help he had given her. During this she followed him out on a training operation, but it was in the wrong place and ran into a well-trained Galton of Gerial wards and Avi. After the battle she tried to save the one that saved her, but he had died before her power could work. She was going now to the camp to find the Gerials and see what they were doing out here. Closing in on the camp she heard the screams of what sounded like Marian, the sister of Jake, which had befriended her. She ran towards the camp, until she was too tired to run anymore. Now she was walking, and able to smell the smoke of the fire. She only had a dagger with her and no other weapons; if these Gerials proved to be hostile then she would most likely be killed. The power from the moon had nearly been depleted that night and she would have to wait until the moon rose again until she could gain any of it back. Her only chance was to meet with the Avi and hope that he was on a mission that could use another cleric. She knew they had their share of power in the camp; she had seen the magic released and the ground caved in from the power of a cleric.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ryvian stood outside of Alec’s tent and heard the soft sobs. He had taken Alec and put him up in another tent. He decided to let her mourn her brother before he made his mind up about anything. He was staring out into the sea when a fleck of metal against the moon flashed in his eye. Thinking it must have been the armor of a corpse out on the beach. He would send a falcon to pass back and forth on the beach to wait for a search crew to tell them what happened so the Teniols did not declare war on anyone. His stare became more relaxed as the light played on the water was blurred. He caught the glimpse of the light again and decided to find out what it was. Pulling the griffon blade once more he scanned through the crystal that lay in the hilt. The vision flew towards the shiny thing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fatigue taking over her body, Emily fell to her knees and then fell on her back to face the sky. She pulled her short sword from her belt and stuck it in the sand next to her leaning towards the camp. When she woke she could follow the direction and get to the Galton. Tomorrow she would find the people that were in that camp and find if they were rogue or not. Tomorrow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Surprised, Ryvian nudged the Gerial that lay sleeping in the sand. She moaned, but did not wake. Contemplating how she got out on the beach this far from home by herself, Ryvian lifted her into his arms and started to carry her back to the camp. He would get all this sorted out in the morning. This girl, and the young Teniol, all of it would be fixed tomorrow. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The next morning the sun rose as it did every day, but this morning there was something strangely different. The birds and gulls that were heard every morning by the sea were nowhere in sight. Ryvian woke and expected to find Lily sleeping next to him; she was not. He sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Ryvian looked around the tent. He found her sitting next to the fire outside the tent. He walked up behind her and sat down beside her. Putting his arm over her shoulder, Ryvian turned Lily’s head to face him. She had tears in her eyes. “Darling, what is the matter?” Ryvian was shocked when she put her head on his shoulder and cried. Understanding that sometimes it is better to let the tears flow, he let her cry it out and held her. <br>
<br>
Emily was woken by the cries coming from next to her. Startled awake, she looked around. She was in a tent on a cot, not in the sand of the beach. Somewhat disoriented she lifted her head to see what the noise was. Surprised that she was looking at Marian sleeping next to her, Emily shook the Teniol awake. “Marian?”  Turning her head, Marian jumped out her bed with a shout. “You’re alive!” the two friends embraced each other. Marian explained their current situation and the two decided to wait it out and see how the dice rolled.<br>
<br>
The day had started and the Gerials were running about doing their duties and such things. Ryvian sat looking at his map following the path with his finger. He had the rest of the day to get to Lib and still be on schedule. Thinking about his current situation with the two newcomers. He was not sure if he could trust either of them. The two women looked like they were battle tested and the Teniol seemed to resent them, yet held a curious nature about her that confused the matter more. Having thought about the matter all night long, Ryvian had decided to let the two come with him to Lib where if they decided to continue with them then they would be allowed, but if they were determined to return home then he would let them leave at Lib. That way if the two were to leave they would still be in safe territory. <br>
