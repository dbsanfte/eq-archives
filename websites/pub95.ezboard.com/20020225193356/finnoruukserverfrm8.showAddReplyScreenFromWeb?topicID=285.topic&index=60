Dude...that is such bullsheet.  Can you say sweeping generalization three times really fast?  <br>
<br>
I learned to drive in a 1985 Dodge Lancer.  A medium-sized car if you will.  &quot;American&quot; made as far as the definition holds. This car was the biggest piece of dung I've ever seen.  The transmission gave up after a couple years and a few &quot;hard-working&quot; blue-collar &quot;American&quot; (read:<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> redneck</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) mechanics got ahold of it. One of the dopey sods even left a screwdriver under the hood, which we discovered later when it began to make an ungodly rattle in the fan blades. The power windows didn't work when it rained. Eventually the drivers side window fell inside the door frame and you had to take the door apart to get it out. The power steering assembly was so poorly designed it actually had moving rubber/plastic hose that rubbed against hot metal surfaces on the engine.  The hose eventually ruptured, spilling that mighty &quot;renewable&quot; power steering fluid all over the road.  Adding to the comic error that was this car, the drivers side door eventually fell off one day, because the pins that held it to the rest of the body would seemingly only work in zero-gravity conditions.  Made in the USA, indeed.  <br>
<br>
My dad, a hard-working, blue-collar guy back then who bought the Dodge with his own sweat and blood, had a friend who worked with him that drove a 1979(?) Datsun.  The guy drove that car for nearly twenty years and never did anything but change the oil, brake pads, and tires.  He finally sold it last year to a guy for $200 with over 500,000 miles on the odometer.  I believe its still running fine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
This in itself is a generalization.  I'm sure not all Dodges are pieces of sheet and not all riceburners are &quot;natural&quot; wonders...but you see what I'm getting at.  <br>
<br>
Today I drive the Honda, and I've got such little self-respect, driving ability, and all that I've managed to drive it and several other &quot;peddle cars&quot; in my measly 11 years on the road without one single crash, fender bender, or other malady.  Not even a parking ticket.  /em looks around for some wood to knock on.  Again, hardly scientific proof to refute your illustrious theory that all economy car drivers are absent-minded wankers going 45 in the passing lane with their left turn signal blinking, but you catch my drift.  Perhaps I'm the missing link that proves Dale Earnhardt evolved from The cell-phone wielding Soccer Mom.<br>

<br>
I can't even get my mind around this one.  Its either a galactically large concept that my feeble grey matter can't process, or its such a blindingly stupid idea that I'm just dumbfounded as to why anyone could believe it.  However, since I have observed that most people on the road today are morons that don't know how to drive, I must assume that it is reasonable that you hold such truths to be self-evident.  Personally...I think you've got it backwards.  Seems to me that most drivers of the lumbering urban assault vehicle try to drive it like a Miata.<br>

Forklifts and dumptrucks move freight and raw materials.  They don't go 95 mph and pass me on the right-hand side in a school zone with enough momentum and kinetic energy to knock down the World Trade Center all over again.  <br>
<br>
I tend to look at the driving experience through utilitarian eyes.  In a way, the word &quot;utility&quot; as applied to the sport utility vehicle is almost oxymoronic and offensive to me.  I like to take a less-is-more approach.  Kinda like David Gilmour plays guitar...no notes that don't belong...but I digress.  The true &quot;purpose,&quot; to use your words, of owning a motorized vehicle or other horseless carriage is to get from Point A to Point B in a relatively small amount of time and with the least amount of work.  The coefficient of friction and drag factors alone on a big-ass, boxy sport utility vehicle (as compared to the economy car) render the average SUV pointless and wasteful to drive all on their own, nevermind the immeasurable kilojoules of petrochemical and mechanical energy required to get the two-ton heaps of crap in motion in the first place.<br>
<br>
You think I'm done yet?  No sir!  <br>
<br>
How in the @#%$ can you even say that oil is a renewable resource?  The @#%$ takes millions and freaking billions of years to form under plate tectonics, massive heat and pressure, and natural decay of sedimentary organic particles.  On the other hand, you've got the number of jackasses driving SUVs increasing exponentially like the number of infectious bacteria in Kaurik's mom's Pap smear Petri dish.  (j/k Kaurik)  If you graphed the petroleum production and demand curves on a good ol' Cartesian coordinate plane, I'd bet you a shiny wooden nickel that the sumbitches intersect before the end of my lifetime.  <br>
<br>
But no, don't take my word for it...go ahead and crank up that John Deere and cut down a few more rain forests.  Hell, feel free to burn off the underbrush with high octane unleaded fuel while you're at it and increase the greenhouse gases.  @#%$ the ozone layer..I've got a pair of high-polymer Ray-Bans!  Just don't come around trying to eat my canned tofu when hell freezes over and you realize that corn don't grow in sulfuric acid...cuz you ain't getting no grub here, Jack.<br>

I didn't just hatch yesterday, I've been driving all over the country for a quarter century or better. And apparently unlike most drivers, I don't insert my head into the nearest anal orifice when I get behind the wheel, I observe those around me. There's nothing wrong with a sweeping generalization when it's true (except that it's heresy of course.)<br>
<br>
An 85 Dodge doesn't fit the American made definition we've established here.<br>
<br>
Uh, btw, just because someone is blue collar doesn't mean they're hard working, and vice versa. tsk tsk.<br>
<br>
Yes, I've heard that line of @#%$ about Datsuns... and seen the Datsuns in question. The only thing holding the vehicles together were the cockroaches holding hands.<br>
Wow, you managed to go 11 years without having an accident. And of course we only have your word and keen sense of observation to know that you didn't *cause* any accidents as people in real cars manoevered to avoid killing you in the crackerbox you were strapped into. Oh, btw, 15 years here w/o so much as a ticket. Prior to that, 10 years. The ticket? doing 45 in a 35 past a motorcycle cop in a speed trap (driving... trumpet please... 76 Spitfire)<br>
Most people who drive the lumbering assault vehicles *can* manoever it like a Miata. Most people who drive peddle cars haven't learned to steer where they can't see.<br>
<br>
Oh, before I forget, I love the way you twisted my words around... number 1 was an assertion I flatly stand behind based upon my observations and conversations with drivers over the past quarter century and straightforward reasoning; if you *learn* to drive in a peddle car, you are not equipped to drive in the real world. period. number 2, however... I said &quot;many&quot;. This is not connected with number 1. I have observed many many many people who drive little cars and seem to think they either own the highway or have an invisible bumper 4 feet on all sides of their vehicle. They are very annoying to those of us who *do* own the highway. <br>

Hyperbolize much? I don't know of any public road where you can legally go 95 mph, particularly in a school zone. Of course they don't have the momentum or kinetic energy to knock down the WTC... just enough to blow a peddle-car off the road. Tough. Peddle cars have less right to the road than real vehicles going about business.<br>
Actually, dumptrucks can and *do* travel at highway speeds. Your average SuV has about the same mass and size as your average Lincoln Towncar (the type of vehicle those highways were built for.) True, an SuV won't haul much freight, but then a Miata won't put a cube of concrete block 2 scaffolds in the air. Nor will it get 5 bags of mortar from the lumber yard, nor haul 5 workers from jobsite to jobsite, nor clear the curb on a jobsite, nor pull a forklift out of the mud on a jobsite, nor carry a half dozen toolboxes of tools (along with those 5 workers come to think of it.) And that's just the random jobs I can think of of the top of my head related *just* to building/home construction that such vehicles serve. SuVs have a purpose. Soccer Moms do not.<br>

Who says? Nuclear energy requires thousands of miles of space, quintillion tons of mass, massive heat and pressure, and 14 billion years of cosmic evolution. Nevertheless, we've done it with less. It only takes so long and requires such resources because we left it up to mother nature, that incompetent bitch.<br>

Yes, and at population growth rates of the 1970s, the Earth will have massive famines and overpopulation by the year 2000. &lt;yawn&gt; If we listen to *you*, we deserve to go back to horse and buggies. There's petrochemicals out there (points up.) There's more on the planet. We can develop the technology to *make* more. We sure as f uck can't develop alternatives if we stop using it today! We've got time now, but we won't have forever. I don't know bout you, but I don't really care if 200 years from now we have no oil, if we're exactly where we are today! Instead of bitching about the consumption and wanting us to go back to the trees, bitch about the lack of research; bitch about the lack of funding for NASA.<br>
<br>
If nature can make it, we can make it. And probably better and faster. Fund the research. If we can afford to send billions to Afghanistan, we can afford to fund the research.<br>

Okay, genius, here's an education for you.. you know what that blue haze above JUNGLES (what you call rainforests) is? GREENHOUSE GASSES. You know what that blue haze that isn't above cornfields is? NONGREENHOUSE GASSES. Rotting vegitation, a prime and necessary ingredient for jungles, released greenhouse gasses including carbon dioxide. Farmland has more oxygen-generating plant surfaces than does a jungle, partly because the plants are planted cheek-by-jowel. Tree bark and lichen don't generate O2 very well. Farmland also increases our albedo... so we radiate energy to space better. Again, the short-sighted liberals whine and cry because the Earth isn't exactly as it was the moment you squirted out from between your momma's knees. Why, your lifetime is the lifetime of the whole universe, isn't it? There never was a time when the atmosphere of the Earth wouldn't support animal life, nooo, there was never any ice ages, or asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions nooo.. the Earth isn't a park; it undergoes changes both longterm and shortterm, and if you look at short term trends and act rashly based on those, you could make the darned place uninhabitable for sure. And long term isn't a century.. it's a million years. Short term is a thousand years. We are, in fact, in equal likelyhood of encountering another ice age as we are a &quot;jungle-age&quot; of global warming. Could it be that the two might balance out? Could it be that there's a cause we don't know about and have no influence over that has thinned the ozone layer in places?  Might be part of some cycle we don't know about yet? Naaahh.. that wouldn't scare people. Can't use that to make them live the way we want them to live (in little caves with no fire and tools because technology is evil oh and btw I hate George Lucas.)<br>
<br>
Corn don't grow in sulphuric acid.. great to hear, I guess that's why there are no corn plantations on venus huh? I spose a bunch of humans went there and cut down all the rainforests and in 3 weeks the sulphuric acid clouds formed, huh? Last time I was in Iowa, the corn was growing just fine, thanks. I don't know how the plastic corn is doing, however (yes, plastic corn.) In fact, we could and should genetically engineer corn to thrive in sulphuric acid and high pressures, so that we can reclaim Venus for life and in a century or so colonize it. But that's long term. And, gosh, along the way we might inadvertently learn a thing or two about how planets operate and how to prevent the very disaster you delight in dreading.<br>
