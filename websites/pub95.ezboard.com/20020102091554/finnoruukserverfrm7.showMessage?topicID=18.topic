This couple has been together a long time, but they hold a secret that not many can know. This couple is not a couple like any other you can imagine. It is one of a dragon and her protector. The man is Mystic and the woman is Windrawn.<br>
<br>
Mystic says in a low voice,&quot; Windrawn I have a question for you. I know I am your protector and have watched you grow from a young dragon when I saved you from the thieves and your mother Sintry Chose me to be your protector and guide. My question to you is why do you choice to be a woman all the time when I know you are able to chose any form?&quot;<br>
<br>
A few moments past as anytime Mystic has asked the Windrawn a question. Then in a soft and almost singing voice windrawn answered, &quot; I chose this form to please your eyes. I know you gave up alot to be my guardian. I know that if you had been able to find a companion who would be able to make you happy, and have a family. I chose this form because we spend many nights out here alone and I know you long for human companionship.&quot; With these words silence falls for what seems an hour.<br>
<br>
Mystic looks at Windrawn and smiles,&quot; Windrawn my friend you have done this to keep me happy. There are things I can not experience with you, but there are things that I have experienced that no other person can imagine. I have enjoyed watching you grow as a dad would to his child. I have watched you as your scales turned golden and your ability to shape change improved. I have watched you dance in a town that all the people thought you where one of them. I saw your first flight. I saw as you gained your ability to heal as your mother did. I spent hours thinking at one time how I could of been married and had many kids, but none would be as unique as you are. If you chose to never turn to human form again I will still be here. You have become more to me than my ward you have became like a child to me. One day I will have to let you go but until then I am very happy just as my life is. And for your compassion you have learned a trait I am glad you are able to express this well...Caring. Now rest Windrawn tomorrow we travel to find your mom and show her how you have progressed.&quot; Mystic changes positions in front of the fire and gets ready to sleep with a tear in his eye...<br>
<br>
.... As morning breaks Mystic wakes and equips his armor which is an assortment of different armor which seems to glow with a hint of magic even though looking like normal armor a ranger of his level would wear. To a person who did not know him they would think he was an easy mark. To those that where close to him the know that isn't so. <br>
<br>
After equipping his armor he looks around to find his companion not in the camp. He immediately becomes worried and smells in the air and looks at the ground for tracks of Windrawn. Finding a fresh track he leaves camp in search of her. With his grace and speed from many years of running through the woods he is as silent as a thief pickpocketing a person in the market. This skill has allowed him many times to drop in on thieves and turn the tables into his favor many times. As he gets closer he hears a splashing and stops to glance and see a female form in a lake enjoying an early morning dip, he chuckles to himself, for he has found Windrawn. <br>
<br>
Windrawn has taken the shape of a half elf lady with hair so fine and brilliant it is as if her hair was made of the finest white gold. Her skin fair and soft, her form appeasing to any man who might pass. This Lady has been the dream of many young boys’ dreams and has parted many old men's coin from their purse to buy her a drink just to talk to her. <br>
<br>
Windrawn steps out of the water and looks at Mystic standing there knowing that she is going to be scolded for not letting him know where she was. But on this morning Mystic looks at her as to say lets go your mother awaits our arrival and turns and walks back to camp. Stunned Windrawn says, &quot;What has changed? Just yesterday you would have not been so patient, you would have made me return and been angry with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mystic turns slowly and with a smile says, &quot; Well today you have become of age. You are now old enough to know your limits on how far you can go from me and be safe. Lets get going because Sintry is waiting for us and you know how much a golden dragon hates to be kept from her schedule.&quot; Mystic hurries back to camp and puts out the fire and retrieves his backpacks and gear for the last leg of their trip to meet Sintry.<br>
<br>
Hours pass with silence to not disturb the woods that they pass through then Windrawn says,&quot;Mystic what do you mean I am of age?&quot;<br>
<br>
Without stooping Mystic responds, &quot; This is the time your mother set for you to be able to make your own decisions on weither to keep me as your protector or go off on your own. I have been dreading this day but what I saw last night shows me my teachings have been learned well. Windrawn I am proud of you and now we go to your mother to show her you are ready to take your place as one of the dragons who take care of keeping the pact that was made between humans and dragon kind all the years ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Windrawn replies, &quot;So at this point we might be parting?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mystic stops and turns to look into Windrawn's eyes and with tears starting to show more than he ever let her see before says,&quot; Know this I will be here till you no longer need me. I am saying now that you are ready if you want to go on your own, but only you can make that decision. I am leaving this choice up to you.&quot; Mystic wipes his eyes dry and turns without waiting on the response to continue along the way.<br>
<br>
A few hours later they arrive at the meeting spot of the dragons. A few dragon lords are waiting there to protect the area, as it is a sacred place in which only the dragon's and their chosen friends are to enter. The 2 protecting the entrance this day have seen this happening many times the time of passage is come and they recognize the concern in Mystic's eyes. <br>
<br>
Bilbo says,&quot; Welcome Mystic, but your friend can not pass us for you know the rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hemmy looks at Bilbo and lets out an evil laugh before saying, &quot;M'lady Windrawn welcome back to the Dragon's layer. Don't mind Bilbo he is not as how do I say this...Observant of the shapes our dragons take. The last time we saw you, Your scales had not matured and your true color had not shown. Welcome back Golden Dragon.&quot;<br>
<br>
From deep within the dragon's layer a loud rumbling started to emit and the sounds of many dragons cheering as another returning to the layer brings joy to them. Some of them older than the plane that exists here. And appearing at the entrance Sintry a powerful golden dragon. She says, &quot;Welcome home my daughter. Mystic thank you for all you have done to protect my daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mystic says regaining his composer,&quot; It was an honor M'lady. She is ready to make her choice of what she would like to do.&quot; Mystic puts away his weapons and turns to Windrawn and gives her a hug whispering,&quot; use your heart and find your path.&quot; Mystic walks over and sits on a ledge outside the dragon’s lairs looking out over a lush valley he had visited many times before. He was waiting to find if he becomes another Dragon Lord to watch his ward become independent and no longer wanting to have him around as he saw so many young dragon's do years before.<br>
<br>
Minutes later the silence was broken and a cheer was heard. Sintry who had taken a form Mystic had seen many times while he learned the ways of a Dragon Lord walks out and joins him on his ledge. Sintry says,&quot;You have been a good teacher and have protected Windrawn to the best of your knowledge. I have watched you two from afar and know how much you mean to each other. I know your heart feels as if your daughter is leaving home, but know this she is more than your daughter she is your friend. She asked if she could go with you in any of your ventures and not have to go out on her own. I told her that you also have a choice here as to be freed of your obligation to protect her and other dragons and find a normal life, or to continue in your duties to keep her safe. When I chose you I set the time not only for her but I knew you where young and would change over time. You might find yourself drawn to starting a family and settling down. So it is up to you.... Stay and be Windrawn's companion, or leave and be known as a great Dragon Lord who answered my call and completed my task.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silences fell once again for what seemed an eternity. Night fell and Mystic says, &quot;Well I have thought about this many days and I have nothing in this world but my love of dragons and my longing to help others. If it pleases you I would love to be Windrawn's companion.&quot; Mystic looks towards Windrawn and grins,&quot;well till she can't stand me anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point Sintry stands goes to her daughter and states,&quot;Your wish has been granted. He will protect you till the end of time. I am here if you ever need me. I am proud of you.&quot;<br>
