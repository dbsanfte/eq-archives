She opens them with a delicate hand, her other keeping her cloak closed about her in the slight wind.  Her hair was an unusual shade of grey, and cut to a very short style, her eyes a deep violet.<br>
<br>
Her steady strides brought her to the recruitment hall quickly, and she flicked back her hood as she addressed those present.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ven'dui, mi'lords, mi'ladies.  My name is Seuinye, an apprentice priestess to the goddess Saryrn.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have known of your house for some time, and I have been guided here as well by mi'lady Ankhami.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I look for a family, for those to share my time and experiences.  I can only hope I am looking in the right place.&quot;<br>
<br>
She curtsies deeply then, a small smirk tugging at her lips. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/SeuSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerridwynn>Kerridwynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ilharess of the Scythe</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/8/03 2:06 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/Kerridwynn2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Priestess of Saryrn</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn looked up from her book as the priestess entered the recruitment lounge.

<br>
She gracefully takes a seat near the leader of the Scythes, her cloak arranged about her carefully.  &quot;My history... is naut nearly as exciting as my future.  But, it does tell a bit about myself, so I will happily share it with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was born to a noble house in Neriak, and as with most daughters of noble houses, I was ordained to be a priestess of Innoruuk.  As such, my earliest years were filled with the doctrine of hatrid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seuinye's eyes take on a far away look, as if reliving those first years, a slight smile on her face.  &quot;I was fascinated, not by the creed that hate should rule your emotions... but rather by the history, the telling of our people's achievements... the bloody victories over our foes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But even more than that... I was positively enraptured in the sacrifices.  I found myself looking forward to the times they would bring in some creature to be sacrificed.  My favorites were the barbarians.  So stoic in the acceptance of the pain, the tearing and singing of their flesh.  They almost seemed to be happy to die... as if they had fulfilled a higher purpose.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighs then, her eyes taking in a new memory.  &quot;I then found why they were happy to die... why they all arrived whimpering and cowering.  Deep in the hidden dungeons of the Temple of Innoruuk, they were tortured, by followers of Saryn.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was there that I first heard my goddess' name, but more interesting to me at the time were their methods... what they did.  I spent more and more time in the dungeons, using my meager skills to help the tormenters in their duties.  I listened to whatever I could from them... and soon became one of them.  I was shunned from the temple, though secretly my skills were used against the enemies of Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Teir'Dal shifts slightly, her cheeks a bit deeper colored as she recites her deeds.<br>
<br>
&quot;However, I quickly learned that while they followed the Goddess Saryrn in name, they were missing an important piece of the following.  They gladly dealt pain, but crudely, inefficiently... for they loathed pain themselves.  They were mere sadists, who used Saryrn's name to their advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seuniye shakes her head slowly, her hand unconsciously fingering the clasps on her left bracer, her eyes still distant.  &quot;And so I left, in search of more information.  I have experienced pain, and through that pain, I have gained clarity, a clarity those sadists never had.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes focus on Kerridwynn.  &quot;You see Ilharess, in my clarity, I realized many things.  The universe has it's own duality.  In the brightest of lights, there is the deepest of darkness.  In the fortress of good rots the corruption of evil.  In the deepest throes of pain, there is an abundence of pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiles then, the past set aside.  &quot;I wander the lands now, ready to help others find these pleasures, and to extend the suffering of all who I may.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
((I will be more than happy to join the chat channel, you can likely expect me there tonight, and more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As a side note, I am an avid roleplayer, and will gladly allow myself to be &quot;incorporated&quot; into other storylines as needed.  I love not really knowing what's going to happen next; the spontanious RP.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to meeting all of you!)) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/SeuSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khorneonabrassthrone>khorne on a brass throne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/9/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Priestess of Saryrn</span><hr size=1> who are you calling odd, mistress.
