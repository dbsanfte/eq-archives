The whole world around you is changing, Miriachn. You’re going to get left behind.’ Caelestis was right. Damn him, he was right. She didn’t want to change. Her life was fine the way it was. Wasn’t it? Maybe a little change was ok… just a little. Maybe she would stop being Caelestis’s call girl. Maybe she would tell him no. What if she told him no and he left? Never to return or see her again? No, she couldn’t have that.<br>
<br>
Freeport was like a sad painting of depression you saw in history books telling of sadder times, only these were the sadder times. The world was stuck in a vicious cycle of destruction that it had created itself. It was man against man; everybody hated everyone else for injustices never committed. The rains of sorrow beat against the already soaked grounds. Would the clouds ever disappear? It had been too long since Miriam had seen the sun, but she did not miss the light. Remembering how the summers felt burned her eyes and made sweat collect on her brow.<br>
<br>
“It is the hate, created by the Teir’Dal, that has led us down this shadowed path, and it is ourselves that keep blindly walking farther down their path. We must band together to spread light into the darkness once more. Join me, my brothers and sisters, and we shall rise above all to bring peace to the tortured and battered souls of the world”<br>
<br>
Miriam pauses. What he spoke sounded good to her. A Knight… she could become a Knight. Maybe what she needed was some discipline, some training. She would be strong once more. Did she really want to be a Knight? Was it the good side she wanted to fight for? The light never seemed to conquer the dark. Miriam could remember all the times she dreamt of being a dark overlord, an evil magician, a rogue who stalked through the night unnoticed. But was that all really her? She wasn’t good enough for the dark. The dark was so lonely; she didn’t want to be alone. The light held comfort and no regrets, didn’t it? She didn’t realize it, but she ran, ran into the Warriors guild and burst through the doors. A guild leader catches sight of her and smiles.<br>
<br>
“Welcome, young warrior”<br>
<br>
“I want to fight”<br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
<br>
And so she was enlisted. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe you’re really a knight… geez.”<br>
<br>
“Believe it, Aino, cuz I am”<br>
<br>
“What the @#%$ were you thinking when you enlisted?”<br>
<br>
“That was a while ago, and I’m not sure what I was thinking. I know that now I know I like being a knight, I like training”<br>
<br>
“Well, have fun wasting your life. I’m out.” <br>
<br>
Aino rose from the bench and walked from Miriiam with a huff. Why did I really become a Knight? Because they have taken away my life… My free spirit, and now I know when I do wrong and have set rules on how to live. There is no longer a fork in the roads and I no longer have to choose with path, the path is already set for me. I like this… I like having everything done for me, it’s easier to live this way. Isn’t it?<br>
<br>
~*You lack*~<br>
<br>
A mirror image of herself stands three feet away, again dressed in that well known cloth dress.<br>
<br>
~What~<br>
<br>
~*You lack*~<br>
<br>
~I lack~<br>
<br>
~*You lack*~<br>
<br>
~I lack choice~<br>
<br>
~*You lack deep thought*~<br>
<br>
~I lack will~<br>
<br>
~*You lack emotion*~<br>
<br>
~I lack life~<br>
<br>
~*You lack*~<br>
<br>
~…I lack~<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For Miriiam each day was hard and unforgiving and each night cold and uncomforting. Her life has become a mechanical routine that allows her to escape all feeling. Her mind would not lie still for that long. A year has passed since she enlisted and now she was slowly starting to slip back to her old ways. <br>
<br>
~You are getting worse~<br>
<br>
Miriiam puts all her weight behind a cold iron bastard sword as she swings it down against a young man’s sword. Both wear plain leather armor. <br>
<br>
~Faster weakling, faster!~<br>
<br>
Growling she reposes a thrust from her opponent.<br>
<br>
~That was sloppy. Woah! Watch what you’re doing, he almost got a hit in. Now! He’s open! Go for it!~ <br>
<br>
Miriiam felt chilling steel against her neck as a dull blade was placed against her skin. How in the God’s horrid names did he manage that? <br>
<br>
“Miriiam, good try, you’re a little weak on your left side. And Jonan, excellent form!” Her own thoughts drown out the praises that the instructor gives Jonan.<br>
<br>
~You stupid idiot! What were you thinking?! You get worse and worse every day! You’re shameful stop trying. You real-~<br>
<br>
“Miriiam?”<br>
<br>
“Uuuh, yes, Sir?”<br>
<br>
“May I talk with you?”<br>
<br>
“Of course, Sir”<br>
<br>
“The rest of you are dismissed”<br>
<br>
Just as the last student left the instructor approached her.<br>
<br>
“Miriiam… I’ve noticed in the past few weeks that you have not been trying as hard or putting forth as much… enthusiasm as you did before. Is something troubling you?”<br>
<br>
“No, Sir.”<br>
<br>
“Well, try harder. You used to be the top of the class and now I see you slipping. It worries me.”<br>
<br>
“I am sorry, Sir. I will try harder”<br>
<br>
“Good… You are dismissed” <br>
<br>
They each go their separate ways. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Miriiam sits on the edge of her bed. Her head rests in her hands. <br>
<br>
~IDIOT! Even the teacher knows you’re weak. You’re failing. I * told * you this would happen, idiot.~<br>
<br>
“I’ve got to get out…”<br>
<br>
~Leave? You can’t just leave! You’re giving up! You’re running away, again! You must stay!”<br>
<br>
“I can’t”<br>
<br>
~Fine! Be a baby, act like a child! Go on! Get out of here! This place always was too good for you. You’ll never become a warrior, you’re too * weak *~<br>
<br>
With tear stained cheeks Miriiam runs. Runs from the guild. Runs from the training. Runs from herself. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was on the street corner on the other side of Freeport that she stopped running. Out of breath she sinks to her knees to try and catch it. Again, that annoying image of herself appears behind her.<br>
<br>
~*Why do you run?*~<br>
~Because I must~<br>
~*What do you run from?*~<br>
~The training~<br>
~*The pain of not being as good as you wish to?*~<br>
~My faults~<br>
~*You have many faults?*~<br>
~Yes~<br>
~*How repulsive…*~<br>
<br>
Miriiam hugs her stomach. How repulsive… Her head begins to spin wildly as emotions run high. What was this? Agony? Despair? Weakness. Leaning forward, Miriiam revisits her breakfast in the most unpleasant way. <br>
