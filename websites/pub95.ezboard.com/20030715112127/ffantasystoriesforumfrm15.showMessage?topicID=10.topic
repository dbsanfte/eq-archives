Chapter 10<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark Forces Arise.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Revisions revisions.... I'm doing this as quickly as possible since I really need to finish this series off. Anyway here we go, I'm glad people actually like what I've written in the past, and very soon you will see what I've written recently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nearly a month has passed since Shoken and Ryo gave their lives in an attempt to stop Xernoss, for the most part they simply delayed the rising of his undead forces. During this time Zebuxoruk still lurked in the shadows, keeping an ever vigilant watch as the dwarves from Kaladim quickly began readying Freeport for the oncoming battle. This was all the ungod could do for the moment, since it was apparent things where only going to get worse.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should of expected Erudin would respond like that, those eggheads always have a problem with undead there, only with Xernoss around it's going to get worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So that just leaves us here in Qeynos until Xernoss decides to strike, a fine situation this is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zolf shook his head, both himself and Shoken's father had been trying to figure out just how to defeat Xernoss. Furthermore matters had taken a turn for the worse with Azia and Rita. They where being recluses, spending much of their time locked away in their rooms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Daxster, what of help from High Keep or Freeport?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's impossible, the undead attack each time anyone even considers sending out a party, and Kithicor forest is even worse than before now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So we're stuck no matter what we do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selena sighed, she couldn't believe things could turn so awful so quickly. To make matters worse when they had searched the Greater Faydark they found no trace of Shoken or Ryo's body. This meant they didn't have any way of resurrecting them.<br>
<br>
Azia at this time was sitting in her room, for the past month all she could think of was how helpless she was when Xernoss attacked. Some how it was a comfort that she still had the Exodus, another thing was the sword itself seemed to be learning at an alarming rate. This weapon seemed to have a mind and a will all of its own, and clearly intended to help in any way it could.<br>
<br>
- You should stop blaming yourself, Shoken and Ryo didn't have a choice, if they had let Xernoss continue fighting everyone you all surely would be dead. -<br>
<br>
&quot;It's still not right...&quot;<br>
<br>
- You and Rita will have your revenge soon, Xernoss won't wait for another to become as strong as Shoken and Ryo where. -<br>
<br>
Rita frowned as she stared out over the city, she still couldn't come to terms with the fact that Ryo was gone and would never be coming back. She knew she would meet Xernoss again and when she did, he would die. This was something she would ensure, even if it meant her sacrificing her own life in the process.<br>
<br>
Xernoss crossed his arms and stared out over the fields of West Karana as his undead legions made their way towards Qeynos hills. So far he had met with little resistance, of course he knew full well he would have to kill the four people who had fought against him on Faydwer. He was still surprised that the boy had that kind of power, but now that he was dead there would be no more problems, or so he thought.<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk in the mean time had been waiting in Qeynos Hills, a small amount of his powers had returned. This would be at least enough to give him the time to hold Xernoss at bay in hopes that someone could arise from the ranks in Qeynos. He certainly hoped someone was could strike the fatal blow that would end Xernoss's life when given the chance. This was all he knew of that could avenge the death of his chosen.<br>
<br>
Zolf and Shoken's father where suddenly interrupted from a shout from the street. It was a Scout who had managed to carry Sir Morgan back from East Karana. The news was grim even for the situation they where in.<br>
<br>
&quot;To arms everyone, the undead have already slaughtered our guard posts in North and West Karana!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sir Morgan had been beaten brutally, his once glamorous armor was now dull and there wasn't a place undented or scratched on it. He had made the mistake of charging Xernoss, if it wouldn't had been for his Squire he would be dead rather than being wounded in Qeynos. All his hopes lie in the hands of the clerics, since he so desperately wanted to defend the city again.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Xernoss comes at last, looks like our luck has run out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dears lets just hope we can stop him this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia and Rita both came down stairs, each with their weapon in hand. They weren't going to let Xernoss get away with what all he had done. If anything they where going to try and put an end to his atrocities, no matter the cost this day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you two sure that you want to fight, without my son here we might not come back from this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As am I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rita glanced over and caught a glimpse of the Exodus tucked away under Azia's scabbard, it was the only thing both her and Azia had left of Shoken and Ryo. It had been the last thing both of them had touched. Maybe, just maybe she thought, with the Exodus there with them they might have a chance at surviving.<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk stood on the path to Qeynos just as the undead army approached, behind him the soldiers from Qeynos had gathered. None of them knew who this cloaked figure was, but as they welcomed his help as they seen him rush into the on coming horde, scattering bone and rotting flesh as he struck down each of the undead that tried to attack him. Now was the time to see if he had regained enough of his strength to do what he knew must be done.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you value your lives then attack now!&quot;<br>
<br>
The ungod's words had a sobering and inspiring effect on the soldiers as they to rushed in and began combating the evil. Soon blood, rotten flesh, and bones covered the ground, however the battle began to go badly as the freshly killed would rise back up, strengthening the undead armies ranks. It was then that they heard a familiar voice echo over the battlefield.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sunstrike!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zolf's spell landed right in the very center of the undead army, incinerating their ranks and sending undead sprawling across the ground. It was then Shoken's fathers turn, only he used a spell none of them had ever seen, or even heard of before. In truth it was an ancient spell he had managed to scribe while studying some combine ruins in his youth, and today his hard work and study where going to be put to good use.<br>
<br>
&quot;Flash Flare!&quot;<br>
<br>
At that a massive of light washed over the legions of the undead army, and within seconds rotting flesh and bones where burnt to ashes. Zolf couldn't believe his eyes, this spell had a range like none he had ever seen before. Of course Zolf's surreal reverence was ended as a cloaked figure was sent flying past him and sliding across the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;So the ungod has come to try and stop me, well I suppose I'll finish you off once and for all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk slowly stood up, he was at a disadvantage and knew it, but he was going to give it his all. With that he rushed forward, forming a green blade of glowing mana from his hands as he swung at Xernoss. This was fruitless as the ungod was once again thrown back as if he was a child's play thing.<br>
<br>
Azia didn't know how this man was, but he was giving them the chance they needed to attack as she ran forward, unsheathing her ancient weapon as she prepared to impale Xernoss with it. This only resulted in having her sword parried away. Again she swung at Xernoss, only to have her blow slapped away.<br>
<br>
Rita in the meantime had managed to sneak up behind Xernoss, she now had the perfect opportunity to strike him down and stabbed forward with her Rapier. All Xernoss did was grunt and stumble forward, Rita's rapier had pierced his armor and sank deep into his back. As quickly as she could she pulled her Rapier away and leapt back, barely dodging Xernoss's fist.<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk seen the opening he needed as he ran up behind Xernoss and brought his mana sword up in a rising slash that landed across the stab wound. It was then the ungod brought the blade back down landing another strike across the wounded Xernoss's back. The Exodus seen a perfect opening for an attack, one that it knew would devastate their enemy.<br>
<br>
- Azia and Zolf, listen careful... Zolf cast your Sunstrike spell on Azia's sword, with that you can stand a chance! -<br>
<br>
Zolf nodded and began casting his spell, but Xernoss had turned back around and was preparing to unleash his rage them all. That is until Zinka landed her most powerful stun on Xernoss. This was all it took to give Zolf the time he needed as he finished his spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sunstrike!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Take this you bastard!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia ran forward as her sword was caught ablaze by Zolf's spell and leapt into the air. The sword landed in an arc across Xernoss's breastplate. They hadn't counted on what happened next as the area around Xernoss exploded into a fiery mass, one that sent Azia and the others reeling to the ground from the force.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did we get the bastard?&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone thought they had indeed defeated Xernoss, until he leapt from the flames. He had a blackened onyx bladed sword in his hands. Though his breastplate had nearly melted away from the recent attack he was still on the offensive. He was now determined to end this all as he targeted Azia and swung at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of the way!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk shoved Azia out of the way and barely managed to block Xernoss's strike with his mana blade. This in turn caused sparks of pure mana to shower both of them. The ungod was determined to do anything to buy someone the time it would take to launch another assault on this Fiend.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll all pay for this... You'll pay with your lives!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rita then lunged at Xernoss again just as Zebuxoruk was kicked away, she didn't have time to stop though as her Rapier collided with Xernoss's sword. She was then promptly kicked in the stomach, and then struck to the ground with the pummel of Xernoss's onyx bladed sword. Xernoss smiled as he raised his sword into the air, ready to finish Rita off.<br>
<br>
Zolf didn't have the time, or the mana to cast another spell so he did the only thing he could, which was push Xernoss out of the way, causing the onyx blade the strike the ground instead of impaling Rita.<br>
For doing so Zolf was to struck to the ground like a rag doll being discarded by a child. Zinka, out of desperation cast the only spell she could think of.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dementia!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss screamed out in pain as he clutched his head in pain. Azia seen the chance to strike and leapt forward, only to find her blow blocked by Xernoss. This was all futile, he was starting to become less susceptible to Zinka's mental assaults.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this the best you have to offer me? Your feeble attempts to strike me down?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss pushed Azia back and brought his sword down, slicing clear through her breastplate and sending her to the ground with enough force to cause to the earth to crack around her. Then his attention was turned to Zinka. She knew she needed to buy everyone some time, and the only way to do that was to get Xernoss away from them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear your not scared of me are you, come here so I can give you punishment you deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss simply smiled as he stepped over Azia and began moving towards Zinka. However, he soon found himself stuck as roots sprung up from the ground entangling his legs. She had played her hand perfectly, Xernoss was now far enough away to where he couldn't finish the others off. Not only that, but Shoken's father was preparing something special for Xernoss.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is just a little something I found in some ruins Xernoss, rather potent spell that your going to enjoy!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken's father thrust his hands forward as a beam of blinding white mana erupted from them and struck Xernoss square across the chest. This sent him flying backwards and into a hillside some distance away. Though it might have looked easy, this particular spell was one that drained every bit of mana a person had into one blast, one that he hoped would be enough to end this battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got him...&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man collapsed to one knee, he had indeed wasted all his mana as well as having strained his mind on the control it took for the spell. He hoped that had bought them sometime to recover, only his worst assumption came true as Xernoss pulled himself from the ground. It was all for nothing, his trump card had been played and there was nothing more he could do now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Smart tactic old man...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't forget about me Xernoss!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk was levitating in the air above Xernoss, he had gained just enough time to begin casting a spell. This was the very same spell that Shoken's father had just used, he himself was very familiar with it. Another blinding streak of mana was seen, one that drove struck Xernoss and drove him back down into the ground.<br>
<br>
For the past months time Shoken and Ryo had both been barely conscious, floating in a vast sea of darkness, a void with which there was no light. They had died, but no plane of existence had claimed their souls, and neither had realized the other was still in existence. It was then that a voice spoke to Shoken.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your efforts to stop Xernoss failed... What is your will?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My will?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, is it your will to return to your loved ones and save them...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't believe you... I killed Xernoss I know it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soon a small circle of light appeared before Shoken, in it was the battle that was going on. All Shoken could do was watch on as Xernoss was kept at bay by Zebuxoruk's spells. It was true, he really had failed his friends, even worse he had failed Azia.<br>
<br>
&quot;So do you wish to return?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What good am I to them if I couldn't even defeat Xernoss before...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your power stems from your will, your spirit, and the courage you possess that strengthens your spirit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if I might die again... I have to try, even if it is to see Azia just one last time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have the power to return, it has been yours, all you have to do is will it.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Shoken's presence disappeared from the void, but Ryo's still remained. It was then that he was given the option the same option Shoken was. After all this entity only thought it would be fair if both of them made their own decision now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xernoss is alive, do you wish to return?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no reason to return, now leave me alone you ignorant entity.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you have no reason to go back? No loved ones to return to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I said I have no reason to return! Now leave me alone!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you should watch, maybe your mind will change.&quot;<br>
<br>
A circle of light, just like the one that Shoken had seen appeared before Ryo. However, Ryo just watched as the battle continued, his demeanor not changing. He was quite possibly the most stubborn person that the entity had ever came into contact with.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we running out of power Zebuxoruk? I think so!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss leapt out of the hillside and crashed into Zebuxoruk, then struck him down to the ground with his sword. A sickening smile crossed Xernoss's face as he looked over all his victims. It was then that his eyes fell on Azia and Rita. He was now prepared to take their lives in one finally attack.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two going to be the first one's to die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss pointed a hand down at each of his targets as glowing streams of mana began to flow down his arms and collect into his palms. He enjoyed this part of the ungods powers, the vast stamina and amounts of mana he could summon up where almost endless. This was something he had counted on when he had managed to steal them from Zebuxoruk before.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am now going to be master of this world, and none can stop me!&quot;<br>
<br>
At that a burst of mana erupted from both of Xernoss's hands and screamed down towards Azia and Rita. The womens minds froze with terror, it seemed the inevitable was about to happen. Victory was going to be his this day, or so he thought...<br>
<br>
Ryo's eyes narrowed at the scene before him, his anger was beginning to reach its peak. It then the voice once again spoke to Ryo. Yet again he was going to be given the opportunity that he now seemed to be willing to accept.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you wish to return?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I do....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The power is yours to return.... Go...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo's body began to glow as for once crimson light pierced the void of darkness he was in, and then he was gone. Silence and tranquility once again came to the blackened area. This was something that was neither wanted nor unwanted though for the entity that resided there.<br>
<br>
&quot;May you two saviors of the world be victorious.&quot;<br>
<br>
The being, a nameless void of darkness sighed and return to its rest. It knew that between the two it had watched over for this short time had the abilities to save not only Norrath, but had the very power to rival the gods. They had become masters over their own spirit and fate in the world they where returning to once more.<br>
