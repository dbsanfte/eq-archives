Ok so maybe my perceptions were a bit off.  Is this more like it?  <a href = "http://www.nakedhatred.com/mulletsgalore/html/class/class01/02camaromullet.html">Aldrin</a><br>

I should have known a rightwinger like yourself would also be a defender of the gas-guzzling SUV.  Drive all you want, we'll drill for more!  Thx Bush administration!   I can't recall seeing  many Civics flipped over I-75 in the opposing traffic lanes...but ten bucks says you'll see at least one Blazer or 4-Runner mangled against a concrete median wall on any given Friday here in Atlanta.  Its also a good bet that yuppie-mom was on her way to get her nails done and was about to miss her appointment when she made a hard left lunge at 90 mph to pass that slow-moving Dodge Caravan--right into the propane tanker sitting in her massive blind spot.<br>
<br>
No, I'm less than convinced from your argument.  We the people who drive &quot;itty bitty cars&quot; are far more maneuverable and MUCH faster at making turns than the lumbering, top-heavy sport utility vehicle, idiots notwithstanding. Visibility limitations you say?  Holy flaming dogshitz Batman!  The only visibility limitations my Honda suffers from is not being able to see around the babysitter's fatass Lincoln Navigator in front of me.  Bitch, put down your @#%$ cell phone and drive!!!  ARRRRGH!<br>
<br>
No sir.  You shall not pass.  SUV's suck.  What <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exactly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> would a person <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> need</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with a Mercedes or Lexus SUV anyway, aside from keeping up with the Joneses next door?  Perhaps George and Judy can't fit the skis and snowboards on top of the beemer for the yearly trip to Vail?  The horror!

First, I've never seen an SuV in an accident. Must happen. (Broncos used to be notorious for flipovers.)<br>
Second, an SuV almost certainly doesn't have the turning radius of a Honda peddle-car.. but it has the power to get out of the way if necessary. Doesn't matter if you can turn on a dime if it takes you six weeks to go six inches, you're still toast.<br>
Why do you object to Lincoln or Mercedes making better quality SuVs? There are Mercedes I consider peddle-cars, that doesn't mean I object to peddle cars because rich people can afford a nicer one. If I were a general contractor and needed a work vehicle, and had the money, of course I'd get a Lincoln rather than a Toyota. <br>
As for your gas-guzzling concerns... <br>
SoccerMom_01 takes her big SuV to get groceries once every two weeks. She gets... two weeks worth of groceries. SoccerMom_02 drives a Honda peddlecar... she gets a day's worth of groceries every day... which one wastes gas? (this isn't made up, btw. I've already discovered that a 91 Lincoln Town car holds a buttload more groceries than a 98 CamAro and only gets about 3 mpg less.)<br>
I'm not going to defend Soccer Moms... they don't belong on the road be their vehicle a tank or a Segway. Soccer Moms rank with feminazis in my book, with the disadvantage of already having bred, in most cases. This is, of course, Soccer Mom as opposed to Real Mom.<br>
But, as I said before, Soccer Moms are not the only people who use SuVs. There are even Soccer Moms who drive Hondas (shudder.) In the 70s there was a CB radio fad. Everyone who had a dollar had a CB. CBs became almost worthless. Car antennae became a status symbol (including the sale of fake ones so you could be a more uber looking CBer.) People who barely drove further than their driveway had CB radios. People who didn't drive at all had CB radios. There were CBs on motorcycles (and not even hands-free ones...)<br>
A quarter century later, truckers still use CBs as the tool they are. The fad didn't make CBs bad or worthless; it was the people using them. The same is true of SuVs. There's a *reason* soccer moms drive SuVs instead of peddlecars. Peddlecars just don't cut it. If a nice stationwagon were still easily available, soccer moms would be using them. Hell, half the soccer moms around here drive Chevy or Ford pickups. <br>
The *one* advantage of having bad drivers in peddlecars instead of SuVs is that when (not if.. when) they cause an accident they'll take the brunt of the damage rather than the poor tired slob driving home from work they crash into.<br>

We could get into a year long argument over fuel efficiency versus total weight vs shopping once a year at Sams Club vs once a day at Publix, or could chew the fat over wall quenching and nitric oxide emissions in various sized engine blocks...but it would be boring and pointless.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that I hate SUVs for the exact same reasons as you and several other posters here hate Hondas:  <br>
<br>
Personal prejudice.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter.  What it amounts to in my area anyway is observed socioeconomic trends amplified somewhat by personal prejudice.  If you wanted to get all psychoanalytic on me, you could probably surmise that I secretly lust over the Lincoln Navigator simply because I couldn't afford to own one.  So I make up some @#%$ about soccer moms to quiet the pain of envy that I feel in my soul.  Or you could say that I hate Lincoln Navigators because they really do look like lardass heaps of @#%$ in a more absolute and universal sense. Makes no real difference in the long run because nobody is gonna prove me wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    You may sway public opinion on the issue...but chances are good you wont sway mine.  I figure that people *should* drive SUVs for one reason:  Utility.  i.e. you're the type of person who has to haul lots of @#%$/people around all the time.  I could go off on a tangential rant about excessive lifestyles in modern America, overpopulation, and shortages of available resources, but I already know what you'd say about that--and I figure time and Darwinian selection will eventually take care of the problem.  Ibid personal prejudice.<br>
<br>
I figure the reason people don't drive station wagons much any more is because the world finally realized they are pretty stupid looking.  Hopefully the same thing will happen with the SUV.  Motor Trend used to rave about the Taurus wagon for awhile...but wow that thing looks like a turd on wheels to me.<br>
<br>
I like my Honda for several reasons:  its cheap, its fuel efficient, it gets me where I want to go (quickly and expeditiously I might add), and its not too dumb looking.  Granted if I were some rice-shitter that gimped it out with spoilers, hydraulics, window tinting and Rockford Fosgate stickers it might become dumb looking...but alas I am not said rice-shitter.  <br>
<br>
Personally I'd rather be driving a hemi 'Cuda in a barren unpopulated world like something out of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; or &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;...where soccer moms are of minimal concern and I could just reduce their vehicles to rubble with a hood-mounted rocket launcher...but such fantasies are unrealistic and somewhat sociopathic.<br>
<br>
btw...plz define &quot;peddle car.&quot;  You lost me a bit on that one.  <br>
