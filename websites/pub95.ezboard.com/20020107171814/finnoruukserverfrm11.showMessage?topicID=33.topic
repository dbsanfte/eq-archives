<br>
I heard that XP, as a copy protection scheme, will require you to make contact with Microsoft to register the product, with a code based on your configuration. Therefore, whenever you change your configuration, you'll have to re-register, or at least talk to MS about a new registration code. That means you're playing EQ... get XP and register... get SoL.. need a more powerful video card... so you have to talk to MS or XP won't work with the new card. And if you can't convince MS that all you did was upgrade the card, you gotta buy a new XP.<br>
<br>
That's my understanding of it. I think it sucks. It could prove a great boost to Mac/Linux sales, if only those communities made the most of it.<br>
Would anyone else object to getting XP under these conditions? If EQ one day required XP to run, would you get XP, or drop EQ? <br>
I sure hope Verant are working on Linux and/or Mac clients for EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sending out information all the time?  It's highly doubtful that they are actual doing this and it is so far unproven.  XP is at least 3 times better then 98SE and I doubt you will ever notice anything that it does if it even does anything at all.  The only bad thing about XP is the passport feature and the fact that you can't uninstall some of the more embedded feature.  You think XP is bad?  Have you ever heard of Echelon?  Ever heard of NSA?  If you haven't, it's the National Security Agency and Echelon is a program that brings ALL email and other information sent out from all computers all over the world.  This means that they see all the emails you send, the IMs you send, and everything else you can think of.  Maybe they are using it now?  You will never know and you will never care, but they say they don't have it activated.  I say you quit whining and get over the fact if you don't do illegal things  you don't have a problem.  Your online information or anything perosnal about yourself has been compramised long ago, and anything you sned out can be read etc and it probably is, so get over it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usograthall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sogra Thall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#778899>(10/3/01 5:41:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Windows XP</span><hr size=1> Orwell ownz !! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#778899>(10/3/01 6:20:12 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/jdwilliams2/data/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Windows XP</span><hr size=1> Who gives a @#%$ about security? I'm talking inconvenience. Yes, I change my hardware quite often. Swap hard drives, video cards, memory, etc etc. And if I have to re-register XP every time I put a new HD in, or reformat it to accomodate Linux/XP/AmigaDE multiboot, it's going to be a pain in the ass. I love the mentality &quot;so long as you don't do anything illegal...&quot; as if only bad people get on the wrong side of the gestapo. What's with the mindset that lets others think for them? It's &quot;illeeeeegal&quot; not to wear a seatbelt, but I refuse to give up that much control of my life to anyone. But I digress.<br>
<br>
I've 3 hard drives in the machine I play EQ in right now. At any time previously, they were scattered among 4 other machines. I've no video card in my EQ machine, and plan on putting one in soon. I also hope to get an entire new system in the near future. I also hope that I'll soon be switching from cable modem to DSL; this means the machine I use as a gateway may go bye-bye, and I'll reconfigure one or more other machines to cover its duties. If I have to check-in with MS every time I do this (especially since some of it will kind of eliminate my internet connection) it's going to be a pain in the ass. ESPECIALLY if I have to reregister or buy a new license. And what happens if it suddenly becomes &quot;illeeeeegal&quot; (according to MS) for me to have other OSes on the same partition or the same machine as Windows?<br>
<br>
They're the one providing the product/service. I'm the one providing the money. They want my money, they do it my way. Of course, that's old-fashioned. Everyone knows that nowadays consumers are just wh0res doing as they're told.<br>
<br>
Bah. Now I'm annoyed. I'm going to go play with some real computers to relax.<br>

My only guess is that they have determined that it is possible to have a completely different computer from another with there being as little as 5 different pieces of hardware comprising the total system.<br>
<br>
Never tested XP..... only use Win2k or WinME and I'll probly be waiting till the L33t H4x0rZ bust up the M$ monopoly before I grab a &quot;copy&quot; of XP.  <br>
<br>
Lakku is right too. M$ isn't looking for an opportunity to screw over the private user.... they would be spending far more than they would make doing that. They screw over 10's of thousands of small to medium sized businesses for the big bucks.<br>
<br>
If you call them and tell them you are making the 5th change to your system they will be glad to help you re-activate I'm sure.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that M$ is a nice company or anything but I'm trying to avoid a paranoia due to a new product.<br>

Edit: Most of the info was for the test ver. of XP. The true release will not be like that. It going to be something like 6 to 8 upgrades before you reregister. Also, video cards, clean installs and someother pieces wont go towards the count. The test ver. sent info to MS to fix problems before it was released. The one coming out should not. <p><b>Kileden Bladeslinger</b>

They include nic card, sound, video, HD, processor serial#, board #, and one or two other things.  Supposedly there are only a couple of pieces that would require you to contact MS.  The nic card and the MB are the ones that I know of.  If you swap you video card and/or sound card or hard drive you woul have no problem and could just reinstall.  <br>
<br>
The problem that I have with XP is the passport garbarge and the fact they are trying to shove more programs that I do not normally install down my throat.   The MSN is one of those things that requires the passport registration.  The more that I read on this subject the further I get from ever purchasing it.  It was bad enough that I had to switch over to explorer after MS killed netscape.<br>
<br>
If you are waiting for the DoJ to force them to remove the other new &quot;features&quot; you will have a very long wait if it does even occur.  MS is not going to be broken up either.  DoJ dropped that option a few months ago in the hope that the case would be settled sooner.<br>
<br>
Win XP could be a good product for the non-power users.  The people who purchase a PC and never crack the case unless TSupport tells them to.  Unless they are privacy buffs then they would be againist XP.  <br>
