Ombres could feel a soothing calm around him.  The world seemed to lose volume leaving only his and Willisa's voice crystal clear to his hearing.<br><br>Willisa bent down and looked straight into Ombre's eyes.  She then glanced up above them and noticed a cut above his left eye that seemed to run up and under his helmet.<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Your looking at my scratch aren't you.  It's what I get for now wearing my helm against a lowly rat.  It took a really good bite out of me.  Damn thing.  Kally hasn't stopped laughing about it yet.&quot;<br><br>Willisa smiled.  She brought her hand up to the wound placing her palm against it.  Little blue shards of light emitted out of her hand.  Ombre's felt something tickle on his forehead.<br><br>Willisa: &quot;There you go.  You should feel a lot better.&quot;<br><br>Ombres raised his hand to his head and could only feel a sudden warmth where his wound once was.<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Thank you whoever you said you were.&quot;<br><br>Willisa knodded in approvement, &quot;You have something for me on your back there.&quot;<br><br>Ombres pointed at the backpack, &quot;This.  Yep!  Its for someone allright.&quot;<br><br>Willisa: &quot;Its from Blackpoint isn't it?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Why, Yes it is.  How did you know?&quot;<br><br>Willisa: &quot;I dont remember how you rogues do it but i think they call me the pickup man.&quot;  Willisa smiled softly.<br><br>Ombres laughed, &quot;Sure!  Sure!  Well, any friend of Blackpoint's is a friend of mine.&quot;<br><br>Ombres removed the pack and handed it over to Willisa.  She placed it on the ground and opened it quickly.  She peered inside and then closed it.<br><br>Willisa: &quot;Thank you young rogue.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;No problem.  The least I could do for our friend Blackpoint.&quot;<br><br>Willisa: &quot;Friend? No no no little one.  I am not her friend.&quot;<br><br>Ombres suddenly had a puzzled look.  He watched as the elf placed the pack over her shoulder and began to walk away.<br><br>Ombres: &quot;If your not her friend then what are you?&quot;<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;What am I?&quot;  Kallypso kicks Ombres in the leg.<br><br>Ombres turns quickly, &quot;No.  Not you.  Her!&quot;  Ombres points in the direction behind him.  He turned his head but no one was there. <br><br>Kallypso: &quot;Who?  I was walking from a distance and could see you talking to yourself.  Are you feeling okay.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;I'm fine.  You don't understand.  I was holding a bag for Blackpoint to give to a friend, or someone,  to pick it up.&quot;<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;What did I tell you about fencing stuff for people again.  That rogue life of yours will be the death of me.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;No no no.  Listen.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien and Kelwin entered the courtyard in front of the bridge in Felwithe.  Cendarien noticed the couple arguing close by.  The slowly made there way to each of them and could hear there arguement clearer with every step.<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;Well my friends, I hope were not interupting anything.&quot;<br><br>Kallypso and Ombres both turned to face Cendarien and Kelwin.  They quickly silenced themselves and turned to face both.<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Hello my friends.  I was wondering if you have seen my wife Belana.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Who?  You cheating on Blackie?&quot;<br><br>Kelwin turned to face Cendarien and could only chuckle.<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Belana is her real name.  Blackpoint is her given name.  Oh, nevermind it would take to long to discuss.  Have you seen her?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Yep!  Just a bit ago actually.  Told me to hold something for a friend and she just came a second ago and took it.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;A friend?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Well.  Thats what I thought anyway.  She left without giving me a clear answer.&quot;<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;You were talking to yourself the whole time honey.  Don't lie to them.  It will only get us into trouble.&quot;<br><br>Ombres scowled at Kallypso, &quot;I am telling the truth.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;I can sense he is not fibbing to us.  What did this friend look like.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Tall.  Elven female.  Wore nothing but a white cloak.  Had the symbol of Tunare on it.  Thats all i remember.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;What was in the backpack?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;I dont know.  Blackpoint told me not to look.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien thought hard.<br><br>Kelwin echoed Cendarien.<br><br>Ombres: &quot;She told me her name but I cant remember it right now.  It eludes me.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;This is very strange Cen.  The white robe he describes is the burial robe for clerics who follow Tunare.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;It can't be Kelwin.  We all watched.  Hell.  I saw it happen.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin turned to Kallypso: &quot;And you didn't see her Kallypso?&quot;<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;Nope.  When i was walking over here it looked like <br>Ombres was talking to himself.&quot;<br><br>Ombres shouted: &quot;Melissa!  Wait.  No, thats not it.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien looked down at Ombres, &quot;Did you say Melissa or Willisa?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Thats it.  What you said.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Which one.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Willisa.&quot;<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Belana walked up to the spires in Greater Faydark.<br><br>Belana: &quot;May i please have an amulet to Luclin?&quot;<br><br>Nexus Scion: &quot;Yes.  May safe travels follow.&quot;<br><br><br>The nexus scion gave Belana an amulet and waved her hands hi into the air.  A blue bolt struck Belana.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>The four stood over Willisa &quot;Whitepoint&quot; Sorrowblade's grave.  Cendarien examined the dirt besides the grave and could not sense anything unusual.<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;Is there something we should know?&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Really.  I'm kind of worried myself.  Is Blacky in trouble?&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;I don't know?&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;The best way to really check is to dig.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;The priests of Felwithe will really love us for that.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;I think they'll understand.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;How's that.  Excuse me priest but I need to dig up my wife's sister's grave to make sure she is still there.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;Well.  Not that way i guess.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;We will have to wait till nightfall.  It isn't far off.  Kally and I will keep watch.&quot;<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;Well, under normal circumstances I would say no to this but if its that important to find out.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;This is ridiculous.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;I've walked this land for a long time.  Nothing surprises me anymore.  Allthough I want her body in this casket as much as you do.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Why's that.&quot;<br><br>Kelwin: &quot;Just an overwhelming bad feeling.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Well.  Lets wait I guess.&quot;<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Belana walked over to the Kunark Scion.<br><br>Belana: &quot;I need you to do me a favor great wizard.&quot;<br><br>Kunark Scion: &quot;What can i do for you child?&quot;<br><br>Belana: &quot;I need you to port me back to Norrath.  But only if it is close to someone specificly.&quot;<br><br>Kunark Scion: &quot;That is within my power.  Who shall I seek.&quot;<br><br>Belana: &quot;Inien Astralwrath.&quot;<br><br>Kunark Scion: &quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br><br>Belana knodded her head.<br><br>Kunark Scion: &quot;Good luck to you then.&quot;<br><br>A blue glow enveloped Belana.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Inien sat under a tree in the Lake of Ill Omen flipping through his spell book.  His familiar Muffin flapped noisely besides him.  He had a small meal sitting in front of him and a pod of water to his left.  Inien brought the pod of water to his mouth and took a long drink.  He sat it back down and stretched against the tree.<br><br>Inien: &quot;You know Muffin.  Its been a long time since I've been able to just sit and relax.&quot;<br><br>Muffin didn't answer.  It just flapped away.<br><br>Inien looked down at his meal and began to eat.<br><br>A blue portal opened in front of him blowing his food to the ground.  His pod of water tipped over spilling its contents.  Inien looked up and saw Blackpoint.<br><br>Inien: &quot;I knew it was to good to be true.&quot;<br><br>Muffin looked at Blackpoint and disappeared.<br><br>Inien: &quot;No.  Now look what you did Blacky.  Muffin disappeared.&quot;<br><br>Belana smiled, &quot;Good.&quot;<br><br>Inien: &quot;Well.  What do you need?  A port?  Some money?  What is it this time?&quot;<br><br>Belana: &quot;I don't know.  I was hoping you would know?&quot;<br><br>Inien: &quot;Whats that?&quot;<br><br>Belana began to tell Inien about the letter.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Ombres: &quot;You better be quick.  The guards keep walking closer and closer.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien and Kelwin moved there shovels faster.  They appreciated elven funerals by not buring the dead so far down.<br><br>Kallypso: &quot;This is so wrong.  I shouldn't be here.&quot;<br><br>Ombres: &quot;Shhh.&quot;<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;There.  Wheres the clasp at?&quot;<br><br>Kelwin reached down to the side and undid a small black clasp.<br><br>Cendarien: &quot;Ready?&quot;<br><br>Kelwin nodded.  He opened the casket not knowing what he would see.<br><br>Ombres left the watch to take a look for himself.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Inien: &quot;Amazing.  But I don't know why I am mentioned on there.&quot;<br><br>Belana: &quot;You don't.  Your the next link to the puzzle.&quot;<br><br>Inien: &quot;I wish I knew how or what.  I have no idea what I am supposed to to tell you.&quot;<br><br>Belana looked puzzled, &quot; I don't understand either.&quot;<br><br>A voice entered Belana's head, &quot;You will soon.&quot;<br><br>Belana: &quot;What?  You say something Inien?&quot;<br><br>Inien: &quot;No.  I was going to ask you the same thing?&quot;<br><br>The voice returned but was close and near, &quot;Soon it will all make sense.&quot;<br><br>The voice came from behind the two.  Belana and Inien turned around to see a tall elven female.  She was dressed in a dwarven chain mail and wore the armor of a cleric.  Her hair was white as snow and she stared deep into the two.<br><br>Belana opened her mouth to speak.<br><br>Inien blinked in disbelief<br><br>~~~~<br><br>Cendarien blicked in disbelief.<br><br>Kelwin and Ombres were speachless also.<br><br>The casket was empty.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>The wind that blew the branches and leaves on the trees in Kunark slowly came to a standstill.  The waters of the Lake of Ill Omen became calm and the windmill slowly came to a stop.  Everything around Belana seemed to freeze in time, including her breathing.   Then instict took over and she inhaled drastically.<br><br>Belana awoke from her moment of imprisonment and took one step forward to the image in front of her.  It resemblance was substantial.  She could barely bring the words off her tongue but somehow, with a hidden strength, she said it.<br><br>Belana: &quot;Sister?&quot;<br><br>The figure in front of her didn't reply.  She kept a soft but cold profile.  A smile slowly crossed her face but as soon as it appeared she blinked unnatuarally.  Her face became pale.<br><br>Belana looked on as she could see the figure was in some sort of pain but as soon as the thought of helping her went through her mind the figure began to deteriorate in front of her.  Her flesh becoming invisible and soon she morphed into nothingness.<br><br>Inien looked over at Belana.  Her eyes were shut and she had brought one hand up to her face.  He could only try to fathom the toll this episode put on her.  She had been through so much in the past months that he was beginning to wonder how long she would be able to hang on.  He wanted to tell Belana that it was her sister.  That she had come back to maybe finally say ther goodbyes ... but something wasn't truely right.  Inien began to run the event through his mind again and again.  His astounding intellect would decipher what was troubling him -- at least he hoped it would.<br><br>Inien walked over to Belana and placed a hand on her shoulder.  He didn't say anything for he knew that nothing could be said to lessen her burden.  She reacted with bringing her free hand up to her shoulder and resting it on Inien's hand.<br><br>Belana sobbed out one word to Inien.  A word that he had not heard that many times from Belana or any other rogue of her kind: &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br><br>~~~~<br><br>After the event a conversation took place between two parties.<br><br>&quot;Is it in motion?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.  It seems it is going to plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about the girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The paladin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She has been dealt with allready.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then I can trust you that the other sister isn't far off from her own defeat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Believe my lord, we will have her in our grasps soon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.  What about the wizard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Were using her right now to get to him.  I believe our newest member has allready found him.  I believe she found him in Kunark.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kunark.  Odd for an Erudite like himself to reside there.  But, no matter.  He must be elimated.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Steps have allready been taken sire.  The wizard and her meddeling husband will not survive the night.  I promise.&quot;<br><br> <p>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue<BR>Rogue of the 38th Dagger<BR>Slayer of Dances with Wurms<BR>"May The Shadow of Sorrow Never Find Your Back"</p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/1/02 8:49:20 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>225</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend" align=absmiddle></a> Email This To a Friend </td><td align=right valign="top"></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#006400><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 width=20%><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newtopic.gif border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a>  </td><td bgcolor=#000000><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a> Topic Commands (Moderator Only)  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to receive email notification of replies  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies </td><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 align=right><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=95% border=0 cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"></td><td align="right" valign="top"><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm20">The Foyer<option value="ebonmoonfrm12">Recruitment - New Members<option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
