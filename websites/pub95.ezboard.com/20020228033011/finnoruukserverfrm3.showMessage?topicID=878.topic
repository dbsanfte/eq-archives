For some, he's always been, for others, he's just appeared at the least opportune time. Stories can be found in Ak Anon claiming that his father was a mage and his mother an enchantress, but who they were and whatever happened to them remains a mystery. Aldrin has a very loose association of friends spanning all of Norrath and its moons which he might consider family, even though some might be considered mortal enemies to each other. Everywhere he goes he finds someone who knows him with affection, probably because he travels widely and likes everyone until they prove themselves unlikable.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Religion:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Aldrin's chosen deity is Solusek Ro, purely for business purposes.

No one knows why he developed his characteristic lisp, but it does cause him exceptional embarassment and he can be brought to tears by those cruel enough to make fun of him for it. <br>Aldrin loves life, and is fascinated by the people he encounters. He doesn't really view anyone as bad, until they try to hurt him or someone he likes. He is indescriminate in this; he's been known to challenge Al Kabor himself over insults directed at a recently acquired friend.<br>Ultimately courageous, Aldrin too often volunteers to take the brunt of damage in  a battle to spare his companions the pain and risk of death that such activities often entail. When a battle goes badly, and evacuation is not an option, he's been known to cast area effect spells or otherwise aggrevate his opponents in an attempt to buy time for his companions to escape or regroup and heal. Rarely does this work. <br>Aldrin's secret dream is to someday become a barbarian, preferably a warrior. He is totally fascinated by the harsh yet compassionate lifestyle forced upon them by their native climate. The sheer size of barbarians might have something to do with it as well. <br>If he can be located nowhere else, he often can be found in Halas, in the dog pens petting and playing with the Barbarian's True Companions.

He left Kelethin upon achieving manhood and joining the Bardic guild, seeking to find knowledge of the events surrounding his family's death.

His mother and father were adventurers before they decided to settle down and start a family together.  They had two children together, Tabbran, and Taurieal.  The boys were born very close together (about 20 years), which is very rare for elf families, but Tabbran's parents saw it as a blessing.  Vigorously overprotective of their sons, the children were destined to follow the life of the merchant, and stay wealthy, than risk the dangers of adventure.  But as is apt to happen to wealthy children who are bored, they begin to get into mischief.  <br><br>One day, Tabbran's mischief took him a bit too far.  He traveled to the highest point in Kelethin, hoping to throw fishing grubs down on the unsuspecting people who are training in the fields below.  But what he accidentally found was the Rogue's guild after a particularly large take.  Obviously not expecting a mischievous young elf to walk right into their business dealings, there was rather loose security, which Tabbran bypassed, or so he thought.<br><br>Taking a bauble or two, and hoping to get away with it, the elfling tried to escape, but was caught red-handed.  Expin, the leader of the Scouts of Tunare had caught him fairly, and dangled the little elf over the edge of the platform.  It was then that a deal was struck between the Scouts and Tabbran, he would become one of them (Expin saw that he had promise) and they would let him live.  It was then that he was inducted as a Martyr of Tunare, the true name that the Scouts held private to themselves.<br><br>He began his training with the Scouts shortly thereafter, and when he felt that he had advanced sufficently in thier ways, he announced to his father that he wished to become an adventurer and go to see the world.  His parents and him fought over this point for hours with neither side gaining any headway, until he played his trump card, and threw down an old, and much used sword, at his father's feet.<br><br>The sword actually belonged to his mother, but the point was delivered.  His parents were adventurers in their past, and forbidding him from seeing the world was simply unfair.  His father conceded the point finally, and gave him reluctant permission to leave and become an adventurer of the lands.  Ever the tagalong, Taurieal wished to follow in his older brother's footsteps.  And the cycle began again.<br><br>Religion:<br><br>There was room only for one Goddess in the Kythrandraal household, and that was Tunare.  Both sons worship the Goddess of Nature, Tabbran particularly so.  Being a Martyr of Tunare holds special meaning to him, and he intends to hold up his end of the bargain that spared his life until the day he can no longer do so.<br><br>Personality:<br><br>Honing his skills to perfection has ever been a priority for Tabbran, he's always seeking to push himself to the next edge, walking the razor thin line that separates success from disaster.  He plays this all off by having a nonchalance about him, a casual uncaring attitude that eases pressure in whatever trouble he got himself into this time.  He's generous with his family, bringing back many treasures obtained on his travelling across the world and moon, and regularly gets into disputes with his father and mother over his chosen profession (They don't care that he's a Rogue, they care that he's an adventuruer).<br><br>Ultimately, Tabbran sees himself as an instrument of his Goddess.  Through and through he is a Martyr of Tunare, he feels that the Martyrs are closer to Tunare than even the Soldiers of Tunare (the Druids), and does the bidding of his Goddess that is best left unspoken. <p><font size=4><font color=666666>T</font><font color=000066>abbran </font><font color=666666>K</font><font color=000066>ythrandraal</font></font><b><HR width=38.5%>           </hr></b><b>Scourge of Oggok</b><BR>Martyr of Tunare, Murderer for the Mother<BR><i>I'm sure I'll find you were as evil as me.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udldragonbreath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dldragonbreath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/5/02 3:02:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Character profiles (not Magelo)</span><hr size=1> Dlmystic Dracobreath or Dragon Lord Mystic Of the house Of Dragonbreath<br>Race: Half elf<br>Age: 500 years Will live till his the Dragons require no more service<br>Alignment: True nuetral<br>Home city: City of Neverwinter In another realm long forgotten<br>Class: Ranger<br><br>-Brief history-<br><br>Family:<br>I had one once my dad a Human ranger.

Her older brother is a Paladin apprenticed in Qeynos.(ooc: a mule Choco made to be precise)  Jolene's war-like abilities made themsleves known at an early age.  She was four years old when she found an old rusty sword lying in the sand.  But before the sword could be taken away from her to avoid injury, that skill made itself known, and very adeptly, impressing her parents.  So, under the cover of darkness, Jolene's parents took her into the warriors guild of Freeport to continue her schooling.  It was with stark clarity that Jolene would not follow her gentle mother in the ways of druid lore, nor in the crusades of her father.  Lenore and Choco set up residence in Freeport, to be near the school.  When Jolene was at an age where she could fend for herself, she set out on her own, forging her own life.<br><br>Religion<br>Rallos Zek<br>It is said that one does not choose their God, but the God chooses you, and Rallos Zek chose Jolene.  Rallos Zek would invade from the dream world, causing Jolene much grief.  How dare a God disturb her slumber!  Sheesh!  But Jolene could not deny she was meant to follow him, as Rallos Zek was obviously impressed enough to come to her in a state more associated with peace.  The only thing that didn't bode well with her was His demands.  Survival of the strong, genocide of the weak.  Being the child of loving parents, she found it hard to swallow those laws.  So, she made her own laws.  She would choose selective genocide as opposed to all and out elimination.  She was not so weak, though, should the opportunity arise where she was required to defend her life.  Was not her fault that some poor slob managed to walk into the point of her sword.  And to complicate matters more, Rallos Zek had decreed that she, a human, would be soulbound to an Ogre.  Why it was done this way, no one knows, nor does Jolene question it.  While she does revel in defying Rallos Zek on occasion, she does have a very healthy respect for his diciplines.  And when she met her destined mate, Gugtukarjunior III, Gug for short, she knew her life was in for a wild ride.<br><br>Personality<br>Jolene lives on the wild side of life.  Even though she had the loving influence of her parents, and a thriving relationship with them, which isn't what most adult children can say about their parents, she considers herself a loner, an outcast, partly because of Gug.  While she loves him more than her own life, and will die for him,  but because he is an Ogre, they are not welcome in most cities.  Jolene counts among her friends the social misfits of society:  Rogues, Necromancers, Shadow Knights, Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, and Iksar.<br><br>Summary of Jolene<br>Independant<br><br><br>/ooc  Sorry for age changes.

At the age of eight, she followed her parents on one of their daily excursions without their knowledge.   Elishia was terrified of the sights and sounds of the forest around her home.  Toxxulia was a dense forest, frequently filled with a foul smelling ever present green haze.  The source of this haze remains unknown, which suits the Erudites just nicely, since the choking gas forces possible pilgrims to leave instead of settle on Odus.  As Elishia entered a secret cave, the sounds of screams, screams of those in pain, and dying.  It was made painfully aware to her she stumbled upon a city controlled by the Heretics she heard some residents in Erudin talk about, as she watched in horror as her parents walked by with skeletal slaves behind them.  Upon her discovery, she fled for her life, back to the safety of Erudin, and collapsed on the steps of the Temple of Quellious.<br><br>Religion<br>Quellious<br>Since she embraced no God, the Clerics and Paladins schooled her.  She had a natural gift of life, as Quellious had seen it and had led her to them, just as Quellious said would happen.  Elishia seemed to be under the personal protection of the Tranquil One.  Elishia trained and studied hard, and was embraced as a Holy Crusader for Quellious.  But, eventually, Elishia was forced to flee her only home, her Sanctuary, since it was not safe as long as her parents were alive.  So, under the darkness of night, at the tender age of seventeen, she sailed eastward, toward Qeynos.  And there, her life would change yet again.<br><br>Personality<br>Elishia is a gentle soul, prefering conversation over conflict.  However, she is not so passive to let a deadly threat against her life go unanswered.  She has but one mission in life, and that is to eliminate the evil of her parents, no matter the cost.  And she is not alone in her quest.  When she arrived in Qeynos,  she met a man schooled in the healing magics.  Heili was a Cleric, serving under Karana.  The two formed a bond, in which the shy Elishia thrived on his love and constant attention.  In turn, her quiet manner soothed his tortured soul, as he was an orphan since bandits murdered his parents.  Only him and his older brother, Choco, survived that attack.  <br><br>Summary of Elishia<br>Shy, yet strong<br><br><br><br>/ooc  sorry for changing the age of Elishia.

Her parents thinking was, start them young enough and they will serve well.  She studied continually, and was frequently drilled by her father to repeat her lessons nightly to ensure she was comprehending.  At the age of seven, she overheard her parents talking about some girl named Elishia.  Zianya learned that this Elishia was her older sister, but she turned her back on her family and became the mortal enemy of all heretics.  A Paladin.  Zianya vowed to seek out her errant sister and return her back to her heritage, or end her life if she refused.  And Zianya intensified her schooling, burning into her mind a hatred for a sister she never knew, and destory her before she destroyed them.<br><br>Religion<br>Cazic Thule<br>While it is said most reptilian races worship the Faceless One, many people of the dark arts of the dead worship him for the reasons that he invokes the fear that keep Necromancers and Shadow Knights alive.  By feeding on the fear of enemies, the Heretic grows stronger.  And Zianya is no exception.  So, when Zianya was seventeen, she left Paineel to begin her quest to eradicate her sister.  Eventually, her quest led her to Freeport, the last known whereabouts of her sister.  There, she met a man, a brother of the arts, and a fellow Erudian.  Her future husband.  His name was Madnbad.  The two formed a bond unique to the human race, shunned by other races, primarliy the Teir'Dal, as Love was weak, and for the weak, and Hatred was the only way to live, as Innoruuk was supreme.<br><br>Personality<br>Zianya is often a uncertain individual, hiding behind the mask of independence, often coming across to people as haughty and superior because of her race.  The truth is, she is very uncertain of her abilities, and became uncertain about her quest.  As time went on, she discovered hidden away memories and conflicting stories, as she finally met up with her sister, Elishia.  And that meeting was not a cry for her sister's blood, but a desire to know the truth.  And that stark truth was that both girls were but pawns to a pair of people too cowardly to do their own duties befitting their station in life.  And that day, Zianya grew up quickly.  She formed a strong bond with her sister, and together, were able to vanquish the lies and treachery of their parents.  While the victory was sweet for Zianya, it was bitter for her gentle sister.  In an effort to help her sister cope, in a way uncommon to a child of darkness, she told Elishia to look at it as a cleansing, sanctioned in the name of Quellious.  It worked.<br><br>Summary of Zianya<br>Strong, yet quietly supportive of common goals<br><br><br>/ooc Again sorry to change the age of Zianya.  Same reasons as stated above.  Zianya has aged a few years since &quot;Bloodlines&quot; was written. <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A> at: 1/7/02 10:55:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ujustallyssia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Allyssia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ichuu.com/anicat.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/7/02 8:37:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/amazonally.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Character profiles (not Magelo)</span><hr size=1> Hehe this is real interesting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Almost should be on the RP forum.
