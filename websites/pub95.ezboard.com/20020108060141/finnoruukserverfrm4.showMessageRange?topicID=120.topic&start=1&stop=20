Now, guild representation at Summits is easy - each guild sends a representative to the Summit.  This representative is chosen by that guild's leadership.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as I can tell, the representative for unguilded folks is self-elected.  Seems there are currently two folks that claim to represent the unguilded, Rumenia and Aldrin.  Neither seem to agree with one another and many unguilded folks that reply to the various threads don't always seem to agree with them.<br>
<br>
The problem here is that anyone could claim to be a representative of the unguilded.  I could get another EZboard login and claim to be a concerned unguilded person, with the intention of stacking the vote.  There is also the problem that self-appointed representatives don't really represent anyone.<br>
<br>
Here is my proposal for adding language to the Summit to cover WHO can represent the unguilded for the purpose of Summit meetings and votes.  I've left some language intentionally vague for Wolfypaw (or whomever) to clean up.  I chose 18 members because that's the minimum for a guild to currently book a plane.<br>
<br>
--- Language begin ---<br>
<br>
The unguilded may send one voting representative to a Summit for every 18 people that have signed a petition authorizing this representative to represent them (probably use a EZboard thread and someone to validate that someone is in fact unguilded in-game).  This petition needs to name the person being represented and the characters listed have to be unique to a PERSON (no multiple accounts or multiple characters).<br>
<br>
--- Language end ---<br>
<br>
Folks, this is a proposal.  This is to add accountability and to ensure that the person voting on behalf of the unguilded is actually representing a real group of unguilded folks.  Please feel free to suggest alternate text.<br>
<br>
Aldrin, Rumenia - this isn't a personal attack, though it may seem like it.  I just think that whoever is representing the interests of unguilded folks actually needs to have some credibility.  As a somewhat infrequent reader of these boards, I honestly couldn't tell a valid speaker from a kook.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

It's unlikely you'll get a server-wide vote among the unguilded. In any reasonable timeframe, that is.<br>
<br>
You make 2 mistakes in your post, however. First, unguilded representation was not selected. Second, I claimED to represent the unguilded at the meeting. If it has not been made clear in my other posts, I no longer represent anyone but myself.<br>
<br>
Note also that there's not uniformity of opinion among the members of a guild. I suggest it would be a mistake to conclude that there is no set of interests shared by all unguilded, simply because there's not uniformity of opinion among the unguilded.<br>

I was reading some of what was being said over my fiance's shoulder while it was going.<br>
<br>
Its difficult, and I was in no way in envy of what they had to do.<br>
<br>
They do what they can. It might not be satisfactory to everyone, as all have their own opinions, but they do attempt to make it as fair as they possibly could (again, unsat to some people).<br>
<br>
I'm glad that they're doing another Summit soon as well, as it will continue to grow on what has been made thus far, and try to fix some of its shortcomings.<br>
<br>
I'm just hoping that people will realize that with this summit, no one is trying to screw over another.<br>

However, I would really prefer that any suggestions they may have should be posted on the boards first, with plenty of opportunity for feedback.  Then at the meeting, if they want to bring up &quot;I suggested this&quot;, they should understand that people will probably already have formed opinions, and trying to cram a discussion down our throats is inappropriate.<br>
<br>
Every decision made on Saturday had received plenty of previous discussion, giving people time to think about how they feel.<br>
<br>
I had some difficulty preventing another FFA is better / scheduled is better discussion Saturday.  There were a few people who don't read the boards who better understood the issues afterwards, but most of the people there already knew how they felt, and you weren't going to change their minds.<br>
<br>
With that many people there, it's too late to try to convince people about something they really don't like.<br>
<br>
In any case, I like Bonestriker's idea -- if it comes down to a voting issue.<br>

Honestly I hope there is no summit IV anytime soon, but when there is, requiring the unguilded 'representatives' to have support amongst the unguilded would probably make things much more organized.<br>
Guilds pick their representatives, someone who will put forth the overall opinions of their guild (not the individuals, the guild as a whole, which all the guild members should of course support). The unguilded unfortunately lack this representation, and because of this nobody knows if the 'unguilded representative' puts forth any opinion but his/her own.<br>

It seems silly to me that if you can get 18 people to sign a petition to elect a representative, why not get those same 18 people to create a guild called something like &quot;Independent Explorers&quot; for full representation and not requiring someone to log in the game to verify the vote?

If they want to have their say, then they're entitled to have it.<br>
<br>
However, having you say does not give you the right to willfully destroy any attempts at conversation that do not immediately suit your goals. That's not discussion. It's blatant contrariness and it is a symbol of an at once great and vast immaturity.<br>
<br>
Act like reasonable adults and you'll be treated as such. Simple as that. <p><center><img src="http://www.fnurt.net/~buckethead/lhilesig.jpg" align=middle></center>

And I am sure they appreciate your condescension.  Funny thing, I talk to unguilded people alot too, but most of the ones I talk to have the skills and character of giants.<br>
<br>
As I said elsewhere, I think requiring people to publicly demonstrate that they want to be represented somewhere is a fine idea.<br>
