Greg never did like singing. Neither did he like the stuffy suit he had to wear to a place he didn't want to go; especially when there were still cartoons to watch!<br>
<br>
Damn those Sunday school teachers for stealing his Spongebob!!<br>
<br>
Greg was a 7 year old little boy with reddish brown hair. His eyes were green, and he spoke with an Irish accent. People were always asking him if he knew where the sacremental wine was ever since his parents started coming to this church; he'd seen Pastor Freemonty drinking from big bottles, but he didn't know what, so he just shook his head no.<br>
<br>
The chimes rang, and it was time for church. Greg's stomach started to turn over in his tummy- it was almost time. He'd have to sing with his horrible voice in front of the entire church... again! The last time, he'd wet his pants and squeeked, so everyone turned and looked at him. His parents hid their eyes. Everyone started laughing. Even Pastor Freemonty made a joke. He knew they weren't being mean, nobody in a church could be mean. Good Christians just weren't mean.<br>
<br>
But it didn't matter. The other boys teased him, and the girls ran away when he tried to say hi. Nobody liked him.<br>
<br>
The time had come. Walking next to the girls with pretty pastel dresses and the boys with black or brown suits, Greg felt so very out of place. When he missed a step, almost the entire children's choir fanned out around him, fearing to get close to the pants-wetter; after all, &quot;it was the devil made him do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
They filed in to the cathedral one by one, with the youngest children in front, and the oldest in back. He was up near the front. Greg finally made his way up and fell in line, just where he was supposed to stand. Someone else didn't want to stand next to him, so the brown-haired boy started making a fuss with the girl next to him. After a minute of back-and-forth squabbling, the teacher smacked them both on the shoulder and turned to the congregation.<br>
<br>
Greg could feel his suit heating. The lights and the candles and the early morning light were almost too much to bear; he couldn't even hear what the teacher was saying. He couldn't even remember her name. Worst of all, he couldn't remember his letter...<br>
<br>
The group started to sing. Greg mouthed along as best he could, and tried not to make a sound. When the kids in the front row, which included himself, started to chant out &quot;C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N&quot; from the song, he forgot his letter. What he also forgot was that he was just supposed to say, &quot;DOT the I!&quot; after the line was done, not any letters. When a little girl up front struggled with her S, he ran out of the cathedral, screaming. The piano stopped, and the organ player chuckled. Most of the &quot;refined people&quot; of the church held back chuckles or snickers, and Greg's parents averted their eyes again.<br>
<br>
Not a word was said the entire ride home. They all piled in to the red minivan, and Greg's beautiful, blonde haired mother looked as pissed as ever. His father, where he got his Irish traits from, was more or less indifferent, and was driving calmly. &quot;So, lad,&quot; he finally asked. &quot;What happened up there? Just couldn't take the pressure?&quot;<br>
<br>
Greg looked down at the seat and sat in silence. His father huffed, and shook his head. Greg's stomach was spinning so fast he thought he was going to throw up. Then, all of a sudden...<br>
<br>
He did.<br>
<br>
All over the back of his mother's seat, by the time they were in the driveway, was green and yellow puss dripping down, and he was vomitting more on the floor. He lurched his head back, and then down to release more of the toxic-smelling stomach fuel.<br>
<br>
Greg's mother was screaming since the second it happened. She was infuriated. Ripping him from the seat, without even unbuckling the seat belt, she carried him inside. Slamming things around in the kitchen cabinet, she found a few rags and a bottle of carpet cleaner. She pointed to the door, her face beat red, and screamed, &quot;OUT!&quot;<br>
<br>
His tears were flowing readily now. He couldn't control them; he just cried. He sat next to the open car door and the stench of his own vomit while he cried and cried. He was tired from the night before, and eventually cried himself to sleep, and layed his head on the gravelly driveway.<br>
<br>
About three hours later, he was pulled up by his now filthy suit by a pair of red nails, and was held up to a beautiful, yet terrifying, face. She screamed so loudly that Greg's ears rang, and he couldn't even make out anything else she said. Her lips moved quicker than snakes' tongues, but he couldn't hear a sound. He looked around and noticed that his father's red pickup was gone; he'd gone out for a while, and Greg knew what that means...<br>
<br>
Belts.<br>
<br>
Being dragged in by the back of his collar, Greg started screaming again. He was so deathly afraid of the belts. He didn't want to get beaten again. He barely had time to heal from the last set of lashes. &quot;-and now it'll be stained FOREVER! All because of YYYOU! YOU and your STUPID WHINING, AND BEGGING, AND TEARS, AND YOUR GOD DAMNED PUKE!&quot; When he heard what his mother was saying, that made Greg cry all that much harder.<br>
<br>
His mother finally set Greg down on the counter, with his legs hanging off the side. She undid his pants, and took off his shirt and coat while he fought her. Try as he might, Greg just wasn't as strong as his mother. She layed him across the counter, and grabbed a nearby belt of his father's. She whacked him across the back with force he'd never felt before- he realized she wasn't holding back.<br>
<br>
Greg's screams came, and continued for the half hour that he was beaten. Eventually, she dropped the belt, and scratched savagely at his back with her fake nails. When she broke a nail, she cursed him, spat on him, and proceeded to belt him on the cuts. Eventually, she tired herself out. Panting, her blonde hair was in a friz. She took out the clips and let her hair down. The despicable bitch bent down to pick up her little boy from the counter, and she set him on his feet.<br>
<br>
Greg stood on wobbly, weakened feet. He could harldy stand, and so leaned against his mother. She put her hands on his back and hugged him, crying softly on his tiny shoulder. &quot;Greg... ::sobsob, boo-mother fuckin-hoo:: I love you... SO much...&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, something clicked in his head. Daddy never did this. Nor did Daddy ever say he loved him. If this was love... then Daddy didn't love him. But he loved his mommy, just as Mommy loved him. He loved her, too. He just had to show her...<br>
<br>
Reaching his tiny hand upwards, Greg caught the handle of a butcher knife that had been sitting on the counter; she threatened to use it on him if he broke another of her nails. Greg brought the blade down closer to his mother, and put the other arm around the back of her neck. He loved her more.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Mommy,&quot; he whispered. As the blade plunged its way between two ribs, a lung was pierced. She gasped, and blood poured from her loving, caring mouth. &quot;I love *yoou*.&quot; Greg let her slide to the floor, and felt searing pain shoot up in his back. That's where it came from, *that* was her love. He felt her love, and decided to return it while she lay gasping and coughing on the floor. She rolled over, and Greg sat atop her, still naked, and brandishing the knife. His normally soft green eyes had a deadly gleam to them. &quot;I love YOU, Mommy!&quot; He undid her button-down white shirt with the knife, and in the process cut vertically down from her breastbone to her navel, more or less (Give him a break, he's a kid- he don't know about precision yet!). He batted off her now feeble arms, lopping off a finger in the process.<br>
<br>
Greg opened her shirt, and saw her exposed breasts once again. He used to be fed by these. This was how she kept him alive. This was how she loved him.<br>
<br>
Well, he loved her, too!<br>
<br>
The seven-year old boy, with his mother frothing blood from her mouth, proceeded to dig his butcher knife into her left breast, and dug out fleshy material. He put it between his fingers, and had to stab her arm before she was too exhausted to fight anymore. Intersting... so *that's* what's beneath a woman's skin. He lopped off the right, and made the same assumption. Just before her eyes rolled back into her head, Greg dug his knife deep into her stomach, and stuck his hand inside. Hmmm.... this was different... Well, Greg always *was* a curious boy... Mommy had loved him many times for that. I bet she loved that he was being curious with her, now!<br>
<br>
After his examination of the human body, he heard a car pull into the driveway. Daddy's home!<br>
<br>
Wait... Daddy didn't love us, Greg. He never did, and he won't! He'll never love us!<br>
<br>
What do we do?<br>
<br>
We need to show that *we* love *him*!<br>
<br>
Greg grinned happily, and ran the butcher knife under the sink. Right. We'll love Daddy, just like we loved Mommy! *That*'ll teach him! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8>Stories by:  Mindles Kali</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
