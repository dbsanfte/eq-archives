Chapter 3<br>
<br>
&quot;The Burning Sword, A Demon's Rage.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus banged a metal pan against the bars of his cell, he couldn't believe it. The wench had picked him out of a line up and worse yet, he was looking at a sentence of life imprisonment or death at the worst. He could only hope the judges ruling would be different than those two choices tomorrow. At least he didn't have a cell mate to deal with. It didn't take long though for the guards to come to his cell and shove him back from the bars.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have visitors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both his grandparents and Kayla had come to see him, of the three though his grandfather was acting odd, he had a smile on his face. The kind that could give anyone the creeps, even the lowest of creatures seemed to sense something as the rats, of two legs and of four scurried further away from them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well looks like you've gotten yourself into some real trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'll be in trouble when he gets out.&quot;, Kayla mumbled, she was still upset at him from before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for the vote of confidence.&quot;, Magus grumbled, he hated this.<br>
<br>
Of course his lowered spirits changed when his father pulled out the very sword hilt he had used in battle. It looked the same, except it didn't seem as old in some way, almost as if it just forged recently. Certainly this was something new to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your father has one similar to this, as does another along with myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Magus visitors left, and soon enough the torches where put out. For some reason Magus felt at home in the darkness or in the light. Oddly enough he could see everything perfectly which gave the guards the creeps because no pure blooded human was suppose to have perfect night vision. The young man's peace and quiet was interrupted as the sword finally decided to introduce it.<br>
<br>
- The names Matsume, you even wake there? -<br>
<br>
- Wonderful, a talking piece of junk -<br>
<br>
- Well aren't you optimistic, and I'm not a piece of junk -<br>
<br>
Magus definitely hated all that had happened to him, of course what was he to do? Well at least the sword itself seemed to hold some promise. It was keeping the rats away as well as anything else in the darkness. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts about what were going to happen to him the next day he didn't notice some small figure was unlocking the door to his cell.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Cain could do was chuckle as he walked away from the jail area. Sure he had caught some heat about what all Magus had done. However, after he'd explained just what he was doing both the young lady Bayle and her father understood. Still telling the royalty that this young man was his great grandson wasn't exactly what he had planned, but things where still turning out wonderful.<br>
<br>
&quot;So my little friend, are you learning more about this world?&quot;<br>
<br>
He had been carrying the crystal that he himself had created in his laboratory around with him all day. It was his theory that the more it could understand of this world the better it could express itself. Deep down the old man realized that this crystal would serve his great grandson, and his further descendants well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Through out the castle things seemed quiet, all the royalty where asleep and things seemed to be settling down after the fiasco several days ago from Magus. This was the perfect time for the assassin to strike, or so he thought. His first objective was to kill the Bayle family, the second was to destroy the being his employer's termed &quot;The Spirit Master&quot;. This unfortunately was one of his better jobs he thought.<br>
<br>
He thought it was odd though, why was a simple human they called a Spirit Master so feared. He himself thought of humans as inferior, at least this was his common belief since it was so easy for him to sneak past the guards.<br>
<br>
Certainly his employer could come up with someone else to do the job just as easily, after all they weren't easily detected. However, he knew that using a hired assassin would better blend in with all that was intended. Still he was puzzled why he was chosen, after all there where far better qualified and more experienced rogues that himself about.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus simply yawned and leaned against his cell door, for now Matsume was quiet. At least the sword gave him some comfort since after all he was in the holding area beneath the very same place he had snuck into not long ago. It surprised him that they still considered using such an old jail area, but if even he wasn't able to pick the lock then it must of meant it was still as useful as the day it was constructed.<br>
<br>
Earlier it hadn't taken long at all for Magus to determine that the locks where tinkered by gnomes. Against normal locks he was a master, but against such gnomish devices he simply didn't have a clue. He still couldn't figure out how his father could unlock them as he had seen him do in the past. <br>
<br>
&quot;What in th.......&quot;<br>
<br>
- Serves you right for calling me a piece of junk. -<br>
<br>
Magus had put his full weight on the door and fell flat on his back when the door opened. Common sense told him that escaping would just get him into deeper trouble if he was caught. On the other hand, he thought it wouldn't hurt to look around just as long as he made it back to his cell without getting caught. It didn't take long for him to make up his mind and he was gone, creeping through the shadows of the castle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kayla laughed to herself as she slipped through the shadows of the castle. If she couldn't get Magus back then the least she could do was torment him while he was in his cell, not to mention her curiosity of the world was getting the best of her. This world was far to wondrous than what she remembered from the past. <br>
<br>
However, Kayla could sense something was not right in the castle, like a strange presence had invaded the very essence of the building itself. Still she was more curious about the events going on in the castle as she faded through the walls. Every so often she would spot something out of the corner of her eyes in the shadows, for the most part all she could make out where patrolling guards as she neared the cell where Magus was being kept.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's gone....&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla was definitely intrigued now, not only by the fact that Magus was no longer in his cell, but to where he could be heading. A smile crept across her face as an idea dawned on her. It was now obvious to her exactly where Magus was going, he was heading up to the young lady Bayle's room. So that is exactly where she began to slip off to herself. Little did she realize a surprise was laying in wait for both herself, and the young lady.<br>
<br>
<br>
Without hesitation or fear the assassin began to strike down the guards, he always liked this part, it was so fun for him to knock the guards unconscious. After all they would live to be punished for not doing their jobs better. To him this was simple child's play, they never seen him come out or return to the shadows as he made his way to the first room.<br>
<br>
His plan was simple, first he would kill the young girl, then while the remaining guards found their fellow guards unconscious he could use the resulting confusion to sneak past the more adept guards at the master bedroom. This was a tried and true plan, at least he thought so until he seen a woman come out of the shadows near the young girls door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wonderful....&quot;<br>
<br>
This was definitely an unexpected flaw in his plan, he hadn't been told of any extra guard at the young girls door. He silently cursed himself for not pumping his sources for more information, to make matters worse instead of leaving the woman was leaning up against the door frame. It became obvious he was going to have to at least paralyze her, or at the worst add another victim to his night of blood shed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on Magus.... Where are you hiding.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla thought for sure she could find Magus at the young ladies room. She couldn't believe she could be wrong, or maybe she had simply arrived before he did. She was certain one of the shadows she had seen before was Magus's.<br>
<br>
In fact she was so wrapped up in her thoughts she didn't notice the figure out of the corner of her eye. Though she did notice the glimmer of cold steel as it traveled through the air and lodged itself firmly in her side. It didn't take long for her to slide down to the floor as her world began to go dim, then shift to complete darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
As typical Magus's stomach had lead him to the pantry, and it didn't take him long to find him something quick to eat before he was back to wandering around the castle. He figured if he was going to be out and about at least he should get one last good meal before the book was thrown at him the coming day.<br>
<br>
Something bothered him though, the castle was unusually quiet, like the guards where all gone or at least off somewhere sleeping. He smiled as he remembered that quite a few times he had run across a sleeping or half asleep guard. Those where fond memories he had of when his father trained him in the arts of stealth, and a couple times he had put the skills to good use as a peeping tom. <br>
<br>
Magus soon set his thoughts aside as he came across an unconscious guard, and then another. It became obvious that some intruder was in the castle as he followed the trail fallen guards to an all to familiar area of the castle. Soon he found himself just around the corner from the young lady Bayle's room.<br>
<br>
<br>
With all the stealth and cunning that he had been hired for the assassin had quickly picked the lock to the young girl's room and had slipped inside. Of course to his dismay he heard footsteps down the hallway. Had he been careless and missed a guard like the one he had just dispatched?<br>
<br>
The assassin simply shook his head, he couldn't of missed a guard. No one had ever escaped his detection before. He was the absolute best at doing this, no one had even seen him before on his many jobs. Which was glad for since it was the only reason there wasn't a price on his head.<br>
<br>
The fun was just beginning for him though as he again heard someone moving around outside the room, which made him pause for a moment. It was definitely someone even if it wasn't a guard. This was going to make the job a little more interesting for him he thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
Something happened to Magus as he rounded the corner and seen Kayla slouched against the wall near the cracked open door. He knew what this meant as he slowly kneeled down beside Kayla. He could tell she was still alive by her breathing. He wondered why she was here in all places and then it dawned on him. Perhaps she had came back to.....<br>
<br>
Magus quickly dashed those thoughts aside as he stood up, they didn't matter because it was evident to him everything was now his fault. His actions had caused all the events to unfold causing everyone around him to be hurt in some form or other. At least now if he wasn't to late he could repent for at least some of it and save himself in the process as he pushed open the door.<br>
<br>
A cold chill ran down his spine as he watched the figure poised near the young girl, and then it was replaced with something that wasn't fear. Something he couldn't describe, but compelled him to take a step forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;So I did miss a guard, I must be getting sloppy...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't even move...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh you plan on doing something to me when your so far away?&quot;<br>
<br>
A smile once again crept across the assassins face has he turned to face Magus. This was perfect, he could kill all his targets easily he thought, and escape before anyone became obvious. He couldn't of even planned something so perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know boy, your going to die tonight, you'll end up just like this young girl here, and maybe her friend outside.&quot;, the assassin chuckled.<br>
<br>
It was always a favorite ploy of his, he would first anger someone so they would make the first move. That way he always managed to get in his fatal blows, and leave before he was noticed. Just as he predicted Magus moved forward to strike, only this time his strike with the dagger missed. Somehow, though he couldn't explain it, he had missed, which resulted in him striking out with his fist. <br>
<br>
Magus hit the ground hard, he considered himself lucky to have dodged the dagger, but the punch left him dazed and his mind clouded. How could he be so helpless, to let this happen to himself and the people here this night. It was then he wished for some kind of force to help him, he wished for the power to save not only himself, but Kayla and the the innocent girl who lay sleeping in the room.<br>
<br>
- Well your a rather sad sight, I was sure you where stronger than this! -<br>
<br>
- What do you know? Your just a piece of junk! -<br>
<br>
- If you want to win just let your mind go. -<br>
<br>
- Fine, whatever, if I live through this I'll melt you down for scrap though... -<br>
<br>
Magus thought he had nothing else to lose as he let his mind calm, it was then that he felt a pulling sensation, as if something was pulling at his soul. Whatever it was felt cold, angry, and enraged. Somehow it was similar yet more intense than what he felt before.<br>
<br>
This was far to easy, or at least the assassin thought as his attention was drawn back to the girl who was in a deep sleep in her bed. However, this was a mistake, as he hadn't noticed the hilt tucked under Magus's belt sparkle for a brief instance. Nevertheless he made his move as he drove his dagger down towards the girl's heart, only to find it had been stopped by some force. Fear raced though his heart as he glanced down and seen the cause of it.<br>
<br>
Magus was holding up a single glowing crimson hand, and there was a defined red glow in the centers of his eyes. Whatever this was, it was something that was definitely helping him. With a swift move of Magus's hand the assassin found himself flung back through the doorway and sprawled across the floor in the hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;So this is why they wanted you dead, your going to pay for that!&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly Magus stood to his feet, then he heard a scream as the sleeping girl had awakened to the scene before them. It didn't matter though, Magus was now letting his anger control his actions as he watched the assassin stand and rush toward him with his dagger.<br>
<br>
Several guards came rushing down the hall as they heard the scream, what they found before them went far beyond what they believed possible. They could only see a blur of movements as what appeared to be two people fought.<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks like you will be paying instead of me!&quot;<br>
<br>
The assassin soon found a punch planted across his stomach, which flung him back into the hall and up against the wall with enough force to leave the guards in awe. It was far from over though for the poor soul as once again Magus was on the assault, this time forcing them both out the window down the hallway and into the open yard outside.<br>
<br>
Needless to say this was a surprise to the guards outside as they seen two people land on the ground in front of them, and then begin to fight as if they where in a bar room brawl. They could only describe the one person being a demon from the savage way he attacked and the way he moved.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before the ground below was drenched in the assassins blood, and many of the guards still wondered how he could still be alive from the punishment they seen him take. Then they seen something most would never forget as Magus crossed his forearms and an incandescent crimson light surrounded his body.<br>
<br>
In Magus's mind he could seen what he was about to do perfectly, it felt so natural, as if he had seen or done this many times before. Just before he was about to part his arms the Matsume once again spoke to him.<br>
<br>
- You can't do this here! Think of all the people you'll destroy! -<br>
<br>
- Shut up! They all deserve this! -<br>
<br>
- Do they really deserve to die? -<br>
<br>
The Matsume's words had a somewhat sobering effect on Magus, causing the glow to fade away slowly. Still his anger made his blood boil, he had to do something to make this man pay for doing this to him. It was then that Magus thrust a single hand forward, in it was the Matsume.<br>
<br>
Night soon became as bright as day as a brilliant field of light engulfed the yard, finally when the light faded Magus was simply standing, silent. However, the would be assassin was barely clinging to life. His body had been bombarded by what looked like strikes from a flaming sword....<br>
