I felt it necassary too respond too this flame about the guild in which I am proud too be a member. I would first of all like too say that the post made by Vaeluudar was made after his removal from finite for cowardice actions in the heat of battle. I would like too just take a moment too clarify some of the things that he posted recently on on this esteemed website. I feel it wrong for somone who has recieved so many benefits from our guild and yet contributed so little too be so upset at us. Vaeluudar came too finite as my friend looking too join a guild. I feel bad at having too remove him but we cannot have people gating out of raids and logging with no explanation of why as we have a wipeout or a tough battle. Cowardice is not something we tolerate. Secondly I notice him trying too bring up personal issues with the guild and pubicly announce them. I feel bad that this has too be the case since people are after all people and all have there personal lives.

I was out of town visiting my grandfather who had taken ill and had an automobile problem which prevented my return for some time. I apologized too my guild apon my return and continued too uphold my post that I was assigned. As far as his rants about the major CR that finite had in the plane of growth a few weeks ago. I can only say that apon agroing tunare the guild that did so ccompletely destroyed our raid and all the mobs were agro into the zone walls making cr impossible for the evening. After several attempts at it we gave up and decided too do so the next morning when situations would be more stable which we did so succcessfully with 2 people completely cring the entire guild and not leaving one person stranded. As far as my personal habbits go I dont feel they are in any way relevant too my abilities too do things for my guild and I feel that it is a petty attempt too demoralize my character in anger at being removed from the guild. I am sorry if I am not a saint but I dont feel that any of us are.

I would first of all like too say that the post made by Vaeluudar was made after his removal from finite for cowardice actions in the heat of battle. I would like too just take a moment too clarify some of the things that he posted recently on on this esteemed website. I feel it wrong for somone who has recieved so many benefits from our guild and yet contributed so little too be so upset at us. Vaeluudar came too finite as my friend looking too join a guild. I feel bad at having too remove him but we cannot have people gating out of raids and logging with no explanation of why as we have a wipeout or a tough battle. Cowardice is not something we tolerate. Secondly I notice him trying too bring up personal issues with the guild and pubicly announce them. I feel bad that this has too be the case since people are after all people and all have there personal lives. I will not advertise anything I know personally about Vael because I feel that I am above such rhetoric. However I will adress my &quot;dissapearance&quot; when our guild leader was unable too sustain internet connection for a short period of time. I was out of town visiting my grandfather who had taken ill and had an automobile problem which prevented my return for some time. I apologized too my guild apon my return and continued too uphold my post that I was assigned. As far as his rants about the major CR that finite had in the plane of growth a few weeks ago. I can only say that apon agroing tunare the guild that did so ccompletely destroyed our raid and all the mobs were agro into the zone walls making cr impossible for the evening.
