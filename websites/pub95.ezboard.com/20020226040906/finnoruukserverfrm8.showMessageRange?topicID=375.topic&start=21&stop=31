Too bad that gif has been used, and re-used, on these boards before. And jeesh, kid, looks like you've used it multiple times. You must have found it one day, while looking up man pr0n, and got infatuated with it. So your hero is Erica Estrada, eh? It has to be since you've spammed other boards with that image. No, wait. Don't tell me. You must have used that image and set it up as your background so you can sigh at it daily.<br>
<br>
In the end, I guess you must've thought that you were bright, witty, and original. But you were probably told as a kid that you were 'special' too~! And later in life, I guess you will believe that size doesn't matter, and it happens to 'every guy'.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should get a cupcake to show you how bright you are? Noooo, I said cupcake, not a goat ass @#%$. Nah, you'd probably enjoy that and add it to your extreme alternative lifestyle memoirs.<br>
<br>
Since you want to try and use an image thats been swimming around the net for awhile, here's one for ya. And @#%$, its even copyrighted~!<br>

LOL. Course I have used it multiple times. It's a perfect description of people who meet your stature and stoop to the use of pathetic flames. IE: It refers to someone who is anal retentive very much like yourself. <br>
<br>
As for the rest of that weak ass flame. Lets see.. &quot;kid&quot; Is this your way of saying that your obvious age and pathetic life are far superior to mine?<br>
<br>
Where I found it. Hi Dumbass I found it on the message board you ignorant inbreed. Isn't this comment a contradiction of your first sentence? Next time think before you respond It helps if you use your 22 IQ.<br>
<br>
Doh! you found me out on where I store my super sexy and super cool Eric Estrada picture. YOUR RIGHT! its right on my desktop.... Though I don't keep it there to drool and stare at.. It's there for a quick right click / insert into posts for People who haven't moved up the evolutionary ladder yet like yourself. (refer to the 22 IQ)<br>

<br>
I don't Think I'm bright witty and Original I was just speaking my mind. However your response that was done in haste and not very well thought out gives me the chance to look &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;original&quot;. <br>
<br>
In the first paragraph you called me a Kid, Next paragraph you state when I was a kid. past tense vs present tense? That is a contradiction. Damn you really need to think before you post generic flames and make yourself look bad.. Damn I don't even have to respond to this and you already look like a moron, However I will anyway so your friends can grasp the concept of just how much of an Idiot you really are vice how you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> try</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to play off being intelligent. <br>
<br>
Ahh when later in life comes on boy how I cant wait to go Limp and not perform! I take it you have a general understanding and have come to grips with this through personal experience? You seam to have a firm grasp on what I will be told later on in life when I reach your oh so wise and old age of what 15? At least that is how you come off in your unintelligent post.  <br>

Hostess Cupcakes are good I wont dispute that with you. However I don't think we are here to debate favorite snack foods. But It's really disturbing to me how you think up these really horrible flames like referring to a goats ass from a cupcake. It's just really hard NOT to think you have a realm of expertise in these areas with comments like this. As far as my Extreme Fetish lifestyles.. I won't deny any form of alternate lifestyle. Plain sex that lasts for 15 seconds or not at all ( from what you stated earlier about yourself) Is very boring and basic. I prefer something a bit more adventurous then your forced life of Abstinence.<br>

I think that the gif posted fits you quite well for a sig picture. The super great one you posted, or the Estrada gif that I posted. Since you are Asking my opinion Ill say, @#%$ is by far a better Acronym than anything dealing with learning since you are more than likely not able to do it to a great extent other than wipe the drool from you lip due to lack of common sense to close your mouth when your not talking.  <br>

Come on Xxein~! You can do better than that~! Proceed by out doing my 'weak ass flames' and show me how ignorant I am with my 'IQ of 22'~!

Suuuure it is~! Try and justify yourself for keeping that image on your computer. Hey man, its alright if thats your bag. No need to cover up the real reason. Go ahead and wear that rainbow ribbon. And its ok for you to wear that pink tutu of yours and call yourself Rainbow Bright. Its your right~! Be proud of who and what you are~!<br>

Don't get flustered and all pissy Xxein. Its ok, we need people like you here in the world. It teaches us the reason why some people shouldn't breed.<br>

On that note, please do the human race a favor and eliminate the possibility of your genetics from being passed on. There's only so much the theory of Darwinism can cover. Hope this helps things get started for you~!<br>
