I didn't just hatch yesterday, I've been driving all over the country for a quarter century or better. And apparently unlike most drivers, I don't insert my head into the nearest anal orifice when I get behind the wheel, I observe those around me. There's nothing wrong with a sweeping generalization when it's true (except that it's heresy of course.)<br>

Yes, I've heard that line of @#%$ about Datsuns... and seen the Datsuns in question. The only thing holding the vehicles together were the cockroaches holding hands.<br>
Wow, you managed to go 11 years without having an accident. And of course we only have your word and keen sense of observation to know that you didn't *cause* any accidents as people in real cars manoevered to avoid killing you in the crackerbox you were strapped into. Oh, btw, 15 years here w/o so much as a ticket. Prior to that, 10 years. The ticket? doing 45 in a 35 past a motorcycle cop in a speed trap (driving... trumpet please... 76 Spitfire)<br>
Most people who drive the lumbering assault vehicles *can* manoever it like a Miata. Most people who drive peddle cars haven't learned to steer where they can't see.<br>
<br>
Oh, before I forget, I love the way you twisted my words around... number 1 was an assertion I flatly stand behind based upon my observations and conversations with drivers over the past quarter century and straightforward reasoning; if you *learn* to drive in a peddle car, you are not equipped to drive in the real world. period. number 2, however... I said &quot;many&quot;. This is not connected with number 1. I have observed many many many people who drive little cars and seem to think they either own the highway or have an invisible bumper 4 feet on all sides of their vehicle. They are very annoying to those of us who *do* own the highway. <br>

Hyperbolize much? I don't know of any public road where you can legally go 95 mph, particularly in a school zone. Of course they don't have the momentum or kinetic energy to knock down the WTC... just enough to blow a peddle-car off the road. Tough. Peddle cars have less right to the road than real vehicles going about business.<br>
Actually, dumptrucks can and *do* travel at highway speeds. Your average SuV has about the same mass and size as your average Lincoln Towncar (the type of vehicle those highways were built for.) True, an SuV won't haul much freight, but then a Miata won't put a cube of concrete block 2 scaffolds in the air. Nor will it get 5 bags of mortar from the lumber yard, nor haul 5 workers from jobsite to jobsite, nor clear the curb on a jobsite, nor pull a forklift out of the mud on a jobsite, nor carry a half dozen toolboxes of tools (along with those 5 workers come to think of it.) And that's just the random jobs I can think of of the top of my head related *just* to building/home construction that such vehicles serve. SuVs have a purpose. Soccer Moms do not.<br>

There's petrochemicals out there (points up.) There's more on the planet. We can develop the technology to *make* more. We sure as f uck can't develop alternatives if we stop using it today! We've got time now, but we won't have forever. I don't know bout you, but I don't really care if 200 years from now we have no oil, if we're exactly where we are today!

Okay, genius, here's an education for you.. you know what that blue haze above JUNGLES (what you call rainforests) is? GREENHOUSE GASSES. You know what that blue haze that isn't above cornfields is? NONGREENHOUSE GASSES. Rotting vegitation, a prime and necessary ingredient for jungles, released greenhouse gasses including carbon dioxide. Farmland has more oxygen-generating plant surfaces than does a jungle, partly because the plants are planted cheek-by-jowel. Tree bark and lichen don't generate O2 very well. Farmland also increases our albedo... so we radiate energy to space better. Again, the short-sighted liberals whine and cry because the Earth isn't exactly as it was the moment you squirted out from between your momma's knees. Why, your lifetime is the lifetime of the whole universe, isn't it? There never was a time when the atmosphere of the Earth wouldn't support animal life, nooo, there was never any ice ages, or asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions nooo.. the Earth isn't a park; it undergoes changes both longterm and shortterm, and if you look at short term trends and act rashly based on those, you could make the darned place uninhabitable for sure. And long term isn't a century.. it's a million years. Short term is a thousand years. We are, in fact, in equal likelyhood of encountering another ice age as we are a &quot;jungle-age&quot; of global warming. Could it be that the two might balance out? Could it be that there's a cause we don't know about and have no influence over that has thinned the ozone layer in places?  Might be part of some cycle we don't know about yet? Naaahh.. that wouldn't scare people. Can't use that to make them live the way we want them to live (in little caves with no fire and tools because technology is evil oh and btw I hate George Lucas.)<br>
<br>
Corn don't grow in sulphuric acid.. great to hear, I guess that's why there are no corn plantations on venus huh? I spose a bunch of humans went there and cut down all the rainforests and in 3 weeks the sulphuric acid clouds formed, huh? Last time I was in Iowa, the corn was growing just fine, thanks. I don't know how the plastic corn is doing, however (yes, plastic corn.) In fact, we could and should genetically engineer corn to thrive in sulphuric acid and high pressures, so that we can reclaim Venus for life and in a century or so colonize it. But that's long term. And, gosh, along the way we might inadvertently learn a thing or two about how planets operate and how to prevent the very disaster you delight in dreading.<br>

I happen to agree with you in that space mining and such are good ideas to pursue.  It does, however, bring to mind a certain line in the Matrix where Agent Smith attempts to &quot;classify the human race&quot; as a &quot;virus that reproduces...until every natural resource is consumed.&quot;  I think to do that in space is probably not the best solution, but the universe is so f-ing big that any impact we might make would be negligible in the overall scheme of things.  However, its fun to take the opposing view and argue with you.  It provides some distraction from the grind of work.  Anyway if you wanna start a million-man march on Capitol Hill to provide more funding for space exploration and research, I'll happily carry the megaphone.<br>
<br>
Granted, I exaggerated somewhat on the bit about SUV's knocking down buildings, etc.  But I still don't like em.  Sue me.  Anyway, I really think you're mounting a high horse in stating that you in your Camaro own the road.  Who died and made you the godfather of the DOT?  You keep saying that the roads &quot;were built for&quot; so and so and such and such...but last I checked the highways were about 12-14 feet wide in each lane, with height restrictions of nominally 9 feet through certain tunnels and drive-thru windows.  There's a good chance of seeing a weigh station or ten on your average drive through any state in the Union, but those are usually closed anyway.  There's also a good chance that construction crews are widening the lanes of some arbitrary highway somewhere on the continent (probably to accomodate some more wide-ass vehicles), which in turn renders my narrow little Honda a bit safer for them when they get around to laying down 20 miles of orange cones and closing off the shoulders.  In any case, my piece of sh-t peddle car is still well under the minimum requirements, where some *other* vehicles toe the line a bit.<br>
<br>
A Honda is a car in the loosest sense of the word, true.  It can't comfortably seat 5 adults, true.  However, in my world its all the car I need, and I rarely come across a situation in which I need to drive 5 adults anyway.  I'm not breeding kids like Old Mother Hubbard either, so chances are good I wont need to upgrade my equipment any time soon.  When I get around to it, Laelia will probably get one of the 10k horses to ride as well.  I prefer the low-cost end of the cost-benefit spectrum.  Thats my nature.  There's no reason to *jeer* at me for it simply because your horse might accelerate a bit faster, or because your horse carries 5 toolboxes.  Not that I really give ashit...my horse still gets me where I wanna go, and I'm mighty proud of it because its mine.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, f*ck you.  <br>

<br>
Yeah, that statement in the Matrix was worrisome, except it's not exactly true. As humans reach higher stages of technology and society, they tend to breed less. <br>
Ever read &quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot;? It's about the far future when we encounter a millions of years old species in an isolated star system. We don't know it, but they go through cycles, trapped in that system. The problem they had is that their species started male, had to turn female, get pregenant, give birth and turn male again, over and over, or die. They develop civilization, fill up the planet, fight over resources, collapse, develop, fill the planet, fight over resources, etc etc. Eventually they got space travel and filled up the star system, but couldn't get out beyond it. So the collapses became almost continual as the asteroids and stuff in the system developed their own cycles. It was a pretty grim vision. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lae.... what I'm trying to get at with the SuVs that you hate is that you are not the only person driving, the only person with needs for a vehicle. If your Honda does the job for you, great, more power to you. If a Segway does it for you, wonderful for you. SuVs serve a purpose. Minivans might serve a purpose, if they could be made like Pintos (ie, rear-collision fireballs...) As has been established, I drive a Camaro. That doesn't mean Camaros are worthless. Same with SuVs. Just because Soccer Moms also drive them, doesn't mean they're worthless.<br>

It is always funny and easy to determine the loser of an arguement on the boards when the spelling and grammer issue come up.  .heheheheh<br>
<br>
So I drive a Forester what is that classified in your eyes as ?  I thought one thing but my registration has it listed as something else. <br>
<br>
My mother loves her Lexus SUV.  It is nice, and is easier to put the skis in the back when she is only 5 ft 5 and the car is taller then her.  It also makes carrying around rolls of material, curtain rods and other long items easier as well as being protect from the elementals.<br>
<br>
Hey Aldrin who is the author of that book?<br>
<br>
So where do all these rice burners run?  In New England I don't see many of them.  Maybe it is all the sand and salt that eats our cars up here.  Maybe it is the fact that low clearance cars become poor snow plows to.  I had a toyota corrola coupe once and I got stuck pushing too much snow a few times.  In general most people that have higher performance cars in this area have a beater car for the winters.  <br>

Notice how the story wasn't claimed to be about how unsafe the Rice Burners are, it was about how dangerous the Trucks/SUV's were to them.<br>
<br>
We should take the same tactics with say Handguns.  Allow anyone to buy a gun that they want, then regulate the @#$@$ out of bullets.  After all, it's not the gun that delivers the killing force, it's the bullets in it : P<br>
<br>
Of course we already do that in a sense, because people say that guns kill people.  People with guns can kill people, but it's pretty hard for an inanimate object to take aim and start laying rounds downrange.<br>
<br>
Besides, what's the problem if Aldrin had said he owned the road?  If I saw him coming down the road and knew it was him, I'd sure get out of the way heh.  Well, that would assume he was able to travel faster then me so that I saw him in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=285.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=285.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=285.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=391.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=386.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=285.topic&index=70><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=285.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=285.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
