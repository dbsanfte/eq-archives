talk</span><hr size=1> Hm. I tend to agree with Ugle, in that I undersatnd what he's saying. I get the feeling he doesn't quite see the whole picture. I think I do, but am virtually incapable of explaining it. It seems to be like the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything; you can know the answer, or you can know the question, but not both.<br>
<br>
First, I'm glad Ugle was asked that about the WTC, because it's been galling me a bit. All this sympathy and attention for the people who died at the WTC, far less for those who died at the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania. But still more than for the guy who's driving down a lonely highway at 10 at night, trying to hurry home to have a late supper with his wife and maybe kiss his kids before they have to be in bed, and is blindsided by a drunk driver, or a jackknifed tractor-trailer, or simply falls asleep and drives over an embankment. For some bizarre reason, we're all more outraged that 3,000 people died together than when 1 person dies all alone. <br>
I was outraged at the attacks, myself. But I was outraged because the WTC was destroyed, and because a hunk of the Pentagon was gone, and because our military might have been impaired, and because hundreds of individual people died because they were denied their 2nd Amendment rights. Someone pist in my face, and being human, I became outraged.<br>
And that may be the part Ugle is missing.. what is evil? Well, is it evil when soldiers shoot each other on the battlefield? Is it evil when a serial killer slowly strangles his victim with a towel just because it thrills him to see the eyes bulge as life leaves them? Are these two the same? Of course not.<br>
Is it evil when a wasp stings a spider to paralyze it, and leaves eggs to hatch and feed on the still living body? Horrible, yes, but not evil. <br>
I once watched a Nat'l geographic where a male lion chased down, killed, and ate the offspring of his new mate, fathered by another lion he'd defeated. Monsterous? It would seem so, but it's the savage battle of the genes in action. By doing so he makes more lions like himself, and less lions like his defeated foe, thus shaping the course of feline evolution.<br>
<br>
The universe was either created, or sprang into being, or has always existed, with a set of basic laws... thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc. As a result of these laws, life takes certain patterns. Those lifeforms just do what they can to survive, without moral restraint. Those who survive to reproduce, flourish. Plants can survive without killing anything else... but they do compete with each other for nutrients and space. Higher life forms have to feed on the living, even if it's only plants. And plant eaters are unlikely to evolve to higher intelligence. Social (pack, tribe, etc) predators seem to evolve the highest intelligence. And only intelligent creatures worry about right and wrong, good and evil.<br>
<br>
So what is evil? Heinlein observed that sin lies only in harming others unnecessarily. Harming yourself isn't a sin, it's just stupid. I would go a step further, and suggest evil is harming others for the sake of one's appetites. Ugle is wrong in saying that people who hurt others for the pleasure of inflicting suffering are merely weak. They are evil. Deer hunters could be shoved into this category... but note that part of the ethic of such hunters is the 'clean kill'. A friend once gave up bowhunting deer after he had to track one for 2 miles to finish it. Such hunters take pleasure in the competition with their prey, not in its suffering.<br>
<br>
Am I evil because I feel no pity for the Afghan people? Perhaps, but I don't think so. It's not because I don't know them. It's because I understand that, by the laws of the universe, they have laid their own path. Unlike most other lifeforms, Afghans have intelligence, as do Americans. They make choices as individuals and as tribes, and as a whole. They are not poor and starving and repressed because I am sitting at a computer in the middle of America, well-fed and warm. Their suffering is in no way my fault, and therefore, why should I feel pity for them? Like the old joke, &quot;doctor, it hurts when I do this, what should I do?&quot;... &quot;Don't do that&quot;. Somewhere in Africa, as I type, a gazelle is being pulled down and eaten by a pack of jackals. Should I feel pity for the slow, or sickly, or dumb, or unlucky gazelle? Is it somehow my fault the jackals caught it? As far as the universe is concerned, it is just evolution in action, and is in fact, A Good Thing, not evil.<br>
As with Afghanistan, and the American aborigines, it's evolution in action. I'm glad the europeans settled the N. American continent; from a standpoint of human evolution, it was a good thing, in spite of the suffering involved on the part of the aborigines (oh, and just because the europeans won, as a whole, doesn't mean that millions of them didn't suffer as individuals in the process!)  It wasn't the first time such happened; earliest evidence of such a conflict was the neanderthal's vs. the homo sapiens. <br>
<br>
Sympathy must be tempered with rationality. One day while I was watching television, about to eat a candy bar, a commercial came on showing starving children in some 3rd world hole. I started to set the candy bar down, sickened. My father had just come home from work (construction work,) and was outraged. Rightfully so. *I* had done nothing to cause the suffering of those children. *He* had done his part to provide me with the candy bar; he worked hard, all day; he paid taxes; he voted; he served in the military of his nation honorably. He was in part responsible for the prosperity that allowed me to enjoy a candy bar in front of a television set. Now that I'm middle-aged, I can munch on down on a candy bar while the scenes of deprevation flash across my screen. Am I heartless and evil? (well, probably, but not because of this...) No, I just know that their suffering is not my fault, their relief not my responsibility, and that my candy bar wouldn't make a darn bit of difference. I can feel sympathy for their suffering, but I can be rational enough to know that it is largely their own fault; I can be rational enough to know that my candy bar is mine not by luck but by my efforts. I can be rational enough to know that the scumbags putting the commercial on are using them and trying to manipulate me. In fact, if evil exists in this scenario, where does it lie? In the warlords the starving people follow? In my indifference to their plight? Or in the organization that exploits their suffering to milk the fruits of my effort from me to put in their own coffers? For all of my life the starving have existed; I know of no place where any of those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> charities</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has *ended* suffering. Give a man a fish and you've got a dependent. Teach a man to fish and you go out of business.... if you're a charity. <br>
<br>
On a sidebar, one might note that this might be a metaphor for the political spectrum; on the far left you have sympathy without rationality, on the far right you have rationality without sympathy. <br>
<br>
But the United States are my people (I would say &quot;Americans&quot; but based on recent commercials, everyone on the planet but me is an American...) and the Afghans are not. Just as a hunter trying to feed his family can't feel much sympathy with his prey (and the prey attempting to survive can't sympathise with the hunger pangs of his adversary,) I can't feel much sympathy for those in conflict with the U.S. I'm not evil; but they have to lose so mine can win. If hating them makes it easier on me, I can live with that.<br>
