He was told to return the things, He informed guild leadership that he had made things ok with Thaor. So a few days later when thaor says I still dont have my stuff, we are surprised. We demand he return the property and he returns what he still has. BTW this was an item transfer he was doing at the time...so he just straight up stole the @#%$ in the first place.<br><br>Fastforward a little...we boot his ass from Battalion for the &quot;snafu&quot; with Thaor and his dishonesty with leadership. So within 24 hours he is doing a gear trade for a battalion member, as an alt Ninji...character asking for the item transfer wasnt aware of his nefarious past. The Item was Gauntlets of Fiery Might. He of course stole them. When the Battalion member asked why he had been stolen from, he replied with because you are in battalion and because it is a 10k item.<br><br>Fastforward again: He Joins Orders of Sirens -- We jump their Guild Leader Xiolia about returning the gloves, hoping she will pressure him into returning them. She says she will talk to him, over the next week or so they are finally both on, I ask her about it and she tells me that Bjornn said he didnt steal them, but that he had borrowed them. He also told her that he had made arrangements with him and it was all even now. Something sounding familiar? Well of course the person who had lost the gloves had never gotten a response from Bjornn when he inquired about his property from the time they were stolen to present...<br><br><br>Xiolia also informed me that she knew Bjornn for three years and was going to take his word over ours. Like we would waste our time smearing him after we already had brought his previous theft to light on this same message board. <br><br>The facts are simple, He at least at one point Had Gauntlets of Fiery Might. They were not his, but he claimed he Borrowed them. He said he worked out a deal with the person he &quot;borrowed them from&quot;....So do a little math, the story isnt made up. He has admitted that they were someone elses property, and that he had them, and that he still had them and had made a deal for them...clearly out PoV is that he is blowing smoke up her ass. <br><br>He hasnt changed he is still a piece of grabastic amphibian @#%$...if he is you buddy you can go to hell with him <p><img src=http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/63/2417563.GIF></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ucedea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cedea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res02go8/cillatiny.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 9:07:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res02go8/cedeaicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bjornn......but different!</span><hr size=1> I had the same problem with the Order of Sirens guild about 4 months ago.  A cleric of theirs was in my group in Seb, and looted Blood Ember arms while he was 'accidently' disbanded. He was already in the looting crouch when he did so, and started asking questions about the price of BE arms as soon as he rejoined.<br><br>Sure enough, the very next day, one of the group members was doing some trades in EC and this cleric was auctioning the piece he ninja looted.  A friend logged a twink and started a conversation with this person about how rare this stuff was, and the cleric said agreed, and told him how he'd just gotten them from Seb yesterday! All of this was logged,for what it's worth, since logs are so easily manipulated. &lt;and no, it wasn't worth keeping a copy :P&gt;<br><br>When approached by group members, he made up a story about selling the arms for a friend, but declined to name the friend...<br><br>Didn't seem worth it to bother doing anything about it, beyond never grouping with the jackass again, but as a group, the consensus was to tell his guild leader.  Needless to say, nothing was done, and we were told that they would 'take his word for it', because he was a guild member.<br>While I understand loyalty, you'd think that 5 other people and logs would sorta make you take it more seriously than 'us against him', but oh well.<br><br>In the end, it was far more satisfying to see him sitting at the Seb zone in, trying to find a group that would take him, in spite of his reputation... &lt;not earned solely from this incident I found out...&gt;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>   <p>Cilla Laa'ren<BR>60th Phantasmist<BR>Giver of VoG to whiny melees<BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uilulaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ilulaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 11:08:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bjornn......but different!</span><hr size=1> i been in orders of sirens for a year.

I am the person who dealt directly with Bjornn on this issue.  As leader of Battalion it is my duty to get all the facts.  I spent 3 days getting the information so I would be fair.  Throughout these three days Bjornn lied repeatedly.  After Bjornn was removed from the guild a druid named Bailey(or very close to it) joined my Guild.  30 minutes after joining he begins to use Guildchat as a lobby to defend Bjornn.  After I confront him he then (lies) tells me he is Bjornn's son of 15 years old.  Why do I say this is a lie?  If anyone has ever dealt with Bjornn it is more than apparent that he is an immature teenager.  His claims that &quot;his father&quot; was telling him what to say via cell phone were absurd.  I called a meeting of myself,Bailey(bjornn),Thoar and two of my Guild members who happened to be in Oasis at the time.  For over an hour we discussed the situation and what needed to be done to resolve it.  Needless to say it never happened.<br><br>  Fastforward 2 days....Ninji(Bjorn's then level 15 monk alt) joins guild.  Says he will help with a transfer for a guildmate and then steals the Gauntlets of Fiery Might.  Saying when asked that he did it because it was my guild and it was an expensive item. (further solidifying my claim that this is not a mature adult)<br><br>  Fast forward 1 day.....Bjornn is now in Orders of the Siren.  I contact the Guild Leader and explain what has happened.  She says she will fix the issue.  For two weeks she gives myself and Heggo the run around and then says she believes Bjornn and will not do anything about this.<br><br>  Anyone who has played this game with me knows that I am a fiercely loyal person.  I respect truth(if you don't believe me ask anyone in my Guild what happens when they lie to me or the Guild) above all else.  Loyalty to someone does not always make them innocent.  I am loyal to my Guild and always will be but when there is a complaint I get to the bottom of it and take what action must be done.  The simple answer &quot;I have known this person for said amount of time.&quot; is not good enough.  <br><br>  In closing, my Guild is relatively new to this server but in the short time we have been here we have  and will continue to serve ourselves as well as others.  I count myself lucky to have succeeded in bringing together upstanding people from all over the world to enjoy a game we all love.  It is just unfortunate that every garden has weeds that must be pulled.  I implore any guild that considers Bjornn/Bailey/Ninji for membership to there Guild to weigh that choise very carefully because it comes with a shadow above it.<br><br><br>Thank you for your time,<br><br>Benegaris Ebonwoulffe<br>49 druid<br>Battalion Commander <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ucedea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cedea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res02go8/cillatiny.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 12:11:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res02go8/cedeaicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> Ilulaan/McFuzz, <br><br>Like I said, it was 4 months ago,  and it was 'dealt with' by an officer in your guild.<br><br>I know the clerics name perfectly well, as he is one of the very few people on my 'do not group for any reason whatsoever'  list.  *shrug* I'm sure he doesn't want his name on a public board, nor do you, since he is still in your guild as of the last time I saw him &lt;which was quite recently&gt;.<br><br>It's really a moot point, but just seemed to be the same sort of situation as this, hence why I posted.<br><br> <p>Cilla Laa'ren<BR>60th Phantasmist<BR>Giver of VoG to whiny melees<BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uheggohalfstack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heggo Halfstack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 4:13:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> I assure you no cleric from Battalion grouped with you Sebilis to Ninja anything.

Discuss it with the officers if it's that big a deal, Fabree in particular, she was the one that 'dealt' with the issue. *shrug*<br><br>And no, like I said, it wasn't that big a deal.  But the point was that the officers of OoS seem to make a habit of believing their guildmembers in spite of much evidence to the contrary, hence gaining a reputation for not caring what types of people belong to the guild.<br><br>It was a guild issue that I was commenting on, hence the decision not to name the person, so no 'shitty' about it. If your guild has a pattern of letting people get away with dishonest behaviour, then it's not me that's 'screwing over' the other people in your guild.<br><br> <br><br> <p>Cilla Laa'ren<BR>60th Phantasmist<BR>Giver of VoG to whiny melees<BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarisai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arisai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 3:03:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> Anyone else think OrderS of Sirens sounds strange? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukaganfindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaganfindel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 3:39:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/49/2436849.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> I'd like three orders of sirens, three trakburgers, and three small cokes.<br> <p><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/39/2383739.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarisai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arisai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 4:42:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> LOL! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 10:26:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Also on this subject</span><hr size=1> Just an FYI Il, we had far more then 2 Seb capable people 4 months ago.
