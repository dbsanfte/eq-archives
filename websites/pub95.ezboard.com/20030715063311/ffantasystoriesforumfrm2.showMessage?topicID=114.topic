<br>
<br>
     &quot; Yaoric will you come with us , we could use your sword and your skill's &quot; Syithumis asked. <br>
<br>
     &quot; I will go , I need to see some things for myself and that means I must go.&quot; Yaoric replied.<br>
<br>
     Two days later the group was in sight of the temple which was about twenty miles away. They made camp about fifty yaards from the nearest tree to the south so they could have an observation post.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot; I'm taking first watch , Threndir and Vendir you too , I'll need your eyes if I can't hear what might be coming at us.  Elaudd , Soen and Syithumis you all need a full nights rest , I know how much a spell can take out of you so I want to see you all rested. Toag , Begnar and Meddwin have second watch and Yaoric you can join either of the watches its your choice.&quot; Bleuhawke commanded.<br>
<br>
    Meddwin ate and went to sleep , Begnar stayed up and sharpened his axe and spoke with toag near the small fire. Yaoric was stargazing or something but he was off by himself. Elaudd the cleric was chanting something.<br>
<br>
    &quot; So lad you ever kill someone? I's just wonderin &quot; Begnar asked.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Yes , just a couple days ago , I've killed a handful of people.&quot; replied toag defensively.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Wo lad , I ein't tryin ta insult ya , just seeing if you'll freeze on us , I need to kno if ya'll watch my back when I need it durin a fight.&quot; Begnar said.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Well don't worry I won't.... &quot; Toad didn't get to finish.<br>
<br>
   Toag threw himself over the fire and over Begnar and was grappling with something.<br>
<br>
   &quot; Orcs! Orcs! wake up you fools &quot; Cried Begnar as he stood up.<br>
<br>
    Orcs began to flood the area all around Begnar. Their was a lot of shouting and you could hear Yaoric and bleuhawke trying to find each other and Threndir and Vendir trying to find them. Begnar walked over to the Orc grappling with Toag and buried his battleaxe deep in its skull.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Thanks &quot; said Toag while he went for his swords.<br>
&quot; No Problem lad &quot; Begnar replied.<br>
<br>
   Now that Toag was up and ready he rushed over to Soen's tent to challenge any orcs over there. Toag quickly parried a blow at his head and stuck his sword deep into the orc belly and twisted it. Toag searched and searched for an enemy and he found one , their was a Dark elf trying to around somewhere.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Come fight me Drow &quot; Toag taunted<br>
<br>
    The figure straightend and spoke &quot; You can't take me &quot;<br>
with a crazed bellow toag walked calmly swinging his swords so that they whirred  when he met his foe. the Drow hadn't even unsheathed his swords until Toags sword was within a foot of him , then his swords were out and he fought back striking like a viper. All of toags concentration was on the defensive . the fighting around him was growing more intense and he could hear someone chanting in the background , he could also hear Bleuhawke and the elves fighting toward the camp. <br>
<br>
    &quot; Gahh &quot; toag cried out , the drow and cut his arm open to the bone.<br>
<br>
    &quot; I told you so , hahahahaha &quot; the drow cried<br>
<br>
    &quot; I'm not done yet fool &quot; toag retorted.<br>
<br>
    Toags counter attack was furious and made the drow think , even with only one sword Toag was forcing the drow swordsman back . The drow slipped over some debris and was know at the mercy of Toag.<br>
<br>
     &quot; Your a disgrace to the battlefield , AHHH&quot; toag shouted just before he delivered the death blow. Before he could a arrow as thick as his thumb hit him in the ribs , then another in the belly. Toag fell down on his back but could not breath , groping at his ribs and belly Toag could breath a little better now.<br>
<br>
   * ohh gods I've been hit in the lungs*<br>
<br>
   The drow stood up and prepared to deliver the same blow to Toag  , Thunk thunk , two much smaller arrows slammed into the drows arms. <br>
<br>
   &quot; We'll meet again &quot; it whispered before it ran off.<br>
<br>
    There was still a lot of fighting going on so toag drug himself to the fire where begnar was fighting. Begnar was outnumbered two to one and another was coming behind , it must not have seen toag because it was still in shock when Toag hamstrung it.<br>
    <br>
     * this is it * Toag was coughing out great gouts of blood , and had trouble breathing again. Bleuhawke the elves and Yaoric were here now and the orcs were fleeing.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Elaudd its the boy , he hurt very bad , don't worry lad I gotcha &quot; Begnar said almost reassuringly.<br>
<br>
    &quot; I'm coming , keep him still fool , Now you , ohh my &quot; Elaudd stopped speaking but kept on moving. ' Move away , move away.<br>
<br>
    &quot; Pe... peace .... so quite now &quot; toag murmured through the blood that was choking him.<br>
<br>
    He could hear Soen scream before everything went black.<br>
<br>
    Two days later Toag was in stable condition and the group had cleared the temple and learned that their suspect had spoken with a god , but they did not know who? They brought the artifact used to speak with a god back to the camp.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dall@fantasystoriesforum>Dall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/1/03 8:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Search for Enlightenment prt3</span><hr size=1> I just finished reading the 3 Search for Enlightenments...not bad stuff.
