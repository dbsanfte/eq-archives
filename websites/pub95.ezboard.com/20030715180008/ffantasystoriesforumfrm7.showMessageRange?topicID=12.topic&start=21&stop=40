The blade moved from his throat. &quot;Hoku, why did you leave me here, I would have come for you.&quot; the bards eyes glazed over for a moment. &quot;Only one more song.&quot; eyelids closed. Screaming this time in rage the girl slammed her fists against the halfelf's chest. &quot;Damn it all!&quot; Yavi snickered. &quot;The boy fought hard.

Smiling at the rapture of being free of all bounds of his real life, Paren looked to see the sun. The actual sun beaming on his skin. He had never told anyone of his friends this, but the lack of a sky, the sun, the stars, his absence of his devotionals in the morning and evening to the sun and moon, was beginning to etch deeply at Paren's nerve. Smiling at the sun Paren felt the pull grow stronger away from the dark forest where his friends where. Resisting for the first time he remembered his friends. As humorless as they might be they were his friends and friends stick together. As Paren began to move back down to the forest, he remembered. His friends hadn't come for him. He had called for their help and nothing, they had not come to his aid. He most certainly would have in a heart beat if he thought he could help, or even die with them. But they had not even answered back. The memory nearly forced Paren's decent back to the forest to stop. They were his friends. He had to go back if not to find out the reason they had not come to help. Maybe they themselves had been caught up in battle, maybe this was a decicive blow from the kobolds. Maybe.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 382<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/13/02 6:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Adventures of Rillen and the Gang</span><hr size=1> ( Okay..Belle Rill, GET BACK IN THE GODAMN STORY!! im pissed off that bicth ayla is again ruining my day!...Damn me why do  i have to stray from my pessimissm!..*sighs* i need to go rant and rave for a while to feel better..

<br>
Brenan's heard jerked up from the holy book in which his head had been burried in in meditation.  He heard a noise.  A voice, but not one belonging to friend of his.  It was desperate.....faint from the distance.  But, yes, he managed to make out two words, bard, and trouble.  Or....barb and bubble, but that just didn't make sense, did it.  No, Paren was in trouble.  When wasn't he...Rising to his feet, Brenan ran.  The voice was distant still, but growing louder as his feet pounded against the hard ground.  Louder, louder.  The sound of dying kobolds echoed throughout the area.  The screams of their dead were worse than the sound of the Maestro residing in Hate, or so he had been told.  Paren!  His body lay sprawled on ground, a Kerran staunchly standing defending him.  Without ceremony, a distraught but ever serious cleric knelt down beside his bardic friend.  Two fingers pressed against a wrist growing cold.  Seconds passed before Brenan felt a pulse, and a weak pulse it was.  But he was alive, and thats all he needed.  Brenan bared his soul to Rodcet Nife, begging life for the bard whose cause was just and spirit even more kind.  The healing light of a god bathed the pair in its radiance.  Brenan's eyelids fluttered as he used part of his own life to repair that which was damaged in his friends.  He felt weak, as if his insides would slip out of his body and his muscles would fail him.  The skin beneath his fingers grew warmer and blood began to flow, as Brenan's skin began to pail and his blood slow its pace.  Using Raiki, a form of healing using ones own body heat to heal another, he finished his work.  Eye lids shut as Brenan told himself the only thing Paren would need is sleep.  The thing Brenan needed himself was a warm bed, and sleep, forever sleep.  Hopefully that Kerran can hold at bay those kobolds, hopefully. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/13/02 9:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Adventures of Rillen and the Gang</span><hr size=1> Feeling his hands grow feeling back slowly.

Feeling his body still needed rest, Paren snarled at the weariness in his legs and leapt to his feet. Looking to find two newcomers one human with a long sword, and one wood elf huddling behind the human. Finding the creature from before still in the fight Paren looked down at his cleric friend exhausted and weak at his feet. He had saved his life, but now it was his turn to return the favor. &quot;Sword!&quot; he cried to the creature. The blade was in the air and spiraling towards him. The feel of his father's sword in his hand was reassuring. &quot;Bre, where's Hoku? I pray to the gods that protect you two that she is ok.&quot; Turning as a Kobold rushed, Paren swung feeling the blade slice clean through the body. &quot;Time for pay back.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bellonakali>Bellona Kali</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://auction.2y.net/user/kanachan/jsk2.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 660<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/13/02 10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/kanachan/XMas_1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams</span><hr size=1> She had ran through the woods faster then Breanan, but it seemed the closer she was to Peran, the harder it was to place one foot in front of the other. Falling behind, she barely moved toward the group, half of which were strangers. What if something bad happened to Paren? What would she do... How could she deal with something like that, with Paren's... if Paren... or if anything... and he sturred. A call for a sword and the moron was on his feet again! Anger shown through on her cheeks in a vivid rose hue. Bah, bards... A tickle in the back of her mind turned her head. A staff to the side was enough reason for the tickle. Hoku fell to her knee and held tightly to her side. Where was she when all these beasts arrived? Just like Paren to distract someone at the worst possible moment. If she was good at one thing, it was teaching animals like these that they couldn't pick on all girls. Her fists were on him instantly, pounding through fur at every chance they got. A knock to the shoulder off set her balance, but not nearly enough. Over and over she struck, her own fierce agression guiding the random hits. The only thing that ran through her mind was &quot;Damn him...&quot;.<br>

Pulling his blade from the last kobold Paren thought he could see movment in the trees, something big. What the hell could that be. &quot;Hoku, Bre you two came just in time. Thought for sure I'd be going to the grand orchestra in the sky.&quot; Feeling the exhaustion seeping i into him and sapping his energy stores. Paren nearly feel down. Staring up a jig of vigor, Paren's energy was back up again. Feeling almost sick, Paren sat down but continued singing. If he used this song much longer he would not be able to wake up for days after this. So to him the feeling of illness that swept over him was bareable until he was sure they were all safe. The creature he had met before was still standing with his sword at ready. &quot;Hoku, stop scaring the little guy.&quot; Paren said laughably. &quot;Thank you for coming.&quot; he said slowly under his breath while Hoku huffed at his other remark. Looking back up Paren smiled again. &quot;Whew that one was a close one wasn't it? Ok ok so maybe just for me, but you gotta remember you are so much of a better fighter than me. I'm just an artist ya know.&quot; smiling at his own bloody blades and the gore that was adroned on his light armor. Paren noticed he needed some new stuff. he only had a leather armor that didn't help much other than keep him from harm when the kobolds punched him. &quot;I think we should go and help our friend to someplace he can rest without having to worry about the fighting.&quot; Noticing the two new comers Paren totally forgot himself. &quot;Oh and you two, thanks for the helping hand. I'm Paren, the most talented bard on this horrid isle, and This is Hoku, she's a friend of mine, rather scary ain't she?

He often times is quite blunt and does not think that others might be offended by his behavior, but he is strong and brave when he needs to be. Sometimes too snappy for my liking, but we have traveled together for many years and I am growing quite fond of his grumblings.&quot; The smiling cleric said. &quot;I wish I could have helped you, but it was outside of my ability, I'm fairly new to this profession and was unsure how to act.&quot; Snarling again Yavi pulled the woodelf closer to him. &quot;Hush your tongue young one, we do not know these people, they may not be as understanding as I, or my sect to your kind.&quot; A discuraged look came over her face and she wrapped her arms around the warriors waist.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rillen@fantasystoriesforum>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/14/02 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Adventures of Rillen and the Gang</span><hr size=1> OOC (Everythings going along wonderfully.

So far, your skill at it has caused no confusion whatsoever and writing excelently.  Just a question, maybe I missed it, I know the clerics a wood elf, can I assume the warrior is the same?)  <br>
<br>
Brenan rose to his feet.  Healing Paren had not taken nearly as much as he had expected out of him and his energy was quickly returning.  &quot;Hail fair warrior and fellow cleric.  Thank you for aiding us in the never ending battle 'gainst fear, war, and hatred.  What has brought you to Odus?&quot;<br>

(I know, I know.  Very BAD, very SMALL post, but I'm working on my story now.  I've only written twelve pages and I'm already getting writers block!  Thanks again for your comments on it Ryvian, I'm afraid I can't live up to such expectations, but your detailed critiques have deffinately helped me improve.

Well maybe not Hoku, but me and Bren atleast. You can trust us. If you hate this place so much, why take your charge, that's what you called her right? why take her to this place, there is a cleric's hall in your home Qyenos.&quot; Paren looked to his blades as the piercing gaze of the human turned on him. &quot;I'm sorry if I'm prying, just curious. Mostly just why a wood elf would be in need of the guardianship of a human, and how on earth that wood elf could be a cleric of all classes, I didn't know they had the aptitude.&quot; he said rather rudely. Instantly wanting to take back his words Paren thought maybe a song was in order.<br>
(OOC- couldn't think of a good song off the top of my head so I'm turning to distrubed for some inspiration here, don't sue me haha) <br>
&quot;Believe, when you lie. You will never need to recognize yourself. To deceive. To remove all chance of doubt and be received. With your lie. And deception is complete when you concede. And decide. To reject your lives, sacrificed to me. penence can't absolve your sin. All your belief cannot absolve your sin.<br>
Believe when you lie. You will never need to recognize the source. Of deciet. To renew our faith in God. You must believe, in your lie. The redemptionis complete when you conveive. And decline.

I can hear their screams tonight. Ever haunting me. Burn your lie. Into me. Penance can't absolve your sin. All your belief cannot absolve your sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking up from his song hoping to have covered his last words and emplanted another idea into their heads, Paren slowly turned his eyes to the human and elf. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bonaki>Bonaki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/15/02 12:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Adventures of Rillen and the Gang</span><hr size=1> (ooc- Rillen Yavi's a human, who's watching over Amy woodelf)<br>
<br>
Snarling and lifting his sword toward the bard. &quot;Little one, I think this is one we should have left to die.&quot; The girl pulled behind him so that Yavi's body was blocking the others of the group. Turning his head back to Paren, &quot;I see bard that you have a strange way of getting your point across. We left because the city by the sea has become so currupt that those studying the arts of magic are behing listed and inprisoned. It was some mad man's idea that the use of magic was that of evil and those using it, dispite their path, were a threat. And so we left, because I could not do the job that her father gave me. I could not protect her from my own people. We thought that by leaving her home, and going somewhere that no one knew much we would be hidden well. But it turns out that evil know's no bounds. Like a snark it sliterhs, coils... destroys what it touches. It is cold, it will be the bane of my people. That's right I speak of darkness, and I speak not of the background of a beautifuol star filled sky, but the blackness that causes men to lie, cheat. To kill, to harm, I speak of darkness my friends. I speak of the darkness, damnp and dank, delveing into the depths of the mind. It is that which whispers into your ear the sweet mutters of power, glory. Like water on a rock it corrodes at your heart. You know what I talk about halfbreed. I can see the darkness in your eyes, and it is the kind of evil that resides in the minds of men. I know this, I have seen the maddness, I have come back from the desert and seen the evil. Have you yet friend. I think not. Before you critize that which you have no understanding, be sure that you fully understand the threat it could cause. In this case me.&quot; with a growl Yavi spat at the bard's direction. &quot;If you are so damn curious to know, perhaps my blades could give you the answer.&quot; Pulling at the sword arm the girl was again interferring. &quot;Yavi, these people are only travelers as we. I am only going to the keep and that is all, if I can find refuge there it will be over with and you can go to your home you can go back to Freeport where the curruption has not take so much. Please Yavi, if you fight, if you do this it will only mean you have been taken again.&quot; Tears were forming in her young eyes. &quot;Please, I don't want to have to pull you from that place again. Let us just go, if they want to cross us, I will handle it, but please Yavi, you have enough scars on your heart.&quot; Lowering his sword slowly. &quot;Young one, I will not be pulled into the darkness again, it is you that I am to protect and I will not let another scar on my soul be reason for my lack of my duty. We will go to this keep, and I will not go home until you are fully trained and then I will see to your return home to the forest of light. Where the stars sing and you can dance with the sky. But until then we must both suffer this evil wood and find the only shelter we can.&quot; Glaring at the small group, Yavi turned his gaze back to the woods. &quot;And all of you beware, we are not alone in the darkness.

Whether it was fog, the darkness, the sounds, they each had their own signature, fingerprints of lurking evil. <br>
<br>
Forna rambled on through the forest. The dead foliage snapped beneath her graceful, yet powerful steps. She was on her way to meet up with Bren, Hoku, and Paren. A few weeks ago, Forna had received a letter calling her away from her friends. It was a letter from her father. Family matters, right? Wrong. It wasn't a letter saying, &quot;Dear, Aunt Laurel just died. Come home.&quot; No, it was business. He needed her. The man who taught her all she knows about being a physical weapon needed HER. The novice. Well, she wasn't a novice anymore.<br>
<br>
Kicking a rock ahead of her, Forna cursed to herself. She should have never went to see him. Being as advanced in sensory as she was, she should have KNOWN it was going to be bad. Yeah, he was her father, she wanted to help him, but she didn't want this...<br>
<br>
The sheathing of a sword caught Forna's ear, stopping, she crouched low and surveyed the area. Music began to lace through the trees and dance in her ears, followed by corny lyrics, that needed grand amounts of work. A smile illuminated her face, and brightened her sky blue eyes. Standing erect again she began to run towards the music, it was Paren, it had to be, and where Paren was, so were the others.<br>
<br>
It was time to push down her troubles, she would talk to Bren about it later. Now was the time to rejoin her friends, her family. <br>
<br>
Dashing past the trees, she caught the glint of armor, the warmth radianting from her friends, but she could sense others. As Forna stepped before her friends, she stopped, her foot coming down on a twig that emitted a loud snap to reverberate in her ears and the group before her. The crowd grew silent for a split second, as Forna's conscience was screaming about the letter, but she pushed it down.<br>
<br>
A bright smile crossed her features, as she jumped and hugged Paren, tackling him to the ground, &quot;Paren! You crazy Bard! How you doing!?&quot; She ruffled his hair then jumped to her feet, as she looked around to everyone they didn't seem so chipper... Looking to Hoku, she gave a little wave, then just stopped, there was a man and a young elven girl she had never seen in her life, not to mention the fur ball eyeing her down. Forna's blue eyes found Bren, her eyebrow shifting to an arch, &quot;Did someone die? Or are you all just THIS excited to see me?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/02 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thanks!</span><hr size=1> Being taken to the ground, Paren smiled but nearly lost his jig. &quot;Forna, darlin' could you ease up just a tad? I'm not totally fixed just yet.&quot; His ribs, that never fully healed were throbbing. Smiling again, Paren tried to stand up. &quot;Damn it's been too long! Where'd ya go off to so quickly like that? I'm sure it was important, why would anyone want to leave such a wonderful bard as myself for anything other than the most important deeds?&quot; His smile faded when his eyes met Hoku, &quot;Ok so maybe I'm not the best bard ever, but hell I'm pretty close.&quot; Looking back to his riend Forna, &quot;Darlin' these two are travelers. Yavi the warrior, and Amy the cleric.&quot; Paren pointed them out. &quot;We were just having a little chat about understanding. Weren't we buddy?&quot; Paren asked Bren. Not waiting for a response Paren quickly turned back to Forna. &quot;So where'd ya go this time? Get me anything?&quot; Looking back to Hoku's huff, Paren backed off just a little. &quot;Ok well now that most of us know each other, umm.. the furry guy is still a stranger to us.&quot; Paren turned again. &quot;I'm Paren, a bard. You know, sing sing sing.&quot; Paren made little singing noises and spoke very slowly. Looking at all the unamused faces Paren gave a sigh. No humor, these where is the fun! &quot;Fine let's just go and grab some food, I'm starved.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=61&stop=78>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=40><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7>Role Playing Forum</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
