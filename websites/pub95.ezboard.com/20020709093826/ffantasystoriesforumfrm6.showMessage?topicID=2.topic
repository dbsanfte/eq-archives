<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The night air is warm; when one breathes in they can feel the moister of the dew. Stars cast down the only light in all of Nektulos. Humming with the noise of life, the forest takes on a surreal atmosphere. A mist of rainfalls, sparklets of water dance in the night-light. Not a single movement is made anywhere. Peace settles in with the early morning fog. A light wind blows, cooling the temperature. Along a deserted path, Bellona and Aeaweien walk side by side. They smile and laugh, talking while they walk. <br>
&quot;Ummm, Bell?&quot; Aeaweien stops, the two turn and look at each other, Aeaweien avoiding Bellona's eyes.<br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well...I am not sure how to say this but......uhh, never mind&quot;<br>
&quot;You know you can tell me anything Aea, anything at all. Heh, it is amazing how close we have grown when we where once so far apart. Just a few years ago I barely talked to you...Now I keep nothing from you. They say that to know Hate, you must also know Love...there are two things I love Aea...My family - and you&quot; Bellona hangs her head, embarrassed by showing any sort affection toward someone else.<br>
&quot;I love you as well...&quot;Aeaweien leans in close, his cheek gently rubs against her cheek and he whispers in her ear, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;<br>
&quot;I have been waiting so long for you to ask me that! Of course I will!&quot; Bellona throws her arms around Aeaweien and hugs him to her. Aeaweien's arms wrap around Bellona's waist, both their hearts bursting with joy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;OH MY GOD!!&quot; Yuzuha's scream echoes over all noise. &quot;MINDLES GET YOU ASS IN HERE NOW!!&quot; <br>
Mindles comes stumbling into the living room. Bellona, Aeaweien, and Yuzuha all stand, Yuzuha embracing Bellona to the point where she cannot breathe. <br>
&quot;Mindles our baby is getting married!&quot;<br>
&quot;SHE IS?!&quot;<br>
Yuzuha nods excitedly. Mindles joins the hug, motioning for Aeaweien to join as well; they create a giant group hug. Telus leans against the hallway wall, a disgusted look on his face. Turning, he disappears into the hallway, out of sight and out of mind. <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bellona awakes suddenly, jerking out of sleep. The night air around her is thin, stale, like the doors had not been opened in years. Bellona rises from her bed, the darkness around her accepts her, hugs her body. Opening the window she takes in a deep breath, the chilled night air feels good in her lungs. Her eyes scan the nightly scene outside...the emptiness of the area makes her feel more secure. Her mind drifts off to what woke her up...Dahnyella. It had been days, weeks, maybe even months since she had last seen her. Something in her heart ached, ached for her friend. There was a bond she felt towards Dahnyella, she could not explain it, but she knew it was there. It was the reason she had dreams of her, dreams of what she was doing, where she was. Visions of Dahnyella waking up at night, haunted by what she did not know, and what she yearned for so badly. Bellona would wake up, like tonight, her chest hurting with the same pain that runs through Dahnyella. Bellona walks over to her dresser, looking herself over in the mirror that hangs above it on the wall. Her eyes are drawn to the corner of the mirror by a dark shadow cast by something...someone. Spinning around on her heels, she outstretches her hand. A spiral of red shards fly from her hand, they shoot through the shadows and pierce the darkness. A burst of color explodes as the shards hit the skin of the person who cast that shadow. Bellona's skin sizzles with pain, was she imagining things? The spell hit the other person, not her, so why did she feel it? From out of the shadows stumbles Dahnyella. Could she really be there? She clumsily throws her arms around Bellona's neck and embraces her. As their skin touches, Bellona heals them both completely. <br>
&quot;Bellie!&quot;<br>
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm here to see you silly!&quot;<br>
&quot;I was just thinking about you Ella...&quot;<br>
&quot;I know...that's why I'm here. I've been thinking about you a lot too. You notice anything...odd going on lately?&quot;<br>
&quot;Waking up at night feeling things you do not understand...&quot;<br>
&quot;Pain that comes all of a sudden from no where...&quot;<br>
&quot;The visions...&quot;<br>
&quot;The nightmares...&quot;<br>
&quot;People..&quot;<br>
&quot;Places..&quot;<br>
&quot;Events..&quot;<br>
&quot;Past...&quot;<br>
&quot;Present..&quot;<br>
&quot;Future..&quot; The last word was spoken by both of them, in a whisper barely audible. The night would be a long one; filled with talk of things that had happen, things they hoped for, things they wanted. A bond was strengthened during this time, a bond that would prove vital in the times to come. The next morning Dahnyella would sneak out the window, she would take a path that led to a small cottage in the forest where she would be safe, warm, and not alone. This was Bellona's house, the house Aeaweien built for her, the house she would live in for only a short time.<br>
*****<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The forest air was cool, frigid winds blew in from far off lands. It was the kind of cold that invaded you, took you by surprise and made the skin on the back of your neck crawl. The air was bitter, like the forgotten. Bellona stands outside, the wind blowing her hair back, the coldness seeping into her skin, her soul. Out of the cottage door walks Aeaweien, a blanket in his hands. A smile dances on his lips and brightens his eyes as his eyes look through the depths of his loves soul. He wraps his arms around Bellona from behind, the blanket covering her, warming her instantly. However she does not move, barely acknowledging Aeaweien's presence. Other things consume her thoughts.<br>
&quot;Something wrong Love?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, nothing&quot; Bellona tilts her head back and rests it on Aeaweien's shoulder. A smile slinking across her lips, turning around she faces Aeaweien, his warm loving arms holding her close. He rubs his hands up and down her back, the chill leaves her. She stares into his eyes, her own glittering like the clear ocean just after sunset. She leans forward and puts a hand gently on his stomach. Sweetly and quietly she whispers, &quot;Dato nell'avversione..&quot; A pain starts in Aeaweien’s stomach, it grows into something unbearable. Nothing in battle could have ever compared to this. His knees give way to the pain, the only thing holding him up are Bellona's small, yet strong arms. The pain spreads, slowly like a tidal wave of suffering it begins to flow through out his body. It does not stop until every inch of him stings, beats, pounds with unimaginable pain. All of him gives in, into the hurt, into the betrayal that beats through his chest. Bellona’s arms fall to her sides, releasing Aeaweien, letting him fall to the dirt ground. He stares up, and nothing and everything, taking all in. Bellona’s palm turns up to the sky as her hand rests comfortably near her stomach. Her voice calm, holding no emotions, she explains all her actions, all her reasons in a simple phrase, &quot;Il mio amore...e' avversione&quot;. Above her hand, a ball of glowing red symbols appear, those symbols shine over Aeaweien’s chest. As she closes her hand into a fist, the symbols explode, but leave no visible damage on Aeaweien. They damage his life shade, which flees from his body. His life ended in a moment, taken by the one he wanted to spend it with....<br>
*****<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Teir'Dal man stands out against the night’s darkened hue. His skin is lighter than most Teir'Dals, his hair as colorless as any other. Pale robes covered his body, making his skin seem a shade or two darker than it really was. As he exhaled a puff of white mist formed in front of his lips. Frost tips the blades of grass at his feet. Early morning sun peeks above the mountains of lavastorm. Life’s changing paths had kept him from Teir'Dal soil for quite sometime. It felt both good and unsettling to be back on his homelands. A flowing green aura surrounds hid body, a sweet voice whispers in the wind so quietly that most others would discard it as nothing. For a moment his fiery eyes shine blue with a plus of mana. The voice stops, all is still. Standing with his back against a tree, he waits. His knees weaken a moment, a buzzing pain slices through his mind. Leaning against the tree for support, he feels another’s surrounding darkness. His heart beat rings in his ears, what was that? Touching his cheek, he feels moister. Looking down at his hand, he sees his own blood. Wiping more of it away he releases there is no cut, his cheek simply started bleeding...but why? Beginning to concentrate with every ounce of strength in his body, he calls the person who caused this pain. &lt;Are you alright?&gt; No answer.... &lt;What is wrong? Is everything ok?&gt; Silence still...He tries to search with his mind, searching the soul of the one who remains mute...but he finds nothing when he should find everything. His eyes snap open. Normally icy cold eyes become wide with the unknowing, and darken with what may be.<br>
*****<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yuzuha’s stomach turns, twisting with a stinging sensation. The sun shines down from high above the Plains of Karana. Green grass grows as far as the eyes can see. A few trees grow scattered here or there, very few however. Clouds drift by, hinting that there will soon be a rain. Shielding her eyes from the sun while holding her hand to her stomach, Yuzuha’s mind can only wonder of what awaited at home. Was everyone all right? Training and errands had taken her presents from the Kali household and away from her daughter. Telus and Bellona both are off somewhere, fighting the holy as well as each other, nothing ever changes. As for Mindles, Aeaweien, Lugabug, and Dahnyella, she did not know. Mindles and Lugabug were most likely in the Lake of Ill Omen, hunting Iksars. She did not care what Aeaweien was doing. It seemed that after he became engaged to Bellona, Yuzuha did not trust him, nor respect him. He had to earn those things; no man would be good enough for her daughter, especially not a light walker. Thinking of Aeaweien gone or dead brought a smirk to Yuzuha’s face. However he IS engaged to Bellona...Yuzuha knew she could not change that. Her mind wondered, it could not let go of the thought of Bellona. What was she doing? Was she ok? Yuzuha wanted to know, wanted to be with her daughter to ensure that no harm would come to her. By now Yuzuha was very worried, her footsteps quicken along the dusty path. Nothing would stand in her way...nothing.<br>
*****<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bellona's eyes flutter open. Her mind is fuzzy, her vision blurred. She tries to sit up, but the weight of pain on her body is too much, her head falls back down. One day runs into another, each minute seems like hours. Slowly, avoiding as much pain as possible, she looks from side to side. Is it day or night? There is not telling. Grey walls encircle her; from where she lays she can see no door, and no windows. Torchlight is the only thing allowing her to see the plain walls. A cream colored hand reaches out, it gently wipes away strands of her hair that have been stained with her blood. Bellona opens her mouth to speak; she cannot find her voice. Her lips open and close, but no sound is heard. Her throat is swollen and numb. The hand pushes on her chin, making her mouth open wider. A cool liquid flows down her throat soothing it and wetting her dry tongue. The hand remains on her chin, a few bottles clink and then another liquid is poured into her mouth, this one warmer than before. It has a sweet taste. The sweetness turns into a metallic after taste, like copper. Her stomach growls, begging for food even though it has received the purest kind of nourishment. Bruises are scattered all over her body, each one hurting more than the next. The hand places a final thing in her mouth, some sort of leaf. The leaf dissolves on contact with her tongue, swallowing hard; the remains of it painfully glide down to her stomach. As if the pain that she was in was not enough, her stomach tightens with all her muscles. Whoever was in the room with her rolls her onto her side. Bellona starts to cough violently, blood drips from her lips. A more intense pain stabs her chest. The unknown person rubs her back gently, calming her cough. Slowly the hands roll her to her back again. The numbing pain in her head lets the darkness in, letting go of reality she slips into her dreams, her thoughts, her subconscious. **It was there, in her thoughts that she finds refuge from her pains. She sinks down, lower and lower into her mind and soul, reaching its full depths. Hate...it was like she had struck a nerve that had been long since buried. Since she was a child she hated, but not like this. Somewhere she had kept her Hate buried, the hate that is instilled in every Teir'Dal since the time their souls are created, the hate that was once a part of their Dark Lord, their Father - Innoruuk. Dormant until now, she relit the flames that are the rage in every Teir'Dal heart, the thing that drives them to do the unspeakable, and laugh at the unthinkable. Maybe it was her injured state, or maybe it was the fact it had taken her so long to find this hate, but it all was not awakened. There still lay quiet a lot of hate in her that was untouched. It would take a lot more than a soul searching to bring this hate to the surface, but it would be done because she knew it was there. Her mind was pulled back, the things she had thought about, her past, all zipped past and she was awake again. She is sitting up, her back against a wall for support. The walls are still as blank as ever, but there is a table that holds the dried drippings of blood over its surface. Bellona had been on this table. Off to the side was a long table; it was lower than the table Bellona had been, that is why she could not see it before. This long table was lined with bottles, vials, bags, leaves, roots, animal parts, potions, poisons, everything imaginable. Laboratory? Research? Potion making? Bellona could not be sure what it was. Bellona attempts to stand, her palms pushing on the ground, her knees bending ever so slightly. The pain that sings through all her muscles is too great, and she lets her legs and arms go limp once more. Her eyes shift down, her armor has been replaced with a very large tan tunic that reaches her knees and a tan belt that makes it look almost like a shabby dress that one would find an ally walker wearing. The tunic is stained with dried black blood. Bellona relishes that she is alone, what happened to the person that was here? There are no windows, no doors, so how did they get out?<br>
<br>
**********<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yuzuha woke up with a start, a wave of hate washing over her like a warm breeze. Her mind runs over what it could be, but it comes to her, Bellona. It was Bellona. Who knew what this meant, she could be in trouble, she could be dead for all Yuzuha knew. Yuzuha would find out, she would be without her daughter no longer. The inn room that Yuzuha slept in is small, a table, chair, desk, and bed. Throwing the covers from her, Yuzuha, fully clothed, grabs her things and storms out of the door. (Yuzuha never did like sleeping in inns, so why would she change into sleeping robes when her everyday ones where thicker and would keep more of the bed sheets thilth from touching her?). The sun is almost blinding, the surroundings have the same light glow. The Common lands always held that glow, and Yuzuha has always hated it. Disregarding the path she runs along a mountainside, the break should be coming soon. Two mountains that are parallel to each other, un-touching, have become a passageway to Nektulos, the shortest way home. Stopping in the middle of this passage, Yuzuha's hands start to shimmer white. Her voice softens as she begins to chant in a dark tongue. As her voice fades, her whole body begins to shimmer, and with her voice, she too fades into silence. The guards never did like her now that her skin was light, which is why she always has to run to her home in secret, yet another thing she despised. With the guards out of sight, she pulls a large bottle from her bags and takes a quick sip, her feet glitter dimly, her movements quicken and she runs much faster than she did before. Her house only a few feet off, Yuzuha is stopped by the sword with a guard’s hand clutching its hilt. Smirking mischievously, Yuzuha's eyes shine red, a red only a few shades lighter than her crimson hair. Lifting one of her palms toward the sky, dark clouds circle overhead. A blinding flash of lightning strikes Yuzuha's hand. She turns to the guard, her palms pulsing with energy. Another blinding flash. When the light fades, the guard’s armor is blackened and burnt to a crisp, the heat burning his skin. He is still alive, but barely. The ground beneath him begins to shake, green root fly up and wrap around his legs and upper torso. Yuzuha's sticks her pointer finger up towards the sky, a smile playing on her lips as a single spark of fire dances on her fingertip. She blows on it, and it floats towards the roots. Almost like they had been dowsed in gasoline, the roots go up in flames, the guard still held in place, burns alive. His screams of death are the sweetest music to Yuzuha's ears, but they lighten her mood only a few moments, she still has Bellona to find. She is at the porch to her house in no time at all, flinging the door open, she finds silence. Running through each room she releases everyone is gone. The sunlight catches something on the floor...Bellona's Regent symbol. Next to it was a small puddle of black and a small piece of cloth. Yuzuha knew the cloth, and knew where Bellona was and that was the reason she ran...ran as fast as she could...<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A tree...in the middle of a silent forest. Darkness and shadows creep around like spirits in agony. A mist fills the air that is not consumed by shadowing shade. The bark of the tree is smooth; warn down by time and wind. Cries in the distance and screams in the night are the only sounds that can be heard. The weeping branches of the tree hang low with age. On the bark a bloody handprint drips, still wet, still fresh with the sent of its maker.<br>
********<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bellona looks around the room once more, like she thinks there is something else, something she is not seeing, or not noticing. She tilts her head back against the wall. ~'God, if only I could cast...If only this pain would leave my head I could concentrate and heal myself'~ Thinking those words hurt her whole body, she was sensitive to everything. Opening her eyes, she sees a figure. A puff of white powder drops down in front of her. She breaths it in and rips at her lungs to the point where she cannot even cough or exhale. Her eyelids lower, the surge of pain is going to make her pass out, but not before she sees this person. Getting only a glimpse of their face, Bellona’s eyes close more. Just as her mind starts to shut down, she whispers, &quot;Dreyan...&quot;<br>
<br>
********<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A human man, a monk, holds a small Teir'Dal girl in his arms. He throws her up into the air and she yells happily. The girl could not be more than five. He catches her and spins her around. Giggling sweetly she wraps her arms around his neck, her crystal eyes glittering with happiness. Off to the side, another Human man who looks similar to the one with the girl, stands next to a Teir'Dal woman who looks like an older version of the girl, his arm is wrapped around the woman’s shoulders. Smiling at the sight of the child and monk, he speaks to the woman, &quot;God, look at him. He treats her like she is his daughter. I don't think I have seen him this happy in a while&quot;<br>
&quot;Look how happy he makes her. I wish she could have met her Uncle sooner&quot; The woman smiles, a small laugh escaping her mouth as she watches the monk tickle the child’s tummy and laugh right along with the little one. The sun shines down, warming the little girl’s cheeks, which are deep violet with laughter. It would be years until the girl would see this man again. 'Little does she know, he will become a big part of her life in the years to come, and he will take on an even bigger role when she needs help the most...'<br>
*********<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grey walls stand strong against the dieing torchlight. The dim lights give the room a mysterious look. It is warm..Bellona was so numb with pain before that she did not notice the temperature, but now she felt warmth. Her sight was foggy, and consisted of blurs, no matter how bad her vision was, she recognized the flames in front of her, she was laid out next to a fire. It was warm and welcoming. Breathing in deep, the soothing aroma of herbs and incense filled Bellona's lungs. Her head felt light, almost like she was detached from her body. The man from before slips a satin scarf over her eyes and ties it in the back. Bellona tries to move, but her body is held down by something. Her breathing was deep, something was pressing down on her chest. A tingling sensation trembles throughout her body. Whispered voices can be heard from all sides. She understood a few, some she had never heard before. A single voice rises above the rest. A deafening scream ends all the rest. Bellona presses her body against the wooden table, the shrill scream echoing in her ears. A whisper, barely audible, says sweetly in her ear, &quot;Il mio caro, il vostro destino ha arived.  Greet esso con un cuore indurito e una mente sapere&quot;.<br>
&quot;Paradise!&quot; A feeling that some person was in the room leaves Bellona. Struggling to remove the ropes that hold her down, she calls out, &quot;Paradise! Can you not see that I need you? Do not just leave me here! Come back!&quot; <br>
&quot;Sguardo entro...&quot;<br>
&quot;Speranza è persa con paradise andato...&quot; Those words rose and sank in Bellona's mind. Those were the last things she thought about before all went black once more...<br>
******<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yuzuha runs through the gates of Freeport. The mid-day sun beats down on her back making her robes hot to the touch. Beads of sweat gather on her forehead. One thing is all she thinks of, breathes, wishes, wants, that thing is Bellona. Knowing Freeport like the back of her hand Yuzuha jogs toward the Temple of Life. Marrs children would pay once she found her daughter. Yuzuha can only hope that Bellona is still alive. Something stops her...a familiar man. Catching her breath, she looks him over. Could it really be..?<br>
&quot;Brother?&quot;<br>
The man gives no response, but he turns around, looking over the great buildings that stand near. Yuzuha's heart sinks, it is not him. A small, quiet voice answers her questions, &quot;Find one half, and you find the second. The docks of Eastern Freeport harbor a force greater than they know&quot;.<br>
&quot;Who...&quot; That voice could have come from anyone, dozens of people buzz around Freeport, walking around Yuzuha, it was impossible to tell who said it. It did not matter who said it, Yuzuha had to get to the docks. Taking in a deep breath, Yuzuha runs again. Her feet move with the speed of ten men. Sliding a few feet, Yuzuha rushes through the doors of a tavern.<br>
&quot;Dahnyella!&quot;<br>
Dahnyella turns from her seat at the bar, her eyes filled with tears.<br>
&quot;Dahnyella, what is wrong, Child?&quot;<br>
&quot;I...I...I don't know!&quot;<br>
Her voice seems separated, as if it is not one voice, but two. What was going on? Someone taps Yuzuha's shoulder. Spinning around, Yuzuha growls angrily, &quot;What do you want?&quot; It was Undeen...He had once been a friend of Yuzuha, but he recently joined Tunares forces. A Teir'Dal worshiping Tunare...he was a rare sight indeed. <br>
&quot;Greetings to you as well, Yuzuha...&quot;<br>
His voice was the same as Dahnyella’s.<br>
&quot;Am I going mad....”? <br>
&quot;Not that I can tell...It has been a long time since we have talked last. How have you been?&quot;<br>
&quot;I...I..Uhh, Fine, yourself?&quot;<br>
Undeen’s words fades into the background, everyone’s voices seem distant, all but the second voice that drones on in the background. Slowly its volume begins to rise. The words become clear, but not what they mean. <br>
&quot;Sguardo entro.....Look within....&quot;<br>
Undeen’s hand on her shoulder brings Yuzuha back from an altered state of mind. <br>
&quot;Something wrong, Yuzuha?&quot;<br>
&quot;Look within...what does it mean?&quot;<br>
&quot;Umm, you would like to rent a room perhaps?&quot;<br>
&quot;The rooms...she is in the rooms!&quot; Yuzuha pushes drunks and bar wenches out of her way, her feet pounding on the wooden floor announcing that people need to move, and now. Every time she pushes one person out of the way, another steps in her path. The bar was filled to the brim with people. Yuzuha stops, her anger rising. People mill around her, some even knock into her. Taking a deep breath, she closes her eyes. <br>
&quot;OUT OF MY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY!&quot; Yuzuha's body is lifted off the ground, her hair floats behind her. Her body glows an eerie red that seems to absorb all energy in the room. The light intensifies, blinding everyone. The light falls, and Yuzuha's aura is left a shocking red that is brighter than any sun. She glances around, everyone is unconscious on the floor, she had taken their energy, and now her body radiated with it. <br>
&quot;Yuzuha....what is going on?&quot;<br>
&quot;I have to find my Daughter&quot; For reasons unknown Undeen was completely unaffected. Like a being of the Otherworld, Yuzuha drifts up the stairs, her feet inches from the ground. As she passes a table it crumbles to the ground. Dust fills the air, as it is now nothing but a pile of powder. The walls bend and groan, avoiding her touch or merely bending at the feel of her power. <br>
&quot;Sguardo entro....&quot;<br>
The voice comes once more from a room. Spinning on her heels Yuzuha slams the door open. As she flies into the room, the door hits the ground with a load thud and a square on the floor jumps. She kneels down, inspecting the square. 'heh, a trap door...quiet clever' Her skin never touches the wood, but the door still opens. Standing up, Yuzuha steps over the square, her body glides down into the secret room. The walls are the colors of Karana’s clouds, blank, emotionless, gray...As her feet touch the ground, the torches flare up, lighting every inch of the room. Yuzuha's eyes are pulled to the table located in the center of the small room, just two feet away from where she stands. <br>
&quot;Bellona!&quot;<br>
Her daughter lies, strapped down, to the table. She rushes to her side. Bellona is not awake. There is a large cut on her cheek; it is deep and uncared for. Where it once had bled there is now dried blood. Bellona's tunic also holds her blood. With her razor sharp nail, Yuzuha cuts open Bellona's tunic at the stomach. Someone had cut into Bellona's symbol, traced with a blade, and left her to die. Yuzuha, a Wizard, knew little of how to help. Pulling bandages from her pocket, she covered Bellona's wounds, tears streaming down her cheeks. Without a Cleric it is doubtful that Bellona will live. Yuzuha looks up at the ceiling, her cheeks wet with salty tears of sorrow and anger.<br>
&quot;DAMN YOU INNORUUK!! YOU TAKE MY IDENTITY AND STEAL MY DAUGHTER FROM ME! YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS WITH THE BLOOD OF YOUR CHILDREN, AND THE ENERGY THAT HAS BECOME YOUR SOUL!!&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
With those words Yuzuha pledged that she would defeat Innoruuk and slay his children for all the wrongs he had put her through, even if she did swear her life in his service. <br>
&quot;Un Kali non e sconfitto fancilmente....&quot;<br>
Those words came from the darkness, the shadows...but there was no face to match the voice. <br>
&quot;Come out, coward! Show yourself! I will not lie to you; your death shall be slow and agonizing. I shall kill you in ways you never thought possible. Your soul shall vanish from the Otherworld, never again to be reborn...Make this easier on both of us and leave your shadowy camouflage&quot;<br>
&quot;Dreyan...&quot; Bellona coughs, her head turns to the side and blood drips from the corner of her mouth.<br>
&quot;Dreyan?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yuzuha...&quot;<br>
&quot;Dreyan! You did this?&quot;<br>
&quot;Bellona is my blood, I would never bring harm to her in anyway&quot;<br>
&quot;Then what are you doing here, why have you not healed her, and who did do this?!&quot;<br>
&quot;I am keeping her alive. I have not healed her because then she would be like you, and want revenge on the people who did this even though she cannot defeat them. Marrs worshipers did this...&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you know exactly who?&quot;<br>
&quot;A young girl, near Bellona's age. She carried a large bastard sword with the symbol of Marr on the hilt. There was a symbol of Marr on her armor, on her heart as well. She was half-elven.&quot;<br>
&quot;Dreyan...&quot; Bellona's arms jerk forward, and then are brought back to the hard surface of the table. Yuzuha notices that her hand in clenched in a fist, like she is holding something.<br>
&quot;What is in her hand?&quot;<br>
&quot;I have no idea...&quot;<br>
Someone yells from above, &quot;What the hell is going on? Who's down there?&quot;<br>
A young woman with skin the color of a tainted sea, jumps into the now silent room. A sword is held tight on her back. She stands ready to attack either Yuzuha or Dreyan. Her lips are pressed thin, her teeth grind together. Her most stunning feature is her wings. Large, jet-black wings, like the night predator that hunts near the gates of Freeport during the dark hours, she keeps them tucked behind her. &quot;Who are you?&quot; The woman’s eyes narrow, searching their faces, taking in their character. Her eyes focus on Yuzuha, whose aura gleams brighter.<br>
&quot;I am Yuzuha Kali, this is my Brother in law, Dreyan.&quot;<br>
&quot;A Kali...&quot; The Teir'Dal woman takes a knee respectfully. &quot;In my circles I have heard tales of the Kali's. Never in my life did I imagine my path would cross with one, let alone a woman... My name is Andy. Knight of Shadow in the high circle of Neriak. If I can be of any assistance - &quot;<br>
Andy is cut short by Bellona's blood curtailing scream. There is a surge of force and Dreyan, Yuzuha, and Andy are slammed against the wall. The rope fall from her, and Bellona begins to levitate, her body surrounded by a violet light. As suddenly as she started, her screams stop. <br>
&quot;Bellona? BELLONA!&quot;  Yuzuha scrambles to her feet and her daughters side. &quot;What is going on?! This does not happen! This is something out of a dream, a nightmare!&quot;<br>
&quot;Her soul wishes to leave..&quot; Andy rubs her head and pushes herself to a stand shakily, &quot;but something holds her back.&quot;<br>
&quot;But her aura still shines...&quot;<br>
&quot;Her soul, not her aura. A mix of Hate and Darkness; red and midnight.&quot;<br>
&quot;She...she...she's dead?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, but she should be&quot;<br>
&quot;Dreyan?..... Dreyan.... for Innoruuk’s sake say something Dreyan!!&quot;<br>
&quot;I...I....&quot; Dreyan bows his head, a tear streaming down his cheek and dripping from his chin to the floor. He had failed... <br>
&quot;M'lady Kali, Sir Dreyan... she is not dead, do not mourn for her. Something is keeping her here, until that thing is gone, she will live&quot;.<br>
Yuzuha closes her eyes. She breathes deep, regaining a state of calmness. A woman screams from the bar room, a scream identical to Bellona’s. Yuzuha’s eyes snap open, her aura intensifying. Her crimson energy mixes with the violet of Bellona’s, and their auras become one. A sudden burst of green entwines itself in theirs. Yuzuha’s body falls to the ground, and Bellona no longer levitates. A hum of three voices sings a sweet and shady song. One voice blends with the next, and one is heard.<br>
&quot;Song of Sin...&quot; Andy’s mouth gaps open.<br>
Dreyan looks up, his eyes wide with astonishment, &quot;Look...&quot; His voice trails off as he stares at the scene before him. The energies have taken on their own forms. They look like people, royal, angelic, and demonic all at once. Their movement is inspiring; it infuses the soul with feelings no mortal of this world has ever experienced. The colors of these energies brighten, their features become more visible. All three have Teir'Dal features and are 'dressed' in ancient cloth. Joining hands, the energies take part in a ritualistic dance. Each step injecting the by standers minds with new, unknown ideas, feelings, and happenings. A wind blows, and the energies are smeared across the air. Through the bending of the hues, a symbol is shown. <br>
*entro*<br>
The word vibrates in their minds. The energies sink into the ground, the singing continues. With each passing second, the notes from the song heal Bellona ever so slightly. Her cuts close, her bruises fade. She lurches forward and gasps for breath. <br>
&quot;Dreyan!?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm here love, I'm here&quot; <br>
Dreyan embraces Bellona tightly, stroking her hair and rocking her back and forth. Yuzuha stands up as if nothing happened and smiles at her daughter. <br>
&quot;I finally understand...&quot; She places an arm around Andy’s shoulder and beams at the sight of her daughter and Brother. <br>
&quot;I'm sorry Belle, I'm so sorry...&quot; <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;...The city of men shall fall...&quot;<br>
Yuzuha's words are cold and spiteful. She sits across from Bellona in their living room, her high backed chair casting shadows on her fair skin making her seem far more evil than any other Koada'Dal. The room holds an eerie silence. Dahnyella sits to Bellona's left, on a couch in between Mindles and Undeen. Andareil sips a glass of Neriak nectar nervously where she sits on the floor, the fireplace warming her back. Telus stands off to the side, separated from the rest. <br>
&quot;If I want your help, I will ask for it&quot; Bellona's faze never leaves the floor, even as she speaks.<br>
&quot;Do not fight me on this, child. You will not win&quot;<br>
&quot;And YOU will not assist me in finding this girl&quot;<br>
&quot;You have no choice&quot;<br>
&quot;Do NOT tell me what to do!&quot;<br>
Slamming her fists on the arm rests; Yuzuha rises and glares at Bellona. <br>
&quot;Someone talk some sense into this child, I do not have the time for it.&quot; <br>
She walks out of the room and to her own. The silence settles once more. Mindles takes the chair Yuzuha had been sitting in. It was obvious that it was taking all his strength not to run to Freeport and tear through ever paladin there with his bear hands. Silence is the only thing holding in his rage. Undeen, like Bellona, stares down at the floor angrily; he is the first to speak.<br>
&quot;Dreyan shall be returning soon... then we will plan our attack on Freeport&quot;<br>
&quot;WE will not be doing anything...&quot;<br>
&quot;Close your mouth, Girl. You have no say in this matter.&quot;<br>
Wanting to change the subject, Bellona looks to her Father.<br>
&quot;Father? You are quiet...&quot;<br>
&quot;They will die… all of them… each and everyone…” <br>
Mindles's deep brown eyes sting with hate. Each person looks around the room at the faces of everyone else. They all shared his hate. If nothing else, the one thing they all had in common was their hate. Tomorrow would be the darkest day for man...<br>
<br>
