<br>
Would it not make more sense to go on SCHEDULED days to avoid this so called @#%$.  I will say that I highly doubt Tunzell trained you, as I was grouped with his chanter for most of the night this went down, and all he had been doing for the past days with his monk is sit there FD and watching to see the Shissar shouts.  He would have no reason to train you people, as far as you seeing him do this, did you not say there were others monks there, did you see his specific &quot;Zend... has fallen to the ground message&quot;, or did you just see some monk, and by your own admission &quot;wears a fungi tunic which just about every other monk on the server wears&quot;.  Could it not be that the other monks in the zone possibly did this.  We know it wasn't just you up there, we know that you did not have 18 up there which is what is needed to &quot;per the summit&quot; call it FiF, I don't care if you can break it with 5 people, we can break it with that many too, but that is beside the point as its not what the summit says.  <br>
<br>
In the end though this post was really to point out that single quote.  Would it not just be easier to schedule a planes trip, and not have to deal with anyone else?  <br>

The three days of FiF/FFA were put in there to allow people more chances to get what they needed from the Planes.  If someone got trained in WW or PoG, would you post that &quot;Well, you shouldn't have been there then?&quot;.  If this post was about two Guilds that headed up there at the same time and were now catfighting about who got there first, then you might be making a valid point.  But there was nobody there except a couple FD Monks from what I see posted.  Nobody else here seems to be saying that DoW didn't have any right to be up there.  DoW's complaint is that with all the extra roamers it already takes them working efficiently to break it, and when somehow @#%$ gets trained all over them, their day is gonna suck.  But wait, it gets better then that.<br>
<br>
Then, rather then starting a big public flame, they just tell the Monk where to stick it.  If the Monk had nothing to feel guilty about, why not just blow it off?  Kunzell chose to start this so that we could all hear HIS side.  Fatty and some others posted how things went down from their perspective.  Ever seen someone arrested during a civil disturbance?  If they weren't caught on tape they say &quot;I didn't do anything, I was just standing there, I'm innocent I tell ya.  And besides, I'm in a good Guild and we would never do anything like that&quot;.  That crap doesn't fly here anymore then it would in most courtrooms.  When @#%$ hits the fan in a zone, whether or not you had anything to do with it, if you're somewhere where they can see you and they get unexplainable adds, they're going to blame you.<br>
<br>
And I am a little confused here.  Kunzell, you say you were halfway across the zone if I read you right.  Kaurik says that one of the people dying targetted you with %t.  Is there some spell that they had cast on themselves that let them see you all the way across the zone, through the hills and buildings and such that let them target you?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarisai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arisai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 9:29:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  !</span><hr size=1> I think what people need to realize is that Kaurik is joking around 100% of the time.

<br>
Dalynia, what are you talking about?  Where did you get your 'facts'.  Where in this entire thread did it say that DoW had 18 people?  Where in this entire thread did I rufuse to go?  How do you know that your alleged TD SK was /guildremoved for such behaviour?  Oh wait, reading what you put down there leads me to belive that you aren't even sure that the SK is not TD anymore.  I guess the actual facts are just to much to deal with eh?  BTW it's Balfor HonorBOUND that you refer to not Honorblade, no biggie, just an example of how close you seem to pay attention to detail.  You're right that he's a great guy though.  Look, I have run into many Amici peeps, you guys are great, I wish you no ill will.  You just need to read everything before you post things as facts.  Either way, Wolfypaw was going off the facts that were presented to him here, and made an edjucated stand.  I think you owe him an apology, but that's just my take.<br>
<br>
Ugle, the arguement of why would someone innocent of such accusations publicly exclaim it is just plain stupid.  Now you've changed your arguement on this thread with nearly every single post.  Each time I counter, you change whatever your issure is, and drop the previous one.  There's no point in my addressing you any further.  Dakin is right, they should schedule a raid if they don't want to deal with others being there.<br>
<br>
As for me being targeted, my guess is this.  Subject gets trained by a monk; subject sends a tell to monk A, with no response; subject sends a tell to monk B, then recieves a 'wasn't me' reply; subject decides that monk A is the culprit and makes up the targeting issue to gain support.  Now that it's turned into a big deal, for subject to admit what he's done would be much harder then just sticking to his story and trying to save some kind of dignity.  I guess someone is saying that he did a %t just trained me before death, but that's impossible since I wasn't there.  So maybe he had the time before death to do the /who.  Dunno, but one and/or several of them are FoS somewhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubalforh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BalforH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 2:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sorry DoW!</span><hr size=1> Howdy all:<br>
 Well after following this thread for several days I thought I might jump in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Im not sure how but this thread has evolved into such a heated topic but it has. The premiss was simple, Tunzell felt he had been falsely accussed and simply wished to clear his name. Personally I would have ignored it.<br>
<br>
 1. I have know Zendareth/Tunzell for a very long time, I can state with complete confidence that he did not do what he was acussed of doing.<br>
 <br>
 2. Having a monk FD in the zone on none scheduled days does not violate any guidelines set forth by the summit. If the zone is claimed by a guild (having sufficient forse to do so as set forth by the summit) said guild can request that the afore mention monk the vacate/q.<br>
<br>
 3. As Tunzell previously stated he was not the only char in the zone awaiting the spawn of the everelusive shissar.<br>
<br>
 4. Dalynia..thank you for your kind words. I wish I had thought of Honorblade I like it better then Honorbound <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
