<br>
(( the letter is written on decent paper, not high quality velium or anything silly ))<br>
<br>
To the Lady Ankhami Vlos`dAthiak<br>
<br>
  Lady, I regret to inform you .. but it's come to my attention that you're currently holding my older brother as a slave. I'm quite perturbed at such and action and wish to have him returned to our family.<br>
<br>
  As such I see three options, First the family could  refund you your purchase price, I'm sure if we  sold grand mothers jewelry, and a few of the cattle we might have enough to do this. Second if you were to require a servant, I could serve some of his tenure, perhaps a year or so, to allow him the time he needs to straighten up the farm, also I could serve you during, the planting and harvesting seasons after that. Third of course, and something that I have considered is to  just do violence to you, then steal my brother back from you.<br>
<br>
 The latter option I rather dislike thinking about, but if such an action is required, then so be it.<br>
<br>
 Lady I do look forward to a speedy answer, else I shall have to take a more direct route to freeing my brother. I would hope this can be worked out in an peaceful manner.<br>
<br>
Tullari Har'Genath<br>

Upon reaching her room she placed her wepons and bag away and sat down near the hearth. Turning the letter over in her hands, she decided to open it.<br>
Quickly scanning the contents, she chuckled softly to her self. How would one respond to such a letter? Should she even respond at all? What she did with the human was no ones business, the fact that he was in her care now and not with Ssinjin, was better for him anyways. He was alive at least. And last she heard, was going to be released from the slave pens in Neriak. She muttered under her breath about foolish humans. <br>
Getting up she went over to her desk, and placed the parchment in a pile of work that needed to be done.

<br>
  Tullari , paced back and forth, it'd been a week and still no sign of an offer to free her ( half ) brother. She fumed , and paced some more. <br>
<br>
  Then she decided to take action, if her brother needed freeing, well then she'd just have to do it. Taking the box of family jewelry, thinking fond thoughts of her dead grandmother, who she hoped wouldn't haunt her for this. She set off from Qeynos , as an after thought she went back inside and changed into her best attire, though that was really just a less torn shirt, and leather breaches that had a few studs of moon ore on them for decoration.<br>
<br>
  She glared and walked forward with purpose, taking the  cow, and the jewelry to the shady part of Qeynos, were she ended up having to trade half of the jewelry to find out the location of the &quot;Harvesters of Darkness&quot;<br>
<br>
 More trudging, and pulling the cow along she crossed the expanse of the  hills of Qeynos, to the  rolling farmlands of the Karannas she made sure to stay on the road walking with this guard and that until she saw the spires, the ones that would take her to the town that  housed that evil evil person that had her brother.<br>
<br>
  Her knees knocked together as she walked up to the estate that homed the Harvesters. Looking at the  pikes the gate guards wielded she almost ran off. She wanted to say &quot; I'm here for my brother, send him out ! &quot; , what came out was &quot;eap &quot; <br>
<br>
  The steely eyed guard looked up and down the peasant girl with the cow , &quot; We don't give hand outs , what's your business here, before I have you run off. &quot;<br>
<br>
 She gulped , &quot; I'm  .. I'm  here to see Lady Ankhami , about personal matters. &quot;<br>

Ankhami rose her head from the paper work she was doing and sat back, slightly amazed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>MOOOO</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There it was again. This was worth investigating, a cow in Shadow Haven?<br>
Rising from her desk, she quickly made her way down to the foyer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>MOOOO</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It was coming from right out side. Ankhami blinked and opened the front doors. She could see the guards, conversing with what looked to be a human female, holding a rope to a cow. A servant was running towards the steps of the manor, looking quite dismayed.<br>
<br>
The young girl stopped in front of Ankhami and bowed deeply, then gesturing towards the gates, began to explain the situation.<br>
<br>
“Some girl wishes to see you, Priestess, says its urgent.” The servant pointed to the girl holding the cow.<br>
<br>
Ankhami looked over to the taller female, standing near the guards, then dismissed the servant, with orders to bring refreshments to the front hall.<br>
<br>
Walking to were the girl stood with cow, she ordered another servant to see to the housing of the beast. Sizing up the human she turned her back and began walking back towards the manor, throwing over her shoulder, “Follow, we have much to disscuss.”<br>

The spelendor of the place took her aback. It was beautiful in a sinister and evil sort of way. She's spend he life on a farm near the famous miller's. Then  once she's saved enough money managed to enroll in the Temple of Silence, a very earthly monk organization. The raw show of wealth danger and power here was intirguing.<br>
<br>
She looks at the  regal lady in front of her, the dark elf radiated power, and the hunger for more of it. Her step was that of a graceful predator, the dark elf was dangerous.<br>
<br>
&quot; Follow , we've much to discuss &quot; not a request  but a command.<br>
<br>
Tullari nodded her head slightly, then followed trying to keep her focus, she'd travelled a long way to get her brother back. She'd not let this one stand in her way, now if she  could only keep that resolve under those peirceing eyes.<br>
<br>
They came to the parlor with a few  nice snacks set about the table.<br>
<br>
&quot; Sit &quot; said the lady. again more of a command than request.<br>
<br>
Tullari almost  slipped into the seat without questing, but her training allowed her to atleast curtsie properly first.<br>
<br>
&quot; Why are you here wasteing my time, and what did you bring that thrice damned animal here for. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I seek the Lady Ankhami , I was told  that she holds my brother, I must  have him back. &quot;  she gulped, as the ice  cold eyes of power  burned into her. &quot; I've  brought everything the  familly can afford, our  cow , and these , *she dumps a small coin bag onto the table * * the coins are  faked anyone with any time with alot of money would know that. * <br>
&quot;I also sold my grandmothers jewlery to the guy that bid the most&quot; <br>
*nods* <br>
&quot;This is everything I can offer, what do you need to give me my brother back ? &quot;<br>
<br>
Tullari sits expecting a reply, in her mind she trys to rationalize  how she could  take this person out, she is a mster of unarmed combat ( well if you count getting a torn shirt and boot out the door trained )<br>

Sister, you must not be here. Our great grandfather did a great injustice to the lady here, and since his son, and his sons son are no longer in this realm, it falls to me to repay the debt that our family owes.<br>

Do not try to buy me back my dear sister, the only way you could is if you took my place, and the only way you can take my place is if I am no longer here.<br>

She'd broken his spirit and mind he was but a puppet  now.<br>
<br>
She turned and bolted to the door of the manor  house, running to kill the pain inside, running to escape the reality that her family was going to die, running to hide from her failure and herself.<br>
<br>
She wasn't watching were she was running, and made a few wrong turns, and ended up someplace she shouldn't be, the dark elves cackled as they dropped down on her with nets.<br>
<br>
&quot; One rothe fer Poyson's games &quot; was all she heard before the sap fell her to the ground.<br>
<br>
Oh ,, oh the pain, her eyes flicked open , she was on a grassy plain, looking on a throng of evil. She tried to escape her bonds only to be kicked in the side. &quot;Rothe , stay&quot; then another kick as the blood splattered from her face this time.<br>
<br>
She looked seeing the moon beginning to rise , red , there were shouts of &quot; Bloodmoon &quot; , &quot; kill them &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; People of Necropolis we gather, to celerate the blood moon, with a pact of evil peoples . &quot; shouted a green armored knight.<br>
<br>
&quot; The first God we honor is that with only Fear's name , bring out the first one to die. &quot;<br>
<br>
With her eye that wasn't bloodied she saw a palidan drug forward and brutally killed after he sucumm to fear.<br>
<br>
&quot; The second god we honor is that of War , Rallos Zek &quot;<br>
<br>
A hand jerked her to her feet, and threw her to the  ground in the blood pool that was the palidan.<br>
<br>
A massive ogre stood over her , &quot; Fight me bear, and u liv , if not u die to Zek &quot;<br>
<br>
A huge frothing bear growled over her , she tried to run the blood in her eye makeing her slip, she fell, and was played with by the bear. Her body shredded for the crowds ammusement.<br>
<br>
Tullari's copse lay there rotting in the heat of the next day, the Bloodmoon completed.

His breathing was deep, yet a carefull listener would note the slightly excellerated and ragged pitch to it. His eyes darted back and forth rapidly under his eye lids. His lips were curled in a slight frown as his mind rallied against the nightmares that haunted his sleep.<br>
<br>
A red moon was in the sky, there were many people gathered, all cloaked in shadows. Red eyes starring, laughing at him. His sister was there, laughing ad pointing at him. Her voice a notch higher then usual, a voice of pain as it mocked him, laughing at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't save me, we're going to die. The family will die, you killed us, you killed me.&quot;<br>
<br>
A soft moans escapes his lips as the dream replays in his head, over and over again. Each time ending with the claw of some beast reaching from the moon and snatching his sister away. He tries to scream, and yet he cannot. He tries to wake, but the potions hold is too great.<br>

He remains trapped in his personal nightmare, his personal hell, until well after the sun raises in the morning sky. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chaeslcassiline@harvestersofdarkness>Chaes LCassiline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/7/03 4:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A letter for Lady Ankhami Vlos'dAthiak</span><hr size=1> Sascha quietly slipped through the tall grass of the field, her nostrils flared at the coppery scent that filled her nose. Sascha knew well the scent of blood, and had almost gotten it down to an art, able to tell what kind of blood came from each race. Sascha lifted her head, releasing a burst of emotions that flooded into Chaes' senses.<br>
  Chaes caught the startledness, and disgust, emanating from his companion. Quickly, he tucked his ulak and katar onto his belt, drawing his knobbed staff off of his back smoothly, holding it in both hands as he silently, swiftly moved towards the sight that had repulsed Sascha.<br>
  What he saw was completely disgusting - a shredded body, dead for hours, judging by the stench. Chaes wrinkled his nose at the scent of rotting, molting flesh, which had not yet begun to fully decay.<br>
  &quot;Who could this be, Sascha..&quot; he murmured, looking quietly around the body. The grass had been stomped down, by multiple sets of feet, and a few burning pits had been dug into the ground, cold now. Obviously some sort of ritual. Chaes forced his disgust down and slid closer to the body, met with a touch of disapproval from Sascha.<br>
  &quot;You don't have to stay so close to me, Sascha. Especially not after this..&quot; Chaes examined the corpse quietly, running his fingers over the curving claws. Too big to be a tiger's, yet too poorly placed to be anything intelligent.<br>
  &quot;A bear,&quot; he said quietly after examining the cuts. Sascha padded a bit closer, nosing at a cut along the shoulder, then grimacing as she caught the magical essence that accompanied the claws.<br>
  &quot;An ogre's pet, then,&quot; Chaes murmured. He had little respect for the Primalists and Animists of the uncouth races, the Trolls with their alligators and the Ogres with their bears. Yet he did respect the enormous amount of strength the Ogres and their companions had.<br>
  &quot;Clearly a sacrifice, don'tyou think, Sascha?&quot; That brought another empathic burst from the tigress.<br>
  Chaes laid his hand quietly upon the corpse, quietly sending a burst of primal energy through the body. Disease was cleansed from the corpse, from the wounds that had been left open, though the repeated bursts drained him somewhat.<br>
  With a slight beckoning to the spirits whom fueled his magic, the primal essence of the magic shifted, quietly closing the wounds, though to close so many upon something that was not alive took almost all the rest of his magical reserves. Breathing heavily, Chaes slumped over a bit, looking quietly upon the human, making sure the cuts had healed. They had scabbed, of course - his healing magic wasn't nearly strong enough to heal cleanly. But she was in good enough shape now to be carried.<br>
  &quot;Come on, Sascha. Get to the temple and tell the Lady Ankhami, or the Lady Kerridwynn, that they'll need to help.&quot; Of course, that was a silly errand, but if Sascha showed up before him, they'd at least know something was up.<br>
  The tigress darted off, powerful legs carrying her across the field towards the Hall. Chaes slid his staff onto his back, making sure his weapons were secured, before picking the body up, laying it longways across his shoulders, one arm over her torso, the other over her legs. He took off at his full speed, which was considerably slower than Sascha, though still quite quick, his legs blessed with the speed of wolves. He just hoped that Ankhami or Kerridwynn was alert to Sascha's warning.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ankhami>Ankhami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Yath'tallar of Vengance<br>
