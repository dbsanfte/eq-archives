Shrugging off her heavy cloak, she leaned back in her chair and stretched like a cat.  Her booted foot knocked against one of her packs, bringing forth a muted clinking of well-wrapped bottles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, I almost forgot I was carrying this...Magpye has been busily brewing again...I'm sure she wouldn't mind my contributing the overflow to the party...&quot;<br>

I better hold on to some of the Halfling Stouters, Magpye and Snoww aren't far behind me, and they go though it like it was fruit juice.&quot;<br>

A mug of what seemed to be more stout was crammed into his hand as he was led to a man that needed a healing supposedly. He was shown to the wounded man and then the hostess darted off. The paladin scratched his head in confusion. His mind still burned with the prescence of the necromancer, he should not be allowed to come into such a happy place as this.

Laying a few pieces of platinum coin on the counter, he spoke. &quot;I will be more than happy to pay for the meal you've given me, but I cannot accept it. I never eat that which my hands haven't prepared, nor drink that which has not been brewed as such. I assure you it is no insult to your clearly superb skills in the kitchen or with a keg, but as you must understand I'm not one of the most loved mortals on this plane. Countless times now I've found poison slipped into perfectly good food or drink by those who would see me dead.&quot; He looked around the room before continuing. &quot;It's obvious there are more than a few here who wouldn't think twice about ridding themselves of my presence.&quot; Raising his voice now, so even those not in the room could head, he said what he hoped was the last thing he'd have to say to this group for the night. &quot;Know this, I carry no qualm with anyone here as of yet. I came to warm my bones and fill my stomach, nothing more. It would make me very unhappy if there was to be any sort of......discomfort aimed in my direction tonight. I am a light sleeper and my minion never sleeps, so don't think a cloak and dagger will do you much good either.&quot; <br>
<br>
Porizj turned back to his hostess. &quot;Now then, would you by chance have any cooking facilities I could use? I would also pay kindly if you had any unbutchered animals. I've known people to go as far as to have precut meat with poison in it on the chance one such as myself comes around. If you could direct me to your main well It would be appreciated. And I hope you don't mind that I always keep my pet with me, I find it deters would-be heroes from making sad mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walking towards the well, Porizj pondered the matters at hand. That dwarf was going to be trouble, this much was obvious. Though he hated wasting good money on fools, he pulled a small peridot from one of his pouches and began to weave a spell. As the peridot began to glow so did his skin. He could feel the protective shield forming around his very being, and at last solidifying as the peridot disappeared into the realm of death. &quot;A small price to pay, I suppose, to keep the meat on my bones one more night.&quot; Though this spell could not keep him entirely from harm, it could keep at least keep a dwarf from stabbing him in the back while he wasn't looking. His minion giggled gleefully, as it could read the minds of mortals, and was looking forward to the promise of blood should that paladin lose his manners.<br>
<br>
After a short walk Porizj found the well, got his pet to fill two large buckets with the clear water, and after checking to make sure it wasn't poisoned, went back into the building.<br>

Both had laughing green eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Iztariani,&quot; cried the first, smiling, &quot;trust you to find the one spot of comfort in a barren land!&quot;  The two halflings joined her at her table, Magpye bouncing energectically about in her chair as she twisted and turned to look around the room, smiling and waving at old friends.  Snoww edged a chair back into a shadowed corner, and sat, near vanishing except for her pale face and hands, hands oddly long-fingered and graceful for one so small.<br>
<br>
Iztariani smiled fondly down at her two diminuitive companions.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may find curling up in the fallen leaves 'neath a tree to be the height of comfort, young friend, and Snoww can make herself comfortable and nigh unseen on a barren field of broken stone, but I would rather dine and sleep in true comfort when the opportunity presents itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magpye grinned, then slung a bulging backpack onto the table, standing on her chair to pull forth many bundles from it.<br>
<br>
&quot;My little side trip was profitable...look, I found several nests of aviak eggs, and there was a cherry tree, too...and see the fine fish Snoww tickled out of the streams while I gathered wild vegetables, and dug roots, and snared rabbits...&quot;<br>
<br>
Iztariani smiled and laughed softly.  &quot;Ah, restocking your larder again...just be sure to keep any candies you make well hidden this time, I have a sweet tooth as you well know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magpye grinned back at her, &quot;Bah, and you can eat as many sweets as you like and remain skinny as my finger, while I work hard all day and am pudgy as a pigeon fattened for the pot.  Ah well, at least Snoww must suffer along with me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Snoww laughed softly..&quot;Really, sister?  Ah, but you forget my little charms and deceptions...&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a muted sparkle from the corner, and Snoww leaned forward...a slim, tall dark elf, her green eyes still alight with mischief.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot; cried Magpye, and sat back in her chair, trying to pout and failing as a broad grin kept stealing its way across her face.<br>

As best as he could tell she had neither tried to lick his boots or place a cobra inside them. Middle ground was not something this dark elf was used to. Casting a playful scowl at her, he took the plate and replied &quot;Well, I have managed to build up a rather strong tolerance to most all poisons anyways, your attempt to kill me shall not succeed. I'd still rather not drink that sugar water, I mean Neriak nectar, which seems to be so widely coveted by my people, though. I do however have a rather large supply of more....exotic drinks I've made myself. Since I'm to trust your cooking, would you see fit to trust my brewing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Reaching behind himself, Porizj pulled out a backpack which seemed to be fashioned from the remains of a rather large eyeball. &quot;Now what can I get for you? Minotaur Hero's Brew? Some Othmir Algae Ale perhaps? I'm quite proud of my Thubr's Darkened Ale&quot;, he said, glancing in the direction of Iztariani for a split second, &quot;and I think I even have some Tumpy Tonics left over. If the dwarf wants something I have some boot beer, still in the boot, and I'd be glad to watch him drink it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Porizj took a few small bites of his meal to show he had decided not to be too stubborn tonight. It took all his willpower not to laugh at how enraged Kinanar had become at the offer of drinking out of a soggy boot. If he was going to take the chance of being poisoned tonight, at least he would be able to die with the picture of that beet red face, almost on the virge of popping, in his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it's a weak poison, perhaps I'll survive the night. I hope you're not too disappointed m'lady.&quot; He jested as he cleaned off his plate before the dwarf could regain his senses and throw it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uporizj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Porizj</A> at: 11/1/01 12:51:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uiztariani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iztariani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wielder of the<br>Red Marker of Doom</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#778899>(11/1/01 2:57:07 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/image/73/3368673.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New digs</span><hr size=1> Iztariani turned towards the necromancer, her eyes gleaming with pleasure.<br>

If I was to get any better at it, I'm quite sure it would be called Porizj's Darkened. I don't use a cask, I find the wood takes away from the taste, and absorbes the alcohol. You'll notice each cork has a different number burned on it. The numbers stand for the potency of the alcohol, 1 for the weakest and 5 for the strongest. I would rate a gnome for 1, and for 5....well....perhaps a dragon could still stand after having a bottle. Be warned though, do not mix the corks up, each version goes down just as easily as water, and you won't notice the real effect until you stand up. Take them all if you want, the cache's of different alcohol's I own would amaze even a tavern keeper, and 5 bottles would hardly put a dent in my supply.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing the hungered gleam in Iztariani's eyes, Porizj snickered to himself. He hardly ever drank anything except for water, but always kept a healthy supply of such drinks with him. It was amazing how quickly a well timed drink would loosen someone's coinpurse, tongue, or loyalty. It might do very good to have a sane paladin to step in should a foolish one try something silly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry about cost, such things come dirt cheap when the maker collects the ingredients himself. Return the bottles when you are done, and I will think nothing more of the matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Porizj turned back towards his server<br>
<br>
&quot;Now then, could I interest you in anything?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uporizj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Porizj</A> at: 11/1/01 3:33:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukinanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinanar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#778899>(11/1/01 5:51:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New digs</span><hr size=1> Kinanar regained his composure and relaxed.

Weather this paladin was brave or foolish, Porizj had meant what he said about number 5.

<br>
&quot;I think I'll have to try this No. 5 of yours,&quot; she said, &quot;but not this night.  This night I believe a No. 3 would be about right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pouring a glass she held it up to the light, and admired the head on.  &quot;Thick enough to float a copper on, methinks...and darker then a mine at midnight, though nicely clear, no clouds of must.<br>
<br>
She sipped, and smiled.  &quot;An excellant batch.  Many thanks for this fine brew.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leaning back, she looks at her two companions.  Magpye was sitting and sipping at a halfling stouter, her eyelids drooping.  Snoww had pulled a surprising variety of daggers from about her person, and was idly juggling them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, shall we stop for a little while then?  Or continue our journey?&quot;<br>
<br>
Snoww sighed and caught the daggers one by one, then hid them away again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose we must continue...let us at least eat and drink first though, a decent meal in a comfortable chair will have to substitute for a nights sleep.  The road west is tiresomely long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magpye nodded.  &quot;Aye, and little I can do to shorten it, save speeding our feet.&quot;<br>

<br>
Lenore still sat on the floor with the barbarian's head in her lap, spooning broth between his lips.  A sudden burst into the room brought her head up quickly, as Laurelai nearly pushed a dwarven male into the room with her.  She shot Lenore a look of pleading then disappeared.<br>
The dwarf looked just as confused.  He had been thinking this a ploy, and there in this room, he sees a half elf female, and a very attractive one at that, her deep purple eyes looking at him, pleading for some help with an obviously injured man.<br>
Shrugging, he offers his assistance.  He notices the man is surrounded by the haze of the white-haired druid's magic, and smiles. <br>
Good, he thinks.  my job will be a little easier.<br>
&quot;Let me lie him down for you.  Besides, he is a little heavy and my legs are cramping.&quot;  The dwarf chuckles and nods.  He helps her lay the man down and Lenore attempts to rub some feeling back into her legs.<br>
&quot;My name is Lenore.&quot; she offers.<br>
&quot;Kinanar, Crusader of Brell, M'Lady.&quot; Lenore smiles.  <br>
&quot;I see you have things well under control, so I will take my leave.  Besides, it looks like Laurelai could use some help with crowd control.&quot;<br>
<br>
As she enters the commonroom of the house, she sees some semblence of peace returning.  And saw the reason for Laurelai's hasty intrusion of the dwarf into the room she was in.  Lenore shook her head.  While she was tolerant of different races, as her own daughter was soulbound to an ogre, she knew Paladins and Necromancers, and especially Shadow Knights, were natural enemies.<br>
But, she also knew that this was neutral ground, and if there was to be peace, she knew these two warring factors had to set aside their differences, at least for now, as Iztariani was so graciously doing.  Leave it to Erudites to display impeccable manners. she mused, smiling.  Iztariani reminded Lenore of her sister-in-law, Elishia.  She was married to her husband's brother.<br>
Shaking off the mists of musings, she hears a loud voice.  <br>
Adoom!<br>
She smiles and makes her way toward the flashy monk.  She sees him in a lopsided dance with Laurelai and giggles.<br>
&quot;If I have to watch you dance, Adoom, it better be a good one.  Monks are not known for their grace and agility.&quot; she teased.  Adoom smiled and lifted Lenore into his arms and twirled her around in a hug.<br>
&quot;Lenore! It is good to see you again.  That paladin still treating you well I hope?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know he does, ya goof.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea, I know, but one can dream, eh?&quot; then he winked.<br>
&quot;And still the shameless flirt I see.&quot;  Lenore smiles as Adoom sets her back on her feet and saunters away.<br>
Lenore now notices that Magpye and Snoww have entered the room, and Kinanar has come back into the room.  She relaxes as the Paladin and the Necromancer seem to come to an uneasy truce this night, and Lenore settles back to enjoy the festivities.<br>

He then noticed his stomach growling and reached into his back pack in search of a ration of some sort. He pulled out something to satisfy his hunger and peered around the room. Quite an odd gathering...Shadowknights, Paladins, Necromancers, Monks, Bards, Druids almost every kind of being on the face of Norrath was in this room. If this had not been neutral ground, a fight of epic proportions would have broken out earlier between the dwarven paladin and the dark necromancer.

I find it to be strong enough to take the edge off, but not so overpowering as my Thubr's Darkened tends to be. It has a sweeter taste too. You're probably used to seeing casks, but as I said before, I don't believe in them.&quot;<br>
<br>
He then walked over to Kinanar and set a bottle on his table. &quot;Number 5, as per your request. I do hope you plan on staying the night here, as walking becomes a dangerous activity when you've sampled my best.&quot; Porizj snickered to himself as he went to sit down again, this was going to be a fun night.<br>
<br>
Turning to Iztariani, he again spoke. &quot;West you say? Just how far west are you going? As chance would have it I need to go in that direction, to check on some.....investments of mine. A lady of such fine taste is always welcome to join me in my travels, prehaps you could critique my brew and offer advice on how to improve upon it during our trip. Of course, I don't travel by foot. An old aquaintence of mine owes me more than a few favours and is always on time when I wish to be teleported somewhere. Besides, the short ones look like they could use a night's slumber, and the only thing worse than a wet cat is a tired shorty.&quot;<br>
