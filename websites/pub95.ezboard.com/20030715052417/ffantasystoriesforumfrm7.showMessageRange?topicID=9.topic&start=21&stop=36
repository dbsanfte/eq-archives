She was delivering a personal message to a salesman on the main floor from her boss. This meant she would have to see that Stevens guy. While she found Stevens mildy atractive she hated that do gooder attitude. But, she thought, it was best to have security on your good side. As she walked up to the sales counter, she noticed Stevens talking on the phone at his desk a few feet away. While she waited for the salesman, she leaned her elbows on the relatively low coutertop, giving Stevens a more than ample glance at her posterior. When the salesman approached she delivered the message and turned to go, making sure to meet eyes with Stevens as she walked out.  <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 3:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sci-Fi</span><hr size=1> &quot;Then let us take a walk.

Steven pulled his eyes away from Mai's delicious curves while he pointed directly to the correct screen, several frames behind the present ones, and found yet another perpetrator. A robot guard's metallic hand clamped around her own *JUST* before she reached the pocket with the silicon processor in her hand. God, he *loved* his job.<br>
<br>
The obsessive compulsive schizo felt Mai's presence starting to leave. He looked back and gave her as warm a smile as possible for the half a minute before she made any motion to leave. He knew he was special; only STEVEN S. STEVENS could sense things before they happened; only STEVEN S. STEVENS had the clear mind and mental capacity to notice ALL the details; and only STEVEN S. STEVENS had access to Mai when she *didn't* want him staring at her... Ahhh, the foolish feminine gender. If John didn't ask her out soon enough, Steve was.

Did the heat from the other's hand stimulate the brain causing the emotion?  &quot;What is that.  Holding hands, I know it is a sign of happiness or lust or pleasure....but why?  I don't understand.&quot;  He turned his head sharply as he heard a sound.  &quot;Why do they yell?  They are mad, I know....but why?

&quot;We can't be out here!&quot;<br>
<br>
The robot did not budge. Sighing with frustration, she answers him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Holding hands is a sign of affection in one form or another. People who like each other hold hands signifying friendship or another type of relationship. People like doing it. <br>
<br>
They are mad for their own reasons just as you are frustrated for your own.<br>
<br>
Plants are not clean. They must be kept in soil and watered. Water and heat can often times make mold or mildew. We can have neither in this building nor can we have soil. We can't have anything getting contaminated. So, because there is beauty in nature, we keep the only plants that we are allowed to have, even if they are plastic. Plus, plants of any kind add to the atmosphere of the room. It makes things more pleasant because plants are pleasant to look at. <br>
<br>
Now. Can we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> please</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> go inside?&quot;<br>

Her eyebrows raise. They needed to get back into the room <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> now</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. What if someone recognized him as the experiment?

Too late. The robot redeemed itself. It went back into the instructional room while Orlaith rattled off answers to the metallic creation's questions. Steve shrugged; it was less work to do it this way anyways. Uhoh- he sensed a 709-B6 down on floor 34...<br>
