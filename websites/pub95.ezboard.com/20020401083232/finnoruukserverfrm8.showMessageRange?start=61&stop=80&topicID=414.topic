Paloem was already in the zone, on the ledge.  What more do you expect us to do?  This man has no life.  He never leaves the zone.  He never seems to camp, either.  When he -does- leave the zone, he does so with whatever character is offering the MQ and leaves the rest in Kedge.<br>
<br>
He has a severe emotional disorder or something in order to be able to sit in front of 4 computers nearly 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, doing the same thing over and over and over in the same place.  I feel nothing but pity for the real person that sits behind his computers.<br>
<br>
Despite whatever reasonable sounding words he may post here, Paloem is the very worst of what Verant has attracted to this game.   He is a griefer pure and simple.  The GMs removing him from the camp is a clear indication that his actions are severely out of line with Verant's intent for this spawn.  He leaves no opportunity to &quot;get there early&quot; because, frankly, expecting your &quot;competition&quot; to be there 6 or 7 hours early as Paloem is, is unreasonable.<br>
<br>
The fact that Paloem posts here that he's &quot;helping people&quot; and to bring the wizard he had with him to &quot;help him&quot; when he has 3 wizard staves in the bank is hypocracy.  If he truly wanted to &quot;help&quot; his friends, the MQ would have already been taken care of.  Do I think Paloem is an evil person?  No, I just think he's pretty worthless.  I can only imagine the hell that is his real life.  I feel pity and disgust for this retched being. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  What a worthless life. <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

Saying that because you were there 2.5 hours early during ONE spawn and equating that to paloem being there for ALL SPAWNS 6 hours early is a big pile of bs. <br>
<br>
the very worst Verant has to offer?  Please be a bit more bitter your wizard didnt get the staff even after you try to justify running over the camp.  I can post a billion reasons why running over a camp is the worst verant has to offer but i wasnt there and i dont really care that you ran over the camp.  I care that you bitterly post on someone judgeing them while your actions may or may not be more evil.<br>
<br>
the wizard in these comments has been offered the mq MANY times.  He wants a staff for himself as others in this thread has stated, some just dont like to mq.<br>

AND you say you would MQ them for 20-30K<br>
<br>
HERE you say you have only been in KK 3 times this year.   What kind of idiots to you take us to be?  In three trips you got 2 BCS and in one of those trips you were occused of training, etc so you got nothing.   So, you are trying to tell us that every single time you kill Phin you get a BCS.<br>
<br>
Besides, people have seen you and your sorry-assed, pasty-faced, no-life, @#%$-for-brains friends in the zone on multiple occasions this year.<br>
<br>
Maybe you just really like killing Phin.  Maybe you are Mr Humanitarian of the Year.   Maybe you pass BCS's and wine to all your little friends.  Well, though @#%$.   It's time for you to move on and let others have a chance.<br>
<br>
I hope every one on Inny makes a trip to KK and if they see you or your lying, loot-hoarding, no-life friends in the zone, they /petition that you are not sharing spawns.   Oh, it may not be true, but I think we're all tired of waiting for your mommy to take away your pc and it's time for the gloves to come off baby! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umizlil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mizlil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/7/02 4:53:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Paloem</span><hr size=1> I would like to here about the time Amici took a guild down there and engaged Phinny.

I'm too scared to goto kk now that i may get petitioned.  Plus i dont want my mom yelling at me if i kill phinny all the time.  Crap there i go lying again, i have a @#%$ job so i cant kill phinny during the week days.  @#%$, i go on guild raids tues, wed, thurs, friday so i cant kill him then either.   @#%$ i cant perma camp phinny anymore.

Didnt realize this post had so many more replies.<br>
As far as Amici goes they have no respect from me and they probably dont want it... which is fine.<br>
<br>
Anyone who asks me his spawn time gets an honest answer. It is then up to them to camp him. I would say 1 in every 3 spawns I leave him up for 1 hour to a whole day. Usually noone shows up. People think that because I farm him they have no chance at killing him. People also say I camp him 8 hours before he spawns did you every think I like kedge keep and get exp there? What people (not all) are really saying is that they arent willing to camp him and are looking for someone to take it out on. I havent killed Phinny for 5 days now. I have seen him up many many times and noone goes to kill him. I could honestly care less what the majority of flaming people say about me (mostly because those are the ones who were jerks in the first place before even talking to me therefor making me not want to help them.) And Amici saying I was removed from the zone .... you guys smoking crack? I stayed in the zone and engaged Phinny when he spawned. One of your guildmembers admitted training my group to a bard I was getting a backbone for free for. (He later recieved his backbone about a week later) What I find Ironic is that you guys didnt get your wizard staff.... then the next spawn when I left him up for about 30 minutes before I killed him he dropped it. Sucks for you because I was going to MQ it for your wizard for 2,000 plat till you decided to be jerks. All in all if people are decent to me and are willing to camp him with me and put in at least &quot;some&quot; effort they will get thier Epic item from phinny for free. I only charge the people who arent willing to make the effort to get it. If you think thats wrong then too damn bad because every GM I have talked to says they dont care what I do with his loot and they dont care if I kill him. Anyways I find this an interesting thread so if you want to flame go ahead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Palo is one of the nicest people I've ever met. I went into Kedge a few days ago helping a druid friend with her epic, and it so happened Palo was in the zone. When he got back from watching a movie we asked him for assistance killing seahorsies, to which he most graciously agreed. This was excellent, since I nor my friend really knew much about Kedge. He basically took us down there and whacked horsies for an hour or so, until we got what we wanted. I dunno what anybody else thinks of the water-hermit, but I thank you Palo. My friend would probably be epicless at this time if you hadn't been so kind.<br>

You and I both know what happened, Paloem.  The GM came to the zone, listened to both sides, and told you to leave the zone.  Rather than comply, you decided to stay behind and try to KS Phin.  The bard who you mention told us later that you got 3 adds and your monk died, at which point you gated and left the bard to die.  Takes a lot of nerve to disobey an order from a GM to leave the zone.  I wouldn't make a habit of that if I were you.<br>
<br>
As for your claim that everything is ok because you leave the spawn untouched 1 time in every 3...please.

*gasp!*  He never @#%$ leaves.  There are times I can do a /who all Paloem and not see him online.  I assume this is when this lying sack of @#%$ is actually sleeping.  The only 2 zones I do see him in are Kedge and Halas.  I wonder what he's doing in Halas?  Perhaps shoving a cattle prod up the ass of yet another other poor wizard.<br>
<br>
It's a pretty safe bet that if he's in Dagnor's, he's either on his way to Kedge again or shoving that cattle prod ever so lovingly up the ass of another mage (that's where the turn in is for the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water that drops from Phinny).<br>
<br>
No, Paloem, I don't want your respect, you've already proven yourself a complete and utter lying sack of @#%$ and a greifer of the worst kind.  What I want is for you to @#%$ die so the world can forget about you.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
And, um, no, Plaoem, you left the bard to die.  We invited her to come with us.  Felt badly for her that the backbone didn't drop since she was getting it.  And no, you didn't offer to MQ the wizard staff for 2k, you offered to MQ it for 2k now with a shitload more money payable in 30 days.<br>

God, Paloem, you really are a complete choad.  When we petitioned and let you know we were waiting for a GM to show up, you took yourself off the ledge and into the lair.  How the @#%$ do you think we trained you down there?  We didn't, we pulled all the seahorses <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Phinny to the ledge and killed them there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   after</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the GM told your sorry ass to get lost.<br>
<br>
You're the kind of refuse I'd love to hit with my car.  And then back up over.  Repeatedly.  Unfortunately, since your sorry pasty ass never seems to leave the house, I suspect I'll be denied the pleasure. <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

<br>
But since you let some people loot for free, you're a cool guy, and it makes no difference that you try to bend everyone else over...right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udalynia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalynia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/20/02 9:29:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=74>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://circe.inetdb.com/~dalynia/images/dalynia-portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bump</span><hr size=1> Furthermore, Paloem, the fact that you have already at least once been <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> told to leave the zone by a member <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant Interactive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Customer Service</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> indicates in no uncertain terms that you, sir, are guilty of zone disruption, spawn hogging, and griefing other players.<br>
<br>
As for not putting in the work and refusing to &quot;come camp the spawn like you do&quot;, when people are arriving to enjoy this epic encounter for their quest over 2 hours early and Mr. Paloem Sweetcheeks is already there on the ledge, it renders whatever point you thought you had, Paloem, pretty moot.  They came to take the spawn but, alas, Paloem Butterbutt was already &quot;camping&quot; Phinny.<br>
<br>
To quote yet another greifer, Paloem,<br>

&quot;You're still a retard.&quot; <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

Untill I found out you had plans to KS me. Daly you are hillarious to take this so far in a game. Just relax and have fun. But there will always be people like you and always be people like me. Too bad you just have to deal with it and cant do anything about it. Of course there are those who were not complete jerks to me in the first place who now have thier epic for free because of me. I feel sorry for you. The guide told me to leave but the GM said I could stay. If ya dont believe me petition and ask if I have any soulmarks on my account. As far as your Q Solo. Anyone who is willing to camp him and help kill him and put in the effort to get him doesnt have to bend over. But someone who shows up 5 minutes before and then start bitching at me well we all know what I think of those people. Griefing other players?  hehe you grief me. And as I recal you didnt pull phinny and seahorses and kill them you got wiped out 3 times before you finally killed him... HAHA  (no pun intended)<br>

<br>
I also have the guide's tell where he told me he had told you to leave but warned me that you would probably stay and try to KS the spawn, so be ready to engage.  Phin spawned 10 minutes later and sure enough, you tried to KS him.  Your claim that in that 10 minute time some GM overruled the guide and said you could stay is obviously pure fiction.<br>
<br>
Enough of the he said, she said though.  I hope you decide to move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uelaurieldragonstorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elauriel Dragonstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/21/02 6:36:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: HAHA</span><hr size=1> Can we not turn an argument between a few people into some kind of guild war?<br>
