Driving:  Driving in the US is dependant on where you drive.  Some areas have great roads, others have varied speeds.  All of this, if you drive a lot, only makes you a better driver.  I learned this from driving in places such as Germany and The Dominican Republic.  Both examples happed remind me of how much I love the US. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Food:  Fast food IS American, Its part of the culture, Good/Bad is irrelevant.  Try it all and decide for yourself.  Its what makes living in new land interesting.  Personally I am a deli man myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Nothing beats a stacked sammy with the right mustard.

<br>
Snow:  It cleans the soul.  Its Magical.  Really check it out some time.  I promise you will see its wonder in time.  I find myself as happy to see it go as I am to see it come.  Its a love/hate for those in the snow belt.<br>
<br>
Language:  Hummmm, we speak American, not English.  It's what makes America different.  After all, America is a melting pot made up of ALL the worlds cultures.  We call ourselves Americans and defend our ways because we are proud of it.  Please don't begrudge those who jump to her defense.  They do so out of pride.<br>
<br>
I am glad you are enjoying the States.  Take time to check out the country when you can.  Its a great place for travel.  In fact.  If you are ever in the Detroit area, I would be happy to show you around.   Instead of trying to explain it, I would rather show you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And I promise GOOD food!<br>

<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did I see your tongue in your cheek on the original post?<br>
<br>
Grammar.  Somewhere between the time I graduated from high school and now, grammar seemed to go to Hades in a handbasket.  Oddly, this seems to coincide with the time high school graduates lost the ability to make change for a dollar.  <br>
<br>
Ya'll.  I've been informed that we all should save our Dixie cups, the South may rise again.  I think this somehow related to the phrase &quot;Noo Joisey&quot;, which is where I live.<br>
<br>
Snow.  I blame God and Mother Nature.  It seems to annoy me more as I've grown older.<br>
<br>
Fast food.  Having been in a few drive-in lines lately, I wonder what happened to the &quot;FAST&quot; part?  This may be related to my last comment on Grammar?<br>
<br>
Driving.  If my commute to work is any indication, it doesn't matter which side of the road we are on.  The majority of Americans can't drive worth the powder to blow us up anyway.<br>
<br>
On a positive note, we Americans seem to cling, for the most part,  tenacously to our ability to make fun of ourselves and our country with little fear of retribution.<br>
I hope we never take ourselves TOO seriously.<br>

I knew you were kidding.  That's why I said welcome to America.  And I was serious.  Welcome to your new home.<br>
<br>
For all our faults, it's home.  Either I missed it, or it wasn't mentioned, but where do you call home now?  If in a snowy clime, go out and enjoy the snow for a bit.  Fall on your back, and wave your arms and legs to make snow angels.  Build a snowman.  Have a snowball fight with your loved one.  Then hate the snow when the snow plows shovel more of it back into your driveway, and gripe because it isn't the white stuff, but hard slushy brown stuff that hardens like cement behind your car.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Why do you think I live in Arizona now?  lol.<br>

Jan 10<br>
It's starting to snow.  The first of the season and the first I've ever seen.  The girlfriend and I took our hot buttered rums and sat by the picture window, watching the snowflakes drift down, clinging to the trees and covering the ground.  It was breathtaking.<br>
<br>
Jan 11<br>
Well, we awoke to a lovely blanket of crystal white snow covering the landscape.  What a fantastic sight.  Every tree and shrub was covered with a beautiful mantle.  I shovelled snow for the first time, and loved it.  I did the driveway and our sidewalk.  Later, a city snowplow came along and accidentally covered up the driveway with compacted snow from the street.  The driver smiled and waved.  I waved back and shovelled it again.<br>
<br>
Jan 12<br>
It snowed an additional five inches last night, and the temperature dropped to around eleven degrees.  Several tree limbs broke off from the weight of the snow.  I shovelled the driveway again.  Shortly afterwards, the snowplow came and did his little trick again.  This time, the snow was a grayish brown.<br>
<br>
Jan 13<br>
Warmed up enough during the day to melt the snow, turning it into slush, which became ice when the temperature dropped again.  Bought snow tires for both cars.  Fell on my arse in the driveway and went to the emergency room.  Nothing broken, thankfully.  More ice and snow expected later.<br>
<br>
Jan 14<br>
Still cold today.  Sold a car and bought a 4x4 in order to get to work.  Slid into a guardrail and did considerable damage to the right front quarter panel.  Another eight inches of the white crap fell again last night.  Both vehicles are covered with salt and crud.  More shovelling in store for me.  The snowplow came by twice today.  Damn him.<br>
<br>
Jan 15<br>
Two degrees at noon today.  More freaking snow.  Not a tree or shrub is left in our yard that hasn't been damaged.  Power was off all night.  Tried to keep from freezing to death with candles and a kerosene heater, which tipped over, nearly burning the house down.  Got 2nd degree burns on both hands, and lost my eyelashes and eyebrows.  Car slid on the ice on the way to the hospital and was totalled.<br>
<br>
Jan 16<br>
Damn mother freaking more white crap keeps coming down!  Had to put on every item of clothes I own just to go to the mailbox just to find he didn't even come today.  If I ever catch the S.O.B. of a snowplow driver, I will rip open his chest, and rip out his heart.  Power still off, toilet is frozen and cracking, and part of the roof is caving in now.<br>
<br>
Jan 17<br>
Six more inches of that damn, freaking white crap fell again, and freaking ice, and freaking sleet and God only knows what other kind of crap.  I wounded the snowplow driver with an ice pick, but he managed to escape.  Girlfirend is frozen like a popsicle.  Car wont start.  I think I am going snowblind.  I can't move my toes.  Haven't seen the sun in weeks.  More snow is predicted.  Windchill is 30 degrees below zero.  Moving back to Australia.<br>
<br>
Or in your case, Zora, move to Arizona.  Then you will have to contend with 115+ heat in summer.  hehehehe..&quot;But it's a dry heat....&quot;<br>

Again... no one forces you to live here,  have you tried Canada or Mexico?  (well unless you were forced to leave Australia because you were so much more a convict then the others.  YOU HOOLIGAN YOU!!!)<br>
<br>
BTW, America was founded by convicts.  You see, first there were these gentle folks called 'Native American,' Indians if you will.  They were here originally.  Then after America was discovered King James sent over a colony of people to settle here, he wanted to increase his riches and wished to leach out the goods of the new found lands.  Sadly though, this settlement parished.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (he also sent over a few more colonies of settlers, but they failed as well)  But wait, we did not give in!  Many people seeking religious freedom set sail for the new world in hopes of finding a place where they could worship freely!  Now, it was only after the people had come over to America and settled that King James decided that would be a big 'no no.' He thus decreed that if you came to America you had to still follow the Church of England or you would be viewed, in the eyes of the royal family, as a criminal.<br>
<br>
Now.... I do believe Australia was an island they DEPORTED all of their criminals to.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Poor them.<br>
<br>
A man or woman who can find no good argument against a person, or a group of people, will often resort to attacking the sentence structure and grammar of those they are fighting.<br>

Seriously, America wasn't colonized by any one group of folks.  Some of the colonists were paid agents of European governments.  Some of them were military deployments searching for resources.  Some of them were refugees, fleeing what they considered opressive government.  Some of them were Missionaries of the Catholic church, and aye, some of them were deported criminals.<br>

He is here because of me.  He seems to really like America too.  I'm glad some of you have a sense of humor like I do and I found his post to be vastly amusing.  I'm currently working on post to make fun of Australians, somehow with their laid back attitude towards life I suspect they will find it to be funny.  Btw, it's my driving that gives him nightmares.

They instantly go defensive cause they know we are right.<br>
<br>
And just watch the flames now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
But really - you have hit on something a lot of Ausies and other non-American people constantly remark upon.   The seemly poor English education of Americans in general as is shown by their poor grasp of the English language in both spelling and grammar.  One good example I think is from a guy who was leaving a message on a guild board to say he would be gone for a month or so as he was going to 'colledge'.  For the benefit of those of you who do not understand why this is funny - College is spelt - College <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and I believe that people must pass some sort of academic test to allow them to go.    Also it was not a typo for if it were the person would not have consistently used the same spelling.  <br>
<br>
Ok so I knew what that meant and as someone said - what is important is that you understand what is meant.  So the following example:  <br>
<br>
<br>
Malcore said:  &quot;Sadly though, this settlement parished.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now if he meant - was settled by God-Lovers then this is very funny.  But since he could have also meant 'perished ' it is hard to tell. <br>
<br>
So you see - when people take less and less care with their English expression many potential funny comments can be lost.  <br>
<br>
On traffic:  No I have not been to America.  But I have driven in all main land cities of Australia and I can tell you Zoranicer -some drivers need re-educating.  The people who are most defensive when you say - WA has the worst drivers are of course from WA.  But this can be backed up with facts from the RAC and NRMA on road accidents.  But still West Ausies will become upset and defensive.  So what does this tell you?  If you tell the truth about people that they do not want to hear they will become defensive.  <br>
<br>
Ergo:  Since so many Americans have responded defensively to Zoranicer's gentle rant on the spelling and grammar of American people which was so obviously meant as a minor jibe, they must therefore have an appauling grasp of Language.<br>
<br>
PS which Australian city were you from Zor?

GDI if you're gonna rant about how unedumacated Americans are you could at least use proper spelling Kutee.  And I'm assuming 'Ausies' wasn't a typo since you consistently used the same spelling.  Americans laugh at themselves.  They just laugh at idiots like you harder.<br>
<br>
So Zoranicer, what does it feel like to get away from Dingo Blue?  Don't tell me it wasn't a thrill when you got to America and found out that you got to wear shoes ALL the time?  And yes, running water is something that almost ALL Americans get, not just the people in the Embassies like in the land down under. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=308.topic&start=121&stop=136>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=393.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=371.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=308.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=308.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=308.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=308.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
