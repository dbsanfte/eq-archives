<br>
Chapter 4<br>
<br>
&quot;Innocence and the Darkness Within.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All he could do was wonder just what his father was thinking sending him on such a trip. Sure he must of had some special reason, but because of who his mother was he was often viewed by most races as trash. To most he appeared human, but in face he was a half breed, half human and half dark elf. This alone made him traveling in the area he was in very dangerous. Sure he had the same build and physical appearance as a human, which made things easier, but he was also gifted with his mothers knack for being extremely fast and dexterous.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse concealing his appearance only seemed to attract the kind of people he really didn't want to be worried with. Most of the time the guards he encountered overlooked him, after all it wasn't odd to see a person nearly completely covered by a hooded cloak. Of course this also seemed to draw pickpockets and bandits to him like flies to honey. Still through it all he had managed to keep his coin purse and his money, at the expense of giving several people broken arms.<br>
<br>
Still he couldn't help but wonder why his father wanted him to personally go and receive information on what was happening on the continent of Faydwer. Sure he had heard stories about how his father and mother had both fought a battle in the Greater Faydark, but that was years ago, before he was even born. Nevertheless, he was going to obey his father's wishes by going to some contacts and getting the information he needed.<br>
<br>
The young man could definitely believe his father had been here before as he entered the Greater Faydark. As he continued on near the spires he seen the tree's which still bore the scars of a savage battle. Something was different, it was like there had been another person during the great struggle from the feeling he was receiving. He never could understand why he could feel such things though, how he could feel where a person had been before or not.<br>
<br>
To him it was simply more a curse than a gift, mainly because at times the feeling he got from the way his father fought made him afraid. It was like some darkness was being focused, something unnatural being twisted and refined into something that was barely controlled by the light. All these things gnawed at him as he traveled further into the forest.<br>
<br>
Things hadn't changed much in the forest over the passage of time. Kelethin was still standing and the great city of Felwithe still remained. Even the Crushbone clan of Orc's still existed, though they hadn't gotten any brighter over the passage of time. The only difference the young man could really notice in the Orc's where that they where much smaller to their counter parts located just near his home city of Freeport. Of course he was just about to find out another difference....<br>
<br>
&quot;Orc Smash! Orc Crush! Orc Kill!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The young man barely had a chance to move as several Orcs leapt from the tree with their weapons drawn. This was definitely turning out to be an odd adventure for him as he managed to dodge the on coming Orcs feeble attacks. They certainly where much faster than the ones he was use to, and their size made it slightly harder for him to judge their attacks. However, by the time the Orcs where done attacking they where to exhausted to hold their weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;See wasn't that foolish? Now why don't you run along and harass something else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the Orcs could once again speak, they each found an arrow driven through their hearts. In fact the young man had been aware that someone or something else was watching the on going fight. As usual what his grandfather had said was true, if your being watched never do anything that might cause yourself more problems. This time it meant he could hide his appearance from the on looking wood elves who had revealed themselves at last.<br>
<br>
With a simple nod of his head, the young man was once on his way to meet his contacts, which happened to be in Kelethin. Luck was on his side, most wood elves and high elves he had met could tell by looking in his eyes he wasn't completely human. It would be doubtful if they'd let such a suspicious person enter Kelethin.<br>
<br>
All the young man could do was stare at the city in awe as he reached one of the many lifts. It amazed him that an entire city could be built within nothing but tree's. Not only that, but the sheer size of the city itself was something else, though it wasn't nearly as big as Freeport it was impressive to see. Even for his fascination he kept his eyes under the cloaks hood, he couldn't afford to be seen just yet, or to be harassed by the guards he seen on patrol.<br>
<br>
It was puzzling, his father had given him a map with the exact location of his contacts home. More so puzzling yet it was apparent that they where either wood elves, or half elves to be living here in Kelethin. From his past knowledge his father was never overly friendly with anyone, let alone elves, with the exception of his mother. All he could do was smile, remembering how his father was always so gentle and kind around himself and his mother. However he soon brought his thoughts back to the map, and to the names of his contacts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Daxster and Selena...&quot;<br>
<br>
Even mumbling the names to himself didn't bring any idea or thought to who the where as he reached the door to their apparent home. With a few simple raps on the door with his knuckles he got an answer, being greeted by a wood elf woman, whom as to be expected had a puzzled look on her face. All confusion was soon set aside as the young man handed the map and a small note to her though, and with that he was allowed inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;So your their son are you? You don't have any proof that your really what you say you are do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew there would be some disbelief, maybe this will prove it.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that the young man pulled back the hood of his cloak, in the process revealing his charcoal black hair, along with his near black eyes. This brought a small look of astonishment and a gasp from the woman. There was no mistake now to her that he truly was whom he claimed to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you, you have your mothers eyes. Sorry if I seemed so apprehensive, it's just your father...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand, so exactly what am I suppose to be here for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To the point aren't you, your definitely his son.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selena smiled, she could see that this young man had definitely gained his mothers gentleness, along with his father's straight forward personality. She hadn't heard from his parents in awhile and was a little confused when they sent word their son would be coming. Though she was in a particular dilemma at the time, what with the last few days of events.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll have to forgive me if I seen distracted. My daughter has disappeared, and my husband went to search for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Husband? An exceptional man with the bow and very silent, am I right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you see him on your way here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe, would it be all right if I took this thing off?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, there's no reason for you to be afraid to be seen here, by the way what is your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Janus...&quot;<br>
<br>
It was evident he was tired of staying stuffed up under a cloak as he removed it with a quick tug. It had been days since he was able to be comfortable. What with the curiosity of the dwarves and the like he had encountered in the Butcher Block mountains. And of course the travelers and the like he had run across out on the road.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, what your father wanted to know was just what was going on between Neriak and the Orcs, but we really haven't been able to find out a word.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now I know why he sent me instead of having it delivered by messenger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose in a few more days we could have the information you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just at that moment Daxster walked in with a solemn look on his face. He was obviously rattled by something. This alone made Selena fear the worst for her daughter, after all, why else would Daxster be acting like this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Selena, Iris has been captured by the Orcs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Iris is the name of your daughter right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right Janus, and this is my husband, Daxster.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daxster finally took a look at their guest, it took him awhile to finally realize who it was, but he could definitely tell who's child he was. The proof was in Janus's eyes, as well as his personality, it was something that was unmistakable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I can't exactly wait around here for long, and I can't very well sit around while a innocence girl is in danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean your going to go into Crushbone?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is the idea, besides its the quickest way for me to get the information I need.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well the best time for you to try is near sunset, and be careful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be fine, you'll have your daughter back with you soon...&quot;<br>
<br>
They certainly couldn't figure out how come Janus could be so alike, yet different from his father at the same time. Then again they never could figure out how anyone could be so cruel or violent, yet still manage to have a family either. However, both Selena and Daxster where glad that Janus was here, because if he had inherited any of his father's power and abilities then the Orcs would do good just to live through the night.<br>
<br>
The guards around Kelethin where at their usual posts, they knew the Orcs where even active during the night. What they hadn't planned on was what they seen before them, a man completely dressed in black garments jumped off one of the many platforms of Kelethin and managed to land safely at that. In a flash he was off running, in the direction of Crushbone. To them anyone going there at this time had to be crazy.<br>
<br>
None of the Orcs guarding the entrance seen Janus as he slipping in with the shadows caused by the sunset. He had heard stories of how the Orcs took slaves, some for mining purposes, and some for other acts that where of a more horrid nature. Still no matter what he was going to find out as much information as possible while still saving Iris. After all it wasn't really in his nature to not help a damsel in distress, besides who knows just what he could accomplish here tonight. Perhaps he could do enough for the elves to earn enough trust with them to be able to walk around without having to hide himself from their eyes.<br>
<br>
Seeing at night was no problem for Janus, but he also knew the Orcs could see at night as well. That's something he learned long ago as a child. He had learned a lot since those days when he would recklessly rush into anything without first learning more about it. Another little trick he had managed to pick up was the ability move like creatures of the night.<br>
<br>
It wasn't very hard for him to find the slaves holding area, most of them appeared to be wood elves. All he could do was nod his head as he observed the area. He couldn't very well leave all these people here to do such demeaning and horrid work or acts. Then again he couldn't start freeing anyone right away either, if he did then it would cause a commotion and get him into more trouble than he wanted.<br>
<br>
Finding Iris was going to be much harder than he thought, and worse yet was the fact that he could sense something nearby. It was definitely bad news for him, and it didn't give off the feelings the slaves or the Orcs gave off. All he could do was shiver, this was getting more complicated that he bargained for, but he couldn't break his word. It was then that he took a leap of faith and woke up one of the wood elf slaves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be very quiet... I'll get you out of here, but first I have to find someone, do you know a girl called Iris?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Iris? They took her far in the back with some other women earlier.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay quiet... I'll return soon...&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus had to admit, he was surprised that had went so well, he would of expected the poor elf to go into hysterics. It was complicated doing what he had planned next, but it was definitely worth a try. Lady luck had been on his side for awhile now. It was difficult enough to crawl along the walls, if someone seen him it would of reminded them of some kind of overgrown spider, but being over a ledge over the furthest slave area was definite a chilling experience.<br>
<br>
What he saw disgusted him, the women had practically been stripped of their clothes except for the bare essentials. Further more crouching upside down under the ledge was even worse than wearing the cloak since the blood was rushing to his head. The next thing he saw where an orc and two dark elf men come into the area. The one was completely clad in plate armor, and the other was in robes, which meant at the worst he now not only faced the Orcs, but also a fighter and a magic user of some sort.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want woman? Point an I tell price.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We would prefer the youngest of the lot here, also a freshly caught one at that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dat be this one. Flower girl, very pretty.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moments later he seen a girl dragged from the group and taken away with the men. In his mind he wondered, if this one was Iris or not. He would have to ask the others below whether she was or not. If she was his job just got nearly ten times harder. He wondered how women could be such trouble as he released his grip and landed on the ground near the women.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello ladies, now be quiet and you'll get out of here soon... I need to know where the girl called Iris is at.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They took her to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's all I need to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a glitter of light as Janus dropped two daggers to the ground and leapt off into the darkness. Not only had he found out what Neriak latest involvement with the Orcs was, but he also knew what his father had been worried about. Things certainly would be what his grandfather would call fun, what with all the scantly clad women he just left behind. At the moment he had more to worry about those as he managed to crawl through a window in the small fortress.<br>
<br>
Janus knew if he didn't think of something good that he would have a hard time escaping. Surely a surprise attack would work, but if he didn't plan it all out carefully then he could be in deep trouble. The worst case scenario involved him or Iris being killed. Least that's the worst he could image at the moment as he crawled along the ceiling of the hallway closer to where he could sense the two dark elves at.<br>
<br>
Needless to say Janus was upset as he peeked through the crack at the top of the door, and into the room Iris was in. They had paid the Orc to use her for their own horrid deeds, still for the moment she was safe and out of attack range which gave him some time to formulate a plan. To take advantage of someone... To be forced like they where intending to do to her, it was enough to make Janus's normally calm and docile personality fade away.<br>
<br>
Many a time he had seen his father angry and had never really understood what could drive someone to fight and train like he did. Now he realized his father probably trained to protect his family, but this feeling he had now was growing stronger. It was like his blood was boiling, and even worse his fingers where now sinking deep into the stone ceiling, unknown to Janus of course.<br>
<br>
Things certainly didn't look to favorable now, he was going to be forced to play his hand no matter the consequences. Janus looked on as one of the dark elves neared Iris, before realized what was happening he had dropped to the floor and had literally ripped the door from its hinges. Then he threw it to the two dark elves and sent them back into a corner. This in turn caused Iris to scream out at the top of her lungs.<br>
<br>
&quot;AHHHHH! It's a Demon! Stay way!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I look like a demon to you!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Iris could react or say a thing he had already grabbed her and was in the process of making his way down the hall. He knew that the Orcs would soon be up to investigate just what happened, and Iris struggling against him was slowing them both down. It appeared his only chance was to leap out the window and hopefully find a place to hide from view.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not so fast, that woman is ours! Bought and paid for! Get him before he gets away you foolish wizard!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Inferno Shock!&quot;<br>
<br>
The wizard's hand surged with mana as a fiery mass of mana leapt from them just as Janus had jumped through the window with Iris in his arms. All he could feel was a burning sensation then intense pain as he turned his back toward the ground, shielding Iris from the fall. The landing had a more sobering effect on Iris than what one would expect.<br>
<br>
Iris's mind was no longer racing, panicked, and frightened. Reason had finally broken through those emotions as she realized just what had happened. Who or whatever this person was had just saved her, and not only that they had sacrificed their own body to protect her. Before she could even think of escaping though, several orcs had taken her in their grasp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not so fast you scum!&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus had regained his bearings and was on the offensive, first kicking one of the Orcs that was restraining Iris directly in its face, probably improving its looks in the process. The next thing Iris knew she could see a fist lash out, catching her other captor across the face, which in turn sent it into the water nearby.<br>
<br>
The on-looking slaves who where in the process of freeing themselves where surprised. This person who they could tell was definitely not a full blood human was fighting with a passion more fierce than any of their own guards. He wasn't fighting for his own life at all, he was fighting to save others which would regard him as an enemy.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for the two dark elves to rush outside, intent on regaining what they regarded as their property. The wizard of the pair couldn't believe this person who, or whatever it was, was still able to move, let alone fight off the Orcs that where coming after him and the girl. It was then that the dark elf that Janus had observed in plate earlier torn a sword from an Orcs grasp and rushed forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's our property now you pathetic fool!&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a quick glint of light as the dark elf struck out at Janus, only managing to graze his shoulder in doing so. It was just Janus's luck that there where no weapons near him, he was now stuck using hand to hand combat against an armed opponent, one he knew nothing about. It was then that he felt suddenly weak, he now knew what his opponent was from the mana surging through his free hand. He was facing a seasoned Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give up now before you die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then so be it!&quot;<br>
<br>
On this swing Janus wasn't so lucky as the blade sliced through the skin of his chest. Then next thing he realized he was sent flying backwards by an unknown force. A force that caused pain to surge though his entire body and mind as he fell backwards against a wall. He was losing, and worse yet he didn't have the strength to escape now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall I finish this fool off so we can get back to business?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, a fiery death for him sounds suiting doesn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It most certainly does.&quot;<br>
<br>
Iris simply looked on in horror from the Shadow Knight's grasp as fire erupted from the wizard's hands and encircled Janus. She couldn't believe anyone could be so cruel, or that anyone could be so gallant even to the end. It looked as if her fate was now sealed to whatever these two cruel beings had intended for her now.<br>
<br>
All Janus could do was scream out in pain as the flames hit his skin, he knew this was the end. All he could think of was how he was letting Selena and Daxster down, as well as his parents. In his mind all he could do was curse himself for being weak, and wish that somehow he had the power to at least complete what he had come to do. It was then that he seen a figure shrouded in the shadows within his mind.<br>
<br>
- Why wish for power you already have. -<br>
<br>
- I don't have any power, not like my father does. -<br>
<br>
- Of course you do, you have it, but your afraid of it. Are you afraid you'll be like your father? -<br>
<br>
- I haven't got any power! -<br>
<br>
- Look at you, you don't even have the will power to fight anymore, you've given up! -<br>
<br>
- There's nothing I can do! -<br>
<br>
- Foolish boy, let your mind go blank and let instinct take over. Only then your power will come to you! -<br>
<br>
All Janus had left was to try, what harm could it do to give any chance he had left a try he thought. As his mind was becoming blank, the pain from the fire seemed to fade away. Soon it was replaced with a warm pulsating feeling that followed through his body.<br>
<br>
The dark elves had done began to drag Iris back into the fortress when they heard the screams from some of the still freed slaves. The couldn't believe what they seen before their eyes. Even worse was the fact that maybe what the wood elves had been screaming was true, maybe this person was really a demon.<br>
<br>
Iris couldn't believe her eyes as she watched Janus stand up and slowly walk out of the flames. Surprisingly there were very few burns visible, and not only that but he looked somehow stronger than he was before. There was definitely something different about him now, but rather than being scared now she was glad.<br>
<br>
Before the dark elves could utter a single word Janus was back on the move. The main focus of his attention for the moment was the wizard as he moved toward him with an unnatural speed. All that could be seen was a flash of light as the wizard tried to launch his attack at Janus, only to find his own hands being held by what felt like the grip of a devil. In the wizards mind there was a burst of pain, then numbness as he stared down to see two bloody stumps where he use to have hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your a monster!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your dead....&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus made a quick strike to the wizards chest, then moments later the dark elf's heart exploded. This was something that could only be a nightmare to some, but to these few witnesses it was a reality as blood and bone fragments spattered the ground. Seeing this display caused the Shadow Knight to release Iris, and ready himself for an attack.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what the hell you are, but your going to die!&quot;<br>
<br>
