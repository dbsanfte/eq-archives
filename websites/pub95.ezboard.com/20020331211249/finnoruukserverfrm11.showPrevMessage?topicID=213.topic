<br>
The opening acts were OneSideZero and Soil. <br>
<br>
Onesidezero was an alright band, but the music wasn't my style, the lead singer didn't lead the crowd very well and I don't see big things for them. <br>
<br>
Soil was pretty good. The music all sounded a tad similar and done before, but the lead singer good at getting the crowd pumped. Heck, he even had the decency to make a comment about the BROWNS! <br>
<br>
SOULFLY! SOULFLY! SOULFLY! SOULFLY! <br>
Ah, the reason I went to this show in the first place. They were everything I had hoped them to be. Max, former lead singer of Sepultura, is a rock icon and one hell of a lead singer. The whole band let out a live energy that immediately made most of the arena burst into a mosh-pit. <br>
Brazilian and American flags covered most of the stage and a Soufly's Phoneix logo covered a huge portion of the back wall. The mosh pit was brutal as expected, but also as expected if someone fell down he/she was lifted up immediately. <br>
Soulfly played for about 60 minutes and some highlights were: <br>
()Max getting the whole Tribe, err, crowd to sing &quot;Boom whatcha got watcha watcha got watcha got BOOM!&quot; It might look silly in text form, but when a whole crowd of people sing it the energy is quite high. <br>
() Soulfly played some Sepultura songs off of Roots. <br>
() Soulfly played a new song called 'Last of the Mohicians' <br>
() Soulfly gave 110% down to the last chord! <br>
() Seeing some idiot grope some girls ass and she turned around and belted him in the forehead with a viscious right hook. A right hook that had a nice large ring on her index finger. The guy had blood spurting out of his head and got kicked out of the show to boot.  <br>
One thing I found that is that in my older age, hehe 22, I have become more of an enforcer rather then a mosher at these high energy shows. I was more interested in breaking up fights and making sure that the crowd surfers landed on their feet rather then their heads. Sure I got into the pit and was dead tired near the end, but everyone's well-being was more on my mind then usual. <br>
<br>
Static-X took the stage as the headlining act and they played with a fury that showed just why they were headlining. They started out the show with their old single 'This is Not' and kept the show moving along swiftly for 1 and a half hours. The thing I really like about Static X live, I saw them once before, is the way the whole band moves across the stage. They all switch places during their songs and make it a point to run around a lot. The high energy they put out flows directly into the crowd and made for some nice moshing. <br>
The lead singer, I forget his name, but I think it is Wayne, wore a Where's Waldo t-shirt of all things and had his hair spiked as high as possible. His whole look, down to his beard and facial expressions was quite insane and he was quite entertaining to watch. Static-X played 1 song for their encore, but the crowd erupted when it started. It was the first song of their second album and man oh man was it great. The whole floor immediately started moshing and we had a blast. <br>
<br>
<br>
One negative point about the whole night...Skinheads. They were rampant for some reason that I cannot figure out. <br>
<br>
(Soulfly consists of Brazilian musicians and hate concepts like racism, naziism for one thing) <br>
<br>
The skinheads were in the middle of the floor where the most intense mosh-pit was. Be a skinhead fine, I don't agree with the views, but it's not going to ruin my night, what did get me mad though was the way they moshed. They did the whole stomping around, throwing elbows and fists deal. They didn't wanna mosh, have fun, and release energy, they wanted to hurt people. Bunch of f@cks, wish Max would have seen em and jumped down off the stage to show them some Brazilian dropkicks. <br>

Well I went, and you pretty much summed it up with your post.<br>
<br>
Static-X and Soulfly really had the crowd going crazy at this sold out show.Static - X keeps the energy level really high, they dont sit still at all and the lead singer reminded me of the slim jim guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It was enough to draw my attention away from the leather clad sweeties, for a while anyhow.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Best T- shirt of the night award goes to some dude with blue hair and a shirt that simply said...<br>
<br>
Spear Britney!!<br>
<br>
Also, Why do people go to concerts and wear earplugs???<br>
<br>
I must have seen a hundred people running around with earpluggs in, Doesn't this somewhat defeat the purpouse of going to a rock concert.... &lt;shrug&gt;<br>

Sepultura = good<br>
Static-x = pastey white.. but otherwhise good.<br>
<br>
Sepultura was always good live, and has a clean sound for how dark sounding some of thier music is (like in the Chaos AD era). Other than a few live b-sides I have on some digi pack I dont really know how Soulfly sounds, thier 2nd album was a little too 'pop' for my tastes, but thier first is one of the best albums I own, even given the low production quality. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=23336"><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gg.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=234.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=234.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=234.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.threadControl?topicID=234.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=234.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=234.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11>Innoruuk - OOC</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
