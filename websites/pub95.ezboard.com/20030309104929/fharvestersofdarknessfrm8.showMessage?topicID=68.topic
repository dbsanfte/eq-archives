class=title> Lucid?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas entered his sleeping chambers with a sigh of relief.  The bed he had abandoned now looked inviting, even carrying the illusion of warmth to his tired eyes.  Three nights spent alone on the cold stone of the cavern floor, attempting to recapture a moment long departed.<br>
<br>
He was home.  He smiled for a moment as he realised with a small degree of shock the comfort that this thought brought to him.  He was home.<br>
<br>
He hung each piece of armor on the rack as he removed them from his scales, cleaning the crusted blood from his arms and armor methodically, his tail tapping out a slow beat on the floor.  As he worked, his mind did not turn to Paineel, or Guk, or even to the overwhelming heat of the blood kiss.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He thought of Xtailia, the Illusionist <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>she</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> had sent to him, perhaps to spread the darkness, perhaps to occupy his thoughts.  The Teir'dal had great skill in her craft, warping the minds of those who they brought truth to.  The twin truths of Hate and Fear.  Gnomes, dwarves, barbarians, and all manners of Lesser'dal fell before them, all who had given their souls to the Light, all who paid for their choices in blood.<br>
<br>
Her hate was pure, and its blackness had impressed him as they fought.  &quot;Hopefully,&quot; he whispered to himself, &quot;it will not blind her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Satisfied with his work, he set about dealing with his own scales, with the wounds he alone bore.  He examined his neck in the mirror.  The twin punctures adorning it like jewlery were healing nicely, much quicker than he expected.  If he did not know their placement by heart, perhaps they would not even be noticable.  He sighed deeply at this thought, and willed his mind elsewhere.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Koada'dal.  How his hand gripped his mace at first sight, and how the memories of Sarhea's pale skin halted him.  Evil comes in many forms, his own scales bringing judgment down upon him one time too many.  He would wait.  He watched with interest and a slight amusment as the high elf flirted with him, and the Teir'dal knight in their company.  He ignored her as the knight toyed with her.  Did she truely know what happens when you flirt with Hate and Fear?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas looked down at his shield hand, slowly unwrapping the gauze covering it.  The scales beneath were blackened, and the hand itself seemed whithered.  The wound was not healing.  He carefully applied a salve to the blistered scales, and set about rewrapping it loosely.  What had he flirted with, to be burned so badly?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He sat down to rest, corpses littered at his feet.  The Koada'dal had skill, not like a child of hate, but skill all the same.  She startled him from behind, her arms wrapping around him, pulling him towards her.  He recoiled from her touch and leapt to his feet, his cold black eyes burning deeply into her with an icy heat.  She looked back at him with hurt eyes, tears welling, and he dropped to his knees in front of her.  He reached out his gauze covered hand, and gently caressed her forehead, opening her mind with his touch, showing her the blackness of his soul.<br>
<br>
When the visions had ended, he turn away once more, the terror in her eyes did not bring him pleasure, and he looked off into the night, sighing deeply, as his thoughts searched for warmth.  Her arms encircled him once again, pulling him towards her.  He sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you not know when to run, child?  When you should flee, screaming in terror, counting your blessings that you still live, that your hand touched the flame and you did not get burnt?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I will not run from you,&quot; she said, &quot;I do not believe that you will hurt me.&quot;  She enveloped him in heat, pressing her warm skin close to his scales.  He did not pull away.<br>
<br>
&quot;In your arms, My lady, you embrace your own destruction.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps in my arms, you will find your salvation,&quot; Her grip tightened around him.<br>
<br>
Ssakas shook his head gently, as one thought filled his mind.  She does not know how wrong she truely is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He climbed into bed, watching the shadows dance from the flames in the hearth.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She had left soon after.  A member of her house had summoned her away, and as she left,  Baron Mirtoch stood in front of the Iksar, and they spoke in the tongue of the dragons.  They talked of destiny, of fate, and then of the Koada'dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;I trust you will protect this child of my House, Iksar?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I walk the path of darkness, Baron.  I did not search her out.  She came to me.  And when I showed her Fear, she did not recoil.  It only drew her closer.  Will I protect her?  From what?  No harm will befall her, except by my hands, this I will pledge to you.  But I speak the truth.  I am her phobias, her fears, the monster hiding under her bed or in her closet.  I am terror, and I am nightmare.  If she comes to me, like a moth to a flame...&quot;  He paused, looking down at his bandaged hand, &quot;She will get burnt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mirtoch looked at Ssakas, eyes absorbing all of the vision before him, settling finally on his hand, and the black scales below the gauze.  He looked back into his eyes, and simply said, &quot;We all must follow the path laid before us by Fate.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas gazed deep into the fire.  Mirtoch's words echoed in his head.  &quot;Must we?&quot; he whispered to himself.  As he watched the hypnotic dance of the flames, his mind wandered, fluttering around as if on tiny wings, the heat of the bloodkiss, the Coterie,.....Mordrae.  Like a moth to a flame......<br>
<br>
He cleched his hand suddenly, the burnt flesh screamed, ripping his thoughts away, and then, in the sweet embrace of pain, he found sleep.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In his dream, Ssakas stood alone in a garden, long abandoned, overgrown.  A single rose remained, half hidden, deep at the heart of a lifeless bush, protected still by walls of thorns.  His hand reached out for it, thorns ripping into him like knives, tearing scales, finding blood, his hand would not be denied, it gently encircled the blossom, caressing the petals, covering it with his hand, with his blood.<br>
<br>
Ssakas crushed the Final Rose.<br>
