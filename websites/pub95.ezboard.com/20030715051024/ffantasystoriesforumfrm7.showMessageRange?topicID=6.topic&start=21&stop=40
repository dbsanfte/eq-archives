Nefertiti found herself stretched out on the floor. Her head near the bathtub and her feet pointed towards the door. The pills were going slower than normal, it usually only too five or six minutes to take away any and all pain she felt, whether it was physical or mental, but today it was being a @#%$ hard ass and taking its dear sweet time. Her stomach gurgles once. What was this? It gurgles once more. Oh gods... Gurgling a third time she felt it at the back of her throat, the tickling sensation. Sitting up as fast as possible she pops the toilet seat up and leans over. Partially digested curry fills her mouth and is spilled out into the once clear waters of the toilet bowl. How... nice. Gagging on the taste of her own stomach acid, she continues to throw up until her stomach is nearly completely drained of the food she had just eaten. Her body had rejected the pills? Impossible! She could barely feel her fingers tingling when she threw up, they barely started to work!! @#%$. Spitting into the disgusting water, she flushes it and stands. That was more than nasty. Nefertiti reaches for her toothbrush and loads it down with some toothpaste. They had some new mouthwash out that was supposed to eliminate the need for brushing teeth, and even had certain foods that took the place of brushing, but right now Nefertiti decided to do things the old fashion way and just brush. And brush she did. Brush and scrub and scrap like she had a damned OCD or something. Throwing up was the nastiest thing in the entire world. Just nasty. Oh so, nasty... Rinsing off the bristles she puts the toothbrush back in it's place and takes a deep breath. ~Hope they didn't hear me puke my guts out...~ Opening the door she steps back out into the smoke filled room. Was it just her or was Derek *always* getting lit? Someone bumped into her, she was too tired still to realize who but she muttered a few words in reply and kept walking. Smiling as she sees Mika, Nefertiti takes a seat on the ground near her, with her arm resting on the coach cushion. Her eyes look over at Devin. It had been awhile since he set foot in their flat. After he had that ‘discussion’ in with Jash she thought he wouldn’t ever come back. Nefertiti smiled, though her mind did not want to let her. With her legs crisscrossed she sits silently, her smile working it’s way from her delicate face. Her eyes jump from person to person as she twirls a toe ring on her right foot. ~I wonder if I’ll ever be as good at all that mind stuff as everyone else…~ with a heavy sigh she lays her head on the arm that rests on the coach. <br>

Jerron saw her.  He had felt her mind, screaming in pain from the bathroom.  She had taken the pills.  More than usual this time, her mind, it practically shut down.  A small amount of sympathy crept into his mind as he thought how shitty she must feel, but then he remembered it was she that chose to do this to herself.  They ALL chose to do this to themselves.  I could heal them all, I know how.  The mind is limitless, but only to those who know how to break the limits.  In his usual eerie quiet voice, he spoke, &quot;Idiots.&quot;  He rose to his feet walking over to near Nefi, who had emerged from the bathroom a few shades paller than before, but what intrigued him was her mind.  It showed not the usual dulling effects of the pills.  The drugs yes, but the pills she had taken moments earlier...no.  Odd.  The screams, they stopped, but not from the pills.  As he walked by, he caressed her cheek with his hand.  He spoke to her, only to her, &quot;meet with me, come to my home, I have need to speak with you.&quot;  Giving her not but a chance to wonder, he walked out of the room, lifting his clouds of misery from them all. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usuedydar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suedydar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Souls</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/02 1:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1>   What was that? Jash has returned from his business and sat back on the couch. As Jerron walked out of the room he peered at him, pondering what he said. &quot;Might be better not to know...not really any of my business any way..&quot; thought Jash to himself. He busied himself with a new psychic game HardTec. had invented.<br>
  Concentrating on the orb he held in his hand Jash slipped into a world all his own. Anything he desired could come true..anything. Right now he just wanted to skate with no interruptions. Instantly a giant skate park appeared before him. Summoning his board he began to hover a few inches off the air. Go time. (ooc: I'll leave all the fancy tricks and grinds up to you to imagine, can't remember everything off TH2 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

No control, she thought.<br>
<br>
Untangling her legs, she let them hang into the grafitti covered bowl. She leaned forward and gripped the edge where the flats met the top of the bowl, her violet eyes caught sight of a tall lanky boy wipe out. Laughter filled her and sparkled in her smile and eyes, &quot;Hey! Skeet!&quot;<br>
<br>
The laughter began to roll off her tongue and out of her mouth, as she waited for him to give her his attention from the bottom of the bowl. Once he looked, she grabbed her hover board and jumped on, &quot;Let me show you how it's done.&quot;<br>

He sighed to himself; &quot;So many people so dependent on drugs. Fools.&quot; He walked into the room, which had by now lost it's purple haze, but the blacklights still shone.<br>
<br>
Nefe was finally back, same with Jash, but Jerron was gone. He shrugged. Jash was concentrating on some little orb thingie. He remembered his Xtreme friend telling him about it, and how he could easliy break off from a Darkslide to a 1080 with no problems in the orb. He remembered telling Jash, &quot;Really now? Dude, what's it like to need some orb thing to go to your... world, or whatever? Must suck.&quot; Derek smiled at his knowledge. He could do almost anything with his mind, where others limited it. He could create his own universe, and stay there for years... Actually, he did that, but people thought he was crazy. Reminiscing the days &quot;behind the Wall&quot;, so to speak, Derek pressed the button on the remote again. The speakers started bumping out the classics; Pink Floyd, baby!<br>
<br>
He touched Nefertiti on the shoulder. &quot;Hey babe, you better?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her scowl was more than an answer. 0_0; Derek sat back on the couch, careful not to disturb Jash. &quot;Why do people limit themselves just from the chemicals in drugs?&quot; he pondered aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you sell them the drugs?&quot; Mika shot back.<br>
<br>
Derek all but ignored the traditional comment. &quot;It's money. Besides, being in the stupor of hallucinogens or narcotics should *unlock* your mind, not hinder it. Why are people so god damned lazy? You'd think by now, people would strive for more than just...&quot; he waved his arm around the room, &quot;This. This pitiful existance, this pinnacle of human society we've worked ourselves to. People are content to let other people or things, like my special-grown hydrike ::grins::, do what they want for them. It's pitiful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You do the same thing, Derek.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How? Cuz I smoke hy? Cuz I grow it? Cuz I sell it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh, duh!&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek sighed. &quot;I grow the best because I let my mind go, and figured out how. I sell it because I can, as I'm not lazy enough to have some low-income, low-risk, low-satisfaction job. I smoke it cuz I can. I don't need to. I've not let the drugs hinder me in any way.&quot; He put a finger up, &quot;And don't anyone give me yer *shitt* about levitatin. My mind don't work like that, you know it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mika sighed, and, before she let Derek go on another long-winded spiel like he's been doing lately, she looked at her wrist, and said, &quot;Time to party.&quot;<br>
<br>
((I'm not saying who says most of the stuff so you can imagine if your own char said it or not. If anyone doesn't want me usin their char for lil things like that, it's cool. I don't appreciate my char bein overly used either, just tell me.

They had managed to create things to do that which they could not.  But they couldn't even keep themselves clean!  The water that sloshed upon his shoes was brown and of dubious origins.  The few people that actually walked the streets stank of dirt and sweat.  The faint scent of roses entered his mind as he altered that which was real.  Yes, the people still stank, but Jerron felt *he* shouldn't have to suffer for their own failures at personal hiegene.  He altered his own senses, blinding himself to the malodorous people.  Emtpy condom boxes, siringes, and pill boxes littered the streets.  He turned right, into his building.  Those who had once called it home were now long gone, and the sole inhabitant of the building was Jerron.  No one ever visited him, and the only two people he would probably ALLOW to enter, would be Nefertiti, and Derek.  Both were good people.  Mika and Jash were foreign to him.  He just didn't understand them, not to say he understood Derek and Nefer.  Intellegent, so unlike the average ilk of today.  He pushed open the door to his left and walked into his meditation room.  White sheets hung from the ceiling and pristine white futons were arranged in a circular formation for sitting, that is, if he ever had company.  Egg-shell colored cloth chairs hung from the ceiling.  Everything looked perfect, yet sterile and unfeeling.  A lone mat rested on the floor, worn from use.  Jerron flung off his black boots, and slipped out of his pale blue kahkies.  He metilculously unbuttoned his long black coat, and flung it on the ground next to his pants.  He pulled on a pair of light pants, and kneeled down upon the mat.  Slowly, he closed his now reddish-brown eyes and focused.  He cleared his mind, but in seconds, his thoughts were filled with Nefertiti.  Her lips, so full, her breasts so perfectly round.  Her form infected him with desire.  He shook his head in frustration, THAT is not why he wished to speak with her.  He doubled his efforts to clear his mind of her, but his work was in vain.  The more he wished to NOT think of her, the more thoughts of her plagued him.  He gave up for the day.  He would be unable to think today.  Slowly he rose to his feet and walked the short distance to his kitchen.  He had no refridgerator, no oven.  Only a loaf of bread and many glasses.  The senses such as taste blinded ones mind to that which was real.  He grasped the slender neck of a glass and put it under the faucet.  Crystal water filled the glass, as cold as the fresh mountain air.  He sat down in a chair, awaiting Nefertiti.  <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/02 9:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1>  devin's eyes snapped open<br>

Carmen's periwinkle tank top was soaked, and her black Cargo's were just, there, hanging low on her hips as always. The exhilartion she got from tryckin' was incredible. It was a new kind of buzz, so different from her crystals.<br>
<br>
Carmen's sleek, platinum blonde hair was swept up in a pony tail in the middle of her head, untamable strands flittered freely about. She was surrounded by all her park friends up on the flats, of course they were all guys, most chicks thought tryckin' was gay. So, Carmen was the only chick here at this park. Up on the north side of town, who knew? Maybe the guys thought it was gay?<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey! Carmen!&quot;<br>
<br>
Carmen looked up in time to see a water bottle being chucked at her, she easily caught it before it konked her on the head. She smiled twisting off the top, and chugging it. Spending so much time with men since the age of 4, she was picking up their habits. Hell, her Mum died. It has been just her and her Dad for 13 years now, and 17 years of breathing...<br>
<br>
Carmen stomped on the end of her hover board, causing its front end to flip up to her. With ease she caught it and adjusted it under her arm. <br>
<br>
&quot;You leaving?&quot;<br>
<br>
Someone asked her, and she nodded, &quot;I needta get home, and take a shower. I'm wrank.&quot; Lifting her armpit she turned her head away sharply, &quot;Yup yup...&quot; The boys laughed, as she grinned and waved, &quot;See you all tomorrow!&quot; Throwing her board down she hopped on and glided home. Making her way down the stairs out of the park, she kissed the rail. Then headed home to a refreshing shower, and 3 lines of crystals, waiting for her... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/02 11:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> (( OO!

&lt;~~~~~~~~~you can tell he's bored at 2 am.<br>
<br>
Yea, so.... Here we go.))<br>
<br>
Derek flipped off his cellcom. Devin was *such* a nut. He didn't know whether the cat man was truely insane, if he was actually feline, or if it was some sick fuckk who implanted a disorder when he was younger. Either way, he felt sorry for that freak if Devin ever got his hands on him... or if he touched Nefe wrong around him.<br>
<br>
Not many people picked up on the way the guys seemed to fall for Nefer, especially not her. He'd tried to bring it to her attention, but she was just convinced otherwise. He still loved her, no matter how many times she protested.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, no matter how well he knew Nef or how much he cared, Derek never could get over his overwhelming thoughts of Mika. He looked across the room to her as she played with a mechanical contraption, probably fell out of Jash's pockets when he broke out the orb. Why did he always want what he couldn't have? Was it genetic? Environment? Just plain bad judgement? He shrugged it off. Derek was used to being disappointed. &quot;Doesn't mean I can't still try,&quot; he pronounced to the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;...........Try        what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry about it. We partyin or what?&quot; Derek stood, and opened the door. &quot;Devin's gonna be outside in the building garage in a few minutes. Probably Jerron, too. Nefer, why don't you give him a call?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cuz he luuuuUUvs yooo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nefertiti sighed and picked up the phone. &quot;By the way, Jash?&quot; He grunted at Derek. &quot;Don't pick up with the whole 'bondage kitty' deal this time, k? I dunno how long those shrooms last.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jash tapped his headband and brought out another drink. He gulped it down, and kicked up his board again. With nothing more than a grin, he walked out. They filed out of the room, and Derek locked it behind them. A minute later and about a mile up in an eleshaft, they were in the garage. The massive, floating drop top corvette, V30, half-electric, solar rechargable, 0-240 in under 7 seconds, light-weight, highly durable supercharger beeped as a man in a suit stepped out of it. Derek's Mustang hovered next to it.<br>
<br>
With a little gleam in his eye, he watched a leather-and-spike-clad cat man walk up from an eleshaft, and climbed up into the vette. &quot;Two things. First, Jerron better get here in the next minute, stat. Second, anyone who wants no part in this, suck on yer bottle and go home.

She pulled the turtleneck on over her tanktop and pulled the skirt on over her pants, which she then unfastened and pulled off, strugling only a little to fit them around her large combat boots.  Shoving her pants into her bag, she reached into the front pouch and pulled out her makeup kit.  Granted their were easier and faster ways of doing this now a days, but like her ciggarettes, Mika enjoyed a few of the old pleasures.  After smearing on her thick black makeup she replaced the kit in her bag and looked into the rearview mirror of the car to make sure she hadn't missed anything.  &quot;So we going to Cyberia tonight?&quot; she asked Derek.  &quot;It's techno night and it's also free drinks for the ladies!&quot; she explained with a smile.<br>
<br>
Mika, although very introverted, liked her friends more than perhaps she let on.  Of coarse she had always shared a bond with Nefi, but the others weren't as bad as she acted.  Derek was a pretty good friend.  Mika disaproved of his drug habbits 'cause she thought they were immature, but she had no problems with his selling drugs, for as she reasoned, 'how else is he gonna get the money to buy my drinks?'  Her friends were a means to kill time.  Mika liked to have fun, even if it was at the expense of others, and this group provided lots of entertainment.<br>
<br>
Mika poped a cigarette in her mouth and sparked it with her mind.  She smiled as she smoked, thinking of the club tonight, wishing Derek would start the @#%$ car so they could go. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/02 8:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> OOC (Sorry for leaving you out Devin, I forgot you name when I was typing my last post and it was 2AM.

Jerron knew she wasn't coming, and that infuriated him.  He wanted to help her, she alone deserved salvation, and it was her refusal that boiled his blood.  She didn't like him, none of them did.  The phone rang.  He placed his hand over it, and sent his mind down the wire.  It was Nefer, theres a party.  He shrugged, why not?  He ran through the house, stopping only to grab his coat.  He used his mind to hover slightly over the ground.  They weren't far, he ran.  Jerron wasn't physically strong, and soon his muscles were screaming from the exertion.  He blocked out the pain.  That which did not kill him, didn't matter.  He saw them sitting at the car.  Mika, Devin, Jash, Derek, and Nefer.  When he saw her, he hoped she was alright.  His anger melted at the sight of her.  A faint smile crosed his lips as he got to the car.  &quot;Hey.&quot;    They greated him warmly, did he deserve such friends?  What had he done to deserve their respect, what had he done to deserve their friendship.  He had always been cold, self-evolved.  &quot;Sorry I'm late.&quot;  Mentally, he rose himself up and plopped down into the car.  &quot;Lets go&quot;<br>

I was bored.)<br>
<br>
<br>
The steam rolled out of the bathroom as Carmen opened the door and walked down the hall to her room. She was clad naked, and didn't care. Actually, alot of times her Dad would walk down the hall as she was making her way to her room. she'd just shrug, it was only what God gave her right? Her Dad was used to her rarely being home, doing weird things, living at the skate park. Hell, he was barely home himself.<br>
<br>
Upon entering her room, which consisted of a chest of drawers, her bed, and a computer, she closed the door gingerly. Making her way to her closet she passed her window, open as can be of course. A couple nights ago two little peeping Tom's were watching her and she had to laugh. So, she gave 'em a good little show. She would've invited them over as if to give 'em a good @#%$, then kick their ass in a heart beat, but they weren't more than 12 or 13. A year or two after her Mum died Carmen wanted to learn Karate, so her Dad took her to a near-by club, and she was there for 7 years, then she dropped it after getting her blue belt.<br>
<br>
In her closet there were TONS Cargo pants, they were her favorite things in the world to wear. Her Aunt Karen asked her why she never dressed like a lady. Carmen always thought women had a bad choice of clothing, it was so uncomfortable. <br>
<br>
Scanning her closet a little more, she found her assortment of hooded sweatshirts and sweaters. Drumming her fingers on her lower lips she walked over to her chest of drawers. Opening the top drawer she pulled out a white, strapless bra, and green, silky-feeling undies. Pulling the undies onto her naked body, she glanced in her full-length mirror tacked on her door. Grabbing her bra she put it on, and watched. How her small breasts kept it up she'll have no idea. You only need a hand full, right? Not like she planned to hook up with any guy tonight, who knew? <br>
<br>
Forgetting about any other clothing, Carmen walked over to her farside wall and ran her hand down it. In her mind she invisioned it twisting and opening like a void, in that void lay her stash. Grabbing her mirror, straw, and razor, she also grabbed her plastic baggie of crystals. Leaving the void open, for when she was done, she walked over to her bed and did up 3 lines. She was on the floor, sitting on her knees with her baby on the bed. Hovering over she did her business, and it was sweet at that.<br>
<br>
After 3 years of crystals, 3 lines barely did it, but that was all she had left. When she was done she grabbed a tissue and wiped off her nose. Grabbing her mirror, razor and baggie, she got up and put them back in the void. In her mind she saw it close, and it did.<br>
<br>
Carmen stood in the middle of her room, hugging herself. Now what, she thought, the night is still young, Carm! First, to find more crystals, but who? They were hard to find on the south side of town. Thinking a minute, she remembered someone giving her the number for some guy named Derek. He was on the north side of town though, and one time she got ripped off major up north. Looking at her cellcom, she grabbed it, and scanned her address book. Finding his number, she decided she'd try him. She listened to it ring, then someone answered. Startled at first she gathered herself, &quot;Uhm, hi? Is this Derek? 'Cause if I have the wrong number I feel REALLY dumb.&quot;  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udahnyella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnyella</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/5/02 8:31:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/02 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> *BWAAAAAAA----- WAAA, OWWWWWWWW*<br>
<br>
The sirens and horns were more noise than he could bear. Hovering a few hundered feet above ground, Derek cruising along a harldy used backroad to get to Cyberia. It was a quaint little place, blue strobes all over, most people doing crystals, lots of ice sculptures, as if they were trying to recreate time when there were still blizzards and whatnot in Russia. I sighed as he swerved down and to the right to avoid a speeding car. He looked back, and saw his friend, Zim, attempting to outrun three Squadies. The police cars were heavily armed, but thank the spirits they hadn't opened fire on him. He nearly forgot all about his plans to go there tonight... guess he didn't have to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends of yours?&quot; Derek heard a snyde remark from the back seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, yes. But that's okay, because I don't buy from him anymore.&quot; He replied, matter-of-factly. That's when his cellcom started to ring.<br>
<br>
The bleeping took his eyes off the road for a second, and he nearly hit a little kid hoverboarding. &quot;JE-SUS! Now I know why it's fukkin illegal! Jash, don't get your ass hit any time soon!&quot;<br>
<br>
He smirked, and stretched his arms up as far as he could, being crowded in the already tiny back seat. &quot;Yep-ah, I'm just too good to get nailed like that. But watch it, kids are *not* fifty points anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek had stopped listening, and was tuning his ears to his cellcom. &quot;Yea, it's Derek. Speak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; came a sexy, female voice from the other line, &quot;I'm out, and I'm lookin. Got some?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You need H, C, or A? The H is homegrown, FIRE, and the A is high quality that ca-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;C's. 3 O's.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, well sexy, I'll tell you what. Meet me at Cyberia in five, me and my crew are hittin the bars right now. The C's are standard power, standard price, but you can sample anyways.&quot; Before he flipped the com plate up, he heard muttering about a board or something. Hmmm, sexy voice, buying crystals, skater... &quot;Hey, Jash, what's up with this town? 'Your people' are overrunning my lazy, drugged up town.&quot;<br>
<br>
He merely smiled. Derek glanced over to his left at Mika who had hopped up in shotgun at the beginning. He tryed to avert his eyes, but it just wouldn't work; she was too damn sexy. Now he remembered why he liked going to school.<br>
<br>

Mika had managed to coax Nefer into dancing, and Devin had gone off with his mistress.  From the corner of his eye, he saw a woman.  She was tall for a girl, almost five eight.  She was plain, but in a good way with her average good looks.  Her hair was brown and hung loosely half way down her back.  She had a plain black sweater on with grey skin-tight slacks.  He walked over to her and before he had a chance to speak, she spoke, &quot;Hello Jerron.&quot;  He was suprised as he had not felt any intrusion in his mind.  &quot;I took your name from you friend over there.&quot;  She nodded toward Derek.  Jerron sent out his own thoughts, to inspect this woman who intrigued him.  Before he had a chance to finish, she punched him.  He doubled over in pain.  She winked, &quot;Only way to stop someones mind.  My names Laurana, Lor.  Wanna dance?&quot;  Jerron disliked dancing as it distracted the mind, but he felt compelled to do so her.  She led him onto the floor before he had a chance to respond.  Whether because she knew his answer, or she wouldn't take no as one Jerron wasn't sure.  Admists a crowd of ravers jumping to the music, Jerron and Lor danced slowly.  She rested her head upon her shoulder as they slowly revolved.  A raver jumped into the pair, knocking Lor to the ground.  He appologized and went to help her up, but she didn't care.  Using her mind, she grabbed his heart.  He grabbed his chest as it seared in pain.  A minute went by before he slumped to the ground.  Whether he was dead or merely knocked out Jerron was uncertain.  Lor stood back up, and again rested her head upon his shoulder.  They clasped hands and he put his hand around her waist.  She had a smile upon her face, as if what she had just done was nothing.  &quot;Having fun?&quot;<br>

Nefertiti smiles as Mika pulls her to the dance floor. She never had been much of a dancer, but when the beat was phat and the mix was good she couldn't resist. What little of the pills that got into her system before she threw them up had faded on their way to the club. She loved it there. If she had her way she would live in the dark atmosphere with the twirler's glow sticks as her only light. An ear to ear smile perminently sticks to her face as the songs roll on while she dances with Mika. Could life get any better? The neon lighting leaves a mysterious glow on her radiant face. It had been too long since she truly smiled. <br>
