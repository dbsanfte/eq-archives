Yes she was, wasn't she?? I remember seeing her in the buffing room. I don't recall seeing her after the kill though.<br>
<br>
I did, teasingly, make Bjornn random for the shaman hammer; but if I had recalled Aprile from the buffing room at the time, I would *definitely* had the two of them random for it (or I would have raised a stink...)<br>
<br>
Man, now I feel bad. Thanks a bunch for reminding me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They/him/her/whatever will have to spend ALOT of time doing damage control. I would start by returning the items in question to all of the PO'ed ppl and then letting the other shammy (Aprile) roll on the hammer. If &quot;they&quot; are serious about fixing this nightmare its a good start, if not then this is all just a bunch of BS and some setup for another scam. <p><br><br>

I'm not a net.grandpa but I've been communicating in text format for longer than most.  One thing that I find I'm very good at is telling the difference between folks based on how they write.<br>
<br>
Now, obviously grammar and spelling can make it easy to tell someone who's ignorant from someone who's educated, but I'm talking about subtle differences, like choice of words and sentence structure.  I can usually tell when someone is playing someone else's character.<br>
<br>
For example, I can tell when Lunawolf is being played by her real-life husband Wulfheart.  I can usually pick the she-males from the real women as well.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However, Dollaine and Bjornn had drastically different styles of communication.  I could clearly tell Bjornn from Dollaine.  Now it's possible Bjornn was playing Dollaine for a very short time and I just didn't notice because he was doing constant price checks and selling in /gu just like Dollaine constantly did.  But I can guarantee that he did not play Dollaine for very long periods of time because I watched Dollaine like a hawk when he was an initiate and I would have noticed.<br>
<br>
However, this conversation is rather pointless.  It's very clear to me, innoplaya, that you are in fact Dollaine.  You sound very much like Dollaine and the only person that would post this in the way you did is Dollaine.  You are also the only person that would be privy to this information.  Havern would know, but I would think he would have offered this information to me two weeks ago when I talked to him about the incident.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we're all wrong.  Perhaps most of the bad things you did should actually be attributed to Bjornn.  However I feel very strongly in guilty by association.  I do not associate with people that are morally corrupt.  You chose to associate yourself with Bjornn, and you knew about his wrongdoings and didn't report it to us.  In fact, you encouraged that we include him in the guild.  Claim ignorance if you will, but in the Real World(tm) people are judged by the company that they keep.<br>
<br>
Also, I had already started the process to have you removed as a member.  Why?  You were always clearly out for yourself.  That's not what the Elder Tribunal is about.  I could cite numerous examples, but I feel I've already divulged enough information about your initiation to the public (we generally keep all of this confidential).  Also the fact that you let someone other than yourself play you without our knowledge (members are not allowed to share accounts with non-members) is a complete violation of our trust and would have been grounds for removal.<br>
<br>
Finally, on a personal note - I find you to be a very well-spoken and &quot;nice&quot; young man.  You are generally nice to talk to and you are very friendly.  However it was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>very</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> clear to me that you had very loose morals and you were only really interested in what benefitted you.  It's actually not that uncommon among teenagers to be completely insensitive of other people's needs and be focused only on their own - it's a juvenile survival instinct.<br>
<br>
However the Elder Tribunal is a guild comprised of mature people and your behaviour is destructive and unwanted.  I'm sure you are having a very hard time with your terrible reputation, but you have to understand that you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> earned</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it, and now it's time to lay in the bed you made.  Stop blaming others.  Apologize for your behaviour and own up to your mistakes like a man.  Make reparations for your mistakes and for Bjornn's, and you'll find that folks will start to accept you once again.<br>
<br>
As far as coming back to Elder Tribunal, you never will.  You blew your second chance.  Perhaps you're not guilty of everything that folks have attributed to you, but your name comes up so much you're <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>clearly</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> guilty of something.  Add that to the fact that you weren't a good member when you were here means you will never see that guildtag over your head again, at least not while I'm on duty.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this is blunt and rather brutal but I'm hoping that perhaps this will help you change your ways.  If you continue in this behaviour you'll find that Everquest isn't the only place you'll have problems.  Folks in the real world don't have as short of memories as we do.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your travels. <p><b>Bonestriker</b><br>

<br>
The fact that you performed this petty deception to try and change the way that others view you is exactly why you have a bad reputation, and is exactly the kind of unethical behaviour that caused you to be removed from the Elder Tribunal.<br>
<br>
Regardless, we have nothing more to say.  Please take my advice to heart, and stop trying to weasel yourself out of this mess.<br>

What else is on the list?  I'm going to guess the following:<br>
<br>
* Blacks<br>
* Women<br>
* Mexicans<br>
* Gays<br>
* Women<br>
* Catholics<br>
* Did I mention women?<br>
