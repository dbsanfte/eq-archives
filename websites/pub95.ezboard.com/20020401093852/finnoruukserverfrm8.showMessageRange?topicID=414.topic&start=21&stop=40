<br>
The above posters are correct, he is up for approx 30 min and is promptly killed.  1 group can do it easily.  <br>
<br>
The problem you will have is the same guild kills him over and over and over (coughendlessendeavorcough) and farms the epic items for MQ to trade for other items.  They know precisely when he was killed and when he will respawn so they can do it again.<br>

Your name matches what everyone in KK last night seen and what I see for days there. Question is why had to invis all your accounts, like Paloem, Ewin, Wizport and have them stand certain spots. I even seen one nuking at zoneline. You can be in combat with Phinny that far away, because  he surely  not anywhere near there?<br>
I going to have Devyon look into this, to be honest it turns my stomach that you see nothing wrong with nonstop farming him looting bard bone for epic on all your many characters  just so you can MQ it for 6k.  What ever happened to community or escaping RL to meet friends. How do you expect help on your epic, groups, guilds, or generally having pleasant EQ experience by doing this? <br>

Only Estrella , Seahorse Patriarch , Phinigel , Shimmering Sailfin, and Some Swirlspines see invis. Thus if you are going to phinnies lair invis is a good thing. Pretty self explanitory. Second in KK as in many zones (as a seasoned player should know) you have to see your target in order to cast on him..... Another thing you see as suspicious out the window. And Lastly I have talked to Deyvon extensively on this situation Phinny is first in force. This does not mean you can go camp mermaids for 4 hours and expect someone who has been camping Phinny for 2 hours to agree that you were camping him. Can you go camp Efreeti in SolB for 4 hours and expect a guild who moved in on Naggies Lair to let you have spawn because you were in zone first? If that is the case what makes Phinny Different?<br>
<br>
If someone wants to kill him they can camp him. First come first serve. If they dont want to bother camping him they can buy the items. (Not sure why they would try to camp him being that the chance of him having the specific item you want on him is slim) But I have never overrun anyone who was camping him there and have also let guilds take him after I had been camping ask TFC , Finite , Iceni ect ect ect.<br>
<br>
The point is if you arent willing to camp him yourself dont complain if someone else is.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uastralblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Astralblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/1/02 2:48:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Farming</span><hr size=1> The difference is you can't time EXACTLY when efreeti will spawn.

We had a mage who needs the phin part for his epic, we were in the next room over, and we'd been there all day (i know cause Fadina were leaving from killing him the first time when I first zoned in) and after you killed him, you managed to /auc the MQ for mage epic item.<br>

Technically not against the rules, but not very nice.  I might have to go sit on Phinny for a while, I dont like what you are doing.<br>

Yes endless endeavor must mean phinny farming.  I always wondered what those words meant.

There are quite a few people who would like to kill Phinny and when it is always camped by you and your crew of Phinny farmers, it is hard for people to actually get that piece for their epic.  But I guess they can always go to you and buy the mq for it?<br>

Remember you told everyone not to attack it? Which was a good honest mistake. Then the paladin there attacked it as well as a necro which you may or may not have seen. I Told the necro to /kill the pet which he did. I then told everyone to bring it back to fight it since it was only one. You swam back the paladin decided to swim it across the room instead of bringing it back. Thus because it had aggro from people already attacking it we were screwed. Do you honestly think it wouldnt come back for you after it already had aggro on you... I remember you were the first one it attacked and I decided to help you guys instead of having you die. If I had not helped you (which I prolly shouldnt have and just invised my characters) 2 of them would not have died. Dont say @#%$ about me training because I did no such thing if anyone trained it was you yourself and the paladin although I do not believe at all you did it on purpose you 2 just did not know a single thing about kedge keep. Which is why he died 3 times trying to get the paladin bone till finally you left and I helped him get it. Then I had to COTH him to exit cause he didnt know the zone way. Nice of you to just leave him there. He even told me he realized it was him who swam the single horse across the room because he didnt know where to go and like I said do you honestly think it wouldnt come after you when you were the first one to have aggro? I know it came after me cause I tried nuking it off you. Point is you blame someone else for training when it not only was someone in your group but the one to first bring it was you yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ufirkang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>firkang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/1/02 8:55:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: training</span><hr size=1> meadbh yes you and others blammed me for training and even people from your guild said we were reported, but never has anyone said, oh sorry it wasnt you.

And yes we stuck around for CR where we could have also just did ours fast and split.

But sure enough he jumped right in without second thought and killed it, though was 28 others all MM in zone.  After re-reading this post they did mention coming to KK in raid and there website even have it mentioned weeks before I did, I just thought was respectful If I backed off. I even passed on what thought been great oppurunity to join them, learn about KK, because a bard was listed as coming and did not want just be greedy and there only for phinny.<br>
Selen even answered tells to me while she/he was hanging raid, so its no question at all that toldly side with her/him and confidence in that side of story.<br>
All I can say now is if gets group full of tells and we meet I would be motivated to stay and fight for camp according to rules. Otherwise I can at least help people with their epics, look me up, amazing that seems to allude people that is what makes this game great and that some actually want to be involved in here own epic and not just hang over ton of pp to greed.<br>

No, it doesn't and only because it was unintentional.  Mistakes happen all the time.  It's not really a big deal, and Ewin graciously helped to drag corpses and rezzed me so I could rez the others.  Thank you, Ewin.  I would like to suggest that people who were not present refrain from pointing fingers as you do not have both sides of the story, and there are always two sides. <br>
<br>
Also, there is no room for vindictiveness in EQ.  It is a game.  I see a lot of these accusations as pure jealousy directed towards a person who has put in the time and effort to get what he wants.  If you want the camp, then go there and camp Phinny.  Put in the time and effort to get what you want.  I am sure Erwin and his crew would not ks you.  He seemed to be quite an honorable and reasonable person.  <br>

The guy just seems obsessed with Kedge, and why not, tis great exp for a group of 4.  <br>
<br>
My guild showed up for a Kedge raid, 3 hours before Phinny spawned.  We were doing Druid epic as well, and spent a while camping several Corrupted Horses.  This guy showed up, asked us what we were up to, told us exactly when phinny would spawn, and left.  He could have easily sawm over to the phinny's spawn and KS'd him before we even knew.  If not for him telling us when Phinny was gonna spawn, our guild would have left long before.<br>

Phinny has always been a FiF race just like many of the dragons.  How is this farming any different than the countless druids that farm items?  For example AC in OOT or Sro.  <br>
<br>
Dgirard have you talked to Paloem about this or are you just going by what someone else was saying?   <br>
<br>

<br>
I am not saying that Selen is lying but it is her side of the story.  Just like any other story there are always three sides, side 1, side 2, and the truth.  A story changes just by the fact that you did not witness it first hand.  Everyone reacts to situations in different ways.  Some word in a tell that was skipped in transposing may hold a stronger meaning for you than it did in the orginal story teller.<br>
<br>
Did MM ask if anyone was going after Phinny? Is it my reponsiblity as a player to check everyones website to make sure there are no clashes?  I have been on quite a few raids that there were conflicts between guilds or people over spawns but some one ussually asks a question instead of assuming that my raiding party has the right of way.<br>
<br>
These are my opinions alone.  I do not know any of the story other than what I have read here.  Yes both Paloem and Firkang are friends of mine if that matters in your judgement of my statements and questions.   <br>

Fact is MM held raid perfectly and sudden the have issues when he arrives, on purpose or not, something to consider. I may haveMS but not stupid, these last few sudden post honoring him does not wash. My sister is sick and I have other things worry about today and all this talk about Fifo, farming, its harsh eq world first come garabage.<br>
Life is short, is so hard to think of others time to time instead this Fifo, etc.<br>
