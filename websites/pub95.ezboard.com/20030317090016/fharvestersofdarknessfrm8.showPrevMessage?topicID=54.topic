There was no sight, no sound, no touch.  There was nothing, nothing but the impenetrable blackness, and a detached mind.  Slowly, thoughts returned, incorporeal snippets of time, vicious in both their vividness, and their truth.  Fear...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ssakas stood trembling in front of Kelisk.  This was the first time that their cold eyes had met, but Kelisk was not unknown.  As a broodling, Ssakas had heard stories, no, legends of this one.  The Skathris Ven'Sho.  Before he had left Cabilis for the first time, Ssakas dreamed of standing side by side with this one, fighting together for the Empire, for the Faceless.<br>
<br>
But that was before the visions, that was before the dreams.  Ssakas now stood before Kelisk prepared to fight, not as allies, but as enemies.  The fear intensified, constricting around him like a snake.  His mace shivered in his hand.  Kelisk sighed softly, and spoke.  &quot;You may tell your mistress Sarhea that I have missed her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Fear.  Disembodied voices swirled through the black, echoing in his mind.  The tone, the pitch, the volume, variable, ever changing, twisting through his thoughts, implanting subconsciously. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Kelisk was toying with him.  Blood poured freely from Ssakas' face, rushing down the front of his armor.  As it ran down his face, it filled his eyes, clouding them.<br>
<br>
And when he cleared his vision, he no longer saw Kelisk in front of him.  He saw Saurix.<br>
<br>
He heard Thenic say quietly, &quot;The hate you two have for each other is heartwarming,&quot; as he once again threw himself at his foe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hate.  It was a new emotion, one that he had been taught to suppress, to bury down deep inside.  Hate ripped through the darkness, suffocating him, as he floated over a twisted vision of Cabilis.  He looked down upon the city where he was raised, his home until scant weeks ago, yet although familiar, it had changed, changed so much.  Buildings once magnificent now lay in ruin, the canal ran crimson, the streets littered with fallen blocks of stone.  Cabilis burned in his vision, and as he floated the streets he saw a young Iksar below, crumpled to his knees, as a warlord stood over him in glory.  He willed himself down, trying to catch a glimpse of what was about to unfold.  The warlord readied himself for the final blow, calculating the force needed to sever the head cleanly.  It was then that he recognized the warlord.  Saurix.  He stood not unlike he stood now, once over Ssakas.  The blow fell, and as the young knights head rolled across the paving stones, Ssakas realized with a shock that it was his own head.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It was over.  Kelisk lifted Ssakas off of the ground by his throat, crushing the life out of him.  Ssakas hung limp from Kelisk's hand.<br>
<br>
Kelisk snickered.  &quot;Good night little broodling&quot;<br>
<br>
With his last breath of life, Ssakas looked deep into kelisk's black eyes.  &quot;The Empire had betrayed our lord.  Follow his wishes...&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Once again in the blackness, lucid thought returning, Ssakas could hear footsteps, earth shattering quakes, shaking his soul.  Below him he could feel solid ground.  He pushed himself up, to his feet, balancing against each quake.  The footsteps seemed to be getting farther away with every shake of the earth, until they suddenly stopped.  And then, with no light, Ssakas could see.  He dropped to both knees, hands to his face, and he started to laugh, first quietly, then slowly building, until tears ran down his scales, and the laughter roared through out this city of fear, echoing off the obsidian towers, off the blood soaked streets, and then it was not one laugh, but two, as a female voice roared her laughter, overwhelming Ssakas.  His hands went to protect his inner ears, trying uselessly to ignore the sound, the maddening sound.  He choked on his laughter, eyes widened, the vastness of the vision before him taking control.<br>
<br>
With all the power of his voice he screamed out.   &quot;Vazaelle....&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Ssakas sat up with a jolt.  He looked around franticly, trying to determine where he was.  The grass below him, blood soaked, the jungle before him...The feerrott.  He looked to his side, at Thenic thanking the Father for returning this childe of fear back to life.  Razuk looked down on him, and then placed him upon his shoulders.<br>
<br>
Out of the jungle, they carried him home.  They carried him back to Harvester's Hall.<br>
<br>
Ssakas drifted in and out of sleep as they travelled.  But one thought stuck to his mind, no matter what he tried to replace it with.  <br>
<br>
Paineel.<br>
