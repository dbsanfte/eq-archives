<br>
<br>
“..Flaming..” Andareil muttered as she raised her sword gripping the leather grip with both hands.<br>
<br>
“….Andareil Ka’Ryusa, Soon to be Death angel Correct?” The angel man said leveling the tip of the ethereal blade at her<br>
<br>
“Yeah, So what?” she asked stepping away from that blade..<br>
<br>
“I want to see if you will survive your…Transformation, A dragon spell is hard to do, Im surprised your even awake now” he said his eyes narrowed<br>
<br>
“The boy your attracted too, He will become a powerful Mage one day” The Angel man backed away spreading his wings a few black tinged feathers fell before him”er..Im…no-“<br>
“You’re a bad lier..Now..Face me. I promise not to kill you” he said readying himself the blade away from him an odd stance. wait that wasn’t even a stance!…what was he trying to pull! The blade was low to the ground, he was perfectly calm..<br>
<br>
“Lloth , Protect me” Andareil whispered softly. As she crouched low her blade moving to her right a bit held still in both of her hands<br>
<br>
“Do you think your Goddess will protect you from the fury of an Death angel!?” he laughed softly as she launched herself at him, swinging her blade in a wide arc it caught his, it flashing upward as  he slide it up and then down again at her neck as she  propelled herself backwards all fingers but two holding down her middle and index up, her right hand around the handle of her blade the tip pointing at him as she circled.. he was breathing softly. so he was trying to tire her out…hehhe..<br>
<br>
<br>
Drow women where known for there increased stamina strength and, well about anything that ANY other elves could offer…But, He was an Death Angel…Fuccckkkk<br>
<br>
“..I know what you’re trying to do!” she said standing tall<br>
<br>
“Tiring you out, No actually. Merely testing your strength. That first attack was okay…Im sure you can do better!, lets see…how you HANDLE THIS!” he flew at her literally trailing the  blade behind him she whipped it upward too fast! It ripped her shoulder armor in half cutting right thru the chain mail and adamanite band as that sleeve fell off as she spun around whipping her long sword down it caught him! Slicing a few feathers off of his wingtip as he spun around swinging his blade. Everything seemed to slow down it arced, a slight after image followed after it as it paused at Andareil’s face. She back flipped away as he sliced if she was still there, her head would be rolling around. She launched herself again her feet pounding against the cold earth. She let out a loud Kiai to focus as she held her blade low. Focusing her energy into an attack known as 100 demons. A muti slash tech. She roared out the Kiai, her feet skidding to a halt holding the blade behind her head slightly diagonally as she slashed at him madly each attack following into the next. a black after trail came from each slash as she neared number a hundred. The blade again! It whipped out slicing thru  her breastplate just enough to remove it… she staggered back, as her top fell off. She was only clad in a thin black cloth wrap. The single sleeve on her right arm. and her leggings where the only thing keeping her from embarrassment, her cheeks burned a deep violet blushing. he was undressing her…<br>
<br>
 he stepped back, tiny rivulets of blood began to flow. Bloody feathers fell down as he smirked despite the pain” Your very Beautiful. To think, You’ll never age….You already could have any one you want..” he remarked. his hawk like eyes looking past her flesh into her soul. She was complex, power was hidden, even from her in every fiber of her being, she was a sad girl, not wanting this fate, but she would triumph.<br>
<br>
“Now. Before your fully naked I think you should do something about that hm?” he smiled softly raising his blade at her, ether sparked as she growled running forward her blade held at her side the tip far away.. lunar mana began to flow and spiral around the blade,<br>
 his eyes widened as she  leaped upwards, the image of a bright crescent moon appearing behind her….she crashed down whipping her blade down in a gigantic crescent the crescent energy went thru him sending him reeling backward bloodied feathers flew into the air as she spun around catching his cheekbone with her boot  still air borne her blade went out  meaning to slice at him again but before that, his fist slammed into her throat, her eyes bugged out as he kicked her hard in the gut sending her   where she belongs.. on the earth. Her hands went to her throat as the ether blade settled at her throat. As it slide down. It was slightly warm, she realized he willed it this way as it slit her wrap apart, she blushed violently as  she could breath again, was he actually healing her? Meep! He had removed her wrap  and was currently staring at her breasts, he kicked her over moving her onto her back as he examined her marks. They had grown, covering all of her shoulder blades now. excellent. she was rather uncomfortable the grit causing some pain in her more private chest area’s.<br>
<br>
“..Your wing marks are progressing wonderfully. You’ll Exalt soon enough. Try to stay alive…The Masked one doesn’t want you alive more than necessary” he removed his boot from her back as he turned her back over, throwing the ruined cloth at her she caught it making a few medications it covered her breasts again, yay<br>
<br>
“Why?” she asked, he was bloody, and burned but still was attractive as anything on two legs should be..<br>
<br>
<br>
“….I Just. Don’t want to see any more Death, Now. Become a full Reaver..and get used to Daylight…Oh and” he reached into a pouch at his side withdrawing an ancient looking Katana, dusty and almost totally rusted  as he tossed it at her<br>
“What is this crappy thing?”<br>
<br>
“A Divine blade that was used by the last Death angel….It needs to be awakened again..”<br>
<br>
“The…Masamune?”<br>
<br>
<br>
“You know your race’s history well…” He smiled lightly as he began to walk away, he looked up at the startled crowd above, all staring at him as a few guards ran in. arm mounted blades clad in violet armor, blood red eyes Andareil shouted ”Leave him!” the Guards twitched, and stood aside all sneering at him<br>
<br>
&gt; Good Choice beautiful one&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt;….I hate it when people do that&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;What probe into your mind?&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Yeah&gt;<br>
Ø&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ….&lt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt; How do I activate the Masamune?&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;Ask it to help you, you need to shed your own blood to it,  My beloved, Lilith used that blade…&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt; By Lloth’s Will…My Family killed Lilith..&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;And Who says the Gods don’t have a sense of humor?&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt;….&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;Andareil, My Death angel, Are you mad at me?&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt; No, Slightly embarrassed , But a Katana?…I don’t know how to use one!&gt;<br>
“You’ll Learn Love, You’ll learn. Seek out  a Ronin, a human sadly enough, that goes by the name of Phoenix….He Will know more of the Masked One, Careful of the Ninja Clan, .Kurai No Ryu<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkness’s Dragon?<br>
 His wings unfurled as he leaped into the air, flying away,..Andareil sat their. as Kor rushed over calling for a healer, his eyes where worried, he’d never seen Andareil so, focused before. and naked…<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 *                *                    *<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3 days later, the celebration of Andareil’s accession into the ranks of the Reaver guild of Lloth, it happened at the spire of Lloth, the main temple.<br>
<br>
<br>
She was dressed in her finest  gown. She personally didn’t like dresses, cus she couldn’t fight in them….unless they where all baggy and @#%$, but why wear something like that when you just where a pair of pants to move around in?…it was a beautiful gown anyway. Made of a thin fabric it went down  a  wide neck. The fabric showed her frame well, her face held little makeup as always just some slight kohl for her eyes and black for her lips. Her hair was done up in a tight braid going down her mid back, two long fore locks went to her shoulders going down just in front of her pointed ears. The dress traveled down her form perfectly slitting at her legs, revealing the musculature of them easily, her feet where in dress slippers as she kneeled before the elder Reaver, a woman of impressive size and strength. Thankfully no Drow women looked Amazonian in the least, she could wield a Claymore easily enough, they just didn’t show it. The Reaver woman took out a long spidery thin long sword, she tapped her on both shoulders, as Andareil took her new sword, the Masamune in all of his forgotten glory as she slit her finger, a vermilion drop falling across the blade<br>
<br>
”Masamune, Holy blade. Help me. As you’ve helped Lilith…” she whispered softly as the blade sparked sending a current of white hot energy into Andareil creating a shockwave. Andareil blinked. Looking at the new blade before her. A katana perfectly forged  the blade was a pristine almost clear color., as if it was made of glass, It was!, a strange blue fire burned within the glass, her blood was no where to be seen, she traced a finger over the blade, it was hot!, she removed her hand quickly before suffering an even worse burn. She looked at her body, the Saya was in her left hand her outfit had changed her shirt was a flowing hakama a soft onyx  an slim obi was wrapped around her waist keeping her  waist shapely. Her hakama-shita where a soft gray also flowing down  sandals of all things where  on her feet, she blinked at the sudden change.<br>
“…The Masamune” he Reaveress smiled softly<br>
<br>
The after party was wonderful!, most Drow nobility parties where very wild where normally every sort of perversion went on, some that Andareil even shivered at. She mostly just ran away Kor in tow. She took him to a private corner, letting the curtains cover their actions as they embraced, there faces inches away she was breathing out what he breathed in, there eyes softened as his hand caressed her cheek softly”Andareil…I” he said his eyes looking uncharacteristically soft , he was always rather stoic. except around her, she was mostly the same, ever since childhood, different guilds, they always where friends.. .slowly they had developed into, something more…<br>
<br>
 They kissed, it was one of sweet little half kisses that lasted for only seconds but conveyed a sort of love, they pulled back blushing wildly<br>
“Andareil…I love you” She collapsed into him wrapping her arms around him, she was slightly taller and bigger than him he held her against him, closing his eyes. they stayed that way in a simple embrace.<br>
<br>
It was little more than that as the night grew on, hugging slight kissing. basic cutesy stuff.<br>
<br>
They were slightly drunk, Andareil leaning onto the only inches shorter male, as he simply lead her to her room.. they shared a final goodnight kiss as he walked off, she flopped down on her bed smiling softly. as she fell asleep letting 5 words hang in the air” I love you too Kor”<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Fight ending up with cuteness…Ick I just cant do cuteness…Oh and sorry for the brief nekkidness.., I don’t want to make it too graphic. but then I need to like. shame it..so..nyeah… Oh and if any of you know Im in love with the name Lilith, its just cool..<br>
<br>
Yum Plot!. Masked One, I hope I can pull off of what I want to do with this story..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p>- its so easy when your evil!<br>
