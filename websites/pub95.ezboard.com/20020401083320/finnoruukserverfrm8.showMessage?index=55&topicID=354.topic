Tunzell's monk didnt train DoW in fear , you got that part right , he trained Vigil while they were making one of their less pathetic attempts at breaking in.  hell we actually thought they were going to make it.  that's why Meslow zoned in to loot his corpse.  he trained Meslow after his FD failed and the scareling that were on him had him down to about 40% hp.  we were never &quot;broken&quot; in the plane , so if you were FD on north wall the entire time how do i know you're using a fungi?  you could argue that &quot;all monks wear fungis~!&quot; which is a valid argument because -most- probably do by now , but yeah whatever.  point is Meslow died with you targeted with a funny little &quot;/gu @#%$ %t training my ass after i looted my corpse. I mean WTF kind of sorry @#%$ are these people?&quot;<br>
<br>
haha Meslow my little child prodigy~!  FU Meslow , sorry  =(<br>
<br>
and Kutee you fuqtard , compared to the previous &quot;hi i have no life&quot; hours i played before i technically -don't- play anymore.  oh and i've not once claimed to be the more mature person.  i'm like a 3 year old in a 20 year old's body , smaller @#%$ though of course.  people that know me know i dont lie 99% of the time.  of course we've all had sex with 14 more women than we really have , which accounts for that other 1% , but this goes back to me being immature , which is another argument for another time.<br>
<br>
FACTS:<br>
1.  we got trained 3 times so no PoF for us , oh well<br>
2.  i'm immature , again , oh well<br>
3.  Wolfypaw is a retard for disagreeing with me and because of FACT #2 i hope you get drug through the streets by an angry 90 year old man in protest of the 5 cent tax raise on cigarettes.<br>
4.  Kutee is just @#%$ stupid because the shemale thinks i care that i'm immature<br>
5.  i hate you Ugle but you're fair about most stuff so i guess props to you for that , even though half the time you just plain annoy me i can see your point.  and as a side note , your guild wasnt killing the Lord spawn we needed in CoM nor did you know how to get to the BRs to spawn him and even if you did spawn him you would have died because you couldnt have killed him.  old , moot(sp?) point.<br>

Are you now attempting to change the definition of First in Force as placed in the Summit you wrote and we all agreed to?  Seems to me it says &quot;18 people&quot; not &quot;18 people that have already successfully broken the plane.&quot;<br>
<br>
If &quot;First in Force&quot; = 18 and Guild Foo has 18 planer level people there, they they are &quot;First in Force&quot; and anyone else can go find somewhere else to play.  Of all people, Wolfypaw, I would not expect you to redefine the terms mid-argument.  And Ugle is right.  The guild that is First in Force, ie; has 18 people there, owns the plane and can ask intruders to leave.  Personally, I don't really care if someone is FD up there when I'm there with my guild.  When Amici took advantage of a First in Force day and a The Defiant SK was FD in the zone the entire time, I quite frankly didn't care.  I was nervous that a bunch of TD would come swarming into the zone but TD has been doing quite abit recently to polish up it's tarnished reputation (ie; not doing questionable things and apparently keeping a lid on some of the more &quot;outspoken&quot; members).  My estimation for TD has gone up considerably as a result.<br>
<br>
This Order of the Charred Heart monk, however noble his intentions, was in violation of Summit III as written by you and agreed to by the various guild leaders of this server.  I'll note that the aforementioned TD SK seems to have been guildremoved from The Defiant.  I think it's an ironic circumstance when The Defiant (I am assuming here) disciplines a member of their ranks for presumably violating the summit in the very manner you are now condoning.<br>
<br>
Now, perhaps my facts are mistaken and Dead of Winter did not, in fact, have 18 people present for this raid on the Plane of Fear.  Regardless, they had more forces assembled than did Order of the Charred Heart (a guild for whom I have the highest respect, based soley on the membership of Balfor Honorblade).  I cannot, and will not accept that the monk had any right to be in plane that day regardless of the presence of Dead of Winter as 1 monk does not a &quot;First in Force&quot; raiding party make, as defined by you in Summit III and agreed to by the various guild leaders of this server.  And in not being First in Force, the plane was not owned by the guild represented bu the monk, and therefore the guild represented by the monk should not have had any forces in the plane at all (read: the monk). <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

If it is a FIF or FFA day, you can have 1, 2, or 17 people in the plane.  If someone comes in with 18 people, then you leave or /q as appropriate.  If you are 1 person and 17 members of some other guild are there and ask you to leave, well according to the summit they aren't FIF yet and really can't do anything.<br>
<br>
With the way things are today though, 1 group could be considered FIF for anything but golems, draco, and CT.<br>

Another fact is they didn't ask me to leave, one of them asked me to /q with something of a cryptic (to me at least) reasoning.  Didn't say anything about who they were, why they had the right to ask me too, for how long or anything like that.  I've already admitted that I unwittingly left things open for problems to arise by being afk, and that won't happen again.  So, for those of you (I think just Ugle) who assume that I'm some crazy maverick that's out there just to train others for my own benefit, you're just plain wrong.  This isn't open for debate, I know my intentions, you don't.  Simple as that.<br>
<br>
Now, as long as people are hanging on technicalities, here you go.  Definitions that I read in the summit gave no one the right to ask me to leave, that is until LoD got there, and they chose not to.  But guess what, had I been there (at the terminal) and someone asked me to leave, I would have.  I can totally understand that you can't trust everyone, and not everyone knows me.  I wouldn't have liked, but I wouldn't have taken it personally either.  I never, NOT ONCE, said that I refused to do so, this was never an issue to me.  Some people are reading this into the story, but it never happened.  By the time I came back to my terminal LoD was just starting to zone in, so I stayed.<br>

First from personal experience and several other posts about them on a different subject OoCH is probably one of the better guilds on our server which holds their members to a higher standard than most, and Tunzell is one of their better peeps. If you want to get technical then DoW only had 12 members in plane by their own admission and therefore by summit agreement did not have enough to claim FiF so that if shissar did spawn and Tunzell called for more guildmembers and friends to come and their total was greater than 18 he could have asked Dow to leave. As it was no one at the time could claim FiF so for DoW to ask him to leave was wrong. <br>
 Second he stated he was Afk, god how many times have I done that? a crp load waiting Fd'd for Rharzar to spawn while I was off doing something else only to periodically check to see if it spawned, and I am sure that I am not the only one.<br>
 The only real point of contention was if Tunzell trained DoW or not? the rest is really a non-issue at the time. I wasn't there at the time so there is no first hand knowledge on the incident only a reasonable doubt to that having been the case. The reasons for this are as follows 1. He was stated as being on the north wall while DoW was breaking in to the west, now thats a heck of a run without getting your ass reamed by the mobs up.<br>
 2.There was more than one person (other than members of DoW) in zone which could have been one of them? don't know but by knowledge of OoCH and its members, and reason Tunzell was there makes it unlikely that he would have done that?<br>
 3. Motive: what was his motivation for this act? just being a jerk? wouldn't be consistant with observed past behavior. Trying to keep Dow out of Plane? well as stated he could have easily gotten FiF if spawn popped and DoW did not have it at time (easily because there is at least 12 non OoCH members that I know of that would have ran to assist if asked, myself being one of them).<br>
 Is it possible that events occurred as stated by DoW members, yes but not necessarily probable. There was obviously a cluster phuque that happened and DoW was at the recieving end of it and for that am sorry, if you need the 18 to keep, even just for numbers I dont mind helping others and there is nothing on PoH, nor PoF that I need or desire now cept to help others, this holds true for DoW, OoCH or not quite as uber as others guild_01.<br>
 Maybe something can be worked out between Tunzell and Dow, or OoCH and Dow to smooth things over, if you give them a tell without spite, or anger most likely you would get it. Again just my 2 cents worth.<br>

<br>
the problem with your little summit is you've always tried to put number restrictions on things.  first it was &quot;you can only have 6 guests!&quot; and now it's &quot;have to have 18 to be FiF , sorry!&quot; but the summit isnt going to work as long as you keep trying this horse @#%$ because you'll have people like this @#%$ monk that &quot;@#%$ on other people's pancakes&quot; (Bodkin sucks ass , but that always makes me laugh  =/ ) just because they feel like it.<br>
<br>
do away with the numbers because your FiF isnt my FiF and my FiF can kick your FiF's ass~! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubrogunesforoad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brogun ESFOROAD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/23/02 4:18:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: :(</span><hr size=1>  Kaurik were you born this much of a jerk or did you get here through hard work, diligence and p*nis envy? . The only reason I brought up the numbers was that the FiF per summit was used as an issue not that I really care about what it takes to break Fear. <br>
 The point I brought up is still valid and has as of yet not been disputed rationally (if thats possible) by you and that is the issue of intentionally training your group.<br>
 You have shown by your own words to be of dubious belivability although there are several other DoW members whos words I respect, unfortunatly you continue to make it very hard to respect you or your opinions. If you can please dispute the issue at hand without resorting to constant vulgarities ( mine was used to show that yes indead I can be a jerk too, just not as proficient as you seem to be)<br>

<br>
Brogun you @#%$ sucker , read my post.  i didnt insult you in any way and you say i got @#%$ envy?  WTF did that come from?  SOMEONE NEEDS THEIR SHOT OF MATURITY FOR THE DAY HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH~!~!~!  the point you brought up can suck my ass.  &quot;the summit's&quot; idea of FFA doesnt apply to us nor do the rest of the rules.  we choose to stay out of the planes except on FiF/FFA days to avoid @#%$ like this.  it's simple , if we're there first just find something else to do or get ready to deal with the horse @#%$ that comes along with fighting for spawns with us.  we've not done hate and fear a few times because it was already taken on the FiF/FFA days and we will be respected the same.  that's the end of this discussion as far as i'm concerned.<br>
<br>
as for your other load of horse @#%$ , the only thing i've ever said that can even be halfway considered &quot;not the truth&quot; is me saying i dont play anymore.  compared to how/how long i used to play i really dont play anymore.  i make it to ToV once a week if i'm lucky and someone lets me use their character because they have a headache and/or dont want to go or if i dont have homework due the next day i might log on to chat before i go to bed.<br>
<br>
my @#%$ is 7 and a half inches long and makes me smile when it shoots it's love juice halfway across the room , nope , no @#%$ envy here.  =(  THOUGHT I WOULD THROW THIS IN THERE TO MAKE SURE MY MATURITY LEVEL REMAINS AT IT&quot;S ALL TIME LOW HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH!~!~!~!~! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 4:23:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=72>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: :(</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Brogun Esforoad<br>
