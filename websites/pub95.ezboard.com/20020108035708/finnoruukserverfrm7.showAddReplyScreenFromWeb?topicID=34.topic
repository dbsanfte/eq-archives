beginning</span><hr size=1> This is a work in progress,I just felt like writing a EQ story and I wrote up a little bit.May post other chapters later.Hope you all like my story!Enjoy reading<br>
Chapter 1-The Beginning(creative chapter title eh?)<br>
<br>
Deebin sat down comfortably on his soft whicker chair.He lifted his pipe gently to his mouth and opened his book to enjoy a nice night like any little Halfling would like too, a hard knock came to the thick wooden door as he started leaning back in his chair and he tumbled over onto the dirt ground of his home.He got back up quickly thinking &quot;Why who could be here at this time?&quot;.The knock continued until he opened his door and a fist almost hit his face.&quot;Err sorry there Deebin,Didn't see you open that door there,I almost right hit you in the face!&quot; Said a bald big nosed Halfling.&quot;No worries Foblo, but what is important at this time of the night?I was about to start reading my favorite book!Then you came racking at the door.&quot;replied Deebin scratching his head where he had gotten a bruise from the fall.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is urgent!Just about an hour ago at old Kethicor Forest My pony got startled and tipped me over!It ran off in fear!I ran as fast as I could,surely If an undead had seen me I could not get away from it without being killed!So I ran back to Riverale thinking how I could get him back.Then I thought of you Deebin, you explored that forest many times in the day when you were young, you know the forest best out of this whole old town here.I need you to bring him back here.Will you do it?Please&quot;Foblo said as he got on his knees begging for Deebins help.<br>
<br>
        Now Deebin is no warrior.He only explored the forest as a child many many years ago.About Onezero years ago was the last time he entered that cursed forest.He has never fought(against anything or anyone that would kill him).He also has gotten quite stubby in his years.He raised that pony though for Foblo and he just couldn't see it go without even trying.He went and walked by where he had fallen,grabbed his pipe and took a smoke.He dropped it and said &quot;I'll do it!But only for ol' prince brown, I'm not doing this for you!.&quot;He answered as he cracked his knuckles.&quot;Thank you Deebin!This deed shall not go frogotten.Hurry!&quot;<br>
<br>
        Deebin packed a little water than headed through Riverale to the Kethicor forest.He entered through the small tunnel in Riverale to the cursed forest.When he got there it was almost pitch black.He could see his way through though,he recognized many of the trees.Knowing Foblo as Deebin did he probably stayed on or near the dirt path made by travellers.He went on the path then turned east after heading some north,this was a way he took many times with the pony when he was younger.<br>
<br>
He walked some that way then found a trail of red blood, he ran following it then found the mutilated corpse of Prince Brown.He looked at the corpse and sat down next to it remembering the journeys they took near this very place.He sat there for minutes,though it only seem a moment.Then he jumped up and started thinking.He thought himself &quot;Something must've killed Prince Brown,what if it was one of the undead and they are still around here?!&quot;.<br>
<br>
He shook his head and looked at the pony at once more then took off running back as fast as he could.He was almost to the path when a green skinned standing corpse was yards in front of him.He stood as still as he could, his whole body shaking,trying to be quiet though.Zombies can smell blood though,it turned around and looked at him and let out a moan of pain and despair.Deebin shrieked then ran.He outran the zombie by only a little,and it was only because he got a head start.It was still close though.He circled around one tree hoping to confuse the brainless beast but only to run into another one!He ran back then bumped into the other one,he turned away from both and ran a little but he was getting tired and they were not.He slowed down it was over,he prayed to Brell for help,he would do anything to get out of here.Give up everything and devote his life to a strict Cleric profession!Anything! The zombies neared closer and he began to pray harder....<br>
<br>
Hope ya all enjoyed<br>
