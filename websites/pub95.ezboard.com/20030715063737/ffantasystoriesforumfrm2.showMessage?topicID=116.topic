Iliaster had watched the torch burn for days now, he wasn't sure how many.  At times the fire would seem to explode, sending bits of burning embers flying through the small room, burning him when they landed on his skin.  At other times the flame seemed to stand still, all signs of it being alive (for fire is, alive) ceased.  Iliaster wasn't sure if it was just a trick or if his mind was playing games with him, but in those moments time seemed to stop.  The last time it had happened he could have sworn his heart stopped beating, but before he could be sure the fire sprang back to life and the beating of his heart echoed once again in his ears.  The silence in the room was overwhelming.  He could hear the blood being pumped through the small veins in his ears.  It was maddening.  It was the worst kind of torture; being left alone with yourself.  He didn't know if it was just to get a break from the deafening silence or because he was starting to loose his mind, but he had taken up talking to himself.  At first he would sing; songs of his youth or fighting songs he learned from bards at the pub he used to frequent.  Then the songs deteriorated as he began to forget the tunes.  He was amazed at how quickly he forgot them, having sung them so many times in that room.  He tried to tell himself jokes, but after finding that he couldn't remember any, he tried to make them up.  His mind was slow, he found that not only was he loosing his cognative abilities, but that it was as if he was forgetting how to form thoughts.  He realed with pain, but lacked even the most basic motor functions, making it both impossible to struggle against his bonds, but also denying him the ability to scream; to call out in pain; to beg for mercy.  His wrists and ankles were bound tightly with rope, so tightly in fact that he had lost all feeling in his hands and feet and had been bleeding profusly from where the ropes had dug into his skin (the blood had now hardned, locking the ropes into his skin under giant scabs).  He could no longer support the weight of his own head, so it hung, motionless, resting on the wall behind him.  His eyes were too dry to blink, so they stayed open, staring at the only door to the chamber and at the torch that hung next to it.<br>
     Although he coulnd't tell you how it happened, the torch went out.  It was not really that the fire was extinguished, but rather it stopped casting light.  The flame reamined but the room became dark.  This darkness however was not the typical darkness that one finds in a lack of light.  This darkness had a certain tangability to it.  It seemed to Iliaster that he breathed it, that he was floating in it, that it was alive.  It was then that the door opened.<br>
     The woman glowed in the absolute darkness.  Her skin was the palest skin could be, or maybe it just seemed so against the pitch black of her hair.  Her robes seemed to be made of the nightime, giving one the impression that her head and hands were floating in the air, for she glided smoothely through the doorway and to Iliaster.  <br>
     She spoke, and her lips moved, although what her lips did seemed to have no coriliation to what Iliaster heard.  Her voice was penetrating and echoed inside his head and he knew that it did not exist outside of his own mind.  Her words rang and stung.  They morphed into images.  <br>
<br>
     He was in his hometown, in his own house.  It was wartime and he had not been home for seven months, off fighting someone else's war in the frozen north.  It must have been night for as he moved through his house he found his wife and his two children asleep in their beds.  He knelt down at his wife's side and reached out to kiss her, being delicate not to wake her.  But the hand that reached out was not his hand.  It was ghostly pale and slender, like a woman's.  And the hand, instead of gently caraseing her cheek, ran one long fingernail across her face before plunging in her eye.  His wife woke, screaming.  Iliaster didn't want to see any of this.  He didn't like this dream, but the images were there in his mind and he could not simply wake up to escape them.  He watched in horror as his wife wad decapitated and her body mutilated to the point that it no longer resembled a human corpse.  His heart froze as the images now took him into his children's room.  He watched his daughter cower in the corner of the room and watch her brother being torn in two like a discarded piece of parchment paper.  Her face was spatered with his blood when she met the same fate.  Their combined blood pooled on the floor.  Words starting forming in the blood.  Words written in an ancient script that he could not read, but somehow he knew exactly what they said.  'the true paradises are the paradises we have lost.&quot;<br>
A single word escaped Iliaster's cracked dry lips, &quot;Paradise . . . &quot; and just as the last sound passed from him, a knife was shoved into his throat.  Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth and the pain that came would be with him for an eternity.<br>
     A girlish giggle echoed loudly in the room as the torch supptered back to life and cast light once again.  The flame grew in intensity and size until it consumed the whole room.  In only a matter of minutes the room was empty once again, save for a small pile of ashes on the floor.<br>
