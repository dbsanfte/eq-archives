<br>
Chapter 7<br>
<br>
&quot;Rememberance and Reflections.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Things had calmed down a great deal since the previous events from earlier that night. Though there was the fact that Leona's parents insisted that she stay at the cleric's guild house so her wounds could be tended to. There was also the fact that the local mage's where rather upset with not gaining a Reaper specimen, though none would really voice their opinion. In truth the reason behind this was they feared they could angry Ryo, which is someone they now had proof was more fierce than a Demon was.<br>
<br>
After the traumatic experience the earlier, Sir William had brought Nadia back to the guild house. In truth he was probably in more shock that Nadia was from the whole incident. She believed fully that no matter what Ryo was, he would of never intentionally hurt either her or Sir William. Still, Nadia was even more curious now that someone else seemed to have the same strength as Ryo, and she was determined to find out as much as she could. This was one of the many reasons she asked to stay in the same room as Leona. She couldn't think of a better way than to ask someone who had witnessed the event themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;So why did you ask to stay in here anyway? Besides taking care of me that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was hoping you might be able to tell me something about the young man you where with.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That Jerk?! I swear all he seems to be good for is attracting attention! I never got into this kind of trouble with my other...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh so you and him are seeing one another?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Absolutely not! It's all our parents idea. It's a rather long story, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh please go on! I want to learn as much as I can about your friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
For once Leona had a chance to actually talk to someone, even though should couldn't figure out why Nadia has such an interest in Zenki. Telling a story certainly was a lot better than letting her mind stay idle. After all she was curious about why all the events had taken place as well, perhaps telling the story might give her some insight at least.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess it really all started when my father disapproved of my last boyfriend, though I'm surprised my father tried to incinerate him all over a simple kiss. Which is why I ended up taking up lessons abroad.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like your father is still protective of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well eventually they asked me to meet them in Qeynos, seems I caught Zenki spying on me while I was taking a bath at the inn I was staying at.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that certainly is an odd way to meet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not only that, but the little creep stole my cloths. I had to chase him all over Qeynos and I still didn't get them back, even with the help of some of the local women.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like he's pretty quick on his feet, or very tricky.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh he's quick all right, and not under pulling some sneaky tricks. When I finally caught up with him he was hiding in his parents house, in which my parents where visiting at the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So both your parents are friends then, that explains why the sudden arrangement.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No kidding, I did my best to get out of the arrangement by going as far as to try and kill Zenki, I'm still not sure how he was capable of that part yet, no one has ever been fast enough to avoid my spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem pretty skilled as a sorceress, so exactly what happened when you confronted Zenki?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried to finish him off with Sunstrike, but everything seems hazy afterwards, I remember him using something to nullify it, and I know for certain it wasn't any kind of spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
To Nadia this seemed oddly like what she had witnessed from Ryo, in the fact that he seemed to have a great resistance to fire. There was also the fact that he had unbelievable fighting skills, much like some of the elder monks she had seen training. In truth this was all beginning to bring up some more questions, mostly about how it seemed that Zenki had these strange abilities.<br>
<br>
&quot;In order to pay for the damages we caused, our parents where making us run some errands, as well as some supplies from Qeynos to Freeport here. That's where we encountered the first demons I had ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would imagine they where much like the ones that appeared here, am I right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They were very different, they seemed more human, and from what I could tell they didn't have the strength that the one you probably seen did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So it sounds like there are more than one type of demon then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would guess so, I'm not entirely certain what happened, but I think when we where attacked that some kind of ability was released in Zenki. He went completely berserk, it was as if the power he had was controlling him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I assume that he destroyed the two demons then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, and as soon as the fight was over something transported us near here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not really sure I should tell you about the condition Zenki arrived in...&quot;<br>
<br>
It was now time for Leona to be curious, since she hadn't gave much thought to just how extreme Zenki's injuries had been. In truth from his outward appearance he didn't seem to be injured much, there were no bruises, even though he did have a few scratches. In her mind she began to remember the fight as she tried to determine just what Nadia was about to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see, when he arrived it was determined that most of Zenki's wounds where on his left side. This included his collar bone, shoulder, and the majority of the bones in his left arm which seemed to be completely shattered.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In laymen's terms...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It means that it should of been nearly impossible for Zenki to fight, even with the treatments we had been giving him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So will he be all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It will be awhile before we can really tell that.&quot;<br>
<br>
In truth, Zenki had just began to regain consciousness in the next room over. The most noticeable thing was that the entire upper left side of his body seemed to be numb. When his eyes finally came into focus he could see the room around him, it seemed plain and barren. After finally sitting up and taking a closer look around it only seemed natural that he figure out just where he was, and more importantly where Leona had gotten to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wonderful... First she wrecks my life, then my dreams, and now she off doing who knows what...&quot;<br>
<br>
One thing that plagued Zenki's mind was why his numb arm was bandaged so methodically. If anything he could tell just by looking that the wrappings where more or less to restrict movement rather than do much else. Curiosity finally got the better of him as he began to unravel the bandage around his arm, exposing what only looked like minor scratches. It wasn't until he moved his fingers with his unharmed hand that he realized just why the bandage had been placed.<br>
<br>
All he could feel was grinding of the rough edges of bones, this had a somewhat sobering effect on Zenki's mind. He was now thankful his arm was numb, otherwise he would probably be screaming loud enough for a deaf man to even hear him. Still the idea of finding out where he was had taken over as he stood up and grasp the handle of the door.<br>
<br>
So far all he could tell was that he wasn't exactly considered a threat to everyone, mainly because the door was left unlocked. There was also the fact that the hallway outside was without a guard, at least he could rest at ease for awhile as he took time to observe the hallway. At first glance it was mostly barren, and had several doors, possibly to rooms much like the one he was at. Towards the end of the hallway was a window with a staircase both heading down and up, at the other end was a door.<br>
<br>
All in all things didn't seem that bad, of course he had no idea how many floors below was the ground floor, or for that matter how many upper floors there where. It was now time for him to try his old skills of deception once more as he began to blend in with the shadows. This way Zenki knew for sure he could have a chance at finding out just what all was happening.<br>
<br>
Zenki focused his hearing, and naturally moved down the hallway towards the door at the end, the source of some faint noise. Of course finding out what was going on inside was going to be tougher, he could definitely feel moist air from the edge of the door. Then the sound of footsteps beyond the door made him uneasy, as his luck would have it he managed to duck behind the door as several women exited. Least now he knew what the room was as he managed to slip past them all and just inside the door.<br>
<br>
Years of sneaking around for his Grandpa and doing little errands here and there had helped him learn the arts of steal much faster than most people. Zenki knew that staying out of the direct view of people was the best way to keep from being caught. Only one person had ever managed to actually give him any problems by seeing through his skills, and that was none other than Leona. The absolute worst thing was about to happen though as one of the women knocked on the door next to the room he was just in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Nadia, the bath area is open if you like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay! We'll be right there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure enough within a few minutes Zenki could hear footsteps coming down the hallway, from the sound as well as timing he could tell there was at least two people. The only chance he had was to hide in the most shadowed corner in the room and hope his abilities where still as sharp as they had been in the past. His mind soon became a blank as he seen another woman and Leona step into the room and close the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Nadia, why where you so interested in hearing about that jerk Zenki?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, you mean you've never heard the demon legend of Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't say that I have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it tells of a young man with crimson red hair and eyes of the blackest night. This demon as they called it was responsible for killing close to fifty or so trolls and ogres who attacked Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So why do they call a person like that a demon?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well this same person also broke Sir Williams arm with ease, which is the person who has been telling this legend. Earlier we came face to face with this person when he fought and killed a Reaper with just his bare hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Never before had the perfect opportunity for Zenki to make money had presented itself so easily, not only that, but was also learning some from the conversation. He though for certain the dirty old man that his grandpa was would have certainly paid out the nose for a chance to see this. He let his mind waver for a moment as he stared at the two women as they undressed, then slipped into the pool of water before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you wouldn't happen to know this persons name would you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He said his name was Ryo Kataoka, any idea's of who he is?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would guess that he's... Maybe he's Zenki's uncle, because earlier I met his aunt, she was very nice for a dark elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You must be talking about Rita, yes she is nice. I've seen her son a couple of times before with the local monks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He must stick out like a sore thumb amongst the other people of this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually he doesn't, the only real difference from him and us humans is his eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I bet he's nicer than Zenki is, all that jerk does is make rude comments about me.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was unbelievable, if it wasn't for him being injured, or for the fact that someone else was in the room Zenki would of given Leona a piece of his mind. It was one thing to outright insult him face to face, but it was a new matter all together to insult someone when they couldn't defend themselves. To make matters even worse, the numbness in his arm was starting to ebb, things definitely were not looking good for now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe he likes you and just doesn't want anyone to know? In the least you should at least try to be nice to him now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose your right, he was injured pretty badly, and he did manage to save me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenki began to weigh his options, either he could come straight out and cause a scene, or he could hope they would finish before the pain became to intense. The first of the two didn't seem possible at all, and the second wasn't looking hopeful. His only other choice it seemed was to try to make it to the door before Leona could find him like she did before.<br>
<br>
It was slow and painful as Zenki began to move from the corner, doing his best to keep his attention on staying out of their view. The pain was becoming agonizing now as he neared the door, beads of sweat where beginning to form on his forehead. Just as he neared the door he stopped, taking great care to observe Leona for the perfect time to slide open the door and leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;This kind of reminds me of how I met Zenki, he probably never knew what he did wrong to get caught.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He sounds pretty sneaky, so just how did you find him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He made the mistake of casting a shadow over the water, that was a dead give away.&quot;<br>
<br>
With hearing that he had a new plan to make sure he wouldn't be seen. All he would do was duck down, and hope that the light from the hallway couldn't be seen as he exited. This way he thought they would dismiss it as the door not being shut all the way to begin with. Of course to test this theory he would basically be hoping for the best.<br>
<br>
Zenki did his best possible given his injures as he crouched down and carefully opened the door. It didn't take long for him to move outside the room, giving him a chance to stand up behind the door. He now had time to finally relax somewhat, and in doing so made a dreadful mistake as he closed the door to quickly.<br>
<br>
This instantly tipped off Leona that something had happened to the door, she always had a sixth sense about people watching her. She moved from the water without saying a word and wrapped herself in a towel, she was going to teach who ever it was a lesson they would never forget. Much to her surprise when she threw open the door she seen no one. That didn't deter her though as she instinctively began to search for signs of movement.<br>
<br>
He couldn't believe his horrid luck, or for that matter his foolishness with the door. That didn't matter now, cause Zenki knew that if he was seen he would be in much worse trouble than he was before. Fate wasn't on his side as his injured arm twitched from the pain surging through it, causing a audible snapping sound as bone moved against bone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nadia your going to have to excuse the rudeness, but I think I just found a peeping tom.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona swung her open palm through the air where she heard the noise come from and struck home. The palm had landed perfect across one of Zenki's cheeks, which in turn caused him to fully appear before her. She couldn't believe he would do this again after the first time, and now it looks like she was going to have to teach him another lesson.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay that's it! So you want to spy on us you pervert?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Wait! It's not what it looks like honest!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to give you what you deserve!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! No! Wait!!! Let me explain!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nadia burst into laughter as she seen Leona drag Zenki off to his room, she didn't believe she would hurt him, but she just had to be certain. With that decided she began to dress as fast as she could. All this time the two could be heard shouting at each other in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Stop with the pulling!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up! It's not like its going to kill you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let go! It's to tight!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet! You'll disturb everyone else!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get off of me all ready!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you would stop squirming this would go faster!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you have any decency?!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then that Nadia had reached the room and opened the door. The scene before her made her face turn to deep crimson as she blushed. She had to admit though, Leona certainly was determined in what she was doing. Especially given the fact that even though her towel had come off she was still straddling Zenki, though she could understand why he had been complaining so much, anyone would given how roughly she had reapplied the bandages to his arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;See that wasn't so bad was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zenki, why do you have your eyes covered?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cause after the last time I seen her she tried to kill me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not that cruel, even I wouldn't hit you when your hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leona quickly grabbed her towel once again and covered herself. She knew after this she wouldn't have to hit him. Though she did feel bad about being so rough with him, as well as the fact she had been so cold to him in the past. Of course she knew with the way Zenki was now, he had probably considered this all to be some sick sort of torture.<br>
<br>
&quot;One question, just where the heck are we, and further more, what's her name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well your at the cleric's guild house in Freeport, and her name is Nadia.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been taking care of you since you got here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm lucky to be alive dealing with all this just now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You big baby! It couldn't have hurt that much!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually Leona, what you did was probably worse than any torture, I'm sure that he was in a lot of pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go to bed, and Zenki, don't you dare think of spying on us while we're asleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;After what just happened, I'd rather got to sleep than risk being attended to by you again.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that all said both Leona and Nadia returned to their room, leaving Zenki to wonder just what lay in store for him in the morning. He seriously doubted that anything else that could happen to him could compare to being taken care of by Leona. In his opinion anything else could of been better than what just happened. Sleep finally came though as he wondered, just what was going to take place in the morning...<br>
