So where should we start. <br>Well lets start with how different levels work within a group. <br><br>~If~ <br>The highest level member of a group cons the lowest level member and the result is grey and <br>they hunt mobs that con gray to the high level then no one gets any XP at all. The reason <br>is because greys never give any xp and the group xp given is based on the highest level group member. <br><br>~If~ <br>The highest level member of a group cons the lowest level member and the result is grey and They hunt mobs <br>that con yellow to the high level the low level gets XP but at a reduced rate. The xp that would have gone to <br>the low level is not given to anyone. This is anti twink code to prevent a level 1 from grouping with a level 30 <br>and the level 30 kills one yellow and the level 1 goes up 2 levels. The xp cap is a % based on the relative levels <br>of the two group members. If they are far enough apart no xp will be given to the low level at all.~~~ <br><br>So what does this mean. Well a simple way to look at it is Characters that are more than 5 levles either =/- of <br>the middle level Character can hunt together but any more and you are actually losing experience. <br>So say I am lvl 18. I would not want to hunt with people that are more then level 23 and really no less then <br>someone that is lvl 13. Now you have to take that into consideration of the group as a whole. <br>Just cause I fit into a group that the highest lvl is say lvl 21 a person that is lvl 13 being close enough <br>to me would get a reduced xp cause he does not fit it the level area of the level 21 character. <br><br>So what are some good group combos of level split ups. Well here are a few to look for.Here is ideal: 5-10; 6-11; <br>7-12; 8-13; 9-14; 10-15; 11-16; 12-17; 13-18; 14-19; 15-20; etc.... This is making it ideal for all levels to be <br>productive in a group. Yes you could expand more if you choose but you are optimising you xp growth and teamwork <br>capability more this way. <br><br>Ok now lets look at each class and what pros/cons they have in a group and some ideas on how each class works within <br>a group. <br><br>~Viking~ <br><br>Warrior- This class is the main tank. They have the best aggro management of any class. They will also have the most <br>hit points(HP), and normally armor factor(AF). When the get thier taunt attack they will use it almost every hit <br>while using thier protection(PRO) ability on the Healer/Shaman and should use guard(GUR) ability on the puller or <br>hardest hitting melee damager. The PRO ability lets the reduce the aggro from the caster and add it to themself. <br>The GUR ability allows them to block attacks directed at another member in melee range. With the use of Parry, Shield <br>and Evade they have 3 natural defense manuvers. They lack the total offensive output my make it up in defense <br><br>Thane- This class makes a classic puller for a group as they use no ammo for there ability. They can be used as the <br>main tank if there is no warrior around. The have a devastating first few seconds of attacks but will lack the full <br>defensive ability of a warrior and will not dealt the melee damage that a Berserker can. They can deal an awesome <br>amount of damage before the mob gets to the party. The should use thier PRO ability on a caster and use thier GUR <br>ability on the main Tank so that they may throw a block in(Only if using shield). <br><br>Berserker- By far one of the best damage dealers in a group. Where they lack in the defensive ability they make up <br>for it with pure raw power. They have some defense in the evade 3(EVD) at higher levels but lack in AF and pure <br>tank ability. Should use the best damage ability they have. This is you groups main damage person. <br><br>Skald- The Bard of Midgard. They have travel songs that let groups travel over land fast. They also have a damage <br>song which is a must when taking on larger mobs or multiple mobs. Can be used as a secondary fighter. They do not <br>make as good of tanks as the other 3 melee class characters. <br><br><br>~Seer~ <br><br>Healer- There are many different styles. You have some that will spec in Crowd Control(CC), or Mending(MND), or <br>Augmentation(AUG). A healer should always work MND for grouping as it is thier primary focus. CC is a great ability <br>as it allows you to take on multiple pulls. Every group should have one. AUG is good for buffing your group. <br>A good split is a group that has a healer Heavy in MND, and a decent CC and an ok AUG. <br><br>Shaman- Can be used as a secondary puller if you do not have one as they have a decent range on a bolt spell. <br>MND is another big thing from them as they are a secondary healer for a group behind a healer but also have REZ for <br>help in bringing back fallen teamates. <br><br>~Mystic~ <br><br>Runemaster- One of the best for a group in RvR. The have alot of different ways to spec. One of the best for RvR <br>is Rune Carving(RC). With the use of Odins Line of spell which is an area of effect(AE) spell can hit multiple targets. <br>They will be taken out quick in RvR by other realms if they get a chance. In Grouping for PvM they need to wait for <br>melee's to engage before attacking so they do not aggor the mob to them. <br><br>Spritmaster- A great caster that has Direct Damage(DD) bolts and can summon a spirt warrior(PET). With the ability <br>to add another member to your group that can be very important to be able to keep it on an enemy caster to keep them <br>from casting. and then be able to use the DD for attacks on top of that. They are also able to heal and buff their PET. <br>A very good addition in RvR and PvM with the crowd control. <br><br>~Rogue~ <br><br>Hunter- A very versitile class for Midgard. They have a few options to choose from. They make great pullers for a group <br>because of range .They have the abiltity to charm a PET that can be either and insect or an animal. They also get the <br>use of a bow. Bows with room can be deadly. In RvR they are used as scouts because they also have the Stealth ability. <br>A good RvR Hunter may look like a Heavy Bow/Spear and Stealth. A great PvM will be more Spear/Beastcraft/Bow. <br>Both are effective and helpful in a class. <br><br>Shadowblade- The class most know little about. They have the Stealth skill that when used in conjunction with other <br>skills is a deadly combo. Most do not know how to use them with a group. They are not the main line fighter. They <br>are purely a secondary attacker. Waiting for the Melee to engagebefore they strike with thier leathal combo's. <br>Once that tank engages the mob the Shadowblade will move in under stealth and use thier critical strike <br>(Can do anywhere up to 1/2 damage in one hit), followed up with a few other special attacks to really weaken a Mob. <br>They are very useful in a group and can actually speed up a group. In RvR they have the ability to really cause <br>havok to enemy mages with the use of those attacks and poison. There are high level poisons that can do up to 50 <br>damage a round. <br><br><br>Ok that is a small explantion of the different classess for Midgard. But how do you work them into a group. Well it <br>really depends on what you are fighting. Are you in RvR or PvM. Are you doing an ambush or a front line attack. <br><br>Here is a nice look at a balanced group for PvM: <br>Tank <br>Puller <br>Healer <br>Shaman <br>XXXX <br>XXXX <br>XXXX <br>XXXX <br><br>Then you fill in from there. The fill in spots can be a Shadow Blade for those high HP mobs. They can be a caster <br>for pure brute Damage. They can beanother healer/shaman. it is endless as each group will add alot to a group. <br><br><br>I hope this helps all those with ideas about there class and ways to group. <br><br><br>~Bael Silverflame~ &quot;<br><br>Thad <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ufyzkel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fyzkel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#DEB887>(10/20/01 2:22:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffriendorfoe58385frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/garrett0/Realm_logo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some good info if you want to learn about Midgard</span><hr size=1> Woot.... in black and white.
