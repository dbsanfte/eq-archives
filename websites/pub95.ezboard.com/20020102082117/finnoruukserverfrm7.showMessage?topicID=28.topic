Seeing nothing on the hillside around me I realised that it was not a physical threat but once again the dream born premonition, why is this dream of a bridge haunting me so, a bridge from where and to where? and why should it make me wake in a cold sweat?<br>
<br>
I don’t know but I fear that it must be a warning from my Lord Prexus. I must now pray for more guidance about the meaning of this dream. Failing this I believe I must return to my homeland to determine if the order has any advice or news.<br>
<br>
Having finished my morning prayers I felt it was time to take care of the material needs of my body as well as the spiritual, relighting my small fire that had gone out during the night I began to reheat some of the fish rolls that the lady cleric Masada had supplied me with on our last meeting.<br>
<br>
Sitting eating staring at my empty campsite I began to regret how rarely I got to see her and my other friends and comrades, sadly however my chosen path in life makes it difficult to hunt as I would have wished and this was yet another sadness I would merely have to accept.<br>
<br>
Having finished my meal I drew this journal from my pack and decided I ought to begin to review the immediate goals that I possess and the ways I can go about meeting them:<br>
<br>
Firstly I need to continue to practice my tailoring, knowing that my vision of one day being able to weave the fabled erudite steelsilk armour was a worthy one and that I had to practice much before I would be capable of this. <br>
<br>
Secondly I still desire to master more of the multitude of languages of Norrath, for how else can I travel the oceans as Prexus demands and teach the heathens the truth of his faith. I don’t believe as my brother does that we are the only true race worthy of venerating my Lord and hence I must do all I can to communicate with them. Already I speak almost fluent Elvish and Dwarvish and have a passing knowledge of both Barbarian, and thanks to the efforts of Saelven, Tier’Dal (although how receptive the majority of this dark race would be to the word I know not). <br>
<br>
Finally I wish to follow up leads and rumours I have heard about items that are worthy of one of Prexus’s faithful:<br>
<br>
I had heard a story from the leader of my Order Welligon Steelhearder about an item known as ‘The shield of the Stalwart Seas’ a true holy shield of Prexus which was stolen by someone called the Maestro of Rancour, who supposedly fled with it to one of the planes, sadly I don’t feel I am as yet experienced enough to be able to hunt for this traitor, maybe it would be possible to persuade one of my more talented comrades to attempt to exact revenge upon this murdering thief, as justice is justice irrespective of the sword that deals it. It is said that this shield provides great protection and a boost to the physical abilities of a follower of Prexus, combined with granting the user the ability to see through the depths with a magic enhancement to vision. <br>
<br>
I have also heard rumours of an earring made from the remains of a creature of the deep, that would when worn allow the bearer to breathe as a fish. Surely this must be a true relic of Prexus, blessed by him. The last known tales of this items whereabouts place it within the Queynos Hills in the possession of some Barbarian, not worthy even to touch it never mind wear it, something must be done to remove this item from him.<br>
<br>
The final thing was in discussion with Masada I have learnt of the ability of Clerics of Prexus to imbue black pearls with the power of my Lord, this makes truly incredible items for the faithful. I have already acquired a pair of rings imbued with such power and would like to obtain an imbued golden black pearl choker and to this end I must begin hunting for gems and a master jeweller capable of creating this, hmmm I wonder if my guild leader Malencia would be capable of this, I must consult with her about it. I also wonder if it would be possible to incorporate the power of one of these gems into the steelsilk armour I one day hope to be able to create… something to consider, now I merely need to find a good source of these pearls.<br>
<br>
Now it is time to close up my journal and return to the hunt, the only question remaining, where to go now, should I once again consider catching the ship and leaving the continent of Kunark, or should I stay here for a little longer? <br>
<br>
Well once again if this is my last journal entry I hope someone will find it intact and will either find it of use or return it to my order.<br>
