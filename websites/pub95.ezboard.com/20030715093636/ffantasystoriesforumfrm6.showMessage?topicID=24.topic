<br>
Every family has one member who seems to be different then the rest, a black sheep if you will. Most black sheep’s simply act strange or odd at times, but not in this family. This is a tale of a girl who is quiet different from her family, but for reasons she can not control... 'Her soul, though it seems pure, is a tainted one. Know of this and keep a close watch upon her, for she may destroy all we stand for...' ~Those words, they keep playing over in my mind. What do they mean? Tainted soul...destroy all we stand for? That is insane, I wish to protect all they stand for, and I want to be an example of what they stand for. What fools, I shall show them all, I shall become great, and they shall kneel before me one day instead of those alters...~ &quot;Malasu? Malasu are you listening to what I am saying?&quot; <br>
A young half-elven girl sits leaning her back against a tree. Her bronze armor glitters in the sun as she thinks of other things rather than listen to her trainer. &quot;No sir, I am sorry. My mind was wondering&quot;<br>
 &quot;Do not let it happen again...Now where was I? You are to set out into the Common lands and find a small band of orcs. Your orders are to slay them and bring me the belts they wear, do you understand? .... MALASU, PAY ATTENTION&quot;<br>
 &quot;What? Yes, yes, slay orcs, bring back belts...Can I leave now?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Yes, but be careful, you are cocky at times and underestimate the power of your opponents&quot;.<br>
 &quot;Sir, they are orcs, what power could they possibly hold?&quot;<br>
 &quot;If they held no power would I send you to train against them? No, now be off, and for the love of Mithanel be safe&quot; <br>
With a sigh Malasu stands up, salutes her instructor. Her bastard sword in hand, she sets off from the gates of Freeport towards the Command lands, and the begging of what may be her demise. <br>
An orc stood badly wounded and leaning against a hut, one large green hand holding his arm, which had nearly been sliced off. <br>
&quot;Ha, and he thought I would have trouble killing vermin like you&quot; Malasu raises her sword above her head, bringing it down hard the blade dug into the flesh of the orc, creating a large gash from his shoulder to his stomach. The beast fell with a thud, blood flowing from his lifeless body. Turning around in a circle, Malasu found no orcs left in the camp. <br>
&quot;That was not even worth the effort&quot;<br>
 &quot;Why are you here? Why have you slain my brothers Dark one?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Dark one? I thought you Oracles were supposed to be wise, not blind. I am Malasu, Paladin of Freeport&quot;<br>
 &quot;Paladin? HA! Yourr essance es anything but one of a Holy Knight. Shadow Knight, perhaps...but not Paladin...&quot;<br>
 &quot;Silence, you will fall like your kin!&quot; A green haze surrounds the Oracle, &quot;You are not going anywhere my dear&quot; the haze fades and roots grasp Malasu's feet, making it impossible to hit the orc.<br>
&quot;Now Child, stop with these games and tell me, what are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am a PALADIN, get it through your thick green head, PAL-A-DIN&quot; <br>
&quot;Hrm, then I must report this to my leader, farewell&quot; Grey fog encircles the Oracle, as it subsides the roots fall from Malasu's feet, and the orc is nowhere in site. <br>
&quot;If you think that will save you, you are wrong! I shall find you and kill you just the same!&quot; Mumbling, Malasu picks up the belts she needs and walks off quiet angry at the orc. <br>
<br>
&quot;Did you bring the belts?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Yes...&quot; <br>
&quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br>
 &quot;I am not evil, why does everyone insist that I am?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Where did you hear that?&quot;<br>
 &quot;An Oracle...&quot;<br>
&quot;An orc? Do not listen to what they say, they where merely trying to get your mercy&quot;.<br>
 Malasu nods, &quot;Well, I am off, I need rest&quot;. <br>
The instructor watches Malasu leave and then looks down at the blood stained belts. Rolling black clouds suddenly wash out the clear blue skies. Looking up at the sky, the instructor nods a bit just as the first few drops fall. &quot;So you see it too Karana? Mithanel shall use her for killing no more, she shall be trained and set out into the world&quot; A large lightening bolt struck in the distance, the thunder rolled and roared as if Karana himself knew what lied ahead and wanted in on it... <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~**~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sunrays shine out over a mountain in the distance, the light taking on a mysterious red glow. Standing there staring out at the scene is Malasu. Her soft feminine features take on a greater beauty from the sunset. Re-sheathing her bastard sword, her eyes wonder over the mountainside and fields, her deep brown eyes seem to smile at the sheer magnificence of nature. <br>
&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; A short dwarf with bulging muscles stands next to Malasu, a long sword in one hand and a walking stick in the other.<br>
&quot;Nothing Then, just looking out at the world&quot;<br>
&quot;The world? Malasu that's not the world, that's just the mountains&quot;<br>
&quot;It is nature, and nature is the world&quot;<br>
&quot;Whatever you say Mal. All this nature is really boring, lets go fight!&quot;<br>
&quot;Can you not even take a moment to appreciate what so many others take advantage of?&quot;<br>
&quot;What are you talking about? Oh yea, nature...It's great and all, I just don't like having to stare at it, it's not very exciting, so come on lets go fight, pleeease?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright, lets go&quot;<br>
&quot;YES!&quot;<br>
With a slight laugh Malasu and Then start off in a jog to the Northern Desert of Ro. <br>
&quot;Anyways Mal, what’s all the talk about nature for? Its kinda sudden to start notice things you never cared about before&quot;.<br>
&quot;It interested me before… just not as much as it does now&quot;.<br>
&quot;That’s odd&quot;<br>
&quot;I suppose.&quot;<br>
As the two ran through East Common lands it seems as if the trees sprout new leaves rapidly, and the flowers bloom brighter than they have in years. Malasu's aura turns a light green suddenly, and her dark brown eyes change to emerald.<br>
<br>
**********Later********<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;God it's late&quot;<br>
&quot;We did leave at twilight you know&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea I know, I just thought there would be some time to fight before we had to set up camp and all&quot;<br>
&quot;We shall fight all day tomorrow if you like&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea, I’d like that&quot;<br>
Malasu flashes a smile at Then before snuggling down into her sleeping pelts.<br>
Sitting by the fire Then asks, &quot;Hay Mal, you think maybe after we get done here in North Ro and we could go to the Karana's?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, I thought it best that we go to Lake of Ill Omen maybe, or High pass Hold, if we go to High pass Hold then we will pass through the Plains of Karana&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea ok, that sounds good&quot;<br>
&quot;There something there that you need?&quot;<br>
&quot;No I just gotta pick something up from a friend&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok. Well it is getting late, we should rest now, Goodnight Then&quot; <br>
&quot;Goodnight Mal...&quot; Then stares over the fire at Malasu who has already slipped into sleep ~There’s something odd about her - I can't explain it. But that doesn't matter, as long as she's mine that's all I care about. I just hope she wants to be mine....~<br>
