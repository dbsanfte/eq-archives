Chapter 5<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadows from the Past, part 2.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This weather was horrible, all the night life had practically dried up since the rain had started. Sure she seen people at the pubs and bars that normally would she would never see there. Of course this wasn't exactly a good thing since the guards also took shelter there as well. All this meant she couldn't get into her usual fights or arguments which was one of the things she really enjoyed.<br>
<br>
All the bartenders and waitresses knew her well, in fact they did just about anything to keep her from getting into a fight. After all, she had been kicked out of the monks guild, mainly because she slugged it out with her instructor which left him bedridden for close to a week. Still even with this kind of reputation most of the waitresses tended to appreciate it when she would stop by. Especially since she had a nasty habit of getting into fights with hecklers, and the occasional &quot;touchy feely&quot; type of men.<br>
<br>
This particular night she decided it was best to stay away from the pub her sister worked at as she made her way into a densely packed tavern. In truth the two seemed to be more or less opposites, and people couldn't believe the two where actually twins. Nevertheless, they knew who her family was and the kind of trouble they could cause if upset. To make matters worse was the fact that a tournament was going to be held soon, which was only proving to draw out the kinds of people she liked to fight.<br>
<br>
&quot;How you doing tonight Cara? Have a trouble?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been quiet lately Rina, no scum bags or anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cara had been one of her friends since they where children, which often meant Rina would come visit her while she was working at the tavern. In fact Cara was thankful for this, since on more than one occasion Rina had gotten rid of some of her less that favorable patrons. All in all this worked out fine for the barkeep, with Cara's friend coming around he didn't have to invest in nearly as many bouncers as his competitors.<br>
<br>
A quick survey of the room revealed nothing special for her, there were just the typical customers. With that she decided to take a seat at the only empty table in the place. All Rina was going to do was sit and wait for someone to do or say something wrong, then she'd have the fight she was looking for. Though she knew her great uncle would most likely end up dragging her home, but until then she was going to be searching for some excitement.<br>
<br>
<br>
The young man couldn't believe his luck, he wasn't able to find anything to do in this city since the raining had started. Sure he had been to a couple places and looked around, but nothing was of any interest here. Though he was grateful that his usual problems with any sort of trouble hadn't shown up yet. In fact where ever he went trouble tended to follow him so even as odd as it was, this break was more than appreciated.<br>
<br>
His luck began to change as he stepped into a tavern, and much to his surprise there was actually a place to sit. Though he thought it was quite odd that everyone took a glance back at him when he took a seat across from the tables sole occupant, then went about their business. Past experiences just told him to keep quiet and keep everything except his eyes hidden from prying eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rina couldn't believe someone actually had the gall to sit down at her table, though from the looks of it he seemed harmless. In fact to her he looked like a drifter with the way his cloak and other cloths appeared. As fate would have it her attention was drawn away as a fight broke out at a table in front of her. Now she had the perfect chance to get the fight she wanted, in which she sprang on instantly as she entered the fray.<br>
<br>
All manner of insults, cursing and the like could be heard from all the parties involved in the fight. Instantly the other patrons dove for cover, even the bartender and Cara took cover as tables and chairs began to take flight. The only person remaining at their seat was the drifter who had entered, in fact nothing that was launched his way had managed to hit him. For the most part the bartender and Cara thought he was nuts to stay in his seat.<br>
<br>
The young man simply thought of this as the usual trouble following him as he stood from his seat and turned to walk away. What he hadn't counted on was the fact that Rina was launched at him and he had no choice, but to catch her. With his luck though his hands landed on a part that no one even dared touch on Rina. In turn all the remaining people of the tavern could do where look on as they realized just what was about to happen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir you better run while you can!&quot;, Cara ducked back behind the bar, she knew all to well what could happen.<br>
<br>
In fact Cara had seen what happened when someone touched Rina in the wrong way, that was just what landed her instructor in the cleric's guild for treatment. This, she knew, was not going to be a pretty sight at all. Even the few guards that had been in the tavern had rushed out after having seen the scene before them. They had seen just what her great uncle was capable of and where certain that she could probably cause close to the same damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let go of me... You pervert!&quot;, Rina was definitely angry now, far more so than anyone had ever seen before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry! I didn't mean to...&quot;, all he could do was duck as he turned to punch him.<br>
<br>
Somehow he had managed to avoid her first attack, much to everyone's surprise, an before she could launch another he was already, rushing for the door. With that the chase was on as Rina followed in close pursuit. She was now determined to make him sorry he had ever seen her now as they rain down the rain soaked street. At this point all the guards had cleared out of the way, they definitely knew by the look in Rina's jade eyes that she was enraged beyond anything they had ever seen before.<br>
<br>
This seemed about usual, just as he would manage to relax, some sort of trouble would happen. Though this time it most definitely wasn't his fault. He was amazed at just how fast she was though, she had somehow managed to keep up with him through all this. It was now apparent he had probably angered one of the people who where going to enter the up coming tournament. Furthermore he couldn't use any of his abilities out in the open like this, otherwise he would have more than just this girl on his hands to deal with.<br>
<br>
Suddenly it dawned on him as he raced past an darkened tunnel, it was the perfect place to get away from her and he could use all his powers. The only down side it was the sewers, which didn't settle well with him at all. This was his only chance though to at least escape, so he took it, running head on into the darkness before him. He was counting on the fact that his night vision was far superior to hers, or so he thought.<br>
<br>
Rina absolutely hated the sewers, especially after she dealt with several unsavory Shadow Knight's before. Though that didn't deter her from following this young man at the moment, after all, if she didn't get him they probably would. She was puzzled though as she seen him navigate through the tunnels, it was clear he had excellent night vision, of course so did she.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't we just talk this out?!&quot;, he hoped that this would at least stop her for awhile.<br>
<br>
&quot;No we can't you damned Pervert! You shouldn't of grabbed them to begin with!&quot;, Rina watched as her prey disappeared from her sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do have a name, its Ash, and I'm not a pervert.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care what your name is! Your still a pervert!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rina's eyes searched the area for him, she simply couldn't understand what Ash was. She could tell by his appearance in the tavern he wasn't exactly a proficient user of magic. Not only that but he had been able to run so fast which was more evidence to show that she was dealing with more of a close combat fighter.<br>
<br>
Ash had always heard that redheads had foul tempers, and stubborn but this one was proving to be far worse than any stereotype he had heard. Most notable was she was visibly searching for him, which made moving for him that much worse. After all using an illusion like the one he was using now was difficult to say the least. He was going to have to make his move soon, or else she would definitely catch him.<br>
<br>
Rina turned around just as Ash leapt out of the shadows after her, there was a loud splash as the two of them landed in the water. She couldn't believe it not only had he managed to sneak up on her, but he now had her pinned down. Of course she wasn't going to stand for this one bit as she began to struggle to release herself. Which of course had very little effect on Ash's grip, he certainly wasn't going to let her go just yet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you just listen now? All that back there was an accident.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like hell it was! Your a pervert plain and simple!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If I was such a person I'd be trying to grab you right now rather than talk some sense into you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Take this you bastard!&quot;, with that she rammed a knee into Ash's groin.<br>
<br>
It had been a long time since anyone had really managed to hit him, and it took all he had just to back away from her. Ash simply couldn't believe she had done that, further more he couldn't believe he was able to stand either. He had now had enough to trying to talk to her as he looked for a quick escape away from the situation.<br>
<br>
In a split second he managed to avoid a flying kick from Rina, as well as scramble into through a opening in the grating of a nearby tunnel. If anything this would keep her at bay while he thought up a new plan on how to get out of all this. Usually when he needed to get out of trouble with women he could appeal to their vanity, in this case it was a definite bad idea. She didn't appear to be the money hungry type either, so that left bribery out as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait until I get my hands on you!&quot;, Rina did her best to try and reach through the metal grating at Ash.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now who sounds like a pervert?&quot;, he couldn't help but snicker at this scene before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Ash could do or say another thing he heard the straining of metal and the cracking of stone as Rina began to pull on the grate. She was doing something he thought was impossible for a woman to do as he seen her tear the grating free and throw it aside as if it where a piece of parchment. All he could do was try to avoid her attacks one after another. This was turning out more worse than he could of expected.<br>
<br>
<br>
There remained to be a few problems the both of them neglected, for one fighting in the sewers leaves no way for escape. Another is that more often then not your discovered by one of the many Shadow Knights that travel the passages, as well as the occasional undead that where associated with them. In this case the later applied as several of the aforementioned heard the fight and took it upon themselves to find out more.<br>
<br>
It was simple enough, or so the two Shadow Knights thought as the neared the fighting. They could simply send in some undead creatures to do their dirty work, then go in and do whatever they wanted. After all they weren't to proud to rob the armor off of corpses if it would further them along in their quests for power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go and kill, bath in their blood...&quot;, with that one of the shadow knight's pointed a hand towards the sounds of the fight.<br>
<br>
The reanimated corpses simply headed down the tunnel toward the where their master had sent them. Most of the undead where several homeless people who had drowned in the sewers due to the flooring from the last couple days of rain. The others where composed of several lesser ghouls, which although not smart, always presented problems to anyone they where ordered to attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was bad, Ash just knew it was from the feeling he got as he continued to avoid Rina's assault. When it came to sensing undead he could of been considered one of the best, mostly due to the blood that flowed through his veins. Most of the time it tended to be more of a curse, rather than an actual gift since it meant one of his family where coming for him. These he could tell where definitely not family, which distracted him just enough for Rina to slip in a quick punch to his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally I got ya! Now stay still so I can do it again!&quot;, she once again drew her fist back, ready to attack.<br>
<br>
She wouldn't have the chance to do it again though as several zombies pounced on her from the shadows. Now Rina was beginning to wonder if this Ash fellow was really worth all this trouble, even if he had grabbed her back in the tavern. She decided to put her revenge on hold as she sent the zombies flying to the walls one by one.<br>
<br>
It was simple enough to Ash to hide himself from the zombies, still it wasn't exactly fair of him to do such either. He was more than use to close quarters fighting, but he tried to avoid that at all costs. This time was different though, in this case it was more or less putting them out of a forced existence of misery and torment. He really didn't have any other choice as he batted a zombie away, sending it sprawling into the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;How about we settle this once we handle our friends here. Is that okay Miss?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Once I'm done with these your next, that's a promise! An the name is Rina, got that?&quot;<br>
<br>
This was enough of a distraction for one of the lesser ghouls to pounce from the shadows and tear the cloth covering Ash's face away. Now she was definitely puzzled, from what she seen he had no reason to hide his face, in fact if Cara would have seen it earlier she would have probably given him a free drink. It was then that strands of mana began to flow through the air as they collected into field around his body. Rina began to wonder, if he had this kind of talent then why hadn't he used it on her before.<br>
<br>
He had never intended to for her to see his face, after all if someone could see his face then they could also see else was trying to hide. That didn't matter now as he slid a several daggers from under his cloak and sent them flying into the several of the zombies, as well as the lesser ghoul that had attacked him. At that he held out his hands as the intensity of the mana surrounding his body began to build, he was now ready to end their torment.<br>
<br>
Rina heard shrieks come from behind her as she turned to see just what was going on. What she seen simply amazed her as streams of mana had stretched from Ash's hands and attached to the daggers firmly embedded in each undead surrounding him. As abruptly as the shrieks began they stopped as lifeless husks fell to the ground, their accursed and tormented souls once again at rest.<br>
<br>
Not to be outdone by Ash she took a stance, as she prepared to use one of the many techniques her great uncle had shown her. In fact he had said it was specifically created to deal with the very problem they where now faced with, which happened to be an unknown number of undead. Little did she realize that an unsuspected problem was about to arise from the mistake she was about to make.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soul Reactance!&quot;<br>
<br>
A massive force of white light erupted from her hands and spread through the ranks of undead around her. The howls of the tormented souls soon filled the air as body after body fell to the ground, the life it once held gone as its own soul was used to attack the next undead creature near it. Then the unexpected happened as the force converged on Ash, next to be followed by his screams of agony.<br>
<br>
This was totally surprising to Rina now as she watched, the brilliance of light as it swirled around Ash's form. She couldn't understand what she had done wrong, she had done everything correct, just as her great uncle had said. Then she found the reason why as she looked closer at his face, grim reality soon dawned on her as she realized the attack had done specifically what it was meant to do.<br>
<br>
The agony of hundreds and thousands of souls assaulted Ash's mind as he felt his very life being torn from his body. It was taking all his concentration and will just to keep his very existence intact as he struggled through the onslaught. In the back of his mind he was sensing something as it was approaching them. Something that was consumed in the darkness was heading towards them and he couldn't fight now.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was clearly disappointing for the Shadow Knights as the both of them neared where they heard the screaming. Their puppets had most likely failed them since neither could sense them anymore. Though neither where prepared for what they seen before their eyes as they reached their prey. They had never seen anything like it, the way the light was shifting around this persons form. Still they where intent on getting what they could as they came out of the darkness, weapons ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
She seen the two armored figures come forward from the darkness and couldn't do anything, she was frozen with fear. Rina was scared, because she had never intended to do this to another person. Her great uncle had always told her that she would know which people should not exist in this world, that she would be able to tell eventually.<br>
<br>
In his mind Ash thought he was surely done for, that is, until the two armor clad individuals past him and began to head straight for Rina. It was then that he had an idea about what to do, mainly of how to free himself, and how to get rid of these two in the process. He was certain that these two had commanded the undead that attacked them, which meant that the souls that where attacking him now held more hatred for these two than him.<br>
<br>
Rina finally seen Ash move, even though he was still being assaulted by the spirits that had been unleashed. Soon the white mass shifted from him to the two Shadow Knights as he reached out and touched them. The result was a blinding flash of white light that filled the sewers for a moment and then it was gone. The souls had sated their rage for not being allowed to pass on by devouring the very people who had forced them to exist past their time.<br>
<br>
<br>
The old man reminded himself that he would chew Rina's parents out for asking them to watch her. In truth it was like dealing with himself again sometimes. Still even for all that had happened he managed to find out where she had been, or at least signs of her handy work as he trudged through the sewers. All he did was spit on the ground as he kicked the two empty suits of armor that lay before him as he realized she was already on her way home.<br>
<br>
It was interesting to him, as he looked at round and noticed several pieces of cloth. She must of been into some kind of fight to cause all the destruction he seen here. It was obvious his lessons had benefited her, and that she showed signs of improvement since her last time with him. Though he still couldn't understand just what had been done to totally evaporate the two bodies that had occupied the armor. He knew she didn't have that kind of power yet, and doubted she would ever intentionally try to gain it either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rina didn't know why she was doing this, after all she wanted to smash his face in when she met him, and still wanted to. Of course she knew that neither her nor Ash could exactly fight after the incident that just happened. In a sense he had saved her, but even if he did, she was still going to get him back once they had rested some.<br>
<br>
&quot;This doesn't mean that we're friends, I'm just doing this so you can't get away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like more trouble for me in the future then....&quot;, Ash couldn't help but mumble hearing that.<br>
<br>
The two had managed to help each other stand as they made their way down the street like a couple of drunks. Ash smiled for a moment, least now she couldn't hit him, mainly because if she tried they'd both fall and probably be stuck on the ground for awhile. Little did he realize that she was keeping an eye on him as they made their way down the street, and his secret was now fully uncovered with his smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should have known you where a blood sucker.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I'm not, I'm only part blood sucker thank you very much.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wise guy too I see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well she was thankful that at least he had somewhat of a charming personality, and he wasn't all that bad as she thought back on it. He'd probably put up a better fight once they both got some rest, though she was unsure of what her sister would say for bringing him home with her. Sure her sister was kind, but she had never brought home anyone of the opposite sex before, which tended to raise some rumors. Though she made sure to stifle them at the source, which lead to some of her many fights she had been in.<br>
<br>
She quickly brought her thoughts to the present as she pushed open the door to her house, only to see something she hadn't expected. A quick inspection showed some recent wet footprints, and the sight of wet cloths outside her sisters room was something surprising. Rina looked at the cloths for a minute, then to the cloths on Ash and realized they both had the same style.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like we have another guest here, wonder who it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As if my luck couldn't get any worse...&quot;<br>
<br>
This was all he needed, he recognized the shirt that lay on the floor easily, it was his brother's. Though he wasn't exactly sure he should tell Rina, who knows what would happen if she got mad now. Ash's plans on keeping Rina in the quiet about who was here though.<br>
