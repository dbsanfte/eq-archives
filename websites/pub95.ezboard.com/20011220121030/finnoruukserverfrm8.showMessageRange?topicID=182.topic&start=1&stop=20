<br>
Doofus01 tells you, &quot;Can u sow me plz&quot;<br>

<br>
Then it graduates to:<br>
<br>
Doofus02 tells you, &quot;Can u sow me plz&quot;<br>
<br>
/target doofus02<br>
You see no one by that name.<br>
<br>
/tell Doofus02 I don't see you.<br>
(pause pause pause)<br>
Doofus02 tells you, &quot;Whr r u ill cum 2 u&quot;<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Next in line, same situation, but instead:<br>
<br>
Doofus02 tells you, &quot;I'm at stupidcamp04, which is on the other side of the zone, pls sow me.&quot;<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Well, last night I got a new one.  I was running 3 chars through Skyfire to BWs.  One of the screens on auto-follow got the messages:<br>
<br>
Doofus03 tells you, &quot;wait&quot;<br>
Doofus03 tells you, &quot;can u c2 2 people&quot;<br>
Loading, please wait.<br>
<br>
I saw the messages just before zoning but too late to stop.  I probably wouldn't have backtracked anyway, I was running to help on an epic encounter and wasn't early.<br>
<br>
/tell doofus03 sorry was on auto-follow didn't see your messages until I zoned.<br>
<br>
Doofus03 tells you, &quot;lol&quot;<br>
Doofus03 tells you, &quot;can you zone back and c2 us?&quot;<br>
<br>
/tell doofus03 You've got to be kidding.<br>
<br>
He wasn't kidding.<br>
<br>
I always thought that when I was asking a favor, it was my responsibility to do whatever I could to minimize the impact on the person I was asking.<br>
<br>
In other words, his proper response (if he's going to buff beg in the first place) was:<br>
<br>
Doofus03 tells you, &quot;Are you staying near zone?  I'd like to zone over for c2.&quot;<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Ever notice that the worst buff beggers are the ones who don't play buffing classes?  When a chanter asks me for sow, he ALWAYS offers clarity.  Similarly druids asking for clarity ALWAYS offer sow, and I often see them running around sowing everyone else in sight, too.  Clerics just get jboots and never ask for either, unless it's obviously no imposition at all.<br>
<br>
Wizards used to be bad, then they became better porters than druids.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
This is a pretty lame rant.  It was just one of those head-shaking moments.  &quot;You want me to zone an extra two times to do a favor for you, when it works equally well for you to zone an extra two times to receive said favor?&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess it's like those people who ask for a ride, but don't know where they need to go, aren't ready when they ask, and aren't near either me or a druid ring.<br>
<br>
Get a clue.<br>

I used to think sow requests were enough.<br>

Now folks are really spoiled and want &quot;hp buffs, speed and regen plz&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm usually pretty easy going about that, but it is amazing what some folks expect.  40 mana is one thing, 1000 mana is another, not to mention memming a different batch of spells.<br>

You don't gain xp by using all your manna to buff everyone else. So I stopped with random buffing and the tells turned into &quot;heal plz&quot;. Which I don't mind much. I have a couple other characters and now how much it sucks to have to wait for your health to go up by sitting. But, when I'm in a group, we are pulling constantly and my manna is needed by the group, d00d is going to have to wait until I have manna to spare. This seems to be a difficult concept for some d00ds. Have had many a d00d mad at me because I won't run all the way across a zone to heal them when they can do what I spend most of my time doing (sittin on my blue cheeks) and get the same effect. I am usually one of the first people to offer help when I'm not already busy. But when I am busy, d00ds need to learn to use the same respect I do when I'm asking a favor of a total stranger....1. BE IN THE SAME ZONE ( I have bad setup on my puter and it takes me about 5 minutes to zone)....2. ask nicely, sucking up a bit helps the manna generate faster. 3. offer to find the person you are asking the favor from so they don't have to spend more time trying to find the d00d's sorry lost arse in the middle of the zone with a ungodly hellish MOB chasing them while they scream at you to heal them. This last scenario will almost guarantee I will be OOM by the time I find you. 4. offer a donation. most likely it will be refused, but offer anyway. Makes for good carma in the long run ).<br>
<br>
Oh and that no xp revive that you so desperately need because you are bound 15 zones from where you died? If I have to find your body first to rez you, d00d, most likely i'm in a group and my manna is needed by my group. HAVE A FRIEND DRAG YOUR BODY TO THE CLERIC!<br>

<br>
Buffing:<br>
I don't mind being asked for an occasional sow, regen, sln, what have you, every now and again, but if you want it, you come to me.  No, I'm not going to run all around the zone looking for you (I hate that, esp when they're running around too), I'll tell you where I am, and you come to me.  If you take too long getting to me and I have better things to do with my time, or you go LD or get eatten by rabid kobalds or whatnot, don't complain to me if I don't wait half an hour for you.  Also, don't ask me to DS you every five minutes... I realize that buff doesn't last that long, but I wont sit and hold your hand (and in a sense PL you) just to refresh your DS every couple of minutes.  <br>
<br>
Porting:<br>
First and foremost, if you see me sitting naked outside the Seb orb (where I am bound atm), do not ask me for a port.  Most likely, the group or raid I was in is on a CR, and if I miss a rezz while I'm zoning, well, that's not going to make me very happy.  Other than that the rules for buffing apply here as well: You come to me if you want a port... that means, don't ask me to port you from another zone.  This has happened more than once, and I only did it once because I was in a particularly good mood, but when I went to pick up the guy, he was inspecting me (I don't have a problem with it, and I have the message turned off) but was asking if I had anything for sale.  I'm thinking, &quot;Okay, I come all the way out here to port you and you want to buy the armor off my back!?&quot;  And another time I was sitting in LS and someone sends me a tell asking for a port.  I stood up, looked around and didn't see anyone.  Out of habit, I did a /who all soandso.  The guy was /role or /anon, so I did /who soandso... nope, didn't turn up in the zone.  So I asked him where he was, and he said he was in WC... hmmmmmmmmmm, well then find a druid/wizzy in WC to give you a port.  <br>
<br>
*shakes her head*  <br>
<br>
And on top of everything else, yes, offer a donation, or AT LEAST, say thank you.  Not only the porting/buffing druids and rezzing clerics appreciate thanks and donations, but also the shammies who buff, the necros/sk who locate/summon your carcass (and necros can rezz), the pallies who rezz, the warriors who can taunt a mob off you to save your life, the monk and rogue who can deal out the last damage and kill what's about to kill you, the chanters who clarity/gom/insight et cetera, the bard who is the jack of all trades, the mage who is the walking Wal-Mart and summons you everything from bandaids to mod rods, the ranger who will track a mob for you, and the wizzies who port too, all appreciate it when you thank them (I hope I didn't forget anyone).  To the newbies/lowbies/pre-40's... when you are older you will understand why we rant about this, and perhaps you will then have a greater appreciation for our services.  Until then, take our advice and don't piss anyone off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31224"><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/grrl/ithis/cass_signature.gif" border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 624<br> <font color=#778899>(11/28/01 12:01:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buff Beggers: A new twist</span><hr size=1> I like Tabbran's solution -- summon some throwing daggers.<br>

Well, this person was an L5 in all Bronze or better.  So I ask him how he got his gear.  He got it all through begging.  Then he EXPECTED people to give him money for better weapons because people gave him all of his gear.  Just makes me sick.<br>
<br>
I remember someone sending one of my bank mules (L1) a tell asking for gear.  I told the guy I'm L1, shouldn't he be giving me gear?<br>
<br>
I can understand wanting SoW (though I will offer you a few PP if I don't know you), and I will come to you in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't really believe in giving random people heals unless they are about to die because, well, if they wanted a healer maybe they should GROUP with one.  I give away tons of gear.  But I don't give jack to beggars except advice.  To people that are trying, they've benefitted greatly heh.  But never to beggars.<br>
<br>
One of my other pet peeves is people who can't just say thanks.  If I'm running my Shammie through Nek Forest and I stop and give you all the buffs a L26 Shammie has to offer, it is REALLY REALLY bad form to then beg for me to give you cash, gear, or stay and PL you.  If I had spare gear on me I wanted to give you, I would ask if I could inspect you, and then give you what I wanted to.  Otherwise all you're going to do is annoy me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uctuttle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ctuttle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#778899>(11/28/01 12:41:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://crackhouse.subculture.net/pics/grim.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buff Beggers: A new twist</span><hr size=1> Ohhhhh thats a good one Tabbran!

If you spend any time around the WC druid ring, for example, there's almost always someone pulling things that are bigger than they can kill, getting it down more than half, then running to the ring for help.  It's usually a bear.  My favorite response?  keep charm animal memmed at that ring...  nice bear. =)<br>
<br>
I am almost never anon, and the other thing that burns me is people who ask you for a sow, or a cleric buff, or whatever without even doing a /who on you.  My druid once got asked for cleric buffs...that was interesting =)  especially since my cleric is usually the one being asked for sow.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents' worth... =)<br>

I zone into WW and haul butt. About 30 seconds later I get a tell from Gamiene(sp) saying something like &quot;I guess people in your guild are too important to reciprocate&quot;<br>

Having no idea what on earth she was talking about I replied, 'pardon?&quot;<br>

She proceeds to tell me that she sowed me when I zoned out and how rude I was because I failed to notice the difference in run speed (I had jboots), and didnt psychically know that I was supposed to c2 her in return for the buff I didnt even know she had hit me with.<br>

I just remembered something else that made me crack up... I was in a group in Seb and all of a sudden, I get a random tell asking if I could come to Unrest and PL a level 10 warrior.  I think about it for a moment, I look at my exp, and then weigh the pros and cons of going to PL some stranger or staying and getting exp... hmmmmm, hard decision.  Anyhow, I reply back to him with, &quot;How did you get my name?&quot; and he said, &quot;I did /who all cleric&quot; and I said: &quot;I'm not a cleric, I'm a druid&quot; and then he said, &quot;Oh, I must have done /who all druid then, I did them both.&quot;  Then I go on to explain that I am in a place called Sebilis... it's a high level zone where the big kids like to hang out and kill froggies... and I was quite busy at the moment, so I couldn't come out there and PL him.  I think he understood... he didn't push the issue too much, but it's still funny, in my opinion.  <br>
<br>
And on another note, to everyone who just asks the highest non-/anon druid/wizzy in the zone for a port: druids and wizzies can start porting others at lvl 29 (I think that's the same for wizzies)... and I'm sure a level 29 druid/wizzy would be much more excited to port you around (esp if you donate) than a 50+ who's been there done that and is pondering going /role again.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I ignore them.  Some people are actually persistent and keep /telling until you give them a response.<br>
<br>
I PL my own characters and in small increments, those of my good friends.  If I happen to be auctioning in EC, I will give buffs to anyone who looks like they are fighting up until they ASK for buffs.  Then forget it.<br>
<br>
The greedy ones really annoy me.  You know, the ones who if you give them SOW, they immediately turn around and ask for everything else.<br>
<br>
The thing is, the people who are buff begging aren't the ones who are reading these boards.  So unfortunately, offering advice in this forum won't help the situation.<br>
