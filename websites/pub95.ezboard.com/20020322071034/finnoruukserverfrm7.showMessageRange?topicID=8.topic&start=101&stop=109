<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Laurelai began to relate her tale of Galadrid and the ship Siren's Bane.  Her initial intent was just to relay the bare bones of the story.  But the combination of strong drink and a bardly nature soon betrayed her, and she began to spin the tale in earnest.  She would pause to take a sip or two, and sometimes she would wipe a small tear from her eye.  She would laugh at a remembered incident and sometimes she would let the cleric in on what she was laughing about- and sometimes she kept it to herself.

&quot;Hello hello!  Come in- there is still a little food left.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She led the two into her cottage, carefully stepping over a dwarf that was sprawled on the floor, carefully skirting a sleeping dark elf curled up in a cushy chair, and quietly passing the monk who was now in subdued conversation with two druid women</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Laurelai dug quietly though the plates she had left, and actually found two clean sets of utensils amongst the recently dirty plates, cups and bowls.  She filled the plates with a hearty serving each of rabbit stew, some vegetable pie, and rooted around to find some marinated muskie fish filets still warm. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I think I still have some fruit pie left too.  Please sit down- um- if you can find a place that isn't already occupied by a passed out guest- and eat&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  She then went and found and old boot that she had made Boot Beer in.  She made it purely because she had found a recipe that required an old boot, but she never drank it, having a hard time getting past the smell of the old leather boot. &quot;Well, I think Paghk would actually appreciate this!&quot;  she thought to herself.  Then she found a clean wine glass (no small feat) and poured a glass full to the brim of cloudy, sweet smelling honey mead.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You gentlemen make yourselves at home.  If you can find more food, you are welcome to it.  If you need more drink, there is plenty.  If you wish to sleep it off, please feel free to make yourselves as comfortable as you are able... just be careful and don't step on the dwarf eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The bard smiled a tired smile and didn't even attempt to stifle a huge yawn</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Please forgive me for being a poor hostess, but this has been a very long day... and an even longer night!  But you are still my guests, and are welcome here.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Laurelai turned to the rest of the revelers (who had appeared for the most part to have reveled themselves out- particularly one dwarven paladin) a smiled again</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

&quot;Good night all- I'll clean up in the morning.  If you wish to help, I would appreciate it, but if you need to leave, please don't feel badly about doing so.  I for one need some rest!  Confound it, I think I'm getting too old for all this.  Oh- if someone new comes by, show 'em to the food ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Laurelai turned to go to her room, but stopped to wave goodnight to the rest who were still awake.  She blew out the lamp.  She made her way to her bed in the darkness but stopped as she saw the soft pearly glow that eminated from the gem now sitting on her shelf.  She got up and walked over to the shelf, gently scooping up the gem in her hands.  The bard looked into the facets, and smiled as she listened and kissed the sphere.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

&quot;Since she was so gracious to open her home to us, the least we can do is help make it back the way it was, yes?&quot; she raised a delicate eyebrow that brooked no arguement.  Lenore handed a few sacks to the &quot;volunteers&quot; and they set about to picking up the litter.  Dishes were stacked in a sink, and were being washed by two people she assigned.  Others picked up paper, bottles, and spilled food, placing it in the bags.  Lenore set about to sweeping dried food remnants out the door, and placing furniture in its proper places.  After an hour, the place was clean again.  She asked a wizard to kindly remove the trash and in a slight gesture, the trash vanished.  Lenore smiled.  Wizards were good for trash removal.  She only didn't want to know where it went.<br>
Feeling a little tired herself, she thanked her &quot;volunteers&quot;, and bid them goodnight, and went outside to sleep under the stars, as outdoors was where she was most happiest.  She listened as the others said their goodnights and watched as the lights dimmed and all was quiet. <p>Lenore Bravehard

<br>
It had been quite a nite as he had wandered by almost tripping over a dark elf as it stumbled through the forest. His first instinct had been to kill this one, but he felt the dark power coming  from it....A ShadowKnight. Cazic would not allow him to kill this one...yet.<br>
<br>
Luckily he had stayed cloaked in shadows as he traveled. Since he had left Norrath to explore the land of the soft skins he had learned much. One such lesson had come painfully as he had approached a city to find the guards did not care for Iksars and attacked him on sight. <br>
<br>
Looking in the direction that the dark elf had come from Groldar had watched warily, then smelling baked breads and cakes...and ahhhhhh alchohol. He started walking in that direction finally seeing where it was coming from. From the sound of things...the party was winding down. Checking the path, he saw the tracks of many that had come and gone.<br>
Making sure that he was still cloaked in shadows and making sure that he was not seen, he watched silently as the softskins played with what appeared to be a bear. Elves, a dwarf, a gnome seated at a barstool that was larger than it was...Some were helping what appeared to be the keeper of this place to clean.<br>
 Looking from person to person Groldar had made up his mind to enter when one of them jumped up swinging his sword around wildly and exclaimed  &quot;Ill slay ye all and let Innoruuk sort you out!&quot; <br>
Gahhhh, Paladins! Curse them........Reaching for his &quot;Noc&quot; blade...he almost lost control and stepped into battle. He went as far as to pull the blade across his forearm..separating the scales and releasing the blood within. <br>
<br>
The patrons were all silent as they looked at the Paladin who, looking embarrased, sat back down saying  &quot;Oh, heh..heh..ermm&quot; <br>
<br>
Groldar whispered,  &quot;Come death...let us win this day&quot; he brought the tip of the sword up and touched himself on the forehead with the blade, Groldar tensed to break the door...Suddenly, inexplicably,  the voice of reason somehow reached through the hate and stopped him. &quot;Not today....there will be another time, another place...there are too many&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hungry as he was...as enticed by the smell of alchohol and a warm place to dry his scales.....he could not step inside. Groldar could already feel the hate welling from Cazic...pushing him to eradicate these do-gooders....even a Reaver such as himself could not hope to win against the odds that lay within.....Quickly....he noted that the keeper of this place, a female songmistress and what appeared to be her sister,  somehow were able to see him and they warily watched from within.....One of them moved as if to come to him, whether to do battle or to just speak, he couldnt tell.<br>
Unsure of how they had seen him and before they could arouse those within....Groldar said words known only to those of the dark arts and stepped through the shadows to appear many  paces from the dwelling....then he warily wandered off to make camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukinanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinanar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/10/02 5:48:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.furry.org.au/BornWild/ubb/avatar/Chrono_Trigger_-_Crono.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New digs</span><hr size=1> As Kinanar was falling asleep another sharp twinge entered his mind. &quot;How many beings born of Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule dwell in this area..?&quot; he mumbled to himself.

He would give the Dark Elves one thing, they have enough intelligence not to ruin a party such as this, but however an Iksar would rush in at the mere thought of tasting the flesh of a Paladin such as himself. He would need to get rid of this new threat before morning..he would not see any of these guests harmed, even the necromancer.<br>
