He almost had an appetizer, but he wasn't much one for steroid junkies, so he just broke the would-be-pickpocket's neck and kept on walking. He wasn't really in the mood to become a preist from Isglanbistan again; they always fell for that. Besides, the Cathedral here wasn't even open this late, except for confessions. Time to see what sick perversions the people of the night had come to relieve themselves from.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Father Johnson wiped the sweat off his wrinkled, weather-worn brow. His belly was round, and his arms were as weak as a girl's, but that was okay for a man of faith;<br>
<br>
He could find pleasure other ways.<br>
<br>
The three previous men who had come to him had given him quite an appetite for the lusty gossip. He recalled his earlier days as a youth minister with feigned horror, and quickly made a cross to alleviate his guilt. After all, they'd done it willingly...<br>
<br>
The next one to step in was a lovely lady, by the looks of it. She had a hood up, but her figure was shapely enough. He already had his hand up his robes from the recounts of that last man with the two strippers, and now one who looked to be a stripper; mercy! Father Johnson's luck was nearly too good to be true!<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,&quot; she began. Her voice was silky and smooth, so sexy... he was already liking this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speak, child, for the Lord forgives all,&quot; Came his reply. But he didn't want to talk. He wanted to hear *her* talk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it was three days ago, since my last confession...&quot; She licked her cherry red lips as just a little bit of light shed on her face, just enough to see up to her nose. &quot;Okay. I was really drunk, right? And there were these two other girls, right? Well, like... so we got back to my place, and I offered them a place to stay, ya know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Father Johnson's hand was moving a bit faster now. He nodded, &quot;Go on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... things kind of got out of hand. We were all joking around, drinking more champagne that we brought home from the party. It was Billy's promotion, and we-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes yes, I understand. What was your sin, young one?&quot;<br>
<br>
She tilted her head to the side, &quot;Heehee. Oh yea. Well, um... we were all kind of... umm...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Horny? It's okay, I've heard the word before.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled again. &quot;Yes. We were horny. Very, very horny. I told them all to wait in the living room, while I slipped into something more comfortable. Well, I was naked and putting on my robe, when Kristie- she's a red head- started to open my door, and I let the robe slip down like I hadn't put it on yet...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mmhmm. Go on.&quot; His robes were rustling now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, she snuck up behind me, and grabbed my... grabbed... she grabbed...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Grabbed? Grabbed what?&quot; his robes were rustling back and forth over his hand.<br>
<br>
The form before Father Johnson changed abruptly. The hood was gone, and only the pale skin of a man with white teeth and white hair remained. His black suit contrasted his skin, making him seem all that much paler. &quot;Grabbed your neck!&quot; Crawf growled as he punched through the speaking window. His hand caught the priest by the neck, and he pulled the fat man's head through the window without him making a sound, as his long nails had pierced his windpipe. Father Johnson still thrashed.<br>
<br>
With a quick neck bite, Crawf was slightly sated. Blood dripped down his chin, and he was quick to dabble it up with a napkin in his breastpocket. Time to play priest... At least this time, he didn't have to stand in front of the congregation. Crawf smiled; maybe he'd go out for Itialian. Bad aftertaste, but the adrenaline thrill of knocking off a member of one Itialian family... well... let's just say it made for *interesting times*. Head awash with possibilities, Crawf sat back in the confessional booth. Had to think... Just as Crawf was starting to clear his head, a voice came, &quot;Father Johnson? Father Johnson, are you still in there?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 7:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Holy Unholy (Cont, 3)</span><hr size=1> ~sigh~ i wish i was itallian... ~looks off dreamily~<br>
