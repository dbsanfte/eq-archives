la~<br>
<br>
<br>
First Ring: Get tailoring up to like 80+ or get someone with 80+ skill and make a blanket out of 2 HQ tundra kodiak pelts(from EW) and 2 HQ cougar pelts. turn it in to Garadain Glacierbane for 1st ring<br>
<br>
Second Ring: Say the word Assistance to garadain and he'll give you an axe to give to his nephew( I think) Boradain Glacierbane which makes him walk to the giant fort( must keep him alive, IE kill whatever attacks him, he doesnt have a lot of HP), then to the ruins where giants, orcs, and walruses are, then to orc fort, then back to where he spawns, at which then spawns a Rabid Tundra Kodiak which you kill and hand what he drops to boradain, take what boradain gives you back to garadain with the 1st ring for 2nd ring<br>
<br>
Third Ring: get blacksmithing up to about 70 or find someone with 70+ skill and have them combine a wooly rhino tusk, HQ walrus pelt, and a skinning rock(found on floor in EW, no drop), to make a Coldain Hunting Knife. Hand that in to garadain with 2nd ring for 3rd ring.<br>
<br>
Fourth Ring: find Tain Hammerfrost,(straight out from bridge in EW) and say help to him, Be sure to have a sufficient force to fight the 4 giants that spawn and rush to you, all blue at 60 i think, and 1 named, Strategy: have a druid or wizard or anyone who can snare, immediately target and snare the namer, this should agro all the other giants on to the snarer as well, have your force(like 1 tank, 1cleric, and 1 or 2 melees should be sufficient) take out the name(Ghuzak Squatnot or something) and give what he drops to Tain hammerfrost, for a Coldain Smithing Hammer, hand that hammer in to Garadain with the 3rd ring for 4th ring.<br>
<br>
Fifth Ring: Roam EW with a tracker until you find ry'gorr messenger, kill him and take what he drops to the Coldain Lookout at garadain's camp to spawn 5 orcs, one of which is named, ****** Scarbrow, use same technique from 4th ring fight here, unless you have an enchanter, who can mez the orcs rather capably, hand in Scarbrow's head with 4th ring to garadain for 5th ring. NOTE: Occasionally, scarbrow drops a 3int 3wis 40mana range slot.<br>
<br>
Sixth Ring: First, see to it that the ry'gorr messenger that you had to kill for 5th ring, stays alive long enough to path to the tower outside of orc fort. There it spawns Ry'gorr Emissary, who in turn spawns Rodrick Tardok, a moderately but not too hard dwarf(no faction hit involved), kill him, loot his head and his dagger(the effect blows, it stuns user for 12 secs, so dont use it), keep the dagger for later, its for 9th ring, the head however is needed for the 6th ring. once you've got rodrick's head, find the coldain ghost(cant remember name, it spawns next to a named wolf, god, what is wrong with me, i cant remember these names to save my life)anyway, you hand your 5th ring in to the ghost(who only spawns at night)and she gives it back and tells you to follow the wolf, do just that, making sure that the wolf stays alive long enough to make it to the orc camp near the bridge, at which point about 6 high level orcs spawn, including a namer, Poxbreath Yellowfang, use the same technique from 4th and 5th fight here, kill the namer, and give what he drops, rodrick tardok's head, and 5th ring, to garadain for 6th ring.<br>
<br>
Seventh Ring: This one is a bit tricky, but if you know what you're doing, 2 people can do this easily. Ok, first you need to find the ruins that Boradain from 2nd ring walked to that were filled with orcs, giants, walruses, and ulthorks. In one of the &quot;houses&quot; there is a lone giant, either Warden Bruke, or A frost giant prison guard, the namer is who you want, the other is the PH for namer. When you pull warden Bruke, 4 blue giants spawn, but, these can be avoided by pulling him from the side of the house with say, an arrow or a spell. Kill him, loot his key, and he drops some ass of a 2hb weapon. now then, go to the most populated &quot;house&quot;, which is guarded by 2 kromriff prison guards, and some orcs are inside, Kill everything, and hand the dwarf in there the key from the warden, and your 6th ring(which he promptly gives back), then he starts to walk off, follow him. After he gets over and out of the valley(i guess you could call it that) he walks for a bit then says something to the effect of: OH NO HERE THEY COME~! and 3 giants spawn about 400 feet in front of him, and 2 orcs spawn about 400 feet to the left of him and both parties start to run at him. What you're going to do here, is have anyone that can root or mez hit him and run to the right of the direction he's facing when he says the phrase that triggers the giants and orcs. once a sufficient distance away, have the person root or mez him, then recamp. After root or mez wears off, he'll path to the place he needs to go, say something, and spawn Dobbin Crossaxe, who you turn in your 6th ring to, he gives you a letter to garadain, hand this letter to garadain for the 7th ring.<br>
<br>
Eighth Ring: This is the kicker, hard as hell, but its where its all worth it. Get about 12 50+ people together, and you must have ONE level 60 if you wanna win and not lose everything you've worked for. If you're lucky, the named spawn Gloradin Coldheart will be up at Garadain's camp, if not, well, you gotta wait,and she's a 24 hour respawn, and god knows when she was last used. What you wanna do is, move all your people into the orc fort, and move them to the right a good bit after you enter it, have them stay there. Shout to the zone that you'll be doing the 8th war and to stay clear away from the orc fort for the next 30 mins or so. Hand your 7th ring into Garadain, who gives you the battle plans for the dwarven invasion of the orc fort. Hand these plans to Gloradin Coldheart. This triggers the war sequence, everything is on the line now. Once you trigger the war, rush as fast as you can back to the orc fort and join your force. Soon, the orc fort will respawn with about 30 50+ orcs and giants outside, and about 6 or 7 50+ inside, the namers are inside. Strategy: Have your level 60 target any of the things that spawned near the entrance INSIDE the orc fort, and pull it, pull and kill everything, you'll have more than enough time with 12+ people to get everything killed, the Chief that spawns with them drops the item needed for 8th ring, and some decent spear, and the namers drop some half way decent lewt, once everything in that little group is cleared(1 oracle, Firbrand the Black, 2 Kromriff Commanders, Chief Ry'gorr, and a elite i think), you have 2 Options. A: Get invis and run out to the hill in front of orc fort, and find the garadain that spawned for the war( NOT THE ONE AT GARADAIN CAMP, I REPEAT, NOT THE GARADAIN AT GARADAIN CAMP, THERE ARE 2) and wait for him to say the phrase that iniates the coldain charge against the enemy forces, and as he charges, hand in Chief Rygorr's head, that will net you the 8th ring, option B: Wait inside until the coldain charge begins and let Garadain rush into the orc fort and then hand in the head, either way is pretty risky, and if you fuq this up, there is no /petition, you're screwed out of all the work you've done. SO BE CAREFUL.<br>
<br>
End Result of 1 - 8: Velium Coldain Insignia Ring: 8ac 8str 8mr Effect: Shield of the Eighth which adds 8pt DS to you, spam clicks, infinite charges, self only, doesnt stack with Call of Earth or Shaman Potion DS. <br>
<br>
As for 9th and 10th, I forgot about those as I havent done them yet heh. I know the 1 - 8 by heart because i've done each at least 10x.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S: I hope you have more luck than I had with the 8th war, I had to do my 8th war 3 times before I got my ring. First fuqed up because Garadain agroed the whole fort on himself because he decided to stop and attack a greenie orc at the entrance, Second Fuqed up because Balrizangor, even after i warned the zone sufficiently, aggroed garadain and killed him. Thx Balrizangwhore.<br>
