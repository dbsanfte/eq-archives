The air was cold and humid, the way he was used to. Fallen branches lay thick across the ground, impeding on his speed. The night limited his vision somewhat, but he had grown accustomed to the darkness. He left the city behind him... left a whole world to start anew. He glanced back and saw the faint lights of restless townsfolk. He could see his house from here. He could see that his cruel guardian was still asleep. The thoughts made Palin pick up his pace a little. He was anxious to get to Qeynos and away from Freeport. All of a sudden he came through the thick trees and into a large meadow. A small, cozy looking cottage stood in the center. A light was on inside.<br>

She smiled at the cottage before her, the light pouring from the leaks in the curtains told her that her mum was home. Though, something picked at her senses. Her Elven ears perked up as she drew her cloak about her tighter, hiding her fair skin from view. Stalking the shadows, she cast her senses to give her a clue of who or what might be out there. <br>
<br>
Her foot got caught in a little divet in the ground and let out a wail as she fell. The cottage door flew open, and a red-headed High Elven woman stood in the doorway. &quot;Eoife? Eoife!&quot; She ran down the porch steps, and into the meadow towards her daughter. As she knelt beside her, they were not alone. Katarina glanced over her shoulder her green eyes lingering over they're visitor that dark night, was he friend or foe? Was he one of the Council come to strip her of her powers? He was too young to be such as that... but she could feel power on him, the power that comes from a life time of pain? Who was he?<br>

OOC: I couldn't tell age, so Guardian put me in a pre-teen/teen situation. Hope this can go somewhere. BTW! guys, it's just a request PLEASE, don't do someone else's dialogue. Also, don't use someone unless you know where they are(Like are they in the room with you? are they at another person's house?). I was asleep on the ground, and someone pulled me into this huge fight I had no idea about. Heck, I wanted to leave my char asleep. Pay attention to detail. Sorry a little rant.  <p><HTML>

He could see an older elven figure welcoming her warmly. All of a sudden, The young elf looked in his direction and he ducked from view. &quot;Wow,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;she must have very keen senses! I wonder if I should show myself... Well, I do need a place to stay.&quot; Palin made up his mind and slipped out of his feeble camouflage. He walked over to the house and introduced himself. <br>
&quot;My name is Palin. I am from Freeport. I mean no harm, I only wish to stay for the night if that is possible.&quot; Palin sheathed his sword as to stunt the perception of threat.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utonicus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tonicus</A> at: 6/19/02 10:41:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udahnyella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnyella</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 10:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Floating Story (By Minjaben)</span><hr size=1> Katarina watched him carefully as he sheathed his sword. Helping her daughter, Eoife, up and onto her feet, she never removed her eyes from him. <br>
<br>
Eoife's green eyes resembled her mum's, but that was it. Katarina's flaming red hair was the opposite extreme of her daughter's fairy tale blonde.<br>
<br>
Eoife's eyes glanced from her mother, to that presence. He was here right before them asking for a place to stay, at least for the night. My senses hadn't failed me, she thought, though her fear that it may be danger was obviously wrong. He was a cute lad, but a bit too old for Eoife's 11 years. <br>
<br>
Katarina watched him a bit more, eyes moving over him, taking him in. Definately not a seeker for the Council, she thought, but something licked her senses. Something strong, she could feel her daughter's aura, aye, she was strong like Katarina. <br>
<br>
Katarina's face relaxed, and she gave a warm smile, Only one way to find out, she thought. &quot;Hail, Pallin. Welcome to our home,&quot; she smiled,&quot;I'm Katarina, and this is my daughter Eoife. Eoife goes to school in Freeport, but is home for the weekend. Come in, come in...&quot; Katarina smiled and led him into the house. Eoife following behind. Yes, he was disturbed, and his internal power had been neglected. She yearned to know why, she yearned to know everything about this traveller. A grin crossed her face as she closed the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC : Eoife, pronounced Eve or Eef, either or. BTW Pallin's age please? Katarina is 28, Eoife 11 as stated. Also, meaning yes... Katarina was 17 when she had her. <p><HTML>

He was so, wonderful, the power though, that was what drew her toward him. <br>
<br>
Katarina shoo'd Eoife off to the kitchen, showing Palin around. His face was enlightened the whole time...<br>
<br>
Eoife muttered, as she prepared dinner. Why was her mum being so nice to the Lad who was stalking our yard? Peering out into the living room, her eyes lingered on Palin a minute. Goddess he was cute, blessed by the Gods themselves. He was just too old though. Besides, her mum seemed fond of him, and to her he was still a mystery...<br>
<br>
Katarina helped Eoife with the rest of dinner, and they ate. Katarina kept taking in his aura, secretly drawing sigils of attachment in hopes they would stick to Palin. Draw him towards the house, so she could find the power that lingered so sweet in the air.<br>
<br>
By bed time, Katarina made Palin a bed on the couch, &quot;No need for the floor, Palin.&quot; She smiled, and blew out candles as she headed for her bedroom, glancing over her shoulder, &quot;Remember you're welcome here as long as you desire to stay.&quot; Smiling, she closed her door.<br>
<br>
Eoife watched Palin from her bedroom door, something about him... She'd seen him before...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC: She was never married, had a lover and killed him for his powers. She's a seductive, power hungry, manipulator. She'll either join you or fry you for your power. The Arcane Council in Felwithe has been searching for her since the death on Huntrius Kitado(The lover, also father of Eoife.) She is extremely wanted, her daughter doesn't know, hence the life in the middle of no where and the child studying in FP. Also Eoife is rather powerful young lass. Katarina is a craver of knowledge and power, and she's not afraid to kill to achieve that. Just some heads up. <p><HTML>

<br>
Shifting through the shadows, Katarina made her way to her desk and sat down with a book. It was ancient and falling apart, but she began to read. She wanted to know, she wanted to leach stronger power...<br>
<br>

<br>
Eoife stumbled out to the kitchen in the middle of the night. Walking past Palin, she smiled. His mouth was parted slightly, and he was twisted in his blanket all funny. Giggling she finally made her way to the kitchen for a glass of water, and walked back to her room, stopping by Palin to fix his blanket. Finally she pushed into her room, and crashed on her bed. Dawn would be there soon.<br>

He could feel his blanket slipping off the couch. &quot;It can wait.&quot; He thought to himself. He fell into a deeper sleep now, and the blanket was on top of him again. Eoife had walked by and fixed it for him. Palin was dreaming about dragons and castles, all in a land of fantasy. But he was one of the knights, and he was warding off reanimated skeletons with his flaming sword. But what's this? A figure in the distance? He was in the desert of Ro now. He was thirsty. Was this a mirage? &quot;Leave now,&quot; a voice said. &quot;Leave now.&quot; The figure came closer, but he could not make out what it was. It was tall, wearing a black robe. It was a female figure now, coming closer still. Suddenly, a fear shook him like a lightening bolt. It was Katarina! Palin gasped, and sat up on the couch. His breathing was heavy, and his skin was sweaty, cold and clammy. &quot;It's just a dream. Just a dream. Just a dream.&quot; Palin could no longer fall back to sleep. He was curious. He was very curious as to if it meant anything. He had to see. Palin slowly crept into the bedroom, silently.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uryvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 9:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Back in Freeport</span><hr size=1> Caledak stormed out of the room. He was pissed! The night had been going perfectly! The drinks were on him, his wallet was full, even the bartender was happy! Then like a jackass that mangy mutt had to come in and crash his party! Turning in the street under the lamp light, Caledak stopped to face this new threat. &quot;Well I see those of the Dark don't seem to get it! I Am No Longer In That Buisness!&quot; Pulling his sword from the old scabbard and throwing it towards the elf. His beard was drenched in mead and wine. The elf just stood there and looked at him. &quot;I have no idea what you are talking about sir Paladin. I was merely asking that for the sake of your family you eliminate this certain problem from our midst. I would hate for Vassahgo to take the life of that sweet daughter of yours, not to mention that strong lad of yours. I'd hate to see his fate be cut short.&quot; Caledak nearly pulled the knife from his belt behind him. Remembing that those days were behind him. &quot;Those are not my children. The day they left me and went out to search for their mother, Irenounced them.&quot; Caledak swore to himself and started back into the inn. His dwarven instincts told him to go back and kill that bastard for the threat, but he remembered late wife. She had brought all that viciousness and took it from him so that he could settle down and be a father. Lilane. The name itself brought back the days of old. When he was in the caves of Crushbone hunting and found a wounded woodelf. He took her up and dragged her back to his camp outside and mended her wounds. After that the two were inseperable. She died at the hands of a darkelf trying to pursuade Caledak to hunt down and kill three of the master magicians in the area. He quit that day with his children and ran to Antonica. the days of old. Bacsk then he was a famous Paladin and loyal friend husband, father, and warrior for the city of Kaladim. Those were the days. Remembering them made Caledak feel like he needed to do something, to get away for a few days, from the city. He went back to his fallen sword and lifted it from the dirt. Heading back to his room to gather his things Caledak pulled his bag together and looked at the base of his shield. <br>
<br>
Sir Caledak Bellitus Protector of His People and of Kaladim<br>
Sighing he let the shield fall on his back and fit right like it had so many years ago. With a new light in his eyes he strolled out of the inn and out into the commons. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles) "I am the monkey king" (quickens the dance) "I am the monkey king!"

Shrugging to herself, she chuckles and turns back to three men who sit at a table. <br>
<br>
&quot;What'll ya have, boys?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
  Eshe had been a bar wench ever since she could remember. Her long since passed Father had owned a tavern and she felt home in the grungy pubs of Freeport. Both her parents fell victim to an epidemic that had swept the city many decades ago. Now, she lives alone in a small flat in the city's Eastern most corners. <br>
<br>
The day had been long and uneventful. However boring it may have been, it was better than a bad day, and to her, that made it a good day. With a smile planted permanently on her lips, Eshe strolls past all the stands and shops on her way home. Tossing a strand of the most gorgeous rippling blonde hair behind her, she begins to hum a delightful tune. Rounding the next corner, she enters her neighborhood. It was one of the poorer ones in Freeport, but then again, what wasn't poor in Freeport? No matter how poor it might have been, it was the lavish Qeynos in comparison to the town's ghetto. Waving to a group of children that play on her neighbor’s doorstep, she pulls a key from her puffy sleeve and opens her front door. As she locks her door, the smile that lit up her face dissolves in the empty house. Home brought back memories of things she would have liked to leave behind her forever, but everyday she returned to this god-awful place, and every day she relived the pain that took form in the scar above her heart. Shedding her work uniform (a purple and gold wenchy gypsy outfit with turquoise trim), Eshe puts on loose cloth clothing. With an old rag she wipes away her thick eye makeup and bright red lipstick. Her over sized hoop earrings were quickly tossed onto a table along with dozens of metal bracelets and an anklet that jingled when she walked. Next to the jewelry laid a full head of shining golden hair. Using a faded ribbon, Eshe ties her crimson hair in a bun on the top-back of her head. What now? The corners of her mouth were turned down in a relaxed sort of frown. Everyday it had been the same thing. Get up; get ready, go to work, come home, clean, go to bed. There was only so much that could be cleaned, and now she finds herself out of options. It was times like this, idle times, that she found herself reminiscing and daydreaming bitterly about her past. Something to do... Gotta find something to do to keep me busy... Picking up scrap of cloth, she walks to the sink. Pushing all of her weight on a lever she causes water to shoot out of a steel pump to wet the cloth. With a gurgle the water runs down the pipes. Eshe rings out the access water and continues to scrub the windows, the wooden furniture, the mirrors, and every other scrub able surface in her house. This took her the rest of the night until she could finally return to bed and sleep with the anticipation of tomorrow and another work filled day.<br>

Katarina smiled at Palin, while she stirred her coffee, the steam rising and heating her face. There was so much about this boy she wanted to know, she needed it before she could leech him. Before she would leech him.<br>
<br>
As Katarina began to say something, her daughter, Eoife, sauntered in, her charism embracing the room. Keeping her fake smile Katarina patted the seat to the right of her, and Eoife sat down accordingly. Katarina watched as Eoife's soft green eyes scanned over Palin, she was a definately the young, star-struck enchantress, but failing at winning the boy. He resisted, easily. He's so powerful, she thought grinning. Offering Palin seconds, as Katarina fixed Eoife her plate, she continued on, &quot;Would you care to join me on my errands this afternoon, Palin?&quot;<br>

Eoife rolled her eyes, then glanced at Palin, who seemed to not know what to do. If it were any of her business, she'd advise him not to... Her Mum was up to something she could sense it, but yet again she asks herself, but what? Maybe onc ethey take this walk she'll find out. <p><HTML>

He agreed! Could he not feel that odd, twinge, that hung about her Mum. It was so repulsive! Was that why her Mum and her were all the way out here? Away from civilization? Was this why she went to the Academy in Freeport and not Felwithe? Eoife yearned to go there so bad for her studies, but whenever she asked her Mum went postal. Screaming about how if Eoife ever ventured off this continent it would be her last glance at sunlight. <br>
<br>
Sighing, Eoife went to her room. Palin had to feel it looming of her Mum, but why didn't he turn down the offer. Smirking, as the thought of her Mum being psycho murderer came to her mind, she plopped down at the kitchen table and began going over her spells...<br>

Katarina smiled at Palin, as they came to an Inn not to far from her home. Inside she gathered staple food items and had Palin assist her in carrying them. <br>
<br>
After paying she waved for Palin to follow her, &quot;Freeport awaits us, come now, make haste...&quot; Exactally, hesitation laced his eyes. &quot;Come, come on...&quot;<br>

Eoife glowered down at her spell book, then after lang intervals of cursing she threw it into the wall, except it went through.<br>

Eoife followed the path of her book, and sauntered up to the spot it went through. Sticking her own hand through, she followed suit into the dark that awaited her. <p><HTML>

Swearing he knocked on the door and moved to the side so he would not be seen right off. There was no answer. Not surprised at all, Caledak kicked in the door and went through. No light, no fire, he was in on piece. Realizing that there was no one in the front room he started to move about the rest of the house. Listening to his skills as an assassin, he heard the voices in the last bedroom. Readjusting his stance for the close range attack, Caledak burst into the room. He saw the child and raised his sword. Swearing as the blade went down he closed his eyes. Just as he could nearly feel the blade going through the girls skull, he pulled the blade as much as he could in another direction. The metal hit a wooden dresser. &quot;Damn!&quot; Caledak was sure he could do this just like old days, he was wrong. This mission was wrong. No child should pay for thecrimes of the parents. No child! Dropping the sword on the ground he looked to the cowering girl. &quot;Do not be afraid anymore, I will not harm you, but from this day on beware because those who sent me will be back only with someone who does not care about life. He felt pity for this child, she would not last a week. Starting his way out of the house he could sense that another was close by if not already in the house. Finding it hard to leave the girl with no protetion, Caledak went back to gather his sword and stand guard at the front of the house. he would do one last thing and it would be honorable just like the old days. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles) "I am the monkey king" (quickens the dance) "I am the monkey king!"

<br>
The meat!<br>
<br>
The little halfling hopped off his blackbear companion and started shuffling through his pockets. Beltpouches and satchels were searched, but he had eaten the last of it; juuuuuust peachy. Oh well, time to get some more. Looking to his mount, he decided bear would do just fine.<br>
<br>
In a matter of seconds, the expertly wielded blades of the green-clad halfling had first killed (quickly, as is the rangers' way with animals), then skinned, then gutted the poor animal, and he was slicing off chunks of meat. After smoking them over his spit, he deposited them into the pouch, and smoothed out his brown cloak. The green ivy and leather that covered his body let the cool breeze slip through, and he remembered to thank Karana for the peaceful journy to the Commonlands. The orcs in Highpass were far to dull nowadays, which only meant one thing; tastier meat! Oh yes, it would be *wonderful* to try out some human, possibley troll if the brutes show their faces around here. Zank pulled a pint of brandy from his backpack and looked for his mount; only then did he remember he butchered the bear to feed the same bear! Laughing at his own idiocy, he started doing cartwheels in the lightweight magical armor, keeping the bow taut on his quiver.<br>
<br>
When he sprang up, he was standing face-to-face with a beautiful, fiery-headed elfette. The females always carried better taste! Bowing and removing the green skullcap, Zank let his curly red locks fall forward. Looking up with the most breath-taking, emerald green eyes, he smiled. The clean shaven face and absence of the rotund belly (Dinna get the lean appearance wrong, me'z eats as much as any 'obbit, and me love o' leisure lets me lethargy loose constantly, hehe!) usually gave him a fair chance with the opposite sex; but his charms may not work on a high elf.<br>
<br>
Presenting a wild flower he'd stuffed in his bracer, Zank bowed and held the flower up. She looked slightly unimpressed, but he continued anyway. &quot;Me name be Zank Torriakuss. Me thinks I've never seen tha likes o' one such as yuirself, lass. Might I escort ye home?&quot; The black aura struck him like a bell; Zank had probably just signed his death warrant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udahnyella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnyella</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/02 8:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The arrival</span><hr size=1> Finally getting the nerve to move her arms away from her head, Eoife watched the man walk away.

The hidden library, the incantations for a mass power leech, the strange man who about sliced her in two, and now the shoutin- Palin, she thought, as the shouts grew louder. She burst out of her bedroom, and out the living room. Before her stood Palin, sweat pouring down his face, his breath heavy. Drawing sigils into the air, she tried to calm his breathing. &quot;Wha- What's?&quot;<br>

He just shook his head and grabbed for her arm, trying to steer her out. She resisted and looked into his eyes, and tried to cast her senses into his very soul. It's Mum, she thought. The Library it all made sense. <br>

This Palin was bad from the start, but no he was so intriguing. His Aura scrumpcious, she let curiosity get the best of her. Not now though, it was time for the second dark wave. <br>
<br>
Grinning she turned back to the Halfling and blew him a kiss, a cloud of black smoke began to creep up to him. It embraced him, it's gagging effects wouldn't last long, but it gave her time to lose him. Though, he seemed like the nature type, he'd remember and track her later. Unless, she'd killed all of Norrath by then.<br>
<br>
The council won't stop me now, she thought as her pace quickened, her cottage coming into view. Eoife and Palin would be first to go. Even if the one was her own flesh and blood. Then, the council and everyone who deserved to be damned. <p><HTML>

He had felt magic and could not compare with the likes of such. He felt it charging for the house h watch over and felt the power building inside as well. &quot;Damn!&quot; Caledak was running out of time. fed up with the waiting and the guarding he stormed back into the room. He sensed two of them in the house now, he just hoped that the contengency plan hadn't already gone into full swing. Pulling a short sword for the small area he started his way down the halls to the place he felt the magic. His paladin insticts told him that with the magic coming that his own magic and the shields he could cast would do no good against this force. Shouting out to the girl he had to get her and whoever else was in here out and away from this horrible disaster. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles) "I am the monkey king" (quickens the dance) "I am the monkey king!"
