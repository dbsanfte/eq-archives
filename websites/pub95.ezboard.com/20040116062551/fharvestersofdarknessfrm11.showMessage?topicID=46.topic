Greetings Ilharess Kerridwynn,<br>
<br>
I have found myself with a handful of questions mulling about in my head, and I hoped that you might be able to help me. I do pray you do not consider it too forward. Curiousity often gets the best of me.<br>
<br>
I cannot find a charter, but your recruitment guidelines state no lesser 'Dal, and no runts. Also, no rangers, druids, paladins, or other Tunarian waste. Do the Harvesters hold true to this decree? I can not say I have met one who does not, but I also can not say I have met you all.<br>
<br>
As well, what is you House policy on close family (alts)? Certainly, I would only refer to those family who would be accepted within the halls on their own merits.<br>
<br>
While the reasons behind this inquiry are not public knowledge, I am certain that you can understand why I might be curious. M'Lord has spoken of the halls since our recent... situation.<br>
<br>
May He guide your blade, and She dance in your dreaming,<br>

For a moment, she wonders if she oversteps her bounds, but then the thought is pushed aside. As ambassador, this is her task too. And it had been a while since she had seen the Ilharess in person. So she sits down and starts to write.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Greetings, Lady Baintreach,<br>
<br>
as Ambassador for the Scythe, i take the liberty to answer the question you asked of our Ilharess. I will keep the answers short, as your time surely is valuable.<br>
<br>
There are no druids among the Harvesters. The same holds true for the other occupations you listed. Nor are there those you call 'lesser dals' or 'runts'. That is, of course, as long as you do not use this term for the gnomes. We do have several, and i am sure neither of them would appreciate to be labeled thus. <br>
So the answer is yes. We hold true to this decree. There has been one foolish one to challenge this. And while the circumstances were exceptional, the result was not. There are no exceptions.<br>
<br>
As to the question how anyone may become a member of the Scythe, this is very straight forward. Everyone will be examined. If they are found wanting, they will be denied. Again, there are no exceptions. <br>
Noone in can bring their friends or relatives into the Scythe. At best, they can speak out for them, but the normal procedure to gain entrance to the Harvesters of Darkness has to be observed. This is true for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>anyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Exceptions are not made.<br>
<br>

<br>
With a wave, she calls her messenger. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Deliver this to the Lady Baintreach. You will find her within House Baintreach. Deliver this to her hand only. After delivery, offer to her to take any note back to the Scythe, so that she does not have to travel to Shadow Haven herself. You will recieve the usual payment on your return.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; <br>
<br>
The messenger nods. He had carried notes for the ambassador before. And he knew that his life would be forfeit if she learned of any indisgressions on his side. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rosfuil>rosfuil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(4/11/03 1:17 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.rainweaver.com/EQ/Rose/Images/bounce.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question (or three)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Having fled from House Baintreach under attack from a hoard of less than sane and barely dressed women, the messenger wanders the streets of Neriak trying to think of where this odd heiress might be hiding. Rounding the corner near the Silk Underground, his ears catch a string of what can't be polite mutterings in some odd, foreign language. Stepping around the building, he spies the small woman flinging a gob of clay at the Halfling standing near the pottery wheel. Her hands are covered with the moist grey mud, the sleeves of her robe tied up around her elbows. A faint smirk crosses his lips as he approaches the wheel, staying just out of splatter range. It takes a moment for her to realize he is there, composing herself as she nods to him politely. The parchment appears from his inner pocket and she listens to his introduction without a word. Reading over the offered letter, a soft smile appears. She tucks the letter into her satchel and pours the water flask sitting beside the wheel over her hands, wiping them off on a passing Ogre. Withdrawing a slip of parchment and her quill from the research tome at her feet, she begins to scribe a reply.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Greetings Ambassador Silenae,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your speedy reply. Those were the answers I was hoping to hear.<br>
<br>
Feir'dal and Koada'dal are the focus of much of my hatred. I work quite well with the kill on sight theology when concerning their kind. As I keep Dwarves as slaves, it would be difficult to look at one in any other light. As for Halflings well, M'Lord Morgrist considers them target practice, so that would be problematic. <br>
<br>
Gnomes are quite a different matter entirely. One thinks herself quite attached to me, and came back to Freeport with me when I left the Keep. If she does contact you, I'll make sure one of the scribes pens her letter. I'd not dare ask any civilized woman to try and read her handwriting. I honestly think that skeleton of hers maintains better penmanship. She did help me rid her race of a handful of Paladins however, so that we might have appetizers for the upcoming wedding.<br>
<br>
Life has been a bit hectic as of late, and as M'Lord and I discussed our plans for the future, questions arose. I thank you deeply for your honest and rapid response.<br>
