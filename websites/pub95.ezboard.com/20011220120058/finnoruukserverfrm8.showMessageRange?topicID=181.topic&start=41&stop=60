<br>
Its not the same as comparing someone on the street walking up and grabbing the tag of your collar to look at it. A more proper comparison would be walking past someone on the stree and looking at them and trying to decide what they are wearing.<br>
<br>
Grabbing the tag would be the equivalent of asking to see an item in trade so you could see the DETAILS of it.<br>
<br>
All you get from inspect is the name of the item. EQs graphics engine couldnt give a unique graphic for every item, so they put in inspect so that you can tell what items people are wearing on the OUTSIDE of their body.<br>
<br>
It simply makes up for the game engine, it isnt being rude. <p><img src=http://www.ashenvendetta.com/solinar/SIG.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uobeorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Obeorn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#778899>(11/28/01 4:15:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: OH NO, YOU INSPECTED ME!</span><hr size=1> Don't expect a resolution to this issue. Its been debated before as Gragar noted. There are basically two main opinions on it.<br>
<br>
a) Its a game! Use all the tools available in it. Inspection is one such tool.<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
b) Inspection without consent is a violation of my privacy.  Many roleplayers would follow this as the character is not just a collection of electrons but an extension of their personality and psyche including alter ego's.<br>
<br>
Tolerance of others views is the key here.  Yes, its a game, but the game designers have made it an extension of our lives.<br>

A friend of mine just sent me a tell couple mins ago that Bel was ranting about me.  I thought I would say my side of the story.<br>
<br>
Bel and me go back a while to raptors in TD.  Now the raptors are camps.  And I had been camping the small one.  Bel gets in the zone and doesn't want to do the big isle camp and start complaining to me about how I should move to big... I was only 54 at the time and small was about all I knew about.  Anyway, after a series of tells and calling me an old chinese woman, I let him have it and go on my way.<br>
<br>
With that prior backround in mind, I thought me and Bel were ok with eachother, yet still not friends.  I zone into Seb one day and go LFG... I get the message Belcasor begings to inspect you and I immediately thought about how more trash talk was coming, so I moved away and resumed my medding like he said.  Then I get spammed with &quot;Belcasor is inspecting you&quot; over and over about 20 times and I asked him to stop it.  And like he said, Belcasor replies with &quot;WTF d00d, it's only equip, I ownz0rz you.&quot;  Then I stated back that equip wasn't eveerything in this game, especially a class like wizards.  So he /duels me to test my skills.  I will admit that I wasn't prepared (no stuns, skins, or resist gear up) I take his offer anyway and he kills me, doesn't surprise me with him being yellow con and having resists up.  I was bound at the orb and zone in, loot corpse and ask for a rematch to see if resists and a skin would matter.  He immediately declines... I get mad because a person like Bel would be /ooc'ing how he owned me and probably put me in his info.  <br>
<br>
His equip was better than mine in lots of spots, but I happened to have a SS Robe and he sure picked that to start ranting about how I shouldn't have one.  And perhaps I shouldn't, but because of friends I got a chance to loot it for free (thanks Etri).<br>
<br>
All in all, I am amazed to see this rant in existence.  To me this is what I predicted, a way for Belcasor to show he beat me in a duel.  Afterall, this started just because I didn't like disrespectful people that spam you with inspection messages.<br>
<br>
It's sad to see what Innoruuk has become socially, Norrath would be a lot better if people like Belcasor didn't roam our home turf.  I soon will become one amongst the many that have left this game for RL prosperity.<br>
<br>
Safe travels everyone and I am dissapointed I didn't get to reply until after everyone had dissed me, thanks for the people that stood up for my rights.  <br>
<br>
I am,<br>

First I acknowledge that getting inspected in and of itself is no big deal.  It just isn't.  This is not RL and nothing bad can happen because I get inspected.<br>
Second its still rude to do something that clearly annoys other people regardless of the stage.  It's about respect really.  Try and show respect to others and hopefully get some back.<br>

<br>
I thought that Bel had dropped off the server, maybe even hoped <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      .  Very few people have truely annoyed me in the game, and guess what, Bel's in my top 3 I'd have to say.  He fits right behind Pinane, the moronic bard that used to plague the server claiming how great she was, while going afk with mana song on for hours at a time.  Then just ahead of Chubbies, the annoying Monk that used to run up to my monk, spam him with inspects and then proceed to tell me how uber he was and how much I sucked (sorry, not all of us are using our college money to ebay the best stuff.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
You see, a very long time ago I played a monk named Zendareth.  One afternoon Bel and I were in a group in LGuk.  I had just killed the EE while waiting for the spot to open up and being a monk the bag was kinda heavy.  I asked if someone in the group would hold it for me, and Bel tells me 'sure'.  Well, he then starts trying to offer me money for it, saying that it's only worth 150pp but he'll give me 175 for it (mind you, this was a long time ago).  I refuse multiple times, and after a little while he disbands and gates with no warning.  Granted it's a minor item, but I was pissed.  I tried to get with him the next day to get it back, so he tells me to meet him at a certain spot (Magi in LGuk) and after I FD'd my way over there he was gone, and had logged.  I gave up at that point, it wasn't a big deal, like I said, it just pissed me off.  The next time I saw him I was in SRo camping the AC.  Dork rolls up and asks if I'm camping the AC, I of course reply that I am, thinking to myself, No, I'm just killing every Spider, Undead and Snake in the zone because you can never have to much spider silk, copper pieces and rattles....  Then he spams his jboots and says something stupid about how great he is.  He made the #2 slot on my ignore list after that.  Since I haven't seen him at all in 60 levels as an enchanter (and I didn't transfer my ignore list) I figured he got booted or bored with the game.  To bad it's not the case....<br>
<br>
Like I said, it's no biggie anymore, it just illustrates the type of 'inspector' that started this thread.<br>
<br>
As for the inspections, well to me it might as well say &quot;a_n00b_01_is inspecting your equipment.&quot;  If you're over level 30 and you haven't figured out that it bothers people, you're in need of serious help.  Does it bother me?  Not allot (unless it's an idiot like Bel that's going to make a stupid comment), but since it's no secret that it bother's most people, why do it?<br>

I don't look at your junk without asking, why you wanna check out my package? I feel like I'm being molested when that happens. At least if they ask I know I'm about to be felt up. (Most of) You people don't just run up to people on the sidewalk and start rummaging through their Calvins do you? I know I don't.<br>

Edit:<br>
To reply to Solinar, inspecting someone is the same as walking up and grabbing tags. You can't see if I'm wearing Lees or Wranglers unless you grab my arse, or you know a whole lot about jeans. Grabbing the tag would not be like watching it in a trade window. The person initiating the trade would have to put the item on their mouse (hand) and show it to you. This is more like someone commenting on your neato watch and asking if you could give them a closer look. <p>Shintou, on Sleeper: Can't the guy take a fuckin Nap? Jeez. Leave him alone.

A while ago, my brother started playing the inny server, and used my char a bunch to get his own sk some gear.  Well, my brother is a little @#%$.  I've had jboots since level 34, and I know my bro used my char to try and get himself jboots, so that's that one explained, but my bro trying to buy your EE bag when I've had one since level 10 just proves his idiocy.  My last guild actually had a bunch of problems with him using bel too, so you're not the only one.  Anyway, sorry that happened to ya bro, I'm not (or at least I think I'm not) that bad of a guy, hopefully ya understand how little brothers can be =(.  As for that switch thing, I'm currently considering switching bel to the cazic thule server; I have some friends on there that I've known for a few years, so I think that's where I'm headed.  After all, once you get seperated from your &quot;friends&quot; in this game, it becomes pretty pointless. <p><blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.

Then I hit higher levels.<br>
<br>
Now, there are only two times when I am inspected:  by accident, or someone checking me out.  What started to really, really bug me is that 99.9% of the time, it was the second type and every time was either followed by &quot;TL me plz&quot; (since they saw I was a wizard), &quot;Sell me xxx item you are wearing&quot;, or &quot;U got good stuff.  Give me pp plz&quot;.   And every single one of those times the idiot that inspected me would not take &quot;no&quot; as an answer.   I even had to put some of them on ignore.<br>
<br>
I tried turning off the stupid &quot;DumbAss_01 is inspecting you&quot; message, but guess what?   That only stopped the message, not the fact that the idiot starting bugging me.   Actually, it was even worse, since I didn't know they were inspecting me, they had time to make a whole freakin list of my equipment so they could ask if I want to sell/give them each item one at a time!!<br>
<br>
So, I turned the mesage back on and now when I see it I move away before they can get a good look at what I have.  It cut down on the terribly aggravating behavior of the totally antisocial morons I was running into. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=181.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=181.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=181.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=135.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=196.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
