Her scream echoed down the halls leading to her chamber, and there was not an ear in the city that was deaf to the piercing sound. The scream shortly gave way to laughter as she rolled on to her back in her bed. Her black hair and pale skin was a sharp contrast to the deep red silk sheets that surrounded her. She slowly rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and yawned, revealing for a brief second a row of sharp teeth. <br>
“M’lady, there are intruders.” A deep voice called in from the other side of her door. She quickly dressed and opened the door. She found the head of her guards standing with sword drawn and a very worried look on his face. She smiled and looked into his eyes. She managed to stop giggling long enough to tell him not to worry about it. He took her by the hand and escorted her to the conference room where her officers were waiting for her. As she entered the room, the candles on the walls flickered and went out. All conversation came to a halt as she made her way to the head of the table.<br>
“Good evening, what seems to be the problem?” she cheerfully asked a gray haired and wrinkled necromancer sitting next to her. <br>
“My liege, there is an army from the north, who, with touches lit, and swords drawn, makes this aggressive move on the shrine. They call for you to come out, to answer for the deaths of their brethren. They ask for your sacrifices as payment for your bloody deeds.”<br>
“Well,” she said as a smile spread across her face, “they’ve come this far, we might as well show them the way to Paradise. Summon the troops; we will answer them.” The elder leaned close and began to whisper in her ear. <br>
“Paradise, I urge you to not act hastily, they are here for war. Remember, this is not a game.” Paradise took hold of the old one’s hand.<br>
“I thank you for your council my friend, you have never lead me astray. And you are right old one, it is not a game. At least not for them.” Glancing up and addressing the rest of the congregation, “go, wake the soldiers, it is time to have some fun.” She smiled as she sat back in her chair. Her left eye twinkled in the moonlight that streaked in through the window. <br>
<br>
<br>
“Set up camp here! We go no further till we have scouted this area.” <br>
“Sire, we must advance now while we can still take them by surprise!”<br>
“We will move when I say we will move. They Qeynos guards have spent years looking for this shrine, what makes you think we will be able to find it in one night? Every Qeynos expedition here has either found nothing, or found nothing but their deaths. It is better to use caution. Now, help with the camp, post guards at every entrance or exit to this chamber.”<br>
“Yes Sire”<br>
Arteus watched the preparations and smiled. He had brought together the strongest and deadliest barbarians he could find. There were 65 of them in all and he reckoned they were a force that no one could stand up to. As he entered the command tent he saw his officers sitting around a long table, there was a pile of documents on the table. As he sat down he was informed that the maps they had of the Aquaducts were useless, they all were incomplete. “We do not know what is beyond this chamber Sire.” His assitant informed him, “But we have sent our best scouts.” Arteus grunted in approval.<br>
“What information do we have about what we are up against?”<br>
“Have you ever fought a Necromancer Sire?”<br>
“Yes, he was a worthy foe.”<br>
“Have you noticed Sire that they travel alone? No one from Hallas has ever fought more then one of them, and many have died doing that. . . What we are up against is that Necromancer, but multiplied by who knows how many. It is good we have the gods . . . the true gods, on our side.” <br>
“Aye. We can sit here and speculate until our hair goes gray, but do we have any proof that this shrine exists?”<br>
“Our men discovered a room down one of these tunnels. It had blood splattered on the wall. Carved in the ceiling was what appeared to be a religious text. I had one of the elders examine it and translate. He said the text is very old. The blood was fresh.”<br>
“What was the translation?”<br>
“ ‘On the twelfth day there was a single star that could be seen through the sunlight. It radiated darkness and consumed the world. On the thirteenth day it took on flesh, and became paradise.’ The elder has never heard this myth before, and knows not what it refers to.” Arteus but his elbows on the table and began to rub his temples.<br>
“Get some sleep, we will move out tomorrow”<br>
“Where will we go Sire, the scouts have not returned yet and I don’t thin . . .”<br>
“We will move out tomorrow!”<br>
“Yes Sire.” And Arteus was left alone, the ancient myth echoing in his mind, consuming his soul. He looked across the table to the mirror. He stared at his aging face. He looked into his own eyes. He began to whisper, trying not to let himself hear what he was saying, “What religious impiety is here! What monster is the proprietor of these unholy acts? Tomorrow we will make our strike. Tomorrow we will have revenge!” The mirror shattered on the last syllable. Arteus went to get some sleep, but when he closed his eyes he only found nightmares. Sleep did not come easy, or without a price.<br>
<br>
<br>
One year later Arteus awoke. He opened his eyes slowly, afraid of what he might see. His body felt weightless. He was floating. He rolled over and pulled himself to dry land. He slowly stood as his eyes adjusted to the dark. He looked behind to see where he had been floating, and what he saw was what he had seen in his nightmares. A large pool of blood was at the center of a rather large chamber, and across from him stood what appeared to be an alter. There was a girl standing at the alter. He fell to his knees. He clutched his head, trying to cover his ears, to rid himself of the incessant giggling. The past year of his life came flooding back to him. That night after the meeting, in the Aqueducts, they had been ambushed. He remember waking to the screams of his comrades. He remembered seeing a girl sitting in his tent. That laughing, he heard it then too. He forced himself to look back to the alter. The giggling stopped. “Where are my men? What did you do to them?” He shouted across the room. <br>
“They’re dead.” Rage took hold of Arteus, and he tried to stand up. He could not. <br>
“What have you done to me?”<br>
The girl paused for a brief moment and looked over at Atreus. A smile shot across her face and she giggled. “I have done nothing. You have been unconscious for a year now. Your muscles have atrophied.” Arteus feebly shook his head as he realized his situation. <br>
“I don’t understand. I. . . I can’t remember wha . .” Atreus felt his mind slipping away. He felt weak, feverish. The girl moved a little closer to him. <br>
“You want to remember . . no?” Atreus slowly nodded his head, as he faded in and out of consiousness. The girl moved closer still, and knelt on the ground next to him, whispering in his ear, “just remember,” a giggle, “you wanted to remember.” With that she put her small hand over his eyes and closed them. He lost all strength in his body and fell to the earth. His mind raced back to that night when the Heretics attacked. He had woken up to the sound of death. A bag was placed over his head, and everything went black. When light once again found his eyes he was home. He was outside the gates of Hallas. His thoughts of home were inturupted as he heard a battle cry behind him, an order to attack. He started marching forward as if he was not in control of his actions. He saw his sword point bobbing in and out of his range of vision. Why was he marching on his home? He looked to his sides and saw that he was not alone, he was marching with an army, an undead army. He saw vicious Shadow Knights and Necromancers walking with him. He shifted his vision forward again and saw the Barbarian army surrounding the gate. He tried to call out to his friends, but found that no sound would escape him. <br>
Back in the underground chamber his body writhed and contorted as his mind relived the battle. He was sobbing. In his mind the battle was fast and bloody. The heretics had defeated the outer guards and were now making their way through the city, having mercy on no one. He found himself at the his own house. As he opened the door he was relived to find his wife and children still alive. He desperately tried to tell them to escape, to hide somewhere, but instead of heading his advice all they did was scream. He watched his sword slice through his wife, before decapitating his only two children.<br>
His eyes flew open and he was screaming. As his vision cleared he saw the girl looking down at him. Tears streamed down his face and he shouted at the girl.<br>
“What have you done to me!?!” there was no answer from the girl. He continued to scream, “Why didn’t you kill me!?” The girl hesitated before answering. She knelt down and kissed Atreus on the forehead, as if to comfort him. She looked deep into his eyes, and giggled. For Atreus, it seemed as though everything was moving in slow motion, her bright red lips slowly spread apart as she mouthed the words:<br>
“I did.” <br>
With that the girl left the room, and Arteus finally looked at his body. The flesh had rotten away, leaving nothing but bone. It only now ocored to him what had happened. Those undead soldiers he had rememberd from the attack on Hallas. He was not with them, he was one of them. Atreus was lost in self pity. He couldn’t even kill himself, he was already dead. It is said that if you are in Qeynos Aquaducts, late at night, deep under the city, you can still hear they echoes of Atreus as he calls out for his family, as he searches to die.<br>
