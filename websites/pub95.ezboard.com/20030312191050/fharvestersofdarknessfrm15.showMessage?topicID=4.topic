But the cold no longer bothers me. It has become a constant companion, much as the scent of death and decay, which seems to be stuck in whatever robes i don. But it was not always so. I too once was just a young, naive girl, growing up within Neriak. But that part was told already, to someone i called friend once, and Ilharn too. Here is that part of the story :<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 This is Silenae's story. She told it to me when we met outside the city of Neriak. Some things she didn't tell me, others I did not ask. If you seek to know more, you will need to seek her out and ask her yourself.<br>
<br>
From what she said, she is the second of three daughters of a wealthy family. All three daughters were well loved by their parents, although the despair at lacking a son to continue the family line was always present during Silenae's youth. Plans were made for all three girls. Needless to say that they were not included in the planning process.<br>
From what she says, her task would have been to become the house wizard. Her education started early, when her parents invited teachers into the house to prepare her for the day when she would be presented as likely candidate for apprenticeship. Those teachers came from all branches of magic, since she was to be schooled well in their various uses and limitations. Without her parents noticing, Silenae was drawn not to wizardry, as desired, but to the dark arts of the necromancers. While her teachers tried to teach her the limitations, she carefully went about to gather all possible information about death magic.<br>
<br>
Years passed, and finally, Silenae reached the age when she was to be apprenticed to the wizards. Yet, on what the family had prepared as her big day, she was pale and cold, seemingly struck down by some odd illness. With the day already ruined, the family decided to wait another year, so that she could become apprenticed with the best possible omens.<br>
<br>
The first half year, she seemed to be docile, following her teachers leads. Then, her wild streak broke through. From one day to another, she abandoned all pretense, and tried to run away, but the undead guardians of the family mansion stopped her in her tracks. Of course this only served to harden her resolve, and she spent the following weeks learning more of the dark arts. Finally, on the birthday of her younger sister, she decided to make another attempt. Her prepared bones in hand, she snuck out past the undead guardians. Finally, she had won her freedom. Once outside, she realized that she had not fled alone. Following in her footsteps was her younger sister, who also felt little inclination to follow the family plans. After discussing their future, Silenae headed straight for the lodge of the dead, and sealed the pact with her dark teachers - a pact her family would not dare to disturb. After yet another time of teaching, the dark masters sent her out into the world, to<br>
make use of her knowledge, and acquire the coin to continue her studies. Right away, she contacted her sister, and spent the following years hunting at her side.<br>
<br>
Silenae had heard of the conclave from the dark masters. They had also told her to contact Kazanti once she thought about joining a larger group, since for her, return to her family was not an option.<br>
<br>
That is about all she was willing to tell. I never asked her about her family name - a look at her eyes as she mentioned running from their mansion was enough to stay that question.<br>
<br>
Kazanti<br>
Leader of the Conclave of the Damned -- Firiona Vie<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That was the beginning. It was followed by years of freedom. Freed of all constraints placed by my birth, i was able to enjoy the world. The sky was the limit, and all of norrath was the playground Lleld and i had. And we used it well. Among the friends made back then are a few which still remain, but sadly, many have fallen, or found a peace which never seemed possible to me. It would not give justice to any if i named those who remain. Instead, i will tell of two who vanished. One, a shadow knight, who found the peace to let go of all hatred, and one, a scoundrel, whose last words were half a threat, and half a promise. But, i skip ahead there. <br>
<br>
It might have been fate, or just coincidence, but while traveling, Lleld and i met with a Shadow Knight, and her constant companion, the rogue Falhurst. And while i am the wrong person to tell their story, i did have a small part in it. For a reason i cannot fathom, the knight and i became closer than i had been with anyone aside my sister. Closer, perhaps, in a way. I still carry a small scar of the bond we formed, and there still is a small stain on a wooden Table in Oggok - proof of the nights spent there after fighting with the lizards. This, perhaps, was the most carefree time spent. It was overshadowed by a ritual smashed by Iksar loyal to Cabilis. Unfortunately, i even managed to survive the desaster, living proof that even they considered me beneath them to notice. Nothing i had done changed a thing, and thus i had been ignored, and the ritual was thwarted. In the end, the light prevailed that day. <br>
<br>
But again i am getting sidetracked. Just one more note to this day - hence forth, all Iksar have been suspicious to me at best. Very few actually managed to win past the mistrust.<br>
<br>
Another shadow loomed over these carefree days. In a way, it were my own actions which brought it down on us. The Knight carried a legacy from her past as well, in the spirit of her mother Darga, who had been a powerful necromantress. This burdon had been wearing on her, and on the bond between us. And while i secretly desired Darga's powers, Darga openly disapproved of anything which could turn the knight from the path laid out before her. I, too, was seen that way. <br>
<br>
After the legacy had become too much to bear, we set out to banish the spirit from Kallee. We, at that time, were the Priestess Ankhami, myself, and a few selected friends. And we succceeded, but the price paid was terrible. We betrayed Falhursts trust, and rightfully earned his wrath. We also won peace for her, which in itself was a success, but for me spelled desaster. Suddenly, i was alone. And out of despair, i spoke what should never have been spoken. The words still echo in my mind as if it had been yesterday.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot; I spend my time in the ice. And my soul has become of ice. I wrap myself in it. What i gave you was the last piece which held some warmth... There will be no other.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Someone or something heard those words. They must have triggered something, since hence forth, i did not enjoy warmth. Quite the contrary, actually. I became most comfortable in the ice. All warmth was gone from the days and nights. And the months that followed were spent alone and in darkness. Looking back, i can only say i have been the fool there. But that, too, lies in the past. With the Knight gone, i turned back towards the Conclave of the Damned. The Ilharn had made me one of his advisors, which gave plenty of opportunity to bury myself in work. I obliged and the days passed quickly. Life went on, until the day when a rift opened between him and me.<br>
<br>
The warlord Gore still walked the world then, and had threatened the Conclave. That, too, is another tale, one i should not tell here. But it caused a rift in that what course of action i suggested was seen as cowardice. And with that accusation out, the dealings with the Conclave grew difficult. More and more time was spent seeking others. New friends were found, as were new allies. And in due time, it became painfully obvious that my time in the Conclave of the Damned was over.<br>
<br>
It is no easy decision to leave what you consider your family.. your home. It had been a dream of mine to find a place where i could live freely, and earn my place in society despite the threat looming - that of the House which still to this day is looking for their two lost daughters. But it had to be done. Again, i found myself alone and isolated. So first, the path led away from the Conclave of the Damned, and then, it led to the Harvesters of Darkness.<br>
<br>
I am with the Scythe now, and the intentions are clear. I will die before i see my dream of a family crushed again. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>
