Unless your one who assumes that only high elves, gnomes, and erudites can be magicians. Part of the Mage epic involves killing Grimrot in OT. For a dark elf magician, this means a faction hit with the outpost. If this makes the magician KOS, he's out of luck basiclly since there's blessed few mobs that can raise the faction, and the ones I have seen are pretty tough (actually, only one that comes straight to my mind is Faydedar, but have heard the other kunark dragons raise it as well). So to be safe one will spend hideous amounts of time either killing berserkers to turn in braids, or killing whordes of goblins to improve FV faction. Either way it's pretty tedious. Of course it doesn't shock me much, I honestly believe VI forgot dark elves could be magicians, we miss out on alot of stuff the good races have access (vendor that sells level 16 and level 20 researched spells, Vendor in TS that sells ALL mage spells up to level 44,  to name a few). Ah well,  won't hijack this thread to rant on just how pampered the &quot;good&quot; races are.<br><br>Kinelaria <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ufennikfoxxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FennikFoxxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/27/02 9:29:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1003.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  ..</span><hr size=1> I am very happy with these changes.  I am a monk, and  always am being told that my epic was so easy. Easy, yes, Short, no.  I did have a 76 hour raster camp to get my robe of lost circle.  I had a tangrin camp off more then 20 hours I'm postitive, but I got exp in a KPC group. The pawbuster was the longest camp of em all, but again got exp while there.  Chardok was hell at the time the zone was the 2nd toughest kunark zone. Betrayer was only a couple 4 hour camps.  I like having the monk epic semi difficult.  Btw, Good luck all on Brother Qwinn when I camped him with 4 other monks the bastard took about a month to spawn in the meantime had a bard twink level in south karana, and a enchanter twink =) just my two cents on how the monk epic will be again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ucaioirontoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaioIrontoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/27/02 10:14:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1003.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ..</span><hr size=1> i have no proof on this but from what i have heard and what im asumeing the spawn times on brother qwinn and z have been increased big time and since they did that they prolly lessened the drop rate.

That's even worse - at least we CAN do faction work.<br><br>A Dev at the Fan Faire stated &quot;There is NO reason Iksar should have to do human quests&quot; when asked about this - they're supposedly looking at setting up an alternative iksar quest leading to the epic.<br><br>Robe does still drop, but at a much lower rate - and Zephyl's spawn rate was never changed.<br><br>Finally, the monk epic may be easy, but it's LONG.  Rather than going through difficult encounters, it was intended that you start the quest at level 1.  If they get an iksar version of the quests up and running, I'd be 100% toward total removal of the RotLC as dropped loot. <p>--------------------<BR>Hizuka - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=481" target=_blank>Profile</a><BR>Swifttail Disciple<BR>Initiate of the Celestial Fists<BR><BR>"In Void there is good but no evil.

But getting the robes required is by no means easy unless you killed the Rath/SK monks.<br><br>Having done the entire quest myself (no MQ)... I can say that it was by no means the easiest epic.  (I think Rogue, Cleric, or Shaman epic may be.. not certain).<br><br>I spent literally hundreds of hours camping Raster (made good exp tho), the Rock in Sol B, countless hours in chardok and KC camping the pipes (now chardok pipe is rediculously easy to get since the chardok revamp).<br><br>Even having spent all the time collecting the parts needed for the robes..
