Then why, might I ask, are your people cowering away on their continent, content with letting the other races fight the wars, so your people don't have to?  Is it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> bellow</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you to lift a finger to fight of what you know will become your foe?  Or are your people so ignorant as to think when someone is victorious in these wars, that they won't come riding to your shores and spires, sword and bows drawn, spells flying to slay?&quot;  All the while, there is a deep, mocking tone to his voice, making it quite evident the wizard has little respect for these 'superior' people.<br>
<br>
Nallu turned to look at Undeen, quickly building a superior, knowing look on his face.  &quot;If they DO come to our land, we will simply obliterate them where they stand.&quot;  He tries, and does an admirable job of not appearing worried at the group he is now finding himself in the middle of, a Barbarian and small, slightly bloodied little girl at Undeen's side and the Cat-Man behind him.<br>
<br>
A cruel smirk crosses Undeen's lips.  &quot;Is the memory of the Erudites so poor, as to no longer remember The Hole, created by such a war?  As I recall, it was decided then you would never do that again, for fear of your entire continent becoming like that....  Know though, Erudite.  Other races coming only to kill you, will not care if your continent, and all your people die in such a blast, lost forever, no more then rubble and bones at the bottom of one giant hole in Norrath...&quot;<br>
<br>
Nallu was unable to keep his eyes from growing large at the thought, swallowing hard, as if trying to push the thoughts down into his stomach.<br>
<br>
Undeen's smirk turns into a shining smiling that doesn't quite reach his eyes.  &quot;Now that you have, perhaps, a bit more respect for those around you.  It is only proper to give you my name.&quot;  Undeen gives a short, slightly flourished bow of his head.  &quot;Undeen Lar'Tese.  Shadow Elven Wizard and Noble of Neriak.  And, apparently, something of a leader to this small band of people here.  And you might be...?&quot;<br>

I believe it best we, for the time being anyway, flee here.  I know of a place the Iksar likely lack control in, as much as they may desire it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Undeen turned to gather the glances of all those around him.  &quot;Don't think it safe to flee here.  No where on Kunark is safe, but I think it best we secure a place from Iksar control to strike from.  Firiona Vie has fallen, as has Karnor's Castle.  Keasora likely has as well.  Despite all that, my guess would be, Old Torsis still stands against the Iksar.  Who here will go with me to make sure the City of Mist remains outside Iksarian control?  Who wishes to return home, and forget about Kunark and Iksar and die in your own little racial war.  And who wants to stay here and die a pointless, brave fool's death?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before they even answered, Undeen began openning his portal to the Emerald Jungle, still turning to watch them all decide.<br>

The big dipped his finger into a blue ink pouch at his hip, and made another streak on his face. Decision reached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Ol' Torsis sounds good to me, elf!&quot; Brutus bellowed, his fighting spear once again laying across his shoulders. He let an arm down from his mystical weapon, and smacked Nallu on the back so hard, the Erudite fell to the ground. &quot;C'mon, *brother*,&quot; he said, with as much emphasis on one word as he could muster past the brandy in his hand. &quot;Our world needs the men of Marr once more!&quot; The Barbarian deposited the bottle back in his packs and pouches that adorn the belt on his kilt.<br>
<br>
The Erudite was on his feet again, and was near boiling with rage. Before he had a chance to speak, a multitude of growls widened Nallu's eyes. He turned to see a pack of scale wolves and a gargantuan kodiac bear eyeing him hungrily. &quot;Me name be Brutus,&quot; the Barbarian said. &quot;And They be hungry...&quot;<br>
<br>
He stepped through the portal, winking at the dark man. &quot;O-laaaay, ole' ole' o-laaay...&quot;<br>

Tani stares at the ground. Staying and dieing wasn't an option. But going home? ... Her blood stained hand came into her sight. What was old Tor-something or other... that place they spoke of? What would she find there? What about home... What about home? She knew *he* would be waiting for her... How could she tell him what she had done? How would he react? She wanted to go home. She wanted to be with him again. But as she watched the barbarian step into the portal, she found herself rushing after Undeen, her arms wrapping around one of his tightly. At home she wasn't sure if she was cared for... If you could really call it 'home' she wasn't sure, but she was sure that as long as she followed the shadow elf, someone cared. <br>

Good thing a wizard's mind moves faster then any living beast known to walk norrath's lands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go.&quot;  With that simple word, he pushed the arm Tani was clinging to through the portal, pulling her along, then stepped through, murmering the single word to cause the portal to shatter behind them.<br>
<br>
Only moments later, a scaled wolf bounded through the air, flying through what had just been a portal and smack full force into the quadrolith spire.  It crashed to the ground with a hollow thud.  Even such beasts of Kunark couldn't servive with a broken neck and caved in skull.  Those spires were harder and less forgiving then they looked....<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Undeen and Tani stepped out of the portal last, the shimmering thing shattering and disapearing into so much mist before everyone's eyes.  And there before them lay the great Emerald Jungle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to the Emerald Jungle, everyone.  Home to some of the largest bloodsucking insects I've ever seen.  You should see the leeches.&quot;  a playful smirk crossed his lips, then he sighed softly, hugging Tani tight and whispering comfortingly into her ears.  &quot;Don't worry dear.  I won't let them, or anything else here hurt you.  They'll have to get through me, and likely the rest of our little group as well.&quot;  He offered her the best caring smile he could give, and it seemed she took it rather well, clinging to Undeen's arm again possesively.<br>
<br>
Looking to the rest of the group, then the forest, Undeen gave a soft sigh.  &quot;Who here among us, has ever been here, besides myself?&quot;  No one commented, though, something about the barbarian said he might have been here before.  Or maybe he was just eager to see some of the horrors this land was claimed to hold.  Brave.  Brave and foolish.  The reason so many good warriors died so early in wars...<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright then.  I suppose I lead us to Old Torsis.  Now, you must understand, there may be a few rogue Iksar here that would help us fight Cabilis.  There will certainly be a lot of undead.  Of about any kind you can think of.  spirits, skeletons, and likely so good, old fasioned zombies.  Don't be surprised by them.  If they attack, defend yourselves'.  if they don't, then don't prevoke them.  This is their home, not our's.  You would do well to remember that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before anyone could respond, Undeen began chanting out a spell.  It only took seconds for it to take effect.  One by one, the pary member's eyes began to tingle, though there was no apparent effect.  Then, one by one, they disapeared, revealed like ghosts to one another.  The last one to go as such was Undeen himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, anything actually living, shouldn't be able to see us.  But don't depend on the spell.  be cautious.  This will just help a little.  If the thing is undead, or seeks by scent, this spell will help you about as much as wearing a clear silk veil over yourself.  Lets go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Calmly, Undeen turned and began to walk, always feeling Tani's tight grip on his arm and her hurrying little feet, trying to keep up with him.<br>
<br>
He couldn't help it.  He looked down at her, smiled, and sweeped her off her feet, cradling her to his chest and carrying her, perhaps putting too much faith into his own spell, and those he was with.  It didn't matter though, so long as Tani prefured this.  Which meant not minding being carried, not minding him, and not minding his cold chainmail.  She would likely want to be put down anyway.<br>

<br>
&quot;Old Torsis is just ahead.  We should be there soon.&quot;  He looked over the others, reaching a hand out to Tani without thinking about it, but something flashes in his eyes as he looks them over.  &quot;Where's that cat-man?  Don't remember the name...  Hasn't he come back to the rest of the group yet?...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tani took his hand and clutched it, seeming tired, nothing like how she had awoken.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Deal with the child later, get out of the open jungle now.

Seeing that no one knew where the cat-man was, Undeen decided to take a chance.  &quot;Alright.  We're going on to Old Torsis.

<br>
Nallu trotted after the elves, and Brutus sighed. He could feel the life force bleed from the mosquito that was previously cleaved in half. He wondered how long it would take Derren to catch up with them; not long, he hoped. The wizard set an unremarkable swift pace, especially for a little black elf clad in chainmail.<br>
<br>
A brandy bottle flew from the barbarian's hand, and it smashed into a tree. The liquid spilled everywhere, the sweet stench cascading down around the bark. Brutus was filled with memories of the war hall, whe- &quot;OIYY! Wait up, Elf!!&quot; He broke into a run, and passed Nallu, finally getting side by side with Undeen. He handed him a bottle. &quot;Smashed un back there; dump 'iss for a trail. This wood is full of sp'rits 'n all sorts ah goodies Oi may be needin fer tha Iksar.&quot;<br>
<br>
Undeen's pace didn't slow much, but he turned his head to Brutus. He nodded his understanding. &quot;Old Torsis. Don't be too long, human.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brutus grinned a toothy, rotting grin. &quot;Me friends won't let me, elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Emerald Jungle was a dangerous place; that much, Brutus was sure of. In previous out-of-body experiences, he walked this steamy forest and was assaulted on all sides by vile presences. But there were great forces to befriend here, as well...<br>
<br>
Had to move quickly. After the last word to Undeen, he stopped and put a knee to the ground, catching his breath. Brutus pulled a few powders from various pouches, and sprinkled them around him in a circle. He set his heart free, and a blinding blue luminescence surrounded him, encasing him in a half-bubble that connected to the ground. From this vantage point, he could see through the trees and animals, and see their auras, the pure energy that created everything. He sensed there were plenty of willing allies near, but he didn't have the time to draw them all.<br>
<br>
In the tongue of the Northern Watchtower, as Brutus's clan called it, he spoke to the spirits themselves, gaining rapt attention. &quot;{{Serrgatti tunu maninachi. Hallah sunnu mangrunschik errr e serrgann}} Battle comes this way. Lizards enslave Life of all. {{Hallah gratchi conna}} Lizards come to burn, {{Hallah gratchi soon dak-tah}} Lizards come to take spirits, {{Halla conngah terri smahllcrah}} Lizards must be smashed. {{Kooo grall smaht?}} Who will help?&quot;<br>
<br>
Inside the bubble of Brutus's energy, he could not see the trees quivering at &quot;Hallah&quot;, the word they knew so well. He couldn't see the plants growing thorns, the vines whipping around, the beasts gnashing teeth in rage at his words instead of racial enemies. Gorrillas pounded their chests in rage, and big cats roared. All Brutus saw was the amassing of every color on the widened spectrum of his vision growing in vibrancy, lifting up higher and higher. The beasts were enraged, the plants were defensive. Now, if only he could locate it...<br>
<br>
There.<br>
<br>
Brutus sent out his conscious thought to Severilous, the great horned dragon of the Emerald Jungle. The barbarian was amazed to see that it actually existed, and the power it commanded...<br>
<br>
The incorporeal form of the dragon in this spirit-awareness state startled him; Severilous was startlingly dim, green, and nearly nonexistant compared to the flash of colors and power around them. Brutus gulped back in his body. He sent out a strain of the emotions he was feeling; fear dominated it all, but his strong resolve to protect this place shone through it. Severilous, while half the jungle away, growled his own discontent at the brazen lizards. Brutus was elated that the giant lizard didn't side with them. {{Would... would you help us? We can defeat them, together...}} He seemed to say.<br>
<br>
A swirl of red and revolting greens hit him back to his body. He got the impression that Severilous would not stoop to aiding men, but rather had his own agenda. The two shamans agreed to stay out of each others' way... mostly Brutus feared to get chomped, and the dragon was irratable and in no mood for annoying morsels.<br>
<br>
The bubble faded. Three shadowy forms surrounded Brutus, blackened with their extreme power; the three great spirits of the jungle, the Gorrilla, the Trakaraptor, and the Leech, entered Brutus's mental holding pen where they were greeted by the rest of his friends.<br>
<br>
The shaman stood up and took inventory. [Old spirits... check. New spirits... check. Dragon... not hostile, and I'm alive... check! Old Torsis... gettin there.] Fur sprouted from his back and legs, and Brutus's nose grew more wolf like. The Gorrilla spirit guided his legs, and the scent of brandy led Brutus closer to the group. His wolfish legs carried him faster than any spells before, a trail of power streaming behind him. The Emerald Jungle supported them...<br>
<br>
((Yea, /power trip off. Brutus got the nature, Undeen better get the civilization orderly. Kinda long, too... sry. Done.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 6:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I wanna go hoooooooome</span><hr size=1> The barbarian sprouted....fur?

And there it was before him.  The entrance to Old Torsis.  Now came the hard part.<br>
<br>
He walked up to the entrance and put Tani down, then turned to the rest of the group.  &quot;I want you all to stay here for just a little bit...  Let me see what I can do with this old fortress of a city, alright?  I'll Be back soon.&quot;  he rubbed Tani's cheek slightly, then smiled, turned and went in, his breath still heavy from the run, but his mind sharp for the fight.  Both here, and with the Iksar to come.<br>
<br>
Undeen was met with the normal welcoming of Old Torsis.  Undead.  He simply ignored them, or rooted them where they stood, if they gave trouble.  Deeper he searched.  He needed to find someone, living or dead, that was in control here.  He knew such people existed in the city.<br>
<br>
He rounded a corner and found himself looking into the ethereal eyes of a long dead Iksar shameness.  She didn't attack or ignore him as the others had.  She looked directly into his eyes, an intelligence there the others lacked.  She knew what he was, even if she didn't know what he was here for.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Best to be on their good side...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Undeen dropped to one knee, kneeling before the spirit, his head bowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I, my companions, and the forest as a whole, living place, seek the assistance of the denizens of Torsis.  The Iksar of new, from the city of Cabilis, seek to conquer and destroy all they see.  First Kunark, then Norrath as a whole.  They fear, for the gods have left us all, and hope to bring Cazic-Thule's notice back to us all.  You must help us keep this city standing, this forest living, and those remaining undisturbed dead here, undisturbed, and resting properly.  If we are able, we shall lay those of you we can to rest properly, that you may finally find the afterlife you deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ya, his words were many, and his breath long, but it got the point across.  The Shameness watched Undeen a long time, as if judging his words, then nodded slowly.  &quot;You are a practisssced courtier, Elf.  And you know what we sssseek, and are willing to attempt to grant it to us.  I sshall accept your requesst.  Torsis will houssse you and your'sss.  We sshall attempt to fight off the Iksssar, and protect the jungle, and our home.  find your'sss, and return with them to this spot.  I will be waiting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Undeen stood and bowed his head.  &quot;Norrath thanks you, Shameness.&quot;  He turned to leave, while she seemed surprised that not only could he tell she was female, as many non-Iksar can't tell easily, but also that she was a shameness.<br>
<br>
&quot;We do thissss not for Norrath, but for Torsis.&quot;  With those words, Undeen was gone, to find the group once more, and hope the Barbarian was with them by now...<br>

It was a massive complex ((never been there, tell me if my description is too far off)), with the putrid stench of undead coursing through the whole of it. The unnaturality of so many zombies and reanimated corpses sent shivers up Brutus's spine, even with the spirits flowing through his body, empowering every movement. Yet, for some reason...<br>
<br>
They weren't attacking.<br>
<br>
As Brutus wielded his battle spear, laced with temperal energy, and prepared to skewer a skeleton that faced him, he realized that its cold, dead eyes stared with malice to the area behind him. &quot;Odd...&quot;<br>
<br>
With an eye on the undead- well, both eyes, and only in the one direction he can face at once- Brutus conjured up a corporeal shell to house the spirit of his wolven companion. The canine was as battle-hardened as he, and bristled at the sight of its natural enemies, the undead. Just before the bones started crunching, Brutus stretched out his hand, and commanded a halt. The wolf was still snarling in hardly controllable rage, but it walked back to Brutus's side. They made their way deep into the complex, the wolf continually brushing against Brutus's leg for reassurance.<br>
<br>
Intuition led him into moldy corridors that stank of disease and pestilence. Stagnant ponds with black scum stains decorated the decaying architecture, bugs nearly bathed the barbarian, and rot threatened to take over his entire body. Shrugging it off like so many insignificant needles, Brutus finally made his way into a room where he found Undeen with Tani close by, Derren acting out his childish feline tendencies, and Nallu drinking in the scenery, as if studying everything even in the midst of all this... death.<br>
<br>
Brutus was still edgey, and grabbed Tani as gently as he could- which wasn't very- and leveled a spear at the undead creature Undeen seemed to converse with. &quot;It's all roight, li'l un, me wolfy an me er 'ere to bail ye out.&quot; He turned to Undeen with positive rage in his voice, &quot;I'll cleanse em o' undeath as we run! BLAST tha hagg, let's move!
