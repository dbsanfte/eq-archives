<br>
Chapter 11<br>
<br>
&quot;Hero's Return.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Here we go folks, the revision everyone's been waiting for, this is where the battle really heats up and I hope my new writing talents can help it become even hotter!<br>
<br>
<br>
Xernoss smiled down at Azia and Rita, his attack was perfect, no one could stop him from killing them. The ungod Zebuxoruk was completely drained of what little powers he had and Selena and Daxster where to busy pulling the wounded from the field and fending off the Qeynos City gates from undead to reach their fallen comrades in time. It seemed that all was over until Azia and Rita both disappeared from view, something or someone had saved them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xernoss your a coward for not fighting someone of your same level!&quot;<br>
<br>
That voice, it was the same voice he'd heard in Greater Faydark, Xernoss began looking around frantically and found the source. It was Shoken, and he was holding both Azia and Rita up. It was thought impossible for anyone to return from the dead after having been gone for so long, yet he had indeed returned. This time he appeared to be different though, something was missing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jerk it's about time you showed up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well better late than never right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rita smiled as Shoken and Azia bickered back and forth, there was hope now. With Shoken here they now stood a chance, more so than they did before, but she could sense he was different. There was something that she felt was missing from him, though she was unsure just what it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rita I'm sorry, but Ryo's...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know Shoken....&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken couldn't explain it, Ryo was no longer with him, no longer part of him. It felt strange, somehow more alone and empty. He had managed to put up with Ryo so long and had never dreamed he would be separated from him, yet now he was. It was as if a brother of sorts had been taken out of his life, never to return.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well boy it looks like you came back just to meet death again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You forgot about me Xernoss...&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken glanced up above Xernoss and smiled, Ryo was levitating high up above Xernoss. It was obvious he was angry, far more infuriated than ever before. This was the Ryo everyone feared, he was possessed by nothing but the rage he felt for Xernoss. In truth he had a very good reason for being so angry, it was the fact his friends had been threatened with death.<br>
<br>
&quot;You tried to kill her...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, and you can't do anything about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Want to bet on that?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo glared down at Xernoss and then dropped down like a rock, colliding with Xernoss and driving both himself and Xernoss down to the cold hard earth below them. A split second later Ryo stood back up and jumped away, coming to a rest beside Shoken. It appeared as though his strength as well as abilities had some how strengthened since everyone had seen him last.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Shoken, are you ready to deal Xernoss the punishment he deserves?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course... Exodus it is your duty now to protect Azia and Rita here from harm.&quot;<br>
<br>
- I understand Masters... -<br>
<br>
With that Shoken set Azia and Rita down as the hilt came to life and created a small barrier around the two women. By this time Xernoss had already gotten to his feet, he was surprised that anyone could move as fast as he could, let alone do this to him. These where definitely the two he had fought from before, but he never expected that he would have to fight them both at the same time. Not only that, but they didn't share the same body now, which made things that much more puzzling.<br>
<br>
&quot;You won't defeat me! Your both fools.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think we can beat you, isn't that right Ryo?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right. By the way, Shoken I think it's your turn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken smiled and then rushed forward, lunging out with a fist that connected right on Xernoss's chin. However, his very next attack was countered with one of Xernoss's own fists causing shock wave that caused the few undead around them to scatter. It was now apparent that both Shoken and Ryo where fighting beyond the limits anyone had seen from them before. <br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk was amazed, with each attack both Shoken and Xernoss where growing stronger. All he could do was hope that the amulet around Xernoss's neck was damaged enough to give Shoken the edge. The ungod knew full well this was not the full extent of the stolen powers that Xernoss had came to possess.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's time I showed you just what kind of power I really have!&quot;<br>
<br>
What Zebuxoruk feared was had come true, Xernoss had surpassed Shoken, and in doing this he sent Shoken reeling across the ground with a glowing fist to his chin. All Ryo could do was shake his head, Xernoss had called their bluff. If anything at least they still had a fighting chance left, especially with Ryo still there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like its my turn!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo flew forward and shoulder rammed Xernoss to the ground, only to have himself kicked up into the air afterwards. Xernoss smiled as mana surged into his palm and then erupted upwards in a bolt towards Ryo. He thought there was simply no way anyone could avoid this assault, though he was about to find out he was wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken leapt up into the air and shoved Ryo out of the bolts path, of course Ryo wasn't to pleased with this latest action. He never did take to receiving anyone's help to well. This held truth most especially when he never asked for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't need your help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you got it anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the two could react though Xernoss had rushed them. He had caught them both by the head and shoved them down to the ground, forcing their heads down into the cold earth. It was then that Azia grasped the Exodus in her hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you help me save them, Exodus?&quot;<br>
<br>
- I was ordered to protect you two women. -<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you don't help me save them then we won't be protected will we?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sword thought for a moment, what Azia said made sense, but was it what its masters really wanted?<br>
Would doing this truly be protecting them. The Exodus could sense Ryo and Shoken slipping away from consciousness, so it made its decision. This was the only thing it felt it could do to save the situation from becoming much worse than it already was.<br>
<br>
Azia smiled as the sword came to life in her hands as a white mana blade formed from the hilt. That was all she needed as she rushed Xernoss from behind, bringing the blade crashing down across his back. This in turn cause him to release Shoken and Ryo, but at the cost of incurring his wrath.<br>
<br>
&quot;You little bitch.... Now you and your friend will die there!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss slapped her away, and pointed two mana filled palms towards Azia and Rita. The resulting explosion shook the ground with enough force to cause the deepest tunnels in Blackburrow to collapse. After the dust cleared though Azia and Rita where barely alive at best, the Exodus had managed to shield them from most of the destructive power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shoken! Ryo! Quit holding back, if you don't use your full potential then they'll all die!&quot;<br>
<br>
The ungod Zebuxoruk was pleading, there had to be more than just this. He was certain both of them had enough power to destroy Xernoss, to make matters worse the Exodus had lost nearly all its power shielding the last attack. It knew full well it couldn't shield them from another attack of such magnitude. <br>
<br>
- I'm sorry Masters, I've no power left to defend them with.... -<br>
<br>
Ryo slowly began to stir, his eyes scanning the destruction that Xernoss had brought upon the people who had befriended him, and Rita. Something inside him snapped as he stared at Rita's battered and broken body, the only person he cared about was now nearing death. It was then that Ryo's mind collapsed in on itself, he felt he had nothing at all to lose now.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now its your turn!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss pointed his hands at Ryo and unleashed the same kind of bolt of mana that had crippled Rita and Azia so badly, and all Ryo did was nothing but stand his ground. Xernoss simply smiled as the explosion engulfed Ryo and Shoken. What happened next certainly wasn't what he had expected, in fact it was beyond comprehension.<br>
<br>
&quot;No more!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo screamed out as power began to flow through his tortured body, he had taken the full assault of Xernoss's attack, leaving Shoken unharmed. This all had served as the catalyst to setting off Ryo's unimaginable rage. Then he began to slowly walk towards Xernoss, tears flowing from his eyes and down his cheeks.<br>
<br>
It was then that Xernoss made a foolish move, he threw a punch only to have it caught by Ryo's own hand. Shoken's father smiled as he caught a glimpse of Shoken standing up, this was going to be a battle that Xernoss wouldn't survive. The old man knew full well that if both of them where to become angered enough that they would definitely stop holding back.<br>
<br>
Before Xernoss could react Ryo was on the attack, and it was taking all Xernoss had to defend himself from the blows he was receiving. Though he was blocking the attacks, the power that they had was beginning to tear through his body. It was as if Ryo's fists where some how sliding through Xernoss's defense and landing directly on his body.<br>
<br>
- Hurry up Shoken... I can't keep this up for much longer!-<br>
<br>
Shoken held out his hands, palms together as he was gathering the precious energy he needed. He was going to put all he had into this one last attack. During this time Ryo was beginning to falter, his attacks where slowing down and losing their force. Ryo knew full well it wouldn't be much longer before Xernoss would be on the offensive once again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Burning out already? What a fool!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xernoss managed to slip an attack in that sent Ryo skidding across the ground on his back. He was tired, his muscles had been pushed far past their limits, all he could do was wonder how come he wasn't dead now. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Shoken spread his hands, he had done his part, he had bought Shoken the time to gather the power needed. Though he didn't have any idea of just what Shoken had planned, he knew for certain that with the time he had given him, it was going to take a lot out of Xernoss just to counter it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Celestial Wake!&quot;<br>
<br>
In an instant a condensed orb of energy formed between Shoken's palms, then shot off in a beam towards Xernoss. Only he had managed to send out a bolt of mana which collided with the energy midway. The fight had now turned into a battle between who had the most power as mana and energy struggled to overtake one another. The ground around near the collision area was beginning to smolder from the massive amounts of heat the two opposing forces where exerting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid, you thought you could kill me?! I'm invincible! No one can defeat me!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was taking everything Shoken had to keep Xernoss's attack at bay, each time he tried to force the attack back his own attempt was counteracted with the same amount of force. Finally he thought of what the void had said to him before he had returned. He had a final chance to save everyone, and he was going to take it, no matter the consequences it had on himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't hold back anymore Shoken, just kill him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo was up and had managed to move behind Shoken, a sinister smile on his face as he had an idea of what Shoken was going to try next. It was then that an eerie incandescent aura formed around Shoken's body. He was doing what no other had the power to try at the moment. Shoken was burning his soul into the raw unbridled energy that he required to finish this off once and for all. It was now all or nothing, and there was no turning back.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's over!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The power of Shoken's Celestial Wake intensified causing Xernoss to slide backwards, his dragging feet creating deep tracks in the ground. Ryo in the meantime had threw up his hands, using what little power he could spare to create a crude shield around their friends. This was the least he could do now, if anything it would partially shield them from whatever was to await.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't be beaten! This is impossible!&quot;<br>
<br>
Those where Xernoss's last words as the mass of energy engulfed his body and the amulet around his neck exploded. The resulting force and counter flow of energy threw Shoken back inside of Ryo's sphere of protection as the earth around them began to turn into pools of magma. It was as if hell itself had somehow come to lay claim to whatever remained of Xernoss as fire and molten rock swirled through the air. <br>
<br>
Selena and Daxster looked on in horror as they seen a flash of light, then felt a rush of heated air run over them. However, their fears where put to rest as a cloaked figure stepped out of a gray portal, helping Zinka and Zolf in the process, soon to follow was Shoken's father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's Azia and Rita?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What we're not important anymore?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo stepped out of the portal, in his arms was the battered and broken Rita. Soon to follow was Shoken, who was carrying Azia, all four of them looked as if they had been to hell and back. The only reaction from Selena and Daxster was that of shock. They thought for a moment that this was a hallucination, it just had to be. They knew that both Shoken and Ryo had died not more than a month ago, they surely knew it was impossible for them to be standing before them now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wouldn't mind calling a cleric for m.....&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken fell backwards causing Azia to topple down onto him, he was out like a light, snoring. Zebuxoruk chuckled, these two people had surpassed even his expectations. Not only that, but the force he had seen earlier was proof that they where a firm match against any god. Though he was confused to how they could get this kind of strength, he was glad that they had attained it. The ungod knew he would be forever in their debt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where the hell did they come from?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't call it hell, more like a big hole of darkness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selena laughed, it was definitely Ryo, no one could be as sarcastic as he could. It seemed to be one of his many unique traits, that and having the foul temper. Though it was confusing, she knew that both Shoken and Ryo where real now. More so puzzling was the fact that they where now two separate people, independent even though their basic appearances where still the same.<br>
<br>
If anything to anyone who seen them now would have thought them to be brothers. The only distinguishing traits where the fact their hair and eyes where different colors. As for personality wise though it would have been easy to tell the two apart.<br>
<br>
The battle was over, and a humble silence was beginning to cover Qeynos as the injured where being treated. Most of the citizens had no idea what stopped the oncoming horde of undead creatures, but whatever it had been they where grateful. It had appeared that the gods had taken pity and saved them from the horrors of death...<br>
<br>
Well enjoy folks and once again I'll be preparing to revise the next two chapters before I get to work on the definite ending of the series. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=11.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=11.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15>Stories by:  Shoken</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
