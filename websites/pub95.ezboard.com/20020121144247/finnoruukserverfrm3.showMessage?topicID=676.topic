(Publishers of Dark Age Of Camelot)  Yes yes, i know i know.. DAoC sucks.. blah blah blah.. well...after the way verant is treating its subscribers as of late... DAoC is a nice refreshing change of pace.  Take the following Update messgae into consideration.  This is from Mark.  THE man at Mythic.<br>
<br>
**************************************<br>
<br>
   &quot;We will be continuing to squash bugs and game imbalances wherever and whenever we find them.  Our #1 priority is a bug-free game.  New content is good but we would rather take a little longer (if necessary) to get in new stuff rather than gloss over what is left behind.  Both the world developers and the programmers are working diligently in improving this most challenging hurdle in developing and operating an MMORPG. For the purpose of brevity (our new content list at the end of this letter is quite long enough) I am not listing these items here. However, better balancing (including enhancements) the Realms and the classes are obviously quite important.  More so then just adding a new exspansion that people have to buy just to see new effects, we plan on making it that all players will see the beauty of our work.. without outrageous upgrades and multiple exspansions purchases&quot;  ~Mark<br>
<br>
*****************************************<br>
<br>
I have been an EQ player for over 3 years... and more and more.. all i ever asked for was a few simple thing... mainly.. FIX THE DAMN MOB PATHING.  Or my second most annoying peev.. FIX BARD ANIMATIONS!  I am sooo sick of seeing a bard running by playing a flute ass backwards or jamming the instrument thru his head, it lost its humor some time ago.  These obvious problems have been in EQ and completely apparent from the very beggining.  Anyone ever die because a Mob waltzed thru a solid concrete wall and killed you?  We ALL have.. and Verant knows it..but instead of QUALITY gaming.. they focus on $$$$$$$ they can make.  Mythic at least is listening to thier players.  And that makes me (and many many others,) incredibly happy.  <br>
     Dont believe me?  look at statistics... 72% of EQ players are currently OFFLINE due to the OUTRAGOUS sytem requirements for Luclin.. not to mention..alot of older video cards are no longer supported by Verant.. forcing many people to spend a small fortune on RAM, GFX Cards and other upgrades.  This, in a word, is nuts.  Everyone with half a brain knows quality gaming can be achieved using todays VERY capable technology.  (Example - Playstation 2) Does that have Incredible GFx?  hell yes (Look at metal gear solid 2) (*DROOL*)  And 98% of peoples current home PC's complete dominate PS2's specs.  yet.. Verant FORCES people to upgrade by no longer supporting certain older GFX cards.  Concern for players?  hardly... more like, concern for Verant/Sony and its partners' wallets.  And how fat they can get them.  Sorry Verant..myself.. and many many others.. arent quite THAT mindless yet.  And Im not even sad to say I sent verant/sony a nice email closely representing this post.  And I am getting rid of my account.  And i encourage you ALL to do the same.. maybe when that current % of players offline or gone from EQ reaches the 90ish area.. Verant just MIGHT start listening to the PLAYERS instead of there wallets.  <br>
<br>
So Long EQ.  Im off to places where my Money (and my opinion) matters and people care about it.  Namely.  Dark Age of Camelot.  DAoC sucks?  I do NOT think so.  EQ sucks?  Maybe.. but i would more accurately state it as, SONY/VERANT SUCKS!  <br>
<br>
<br>
~Umian Ruza<br>
<br>
P.S - Before someone replies and says &quot;Oh look..he doesnt SAY what they will do...&quot;  Allow me to post the END of that update msg&quot;<br>
<br>
1) Climbing and ladders will be added to the game.<br>
<br>
2) You will be able to see arrows and ammo being shot by other players.<br>
<br>
3) Shapeshifting will be added.<br>
<br>
4) Bounty points (for Realm vs. Realm combat) will be added to the game.  As part of this we will also add a Realm Store where you can redeem your points.  We will also convert each character so that Bounty Points are added retroactively to your character based on the Realm Points you have accumulated so far.<br>
<br>
5) A new class of weapon effects will be added to the game for things like flaming swords.<br>
<br>
6) Battlegroups will be added to the game.<br>
<br>
7) We will look at improving the animations for both water and lava.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   New weapon animations for skills will be added.<br>
<br>
9) More unique NPCs will be added to the game.  What we mean by unique is NPCs that require their own special animations/attacks.  These are not NPCs whose type exist already in the game (to which we just add new skins) but whole new types of NPCs.<br>
<br>
10) More skins for NPCs (as separate from above).<br>
<br>
11) Ongoing Realm by Realm, Zone by Zone analysis of all parts of the Realms.<br>
<br>
12) Hibernia will get special attention in order to correct what people perceive it being the &quot;poor stepchild&quot; of the game.  In particular all aspects of the development team will be turning their attention to that Realm (classes, spells, NPCs, dungeons) to improve it and the player's perception of the Realm.<br>
<br>
13) Increased itemization of certain dungeons and outdoor areas.<br>
<br>
14) Addition of Epic Quests to 40th level across all Realms.<br>
<br>
15) Addition of some Epic Quests up to 50th level.<br>
<br>
16) Addition of more non-Epic Quests.<br>
<br>
So, that's the list.  In January we will be turning our attention to housing, server types and horses as well as lots and lots of other stuff.  We have also recently made a decision based on the current workload to plan for our first expansion pack a little later than we had originally considered.  We are doing this so we can continue to show our commitment to our current players in delivering a ton of new content as part of the subscription service.  Rushing an expansion pack out there could have endangered that effort and thus, we are delaying it by a couple of months.  As tempting as it is to get another SKU out, doing so would not be the right decision for Mythic or for the players.&quot; ~Mark<br>
<br>
Ok...im done now.. back to DAoC i go.  Later. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uumianruza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Umian Ruza</A> at: 12/7/01 3:53:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ujerelakoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jerelakoth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#778899>(12/7/01 3:47:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.animationcity.net/gifz/animoon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: And now..a minor rant from a long time EQ player.</span><hr size=1> &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Our #1 priority is a bug-free game&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>

<br>
I happen to disagree with the person who assumes Verrant's priorities are based around screwing the customer.<br>
<br>
Yes, they are certainly trying to make sure they make a profit.  There's nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
But do you think that's what the programmers are thinking about every day they come to work?  Golly, let's find new ways to screw our customers?<br>
<br>
I really doubt it.<br>
<br>
People talk like companies are a thinking (usually evil) entity.  Companies are NOTHING more than the people who work there married to the people who control the purse strings (owners, in some fashion or other).<br>
<br>
There's nothing in this game that strikes me like it was produced by a bunch of money-grubbers.  Is it perfect?  No, absolutely not.<br>
<br>
But it kicks butt on the competition.<br>
<br>
Why do people play Dark Ages?  Well, everyone I've talked to says, &quot;you can make progress without as big a time committment.&quot;  So that's DIFFERENT, not better or worse.<br>
<br>
Some of the people have left DA because &quot;it's too easy&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mob pathing -- yes, it still has problems in a few places.  Bards playing their instruments wrong -- I don't care.  Yes, it looks dumb.  But to fix it, they would have to increase their system requirements even further.  They'd need animations for bards standing still, playing each of the 8 (or whatever) types of instruments.  Then they'd need another set for when the bard is walking with those 8 instruments.  Then another set when the bard is running with those 8 instruments.  That's 24 animations (3 * however many instrument types there are) for one class where every other class gets by with 3.<br>
<br>
For that cost to the system requirements, I don't mind that bards sometimes have the wrong animation.  And it sure doesn't affect game play.<br>
<br>
Could it be better?  Yes, of course.  But if they're going to spend time on stuff, I'd rather they added more quests or fixed real bugs.<br>
<br>
Like the ones they fixed a few weeks ago where you can't fall into a wall anymore when you die.<br>
<br>
EVERY company says they're committed to quality.  Take a look at what Verant has done.  This is an AMAZING piece of software.<br>
<br>
Perfect?  No.  But pretty darned impressive.<br>
<br>
I've told my friends (all of us with roughly 20 years of experience in the software industry) that I consider this the best-written piece of software I've ever seen.  And they all agree with me.<br>
<br>
I guess that's not good enough?<br>

First off, where are you getting your percentage numbers?  Because so far I have seen the servers pretty damn packed where I go during all times of the day and night.  To me it sure doesn't look like 72% of the population is stuck not being able to play.  Also if you can't get your system to run in Luclin then you either a) have a super old system that is VERY out of date or b) don't know how to use a computer and update it.  <br>
<br>
I have 2 systems that I run EQ on so I can dual comp.  My main is a Pent III 1ghz 512megs ram, geforce 2 pro 64 meg video.  Yes that is a good machine that is a year old and it runs VERY smooth.  However I also have a little old Pent II 300mhz 256 megs of ram (recently upgraded cause ram is damn cheap), and a simple ass TNT 1!! 16 meg video card.  And guess what?  My little pent II 300 runs the game (luclin installed) just fine.  I bought 2 expansions the day it came out, and was up and running and playing in the game by 9pm pst.  <br>
<br>
2nd point, you obviosly don't know how computers and how consoles work because comparing a console system to a PC system is apples and oranges.  A PC has to run under a full OS that does many different things, and it is developed to handle those things.  What determines the &quot;graphics&quot; on a computer are the video card.  And if you have ever seen the specs on a video card you will prolly say to yourself &quot;wow those suck hard&quot;.  The new Geforce 3 Ti500 runs at a clock speed of 250mhz, that is slower then my main comp, and it only has 64 megs of DDR ram.  The difference is the chip was specifically designed to do nothing but graphics, it doesnt sit there and worry about an OS backing it up.  If you want a test, take a 1ghz+ machine, and install a simple 2D/3D 8 meg video card into it, if you can find one that is and try to run a 3D game.  I bet you will run at a very low frame rate and the textures will look quite crappy.  Now install a Geforce anything and see how it looks and runs.  Consoles are specifically designed to do nothing but run graphic applications.  The Playstation 2 happens to have a 300mhz main proccessor along with 2! coprocessors, that is why it looks so pretty.  Those chips were designed to do nothing but churn out graphics.<br>
<br>
Lastly If you are still running Win95 then you need to upgrade, just a little FYI, since Windows XP came out microsoft does not consider win95, win98, or even win me a part of its lineup anymore.  They said they will no longer support those products especially win 3.1 and win95.  You can't buy them in stores and you will be hard pressed to get support on them unless you pay a pretty penny.  <br>
<br>
I personally find the expansions (all of them) fabulous.  EQ is the best gaming experience ever for me, and I am a mega game fan.  I have 2X playstations, 1X playstation 2, Dreamcast, Virtual boy, Dreamcast, Gameboys X3 (including advanced), Sega Saturn, NES, SNES and all the goods.  EQ was probably the best thing that happened to me because once I started playing it, I hardly ever bought anymore games.  I got the Dreamcast and about 30-40 games, I got the Playstation 2 and another 30 games or so, but I used to buy 10+ games a month, now I just play EQ and save money.  And remember if you like DAoC so much then stop bitching about EQ on our boards, go make or find a DAoC board and go rave about your game there.   <p>Bumbaz Tanx <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45653">Profile</a> <br> Dakin Drayklore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46166">Profile</a> <br>Saore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46017">Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uumianruza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Umian Ruza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#778899>(12/7/01 8:24:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: And now..a minor rant from a long time EQ player.</span><hr size=1> First off Bumbaz.. lets get one thing straight.  I was most likely playing EQ before you even heard of it.  Ive been a Player since EQ went live.  So dont tell me about this and that.  Second off.  Let me describe MY machine to you.<br>
<br>
Athalon 900 Mhz<br>
256 MB SDRam<br>
S3 pro Ravage KM33 32MB GFx Card<br>
Windows ME<br>
20GB HD<br>
DVD<br>
CD-RW<br>
<br>
Now, smart ass... HERE is my laptop<br>
<br>
Athalon 1.3 Ghz<br>
40 MB HD<br>
NVidia TNT Rage 64 MB Gfx Card<br>
Windows XP<br>
20 GB HD<br>
DVD Rom<br>
<br>
The Desktop i built myself.  So dont tell me i know nothing about comps and how they operate.  I stated valid points and supported them.. and instead of mature responses Like wolfs.. people..no..idiots like you decide you want to start flaming.  I have spent more time in EQ than most people ever will.  Between work and sleep..it was all i did for a long time.. and it was because i was such a HUGE fan i am so sorely dissapointed.  As i stated in my first post, there are so many obvios, annoying bugs that have been around since the beggining.. yet NEVER got fixed.  Another VERY valid point of this..  Mobs and Players &quot;Falling under the world&quot;  been around since DAY ONE... yet nothing has been done about it.  As for the bard animations.. no..you dont have to add a ton of new animations to make most people happy either.  How about adding 3..  one bard playing DRUMS sitting.. standing.. and running.  Hell..i can do it with the proper programs in 5 minutes.  Yet verant is too busy adding new eye candy to hopefully cover up there oversights.  Every single player in EQ knows at least 1 &quot;bug&quot;  And most likely.. has reported/petitioned or sent feedback to a GM about it.. yet, (again, as i stated earlier, READ my post) What has been done about it?  Nothing.  EQ IS a GREAT game.  And ive had many happy memories there.  But sooner or later.. People WILL realize what im saying is true.. Verant is TOO focused on the new.. and not concerned enough with the old.  Anyways.. i dont really give a @#%$ if i get flamed any further.. My points hold up..they cant be disproven.  So in the end.  im right.  Flame away, before to long.. yer gonna realize it too.<br>
<br>
 (Oh ...and as a minor Post script.. Revolutionary game design.. uber graphics.. yet... mobs STILL beat you thru walls.. and can track with 255 skill forever no matter how fast you run.  SoL = New zones, new designs, new quests, new items..same old bugs.)  Someone drop me a line when they decide to fix EQ the right way, and i'll come back so fast it will make yer head spin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br>  Posts: 378<br> <font color=#778899>(12/7/01 9:34:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: And now..a minor rant from a long time EQ player.</span><hr size=1> I gotta agree with the other people here.

Second of all you say you need to spend a small fortune, yet someone posted they are playing with a TNT1 video card.  I'm sorry, I don't consider $100 for a GeForce2 a small fortune.  Nobody was flaming you, they were just questioning your numbers and claims, you seem to be the one wanting to get personal with it.  So that's two of your points you said couldn't be disproven.  Unfortunately you seem to see people disputing your numbers as flames, so I guess add one here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udakindrayklore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dakin Drayklore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#778899>(12/8/01 4:13:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.kscable.com/cyberdyne/images/ghim-face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: And now..a minor rant from a long time EQ player.</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to point out a small addition, since you question my play time and ability.

I know I played it. Gotta love the way those horses run too. And don't forget the feat of the Gods that is walking up a ramp or staircase. And I bet all the ex-EQ players love the way they make Hybernian rangers into Delta Force Snipers, killing opponents in 1-3 arrow shots.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, DAoC has brought alot to the online gaming table. But you aren't going to make your case with cuss words and hostility. And you know what, I doubt anyone cares that you were playing beta for eq.<br>
<br>
EQ is buggy as hell. Verant constantly requires players to upgrade their comp. I did the math. I have spent over $900 on EQ, $2,400 if you count the fact that I had to buy a new computer just to play. I wouldn't trade it though, I enjoy/enjoyed my time here. You obviously haven't.<br>
<br>
You don't like EQ anymore? Fine, thats cool, play DAoC. Please leave our community, your stinking the place up.<br>
<br>
By the way, I've been playing on Inny since June of 1999 and I don't recall ever meeting you. I do, thought, remember a &quot;I'm leaving EQ random generator&quot; and buddy, your's looks like it.

Your opinion should ALWAYS be based first on &quot;Am I having FUN?&quot;.  Sounds like DAoC is filling the bill for you there.  <br>
<br>
I too am an old greybeard in Norrath, Gregar being born Mar. 26, 1999.  And I'm a ranger.  There is NO love lost between Verant and I, OR between folks who will post on messages boards about MMORPGS's.<br>
<br>
Yes, Mythic seems to have some very amazing ideas, some amazing new concepts, has addressed a lot of things in EQ that have irritated Norrathians for years.  Top drawer for smoothest launch of any MMORPG.  RVR is a GREAT concept for PVP.  Once I upgrade my PC, I will certainly give DAoC a whirl.<br>
<br>
But I read DAoC message boards too:<br>
<br>
Rogue classes broken from day one.  No visible effort to fix.  They are not the only class saying they are far from complete. <br>
<br>
Mythic has seemed to reverse their &quot;no nerf&quot; stance, at least in actions if not in words.  They have also hopped on the &quot;stealth nerf&quot; wagon a few times.<br>
<br>
Lack of content for the high end.  That includes drops, exp, content in dungeons, and some sort of reward or reason to participate in RVR.   Mythic HAS to address content heavily simply because of the age of their game. <br>
That certainly sounds like a &quot;Ship it now for the $$$, or wait till it will please our paying customers more?&quot; scenario to me.<br>
<br>
In-game or other CS isn't straight from heaven, any more than Verant has ever been.<br>
<br>
Realms and classes were no way even close to being balanced at release.  A &quot;sameness&quot; about the realms, within each realm.  There are no &quot;wows!&quot; like going from Gfay to Perma to DL to Kedge to Unrest to BW to ToFS to CC to Butcher Block.  Realms are being called very small?<br>
<br>
Global &quot;fixes&quot; can, and have, affected other areas or classes that Mythic did not anticipate would be affected.<br>
Some of those surprises are not admitted by Mythic<br>
<br>
They ARE not a non-profit organization, any more than Verant is.  Their spokespeople are no less cryptic and unclear than Verant's, whether that is by design or not.<br>
<br>
Many of their beta testers have said their concerns about problems that Mythic is now willing to call problems were ignored by Mythic in Beta.  These problems still exist according to many.<br>
<br>
There is a LOT more coming from DAoC players on that game's boards.  I've only scratched the surface.  That doesn't come from me.  That's just what I've observed being said by DAoC players on DAoC boards.  Yup, probably a vocal minority.  EQ message boards aren't?<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
I have a problem with doing a DAoC vs EQ, or a Mythic vs Verant.  Why not throw in UO, AC, and AO as well?  <br>
Actually, someone told me yesterday that the folks who stayed in AO are beginning to be pleased with what has been worked on.  Each has strengths, each will have weaknesses.  Each will have things that bring a broad smile to your face, or things that make you grind your teeth.  EVERY complaint I have seen on an EQ board seems to have a doppleganger on a DAoC board.  Actually, the DEV boards for DAoC at the vault recently look VERY much like the old official EQ boards did in the early days.  There are NO complete, balanced, problem-free launchs of either games or expansions in MMORPG's.<br>
That's a holy grail or an urban myth.<br>
<br>
I will definitely give DAoC a whirl.  But, I won't compare apples and oranges.  I won't be owned by Mythic, any more than I am by Verant.  If they both still give me FUN, I will certainly split my playtime.<br>
<br>
That said, there are NO wrong opinions.  If DAoC and Mythic bring a smile to your face, that is absolutely great!  Enjoy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I started with a Voodoo5 and was able to play fine at 1024x768 on daoc.  I started playing Luclin and found my card wasn't nearly powerfull enough.<br>
<br>
I put in a Geforce 3 ti200, then found my memory wasn't near enough. (256) so I put it to 640 meg.... I feel that even *this* isn't enough.<br>

So for me....  the minimum machine that I would feel happy playing luclin with is:<br>

 I see your running Windows ME with Athalon processors... would you also happen to have an ASUS Motherboard? A7V?<br>
<br>
If so - go into your BIOS - switch your System Performance setting from Optimal to Standard. Solved my problem right away. Also disable fastwrites.<br>
<br>
I was frustrated as well - however now that my system is running EQ SMOOTH AS HECK - I'm stoked! Lovin SoL (even though 2 days ago was irritated as hell).<br>
<br>
SoL Pushes systems pretty hard (lots of Polygons to make those b00bs!) you may want to look a little closer at your system before blaming Verant. <br>
<br>
Remember - I was in the same boat as you 2 days ago.  <p><center>
