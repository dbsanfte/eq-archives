You see, I've had my monk FD in PoF monitoring for the Shissar spawn for the last several days.  I just leave him there and go afk for hours during FiF/FFA days and check back every once in a while to see if the thing has shouted lately.  There's actually 3 of us that have been doing this, and Zendareth (my monk) hasn't even stood up in 36+ hours.<br>
<br>
So get this, I fall asleep for a couple of hours and come back to my system to see what's up.  I start scrolling through about 1000 'you are out of food and drink' , 'you are hungry' and 'you are thirsty' messages, see that CT has been yelling lately and that's about it.  Then I see a tell from Zatharas.  Zatharas tells you, &quot;Why'd you just train Meslow?&quot;  This was followed by, Meslow tells you, &quot;I'd appreciate it if you'd /q so that you don't train me again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Having missed whatever moronic deeds they obviously brought upon themselves, I send a tell to Meslow, 'Hey man, I'm really sorry you got trained, but I've been afk.'  Meslow goes into some BS about watching me do it, which is really quite laughable since I haven't even been awake (which I explained to him).  I asked him for his GM so that I might set the record strait, since I've got a witness that's been FD right next to me all day.  Meslow tells me that he is the GM and he is the one to talk to.  I let Meslow know that's pretty sad, but okay.  Moron still doesn't believe me, and says that I must have had some really bad ghosting.  I use a low end system for that account but that's gotta be the worst ghosting I've ever heard of, since I was FD and afk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
I then tried to let Zatharas know the truth, but this guy won't listen to me either, so there you go.  I then gave Meslow the name of my witness and the name of my GM and left it at that, okay I'm leaving it at this really.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, but I hate being accused of things that are against my being.  I've never intentionally or even unintetionally trained/KS'd/or anything like that to anyone in the game.  Take that back, I did unintentionally train a group in ME once recently, and I apologized to them for it.  That's about it to my knowledge.<br>
<br>
So whatever, I was still a little PO'd when I logged so I decided to leave a minor rant.  That's what this is for right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p style="line-height: 10%"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40436">

FiF is defined as First-In-Force. This means that the first group to assemble sufficient force -- which is defined as 18 people -- owns the zone just as if it were a scheduled event. <br>

As long as you're off the subject I'll clarify for you.<br>
<br>
A) They didn't have 18 people when I got back hell they weren't even close.<br>
B) I wasn't there anyway, hard to /q while afk, but they could have petitioned and forced me out, which they did not do.<br>
C) It was an FiF day, so there was no scheduled raid, nor was there one the 2 days prior.  LoD took over the zone, and they had no problems with my being there afaik.  So I broke NO rules what so ever.<br>
<br>
So, while your quotes etc are informative and correct, your observations are way off, but I didn't give you all the facts so that's okay.  I never said anything in my statement about whose right it was to be there or that I refused to leave even, but since you bring it up, there's the breakdown on that.

Strange, since I didn't have the afk tag on the whole time.  Ask your buddies, Meslow and Zatharas, they got no afk messages on their tells.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know anyone from DoW, is your whole guild like this?  Making up stories when they don't know what's going on?  Better stick to the facts man, not fiction.  I'm fairly confident that your guild isn't entirely stupid.  I was in the plane on Tuesday night when you had about 10 people there kind of playing around and I thought it was great.  I didn't bug you then, why would I decide to do it now?  Fact: you didn't see me do it, because I wasn't there.  I was on the North wall, never moving.  Just because you guys are apparently not quick enough to figure things out as they happen, doesn't give you the right to do a /who and make FALSE accusations at the most likely target.  I've got my own place, and my girlfriend wasn't here, so... do the math.<br>
<br>
Can't say I'm surprised though, since it was handled poorly to begin with (by your people, and my not being there didn't help), it would have taken some courage to admit a mistake in identity was made.  Something you obviuosly know nothing about.<br>
<br>
Slenda- maybe I'm jumping around a bit, my only real problem was just being falsely accused of something.  You make a good point, and I'll be careful to abide by those rules should the need arise.  I'll go ahead and log off when I'm not going to be at the terminal for more then 15 minutes at a time just to avoid such issues that I really had no way of foreseeing.  At any rate, I keep myself out of the plane during the days that are reserved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoderrybadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oderry Badgerclaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 4:01:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clanbadgerclaw.homestead.com/files/face.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Not to take a side on whether you trained DoW or not, but it seems that DoW has the right to ask you to leave the zone, regardless of whether you trained them, or they did it themselves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I can't vouch for anything else, but I can tell you that I didn't see him when I poked around, and he wasn't on tracking from the west wall camp.  In other words, I tend to believe his story -- if there was some training going on, it was probably someone else.<br>

The GM isn't going to boot him out, as he's not doing anything wrong in Verant's eyes.  He's FD'd across the zone from them, for crying out loud.  Verant doesn't recognize our Summit.<br>
<br>
DoW was having a horrid time up there.  I know -- I had a guildmate along with them.  And a friend in the Vigil group that tried to help.  As I understand it, CR was over 3 hours and a total mess.  I think at the time this guy was getting told off, DoW could NOT say they were FiF.  I don't think anyone would recognize 40 corpses as sufficient force.<br>
<br>
But even if they WERE up there -- I don't think the summit rules considered someone doing what these guys are doing -- FDing well clear of where anyone goes, watching for a specific mob.  Could you ask him to leave?  Yes, you could.<br>
<br>
Would it be reasonable for you to do so?  Well, let's just say that I personally wouldn't think of someone who quotes rules in such a petty fashion.<br>
<br>
He's not killing mobs, he's not moving, he's just there FD'd.  Harmless.  Leave him alone.<br>
<br>
Folks, we all know how chaotic the planes can be.  We've all seen problems up there.  It's quite easy to point fingers in the wrong direction.<br>

<br>
Wolfypaw , you're an idiot.  nobody was claiming the corpses were holding the plane for us.  we were there first and your guild mate is the one that trained us the first time.  he got scare ported from zone in and brought about 50 friends to west camp with him where he ran in circles screaming &quot;GET THEM OFF ME GET THEM OFF ME~!!!&quot;  so what do we do when Vigil shows up?  we offer them the plane cuz we dont feel like doing a naked CR.  Vigil zoned in with one group which consisted of 1 bard , 1 cleric , a monk and no tank like the group of total @#%$ retards they are and naturally they die.  last patch VI added like 10 scareling around the portal.  one enchanter has a hard time with that many scareling let alone a group of idiots with a bard kiting @#%$ all over the plane.<br>
<br>
so what do we do when we see these incompetent jackasses at their bind points?  we buff our naked asses, i trained mobs away from portal to North Camp , everyone zoned in and looted their clothed corpses and got ready to fight while i made circles in NW corner.  well lucky us Xcreeping in all his <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> maggotness</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> never /q'd from their first asskicking and what does he do?  in all his infinite gimptarded lamebrained wisdom he stands up and trains us again.<br>
<br>
now we're all like &quot;yay <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bleep</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->tards training us , we shoulda just went to Hate.&quot;  by this time we just want our @#%$ and we want to get out.  so what do we do?  we offered to go in with Vigil and get our @#%$ and go.  Vigil wants to try again so what do we do?  we let Vigil try again.<br>
<br>
Zechs had already FD and /q and come back and FD again in the plane before they zoned in again.<br>
<br>
Zechs tells the guild, &quot;LOL their only warrior is Sacel and when he gets aggro he runs around telling everyone to taunt hahahahahahah&quot;<br>
<br>
yay we buffed again!  same groups!  zoning in!<br>
<br>
/who<br>
(60 King @#%$) Xcreeping &lt;Bunch of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bleep</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->tards&gt;<br>
<br>
You tell Xcreeping, 'if your @#%$ ass stands up and trains us i swear i'll find where you live and @#%$ your wife while you're at work.'<br>
<br>
YAY IT&quot;S TARA COME TO SAVE THE DAY!<br>
<br>
/who Tara<br>
(58 Stupid <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> #$%$</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) Tara &lt;Bunch of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bleep</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->tards&gt;<br>
<br>
what do you know?  Tara has friends~!<br>
<br>
a scareling backstabs you for 468<br>
You say, 'i @#%$ hate you people'<br>
Tara died.<br>
<br>
so Vigil zones in another time.....<br>
<br>
Zechs tells the guild, 'haha i think they might make it'<br>
<br>
that's when Meslow zoned in and targeted you as you ran by him with 3 scareling and a decrepit warder.  i dont give Vigil much credit , because after all , they're totally @#%$ stupid gimp @#%$ , but i wouldnt doubt your @#%$ ass didnt train them to keep us both out of the plane cuz you thought your guild could beat us to Shissar cuz you thought it was spawning that night.<br>
<br>
enter LoD.<br>
<br>
they zone in , portal has like 15 less mobs than it had before , they have the plane including CT dead in like an hour and a half and we all had our corpses.  they were rezing us left and right and killing 20 things at the same time.  Quirk even stayed for the CT kill.  so i'll end this with a thank you to LoD for dragging us out of Fear.  Arsenic knows how hard that is for me to say.  =(<br>

The Geneva Convention is also not  enforced, in the same sense.  However, there are good reasons for abiding by the summit notwithstanding.<br>
<br>
My point, which I did not expressly state, is that when things go wrong, it is quite likely (and almost natural) to suspect someone lurking in the zone may have caused an unexpected event to occur EVEN IF THAT PERSON IN FACT DID NOTHING WRONG (wrong is used in the sense of causing the events which lead to the problem).  For example, if someone aggrivates a named mob, can it not cause the whole zone to go crazy (for example, Tunare).  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I don't really mean to interject any other opinion here, other than to say that being in the zone like that invites exactly the situation that occurred.  It probably would have been better to inform all in the zone what you were doing before the accusations even start.<br>
<br>
Sorry if anyone took offense to that.<br>

Vigil messed up, they got you killed, and you chastise them. I know for a fact that if you had screwed up like that and gotten a bunch of Vigil killed they would not have taken the same road you did. Please go look in a dictionary and look up the term &quot;immature.&quot; You just might find the acronym DoW next to it.<br>

<br>
here's some tips for you next time you want to be &quot;the better person&quot; you stupid @#%$.<br>
<br>
1.  never do what i do and insult a large group of people just for shits and giggles to see what their reaction is.  makes you look stupid and immature , not to mention you're probably one of the retards i was talking to so i dont even give a @#%$ what you say half the time anyway.<br>
2.  never assume you know more than you do because fact is you're a complete retard who needs his mommy to wipe his ass and should be drove to school on the short bus. <br>
<br>
IN CLOSING~!  fact is we werent in the same situation as Vigil because we never do what Vigil did.  we dont train people in the planes , we stay out if they're breaking the plane.  no room for error = no error. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 11:58:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sorry DoW!</span><hr size=1> Kaurik remember what Poncho says:<br>
