<br>
The people dying in the WTC bothered me no more then the people killed in a bus bombing in Israel.  The people dying in the WTC bothered me no more then the Marines that died in the Beirut bombing (actually I could relate to the Marines more then I could the accountants).  The fact that those people died doesn't disturb me any more then it did when Randy Weaver's wife was killed by federal agents.  Or when those people died in Columbine.  Or Waco.  Or the tens of thousands that Pol Pot, or Stalin, or Hitler, or Mussolini killed.  Or the girl in this news story.  Or the people of Kuwait.  Or the civilian people of Afghanistan, or the Sudan, or through the corrupt policies known as Apartheid.  Or the people in Bosnia, or the Native Americans at the hands of the settlers.  The people in North Korea, or Iraq, or in Oklahoma city.  Or Ted Bundy's victims for that matter.  <br>
<br>
I love my country and believe I served it with honor.  But to lament about the loss of American lives and ignore the other losses of life would make me in my psyche truly heartless.  So what do I do?  Do I sit and cry over the American lives lost, while by ignoring the losses of life in the rest of the world spit on the graves of anyone not American?  Or do I treat all of these lives equally important?  I choose to treat them all equally.<br>
<br>
So, how do I cope with all of the loss of life?  I can sit in the corner and cry about how unfair life is.  Or I can accept that death and cruelty are part of this world, and while I can help where I can, accept that this will happen.  To shed tears for those people who died untimely in this suicide attack and not miss a beat when an Israeli or a Palestine dies to me is unthinkable and inhuman.  It is not my call to judge the worth of another persons life.  I accept that death is the way of this world, and with that acceptance I feel no need to grieve over someone I do not know.  Remember, I feel that you cry for the living, not for the dead.  And since none of these people were part of my life, I have no reason to cry for what I would miss about them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 9:48:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> I understand now, I think.

Americans: Here's a picture of my wedding.  Here's me and my hon.  Here's a picture of the bridal party.  Oh, and our wedding was ruined by someone writing a dirty limerick on our wedding book.<br>
<br>
A couple in Israel tonight: Here's a picture of my wedding.  Here's a picture of me and my hon.  Here's a picture of the 6 people's coffins who died at our wedding.  Here's a picture of the other 20 people taken to the hospital.<br>

Let me also say this you compared my funeral/wedding book analogy with terrorists attacks in Israel.  I still wouldn't scribble graffitti in someone's guest book it has nothing to do with comparative morality just respect.<br>

Your perspective is different than some others Ugle.  I posted my sympathies because I read a story about a young girl who was robbed of life, and she and I shared a common hobby, that being EQ.  In my mind, all I could picture was this girl playing EQ with her friends, dueling another guildie until her father walked into the room and shot her!  That made my heart ache.<br>
<br>
When I read a local newspaper and learn that some child had gasoline poured on him and torched to death by other children, my heart aches and I sometimes have tears come to my eyes when I read about these event.  Why?  I don't know and often I don't like it and am embarrased by it.. but that is me, and that is part of what makes me a unique individual.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, I believe that many of us don't understand your original post Ugle because we don't understand where you are comming from completely (or speaking for myself, I do not FEEL where you are comming from), and perhaps you don't know where I am comming from.  I was simply expressing somthing from my heart cause I am a person that needs to express feelings.<br>
<br>
Finally, my contributions to society are that in which you would EXPECT from a fellow human, and more.  For you to even challenge all the posters without knowing them is very shallow of you and was the only part of your post that I take exception to.  <br>

If you had said 'insult', while that is also arguably true, insult would mean that the only reason for the statement was to offend.  'Challenge' would imply that I was trying to goad people into doing more, so it at least was somewhat effective, because subconsciously or not you saw it for what it was.  Inflammatory would be a better choice of words I think then shallow, but since most people won't face things until they get slapped with them, I wound up.<br>

I tend to agree with Ugle, in that I undersatnd what he's saying. I get the feeling he doesn't quite see the whole picture. I think I do, but am virtually incapable of explaining it. It seems to be like the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything; you can know the answer, or you can know the question, but not both.<br>
<br>
First, I'm glad Ugle was asked that about the WTC, because it's been galling me a bit. All this sympathy and attention for the people who died at the WTC, far less for those who died at the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania. But still more than for the guy who's driving down a lonely highway at 10 at night, trying to hurry home to have a late supper with his wife and maybe kiss his kids before they have to be in bed, and is blindsided by a drunk driver, or a jackknifed tractor-trailer, or simply falls asleep and drives over an embankment. For some bizarre reason, we're all more outraged that 3,000 people died together than when 1 person dies all alone. <br>
I was outraged at the attacks, myself. But I was outraged because the WTC was destroyed, and because a hunk of the Pentagon was gone, and because our military might have been impaired, and because hundreds of individual people died because they were denied their 2nd Amendment rights. Someone pist in my face, and being human, I became outraged.<br>
And that may be the part Ugle is missing.. what is evil? Well, is it evil when soldiers shoot each other on the battlefield? Is it evil when a serial killer slowly strangles his victim with a towel just because it thrills him to see the eyes bulge as life leaves them? Are these two the same? Of course not.<br>
Is it evil when a wasp stings a spider to paralyze it, and leaves eggs to hatch and feed on the still living body? Horrible, yes, but not evil. <br>
I once watched a Nat'l geographic where a male lion chased down, killed, and ate the offspring of his new mate, fathered by another lion he'd defeated. Monsterous? It would seem so, but it's the savage battle of the genes in action. By doing so he makes more lions like himself, and less lions like his defeated foe, thus shaping the course of feline evolution.<br>
<br>
The universe was either created, or sprang into being, or has always existed, with a set of basic laws... thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc. As a result of these laws, life takes certain patterns. Those lifeforms just do what they can to survive, without moral restraint. Those who survive to reproduce, flourish. Plants can survive without killing anything else... but they do compete with each other for nutrients and space. Higher life forms have to feed on the living, even if it's only plants. And plant eaters are unlikely to evolve to higher intelligence. Social (pack, tribe, etc) predators seem to evolve the highest intelligence. And only intelligent creatures worry about right and wrong, good and evil.<br>
<br>
So what is evil? Heinlein observed that sin lies only in harming others unnecessarily. Harming yourself isn't a sin, it's just stupid. I would go a step further, and suggest evil is harming others for the sake of one's appetites. Ugle is wrong in saying that people who hurt others for the pleasure of inflicting suffering are merely weak. They are evil. Deer hunters could be shoved into this category... but note that part of the ethic of such hunters is the 'clean kill'. A friend once gave up bowhunting deer after he had to track one for 2 miles to finish it. Such hunters take pleasure in the competition with their prey, not in its suffering.<br>
<br>
Am I evil because I feel no pity for the Afghan people? Perhaps, but I don't think so. It's not because I don't know them. It's because I understand that, by the laws of the universe, they have laid their own path. Unlike most other lifeforms, Afghans have intelligence, as do Americans. They make choices as individuals and as tribes, and as a whole. They are not poor and starving and repressed because I am sitting at a computer in the middle of America, well-fed and warm. Their suffering is in no way my fault, and therefore, why should I feel pity for them? Like the old joke, &quot;doctor, it hurts when I do this, what should I do?&quot;... &quot;Don't do that&quot;. Somewhere in Africa, as I type, a gazelle is being pulled down and eaten by a pack of jackals. Should I feel pity for the slow, or sickly, or dumb, or unlucky gazelle? Is it somehow my fault the jackals caught it? As far as the universe is concerned, it is just evolution in action, and is in fact, A Good Thing, not evil.<br>
As with Afghanistan, and the American aborigines, it's evolution in action. I'm glad the europeans settled the N. American continent; from a standpoint of human evolution, it was a good thing, in spite of the suffering involved on the part of the aborigines (oh, and just because the europeans won, as a whole, doesn't mean that millions of them didn't suffer as individuals in the process!)  It wasn't the first time such happened; earliest evidence of such a conflict was the neanderthal's vs. the homo sapiens. <br>
<br>
Sympathy must be tempered with rationality. One day while I was watching television, about to eat a candy bar, a commercial came on showing starving children in some 3rd world hole. I started to set the candy bar down, sickened. My father had just come home from work (construction work,) and was outraged. Rightfully so. *I* had done nothing to cause the suffering of those children. *He* had done his part to provide me with the candy bar; he worked hard, all day; he paid taxes; he voted; he served in the military of his nation honorably. He was in part responsible for the prosperity that allowed me to enjoy a candy bar in front of a television set. Now that I'm middle-aged, I can munch on down on a candy bar while the scenes of deprevation flash across my screen. Am I heartless and evil? (well, probably, but not because of this...) No, I just know that their suffering is not my fault, their relief not my responsibility, and that my candy bar wouldn't make a darn bit of difference. I can feel sympathy for their suffering, but I can be rational enough to know that it is largely their own fault; I can be rational enough to know that my candy bar is mine not by luck but by my efforts. I can be rational enough to know that the scumbags putting the commercial on are using them and trying to manipulate me. In fact, if evil exists in this scenario, where does it lie? In the warlords the starving people follow? In my indifference to their plight? Or in the organization that exploits their suffering to milk the fruits of my effort from me to put in their own coffers? For all of my life the starving have existed; I know of no place where any of those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> charities</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has *ended* suffering. Give a man a fish and you've got a dependent. Teach a man to fish and you go out of business.... if you're a charity. <br>
<br>
On a sidebar, one might note that this might be a metaphor for the political spectrum; on the far left you have sympathy without rationality, on the far right you have rationality without sympathy. <br>
<br>
But the United States are my people (I would say &quot;Americans&quot; but based on recent commercials, everyone on the planet but me is an American...) and the Afghans are not. Just as a hunter trying to feed his family can't feel much sympathy with his prey (and the prey attempting to survive can't sympathise with the hunger pangs of his adversary,) I can't feel much sympathy for those in conflict with the U.S. I'm not evil; but they have to lose so mine can win. If hating them makes it easier on me, I can live with that.<br>
