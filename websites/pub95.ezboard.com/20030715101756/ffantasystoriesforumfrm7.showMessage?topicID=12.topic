Considdering I know my own best, I chose mine.  If someone else believes their story to be better, and therefore, the better topic for an RP, please say.  It has come to my attention though, that all RPs but dark dreams are, obveously, dead.  I dont know what was wrong with s'just life.  Maybe we veered from the soul of the actual RP, the fact that it was just s'just life, and then evolved into something else entirely, or any number of factors, BUT the fact remains that it, and many other unfinished RPs are DEAD.  So, heres my propositions:<br>
6 charecters<br>
Rillen-a wizard born in paineel.  Brother to Gerald, he was weeded out of the population of Paineel at a young age for his ineptitude at any of the darker crafts.  As a wizard he was not entirely shuned by his people, but when he chose the agnostic path, they were less than kind toward him.  His friends include hokulani(hoku), Brenan(Bren), Paren(sometimes Par), Ulla, and Forna.  The friends met all met in the warrens.  Rillen, Ulla, Bren, and Hoku had been friends before, but the six became close soon after fighting together.  This is where I would like to start the RP, but it could be anywhere.<br>
Ulla-Rillen's closest friend.  There is a connection between the two beyond friendship, but not quite in the erotic area(yet)  She is a mage of Erudin and sister to Hokulani.<br>
Hoku-Her and Paren start off quite apprehensive towards eachother due to some lued comments made on his part.  Their relationship grows into something beautiful and twisted all in one, although love doesn't blossom until quite some time later.  Both her part and Paren's would be fun to play in my opinion.<br>
Brenan-a cleric of rodcet knife.  He is an erudite of erudin of course.  He met Rillen by saving his life with a heal spell and the aid of his club against a herd of skeletons.  They later met the sisters having a spat over a gem dropped by a kobold.  He is quite alloof, but loves all his friends and will do anything within his power to aid them.<br>
Paren-The drinking halfelvish bard of Qeynos.  He often sings the wrong song for the occasion and rarely thinks about what he says until after hes said it.  He is the most outgoing and friendliest of the six, and this leads him often into trouble.<br>
Forna-A human monk with a wicked kick.  When shes night bonking heads, shes eating like a cow.  She often tries to bring Brenan out because she sees something in him that screams greatness.  Her antics, much as Parens are foolish and comical all at once.  Even in battle she keeps her spirits up and her stomach full.  Well, here you go.  Someone please join, I'm rather bored.  Oh, and the spot of Rillen is NOT reserved by me.  In fact, I'd much rather play another, and if all six spots are taken, you can just join as a random charecter, but it would be better if the original six are taken first.<br>
There also is the charecter of Gerald.  His isn't really one of the friends, but I guess someone could play him.  He is Rillen's brother and a rapidly rising necromancer.  At times, he comes to the aid of the friends, but he can also be jack ass as he laughs at their plight and may refuse help if he isn't in the right mood.   <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/02 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'll take Paren haha sounds like fun</span><hr size=1> Humming a stupid tune that would not leave his head, Paren sat in darkness while he waited for his friends to show up. He scratched his foot as a bug crawled across it. &quot;Blasted bug!&quot; Lifting it off the ground he threw it into the small stream that trickled past him. Continuing to hum the same rediculous song he thought his eyes caught some movement. Sighing out of impatiances, he stood up and stretched. &quot;Where is everyone this morning?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beetle man, Beetle man, doing the things that a beetle can. Walking with one foot and eatting with two, Beetle man, he's gotta shell that looks real new, what would happen if I smashed him with my shoe. Then he'd be beetle goo, bettle man.&quot; Smiling at the small fire beetle run across the ground he stapped it with his long sword. The bug cried out and died. Laughing at his song and his good fortune to have found a stupid bug, Paren looked around again for his friends. &quot;They should have been here ages ago! What could be holding those slackers up!&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rillen@fantasystoriesforum>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/02 6:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Me be Bren</span><hr size=1> OOC (I've decided to be Brenan.)<br>
<br>
As he walked through the small field were the young erudites who wrongly followed cazic thule, Brenan heard the most ungodly song sung by the most beautiful of voices.  It could only be one: Paren.  Why the gods had chosen to 'bless' Bren with the rude bards company, he knew not.  There is a reason for everything though.  Following the tune, Bren found the man for whom he searched.  &quot;Hail Paren.  Tis a beautiful morning, tis not?  Are we the only ones here?&quot;  <br>
&quot;The early worm gets the bird&quot;  Using another tone mimicking his friend, Paren spoke &quot;tis it not so?&quot;  <br>
&quot;I believe it to be the early BIRD gets the worm.  Shall we venture into the warrens to wait?&quot;<br>

Hoku glared at him fiercly. Nothing was more annoying than a bard, espeshally <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bard. Grumbling towards Paren she fake-lunges toward him just to watch him flinch. Unamused by his presence she glances from side to side.<br>

She groans and then takes a seat indian style on the ground next to the two. Finished with her dramatic entrance, she does various things idley. Splits a few blades of grass, twiddles her thumbs, looks around, fiddles with a seam, ect. Breathing a heavy sigh she looks up at Paren. <br>

&quot;It doesn't surprise me why you'll never make it as a musician. Your singing is that of an old bar wench who's missing all but 4 teeth and sounds, as well as looks, like she doesn't belong to either half of the gender, but rather both - a Shim as I like to call them. Only your voice is worse. However now that I think about it... Your voice is like an angel's in comparison to the rest of you...&quot;<br>

With her upper lip upturned, Hoku turned from Paren to Brenan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets have no more talk of such unpleasentries. Now, Brenan. Where do you have us traveling to today? Somewhere less... noisy hopefully&quot;<br>
<br>
All but ignoring Paren, she keeps her eyes locked on Brenan's. He couldn't bother her if she pretended he wasn't there. If only he really wasn't.<br>

His mood changed menacingly.  &quot;And if I hear you sing that Terrible song again, you'll feel the whack of my club against your oh-so-thick skull.&quot;  He chuckled as he smacked his hand with the broad part of his club and resumed his meditation. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/02 5:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Adventures of Rillen and the Gang</span><hr size=1> Somewhat upset that his song did not lighten the mood, Paren muttered to himself, &quot;Only if you can catch me.&quot; and with that he sat down with a hurmp. &quot;This is going to be a long day I just know it.

Paren's eye caught the movement of something in the woods again and he decided that it would be better to go have some fun than to just sitting and humming.

Paren smiled as he watched a beetle move like it were in slow motion. Running he had to keep his concentration up, but it was so hard. Those two he thought to himself as he slowly started to come out of the speed, they just don't understand. If there isn't something to laugh about then the world ain't worth being in. whew. Sighing he was disappointed in his friends. They were always serious, he only wanted to help them learn some humor, and maybe some humility as well. While he slowed to a walk he noticed the shimmering of the thing he saw before. There it is! Selo's! without the words this time, Paren didn't know how fast he'd have to come out of it. Sword pulled, he ran his finger down the blade of his Defiance still sharp, noting that this thing moved faster than he did, Paren also pulled his father's long sword of ethereal energy. This would come in handy he thought. And again selo's pulled him into a speed warp. He hoped this wouldn't take too long so he could get back to his friends.<br>

His skill with his own weapons were not as good as they could be, for he played more than he practiced, but he still could carve the kobolds into pieces. Not understanding what the thing was saying Paren cleared his belligerant mind and focused, he knew almost every documented language in the known world, he should be able to make something out of this. &quot;Damn it, umm... I am Paren, half elf of qyenos, who are you..... ummm...&quot; thinking of nothing else he decided to try a song to calm this creature's eyes. &quot;Hmmmm...... Tonight, there was a gal, who spun with one of my good pals. Her name was Sarah and her friend was Cara, but both of them could dance like they were from Ferra....&quot; Damn it that didn't make any sense, his mind was fogged. He couldn't think of anything to say that could help. Stumped, Paren slowly put his blades away. Maybe he would get further with some pictures.... This could take all day. Paren didn't have all day.

They were on him and his swords rent one in half as the blood sprayed everywhere. Confused as to what was happening he saw the creature fighting the kobolds as well. Tuning his song to differ from hurting everyone to just the kobolds, Paren smiled as the blood ran down the kobolds ears. &quot;Hear it and die filthy creatures!&quot; Saddly his song was not only directed to the kobolds and before he knew it the entire forest so it seemed was fighting him. bats, snakes, beetles. Where were his friends. Screaming at the top of his lungs he yelled for all those allied with him to come to aid his swords. Tearing apart a kobold as Paren changed his song to attack singlely, he was struck in his leg and then his arm and again in the back. Screaming in pain he only wish to die a good death, one that would be make up for all the times he had been scornful to his friends, specially Hoku, she was the target of most of his schemes, but only due to the fact that he liked her the best. Her reactions where the best. He had to make a fight that could make her smile and be proud.

Looking up at the kobold with blood running from his eyes he sang the first song he could think of. The kobold smiled but was soon torn apart. Magic glittered in his eyes. Paren fell on the ground face up. he saw the claws flying and the other fighter still teariing into them. If only his father had taught him to fight with a sword better, or his mother taught him a stronger song. Grunting as another kobold stepped on him considering him no longer a danger Paren looked up at the sky. Leaves, there were so many of them in the dark forest. One he remembered trying to count them, he would just have to again. Feeling his chest torn and his ribs break as a kobold gave it's dying swipe at him he wondered. Where are my friends, I hope to the gods that I had not lost their friendship as well. Swearing he looked back to the leaves. He begged the good spirits to take care of his friends and ward them from this mess. He had not died with the honor he had intetended. As his blood spilled on the ground Paren figured out something, death is death no matter how glorious, death can only end one way. Smiling a wicked smile Paren tried as best he could to lean his head up to see another kobold explode from his directed song. &quot;My young brother! Go I'll guard you're back as well as I can. Run and find my friends, take my sword and make sure they understand that danger is coming! Now Go!&quot; starting his last chords, the one he had learned from his mother before he left home, Denon's Disruptive Discord. Screaming it out as loud as he could and enforicing it and braiding the power with the chords of dissonance, all the Kobolds turned their bleeded ears to his full attention. &quot;To Innorruk with you creatures!&quot; Paren wished it was enough to help the furry creature to get away. The power in the song took all the rest that Paren had and he could not stop the power from hurting himself, and as the blood ran from his own ears, Paren could no longer hear and the tone of his songs only lightened and grew stronger.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bonaki>Bonaki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/12/02 6:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Last stand</span><hr size=1> Hearing a horrible song reverberate through the trees, the stranger smiled as he reconized the song. &quot;Someone must be dying.&quot; he commented to his traveling compainion.
