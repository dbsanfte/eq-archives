Almost as quickly as he appeared, a sash which fell from his waist began to emit shadows, cloaking his presence from those nearby.<br>
<br>
His presence was well known within this city - he was no enemy to those within, however his business was his own, and simple enchantments such as these kept his business from the normal rumor lines.<br>
<br>
He walked quickly through the alleyways towards Harvester Hall, the guards equipped to see him smirked slyly, and nodded his passage on.  He passed the main hall, and instead went to the lounge where those who sought to join the hall stayed.<br>
<br>
The shadows fell from him with a mere thought, revealing the bard fully.  He was not overly tall, his stature muscular and well honed.  His face showed a mere two decades, though his haunted blue eyes seemed as if from a much older man.  His platinum hair was cut short to accomidate a helm, and a simple gotee and mustache surrounded his lips.  White armor clad his body, a very old mandolin graced his back, and two swords sat in their sheathes on his belt.<br>
<br>
He spoke in precise Teir'Dal, his voice clear and somewhat jovial.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Why did the ones before have to make it hard for the ones to come? Falcolas had proven him self, and yet his fate hung in the balance because of another bard. <br>
She hoped that the one she called sis, could see beyond the class, and look into the person Falcolas was. Ahh well, time would tell. And what ever the outcome, she would stand behind her family.

Greetings, Bard,<br>
<br>
i have heard tales about you from Ankhami. She has told me you would seek to become one of the Harvesters. Perhaps she also told you of my views towards your kind. If not, i am sure Kerridwynn has mentioned it.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, your visits brings up memories.. memories i had hoped that would never return. Thoughts of my childhood, and memories of the biggest mistake made. I do not intend to repeat that mistake.<br>

Once i accepted the challenge. Now i deny it. You will not find acceptance or welcome in my words or actions.<br>

Kerridwynn, Demaste, Harvesters.<br>
<br>
I have long considered my application to your hall, after learning of the pain my application has caused.  I understand fully your desire to speak this through, and come up with a solution for the greater good of the family, and I also understand that it is likely that my application would be accepted.<br>
<br>
I am, however, a prideful man, and can not accept that knowing as I do the pain my acceptance would bring, despite any greater good caused by it.  Hence, I withdraw my application.<br>
<br>
This does not change my regard for you in any way, and I hope that I will always be welcome as a guest within your halls.<br>

Until we see each other again,<br>
