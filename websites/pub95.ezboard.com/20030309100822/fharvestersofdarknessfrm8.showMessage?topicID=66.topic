<br>
Vendui Dark One, you requested this note I believe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
<br>
 Silenae's Story This is Silenae's story. She told it to me when we met outside the city of Neriak. Some things she didn't tell me, others I did not ask. If you seek to know more, you will need to seek her out and ask her yourself.<br>
<br>
From what she said, she is the second of three daughters of a wealthy family. All three daughters were well loved by their parents, although the despair at lacking a son to continue the family line was always present during Silenae's youth. Plans were made for all three girls. Needless to say that they were not included in the planning process.<br>
From what she says, her task would have been to become the house wizard. Her education started early, when her parents invited teachers into the house to prepare her for the day when she would be presented as likely candidate for apprenticeship. Those teachers came from all branches of magic, since she was to be schooled well in their various uses and limitations. Without her parents noticing, Silenae was drawn not to wizardry, as desired, but to the dark arts of the necromancers. While her teachers tried to teach her the limitations, she carefully went about to gather all possible information about death magic.<br>
<br>
Years passed, and finally, Silenae reached the age when she was to be apprenticed to the wizards. Yet, on what the family had prepared as her big day, she was pale and cold, seemingly struck down by some odd illness. With the day already ruined, the family decided to wait another year, so that she could become apprenticed with the best possible omens.<br>
<br>
The first half year, she seemed to be docile, following her teachers leads. Then, her wild streak broke through. From one day to another, she abandoned all pretence, and tried to run away, but the undead guardians of the family mansion stopped her in her tracks. Of course this only served to harden her resolve, and she spent the following weeks learning more of the dark arts. Finally, on the birthday of her younger sister, she decided to make another attempt. Her prepared bones in hand, she snuck out past the undead guardians. Finally, she had won her freedom. Once outside, she realized that she had not fled alone. Following in her footsteps was her younger sister, who also felt little inclination to follow the family plans. After discussing their future, Silenae headed straight for the lodge of the dead, and sealed the pact with her dark teachers - a pact her family would not dare to disturb. After yet another time of teaching, the dark masters sent her out into the world, to<br>
make use of her knowledge, and acquire the coin to continue her studies. Right away, she contacted her sister, and spent the following years hunting at her side.<br>
<br>
Silenae had heard of the conclave from the dark masters. They had also told her to contact Kazanti once she thought about joining a larger group, since for her, return to her family was not an option.<br>
<br>
That is about all she was willing to tell. I never asked her about her family name - a look at her eyes as she mentioned running from their mansion was enough to stay that question.<br>
