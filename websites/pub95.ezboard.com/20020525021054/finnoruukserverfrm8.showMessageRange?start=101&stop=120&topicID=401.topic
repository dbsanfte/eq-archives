<br>
I know many people that I could say they are &quot;@#%$&quot; because of there upbringing and needing the &quot;Male Role Model&quot; Or female as it were because there mother/father left did something to them &lt;sexual abuse and like&gt; and it becomes a mental thing. Others ive know from early childhood that were NOT male/female even tho physically they were. Ive even met a boy that had breasts. Strange true but his body didnt produce the massive amounts of testosterone normal males do it produced Estrogen. <br>
<br>
The boy i met was still heterosexual even tho he had estrogen and not nearly the same amount of testosterone. <br>
<br>
Does that make him a lesbian? lol I think not <br>
<br>
Personally what people do in there sexual lives is there own buisness. I dont like being hit on by @#%$ men and dont like to SEE @#%$ men do any sexual acts but i accept it as something THEY like to do. Sure like all males i like to watch to beautiful women make out and do all kinds of nasty things. Why? WHy women and not men? Because im sexually attracted to women and seeing to beautiful women just turns me on /shrug. Same cant be said about men.  <br>
<br>
ANYWAY Bjornn bad Aldrin Bad&lt;soometimes&gt; And everyone else is bad in the bedroom!!!!! Either way it dont matter we all got opinions and thats fine but when we take the extra step to belittle and demean others for theres is when we have gone to far. Personally aldrin has some points and i can understand his view point. I dont agree with alot of his feelings but that doesnt mean anything really No one agrees with my opinions lol anyway i forgot what else i was going to say im at work and was called away from desk so I forgot I suxors i know /sigh PS you all got to much time on yer hands<br>

<br>
<br>
On the bjornn thing and dollaine or wtf ever he is you all need to follow my advice and never transfer any items thru anyone other then yerself or a rl friend who you can beat the hell outta if they keep. This is just my opinion and how i do buisness myself although i have at times used friends in game for this purpose but almost all were friends of 2-3 years in game. <p><img src="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/affliction/ebola.gif" title="I am Ebola.

Rather then going through all the hard work to become legal immigrants, they pay someone to smuggle them (yes, selling accounts is illegal too) to reap the benefits of someone else's hard work.  Do we say &quot;Well, he's E-Bayed but he tries really hard so we shouldn't make fun of him?&quot;.  No, we say &quot;Wow, you play your class not too shabby for a POS E-Bay scumbag&quot;.  <br>
<br>
If you're going to point out achievements, I'd rather be touting the hard work of American citizens including LEGAL immigrants rather then talking about what a great person these illegal workers are.  They are breaking the law, they are not paying taxes, though by using the roads, schools, etc., they are taking money from the economy.  And yet you wonder why people rant against that?  I work fairly long hours and have done so for years.  I don't mind helping someone who through no fault of their own needs a hand.  But to ask me to support someone who was unwilling to work in their own country, breaks the laws of my community and country, takes money that I've earned for himself, all the while working less hours then me or not at all, is not something that I'm going to agree with you on.<br>
<br>
A few years ago when the economy was humming, hearing an illegal was working 2-3 jobs wouldn't have had much effect on me.  There was work to go around for those who wanted it, you might even say they were filling a need (though they still generally take more money out of our economy then they put into it).

My views concerning homosexuality have formed over a couple decades. At one time I was also under the misconception that it was normal and healthy.<br>
Logically, there's no reason to be sexually attracted to anyone. Logically, mammals are attracted to members of the opposite sex so that they will make babies. If you're attracted to members of the same sex, by this reasoning, something's wrong. You may disagree with my basic premise. But, and this is the important point, it's not born of hate, or moral indoctrination. Remember that Dalynia accused me of hating homosexuals. You may think I'm wrong, even ignorant... just so long as it's clear that it's not hatred or fear. I think those who support homosexuality as an &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; are wrong, ignorant, and doing harm. (shrug)<br>

Yes, I'm familiar with that heap paradox, but in the context of equality, I think we should view it based upon the Declaration of Independence, which so many people refer to in arguments of equality. In the context of that document, and upon careful reading, it appears that they were attempting to define some intangable quality of humanity. As I pointed out, I'm not equal to Bill Gates.<br>
 <br>
John W. Cambell years ago wrote a great essay entitled &quot;Hyperdemocracy&quot;. In it he explains that people, in fact, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  aren't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> equal. He uses the example of a Peruvian Indio, who can works hours at 14 thousand feet, while a U.S. engineer who'd worked in the area for years can work a treadmill perhaps 8 minutes at the same altitude (this was based upon a report he'd read, actually.) Experience is not going to make this difference. Generations of living at that altitude gave the Indio that capability. The difficulties of childbirth pretty much guarantee that such a capability will be bred into the population. <br>
Should a gov't program be instituted to give all Indios asthma, to make them equal? Should European people be encouraged to live at 14 thousand feet, because the Indios can?<br>
<br>
I have to ask myself, why do women have to have their own olympic hockey team? Why can't they play on the male's team? Why do they have to play hockey at all? Why does the network broadcasting a female olympic hockey game have to air a commercial falsely claiming that 1 in 3 women &quot;experience&quot; domestic violence? Let's face it, if I try to domestically abuse Jim Craig, he's going to dance on my face.<br>
In my opinion, there is a very dangerous sickness in the idea of pushing females into masculine behavior while attempting to retain the cultural paternal protectiveness over them. There's no question that U.S. culture, especially among young males, has become more violent, less tolerant, more vulgar, less educatable, and less moral (by any standard.) You can't have a boy treat a girl like a boy throughout his childood, and then when she hits puberty expect him to treat her some other way, now alien to him. You can't expect to treat a girl like a boy throughout her childhood and then expect her to know how to be a lady when the occassion calls for it once she's an adult.<br>
There is a subtle, actually not so subtle, suggestion in the media and in western culture everywhere, that to be equal females have to do what males do. They have to like what males like. They have to be where males are. Which throws away all those things that females like, do, and are that males don't share.<br>
<br>
Haagen, I'll put it in bold so it's clear, but you can also read my response to Maui concerning homosexuality:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  My views on homosexuality are not based upon morality</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Whether it is moral or immoral is irrelevant to what it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I have to admire the way you attempt to twist definitions out of their meaning. &quot;All elephants are pink; Nellie is an elephant, therefore Nellie is pink.&quot; Are left-handed people abnormal? Among Europeans, yes, because the Romans tended to discourage left-handedness by chopping it off (Even my mother was taught in school not to be left-handed.) However, does having a left hand as a primary hand in any way interefere in the evolved functioning of a human? A male gets aroused by a female in order to get the female pregnant. If he's aroused by males, or children, or horses, this interferes with the evolved function. There's no indication whatsoever that the right hand must be the dominant hand. But the very nature of sexual reproduction dictates that heterosexual behavior is necessary for the perpetuation of the species, and there is no evolutionary evidence supporting the suggestion that homosexual appetites evolved into the species to perform some function, as is the case with heterosexual appetites.<br>
I'm arguing logic, you're twisting semantics.<br>
As for your suggestion of an over-inflated ego; like everyone else, I live in the world, therefore I must interact with it. To interact with it I must make judgement calls, just like everyone else. It's not a matter of egotism that I make them, nor is it a matter of ego that they disagree with yours. Like a Motie Mediator, I'm not responsible for the conclusions you arrive at; I judge on the evidence.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Where does it say anything about imposing your morals on others? (in fact I'd argue that liberals, by definition, do NOT impose their morals on others) I see no mention of being a drone, in fact &quot;the autonomy of the individual&quot; is explicitly mentioned. In fact, almost every single characteristic you attribute to liberals in your attempts to bash them are in fact conservative characteristics.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
All you are arguing here is that political liberals are not, by your quoted definition, liberals at all. Either the definition you choose to quote is in error (not the first time for a dictionary,) or the political organizations in the U.S. that work under the banner of &quot;liberalism&quot; are working under false pretenses. <br>
Henceforeward, I will use the term &quot;political liberal&quot; to refer to Democrats, Greens, and other political organizations associated (apparently improperly) with &quot;liberalism&quot;.<br>
Political liberals do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> promote the autonomy of the individual; as evidence I give you the host of social welfare programs. I give you the withholding tax, I give you the seatbelt laws, I give you the 1964 civil rights act which reduces individuals into faceless members of groups, all strongly supported by political liberals. I give you the unions supported by political liberals, I give you the Enron debacle in which political liberals are calling for a bailout of the employees. Political liberals suggest in speech after speech that an employee somehow is deserving of protection, and an employer somehow has a moral obligation to care for his employees. So much for the autonomy of the individual.<br>
 <br>
Political liberals have consistently forced their morality on others; I cited earlier the liberal teacher who wished to teach gradeschool children that homosexuality was good and moral. It is a matter of pushing political liberal morality when the ACLU suggests that a resident alien is the equivalent of a native-born citizen. Political liberals force their morality on others when they promote laws, rules and practices which equate paganism with Christianity. Political libearls force their morality on others when they teach schoolchildren about Islam but refuse to allow any reference to Christianity in a given school. Political liberals impose their morality when they pass out condoms and promote sex education courses as education requirements. Political liberals impose their morality when they produce advertisements and entertainment (aka propoganda) programs which denegrate the classic nuclear family view and celebrate the modern exploded family, particularly when they dominate and in large part control the media.<br>
<br>
 Here is Merriam-Webster's definition of conservative:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 1 a : an adherent or advocate of political conservatism b capitalized : a member or supporter of a conservative political party<br>
2 a : one who adheres to traditional methods or views b : a cautious or discreet person <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only part of the above definition that doesn't apply to me is 2b. (well, I don't belong to or support a conservative political party because none exist in the U.S., but...)<br>
<br>
Interested that the political left in the U.S. would adopt the term liberal for themselves; much like the party name &quot;Democrat&quot; (so often misused as &quot;democratic&quot; it implies what isn't the case.<br>
<br>
However, much of my views do defend, promote and embrace the individual. But unlike political liberals, who seem to view the individual as a member of some subset group of the whole, I promote the individual as an entity unto himself. <br>
<br>
I see no harm in referring to people as liberals who refer to themselves as liberals. If they behave this way, and they call themselves liberals.... I leave it to you what to call them.<br>
<br>
I wasn't trolling, btw. I was truly shocked by Dalynia's reply to my message. The most reaction I expected from anyone was along the lines of, &quot;wow, I didn't know that. Weird how common terms come about.&quot; <br>
<br>
Here's another one: &quot;jerry-rig&quot; and &quot;jury-rig&quot;. I'm not sure which is correct; I'm under the impression that the British coined the former, referring to something cobbled-together by Germans (there's yet another.. where did &quot;cobbled-together&quot; come from? Shoemakers making fast, poor quality shoes?)<br>

No, I am the judge of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> morality. Nowhere in this argument have I made any moral judgements. I didn't say homosexuality was immoral, I didn't say sexual equality was immoral, I didn't say illegal immigration was immoral. <br>
My definition of morality follows very closely Robert A. Heinlein's: &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sin lies in harming others unnecessarily. Harming oneself isn't sinful, it's just stupid.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
One can say alcoholism is an affliction without making a moral judgement; like saying an alcoholic is a bad person. One can oppose illegal immigration without saying illegal immigrants are immoral people.<br>
In this case I am guilty of troll-baiting, I confess. I wanted someone to bite on that so I could come back and point out how I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> passing moral judgements on people.<br>
<br>

Ah, but we are members of the same culture, and live in an established nation with laws about such matters. And yet, people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  have</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lost their property because they were not utilizing it, and others could make use of it.<br>
And if there were no laws, yes, I could do exactly that, and if I were right, I would possess the land and you wouldn't. But that doesn't make it wrong for you to oppose my acquisition efforts.<br>
I didn't invent the levels of civilization; they just happened. You have hunter-gatherers, you have agrarian, you have industrial, you have what we would call modern, I suppose. And several in-between (it's been 20 years since I had anthropology.)  Another measure is stone-age, bronze-age, iron-age... up to the space age. <br>
It's not an arbitrary valuation; viewing the historical evidence, the European cultures of the time were farther advanced than the American cultures. They had gone beyond the agrarian era and were into an early industrial era. Europe herself was undergoing massive development, internally. <br>
Would we be sitting in our houses in Europe talking over the computer today if the Europeans had been nice and left the Americans to the aborigines? Yes, but then the dominant culture of the Americas today would probably be based around Asian cultures. Fossil records show that humans inhabited the Americas 40 thousand years ago. About the time the homo sapiens occupied Europe. America is as rich in resources as Europe, probably richer. There's no reason to believe that the aboriginal cultures would have developed to the industrial age if left to themselves. Already the highest civilizations in the Americas were starting to crumble when the Spaniards showed up to finish the job. <br>
The key point, however, is &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; vs &quot;farmer&quot;. Yes, some North American cultures had developed farming at a primitive level (btw, it's a myth that the aborigines taught the colonists how to plant corn.) While Americans were using digging sticks, Europeans had developed the steel plowshare pulled by horses or oxen (which required the invention of the horse-collar, btw.) <br>
Attempt to compare this natural competition among higher level animals with illegal immigration... people from an industrial age democracy illegally invading a space-age democracy to avail themselves of the attributes of said democracy, with people from a variety of industrial age societies invading a mostly-empty land, with at best a hunter-gatherer society, with the intent of bringing the superior attributes of their more advanced society to the new land, to build upon. It's not the same. The former interferes with the advancement of mankind, the latter supports it.<br>
<br>
My stance has been in opposition to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  illegal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> aliens. If they came from Canada as they do from Mexico, I would be just as opposed. It's not a matter of skin color or morality, it's a matter of the well-being of my home.<br>

Btw, it's Alan Colmes, and he's a liberal. You're thinking of Sean Hannity. What's interesting is what you've named are all <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  radio</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> talk show hosts. Yes, conservatives have all but taken over the raidio airwaves. Fox news employs some of them. To combat this you still have all of CNN, most of MSNBC, CBS, ABC, and not just talk shows but entertainment programs from Friends to Star Drek. You have Hollywood, making movies that are either thinly veiled propoganda or mindless violence/sex romps. What Veerhoven did in turning Starship Troopers into a movie should be criminal. Why are so many classic movies being remade? Why is the plot being changed, and politically correct characters/themes being introduced? It's possible that screenwriters have run out of original ideas (they're even starting to steal themes from video games.) A more Orwellian suspicion is rewriting the past. I was shocked that they rewrote Rollerball. If ever there was a condemnation of corporate capitalism, that was it. Then again, I haven't seen anything but the trailers, so the bad-guys might still be corporations. But I notice it's no longer the autonomous individual combatting them. It's Stereotypical white male hunk, Stereotypical black mail hunk, and Stereotypical female (masculine) hottie.<br>
That conservatives and liberals promote their agendas in the media neither surprises nor alarms me. What alarms me is when one side (and very skillfully) attempts to use the media to promote their agenda as the common wisdom, rather than as their agenda. This happens when every &quot;entertainment&quot; program casually treats homosexuality as just another lifestyle choice, with no opposition; or any opposition being a straw man set up to be shown as bad, stupid or otherwise rejected and outcast. Same goes for single motherhood, promiscuity, historical revision. You have a smoker in a movie or tv show? It's likely he's a bad guy. You have a corporate type in a movie? More likely than not he's a money grubbing, bigotted coward (and white and male...) and some nature-loving liberal is going to take him down...<br>
<br>
In The Practice, the other night, one lawyer asks another if her client didn't know that asbestos causes cancer? Convenient. There's more than one kind of asbestos. Not all asbestos causes cancer. <br>
<br>
Nowhere is there a better example of this media bias and innuendo than in the book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Fallen Angels.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (most significant work of fiction since Orwell's 1984, IMO.) <br>
It takes the political liberal's agenda to it's natural conclusion. Political correctness reigns over all, sometimes with hilarious results. In one scene, the police raid a convention, and one conventioneer has a button which says, &quot;Have sex outside my species&quot;. Now, technically that's a violation of the morality laws (sexual reference), but he's not allowed to notice it if he takes what the badge says literally. <br>
<br>
&quot;Microwaves are a form of radiation, which causes cancer&quot;, states a news report. &quot;Nice placement on the comma&quot;, one character observes. The implication is that microwaves cause cancer, rather than that some forms of radiation cause cancer. And <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a classic example of the news reports I see every night on most news channels. Even Fox.<br>
<br>
Get the book, it's a fascinating read. I guarantee that at some point it'll offend you, whatever your views.<br>
<br>
<br>
We're also way off the point. We can argue these issues all you like; the point is I made a simple statement about a bit of trivia, and I was attacked and accused of hating any number of groups of people. Since then I've attempted to demonstrate that, flawed or accurate, my views do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> involve hate. I think I've done so. <br>
Therefore, there's really no point in continuing this argument.<br>

Being horny isn't &quot;logical,&quot; Aldrin. Wanting to rub your boy-parts on another boy or your girl-parts on another girl has nothing to do with reproduction.

Was it some gift from the Great Creator so we could develop a &quot;buzz&quot; without using illicit drugs? Why is the orgasm so addictive that we'll ruin our lives and risk our health for a shot at it? The answer to these questions is a matter of logic, not horniness.<br>
<br>
It's so we'll procreate. Procreation, actually, isn't terribly pro-survival for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  individual</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but it is for the species.<br>
<br>
There are lots of behaviors and attributes animals have that are not pro-survival but are not anti-survival either. They aren't bred out of a species until they threaten the species continued survival; the threat they offer the species survival is what eliminates the characteristic, in fact. <br>
<br>
Why do you eliminate sexual assault? What harm does it do to the species? Forced copulation is pro-survival, provided that it results in offspring and the offspring is raised by the rapist and its mother. Since a loving relationship between a male and a female works best for seeing the offspring reach breeding age itself, instincts evolved to promote love and suppress forced copulation. But forced copulation still happens. Well, since it happens, should we embrace it?<br>
There's a dead little girl out there somewhere, because people were nice and tolerant of someone who suffers from a mental/emotional disorder. Instead of wanting to mate with a female of breeding age, he's attracted to children. How dead would the little girl be if this guy were locked up in a mental hospital? Tell me how one guy's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   attraction</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to another guy is any different than that person's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> attraction</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to children or farm animals or space aliens? Tell me how homosexual advocacy groups aren't arguing for an end to age descrimination in regards to consensual sex acts. <br>
There is a difference with regards to masturbation, as I'm sure you're aware. If someone can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> become aroused by masturbation, then they have a mental/emotional problem, just as if a person could only become aroused by a member of the same sex, or a child, or a giraffe. With the added caveat that they may have a form of impotence caused by physical problems. But, hey, if someone's impotent, we'll just call it an alternative lifestyle and let them do without, let's not embarass them by getting them help.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dalynia, get it right <br>

1.  Native north americans were not 'hunter-gatherers', as you stated (or stone-aged).  While my background is not cultural geography, I do know that agriculture was well developed in all native cultures south of the subarctic.  Corn, tomatoes and potatoes are fine examples of north american agriculture that was brought to Europe by colonialists.  The Incan's, prior to the wipeout of their civilization, had advanced systems of accounting and taxation.  Accurate records were maintained of all personal belongings, even the number of pairs of shoes in each household, through a system of strings knots.<br>
<br>
2.  At the time of the discovery of North America by the portugese / spanish, the population of North America exceeded that of europe.  However, genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism and lack of immunity to diseases which had been present in Europe for centuries, caused the population to destabilize.  However, most natives were killed by disease, not war or social darwinism.<br>

Introduction<br>
 <br>
<br>
Relativity, theory, developed in the early 20th century, which originally attempted to account for certain anomalies in the concept of relative motion, but which in its ramifications has developed into one of the most important basic concepts in physical science (see Physics). The theory of relativity, developed primarily by German American physicist Albert Einstein, is the basis for later demonstration by physicists of the essential unity of matter and energy, of space and time, and of the forces of gravity and acceleration (see Acceleration; Energy; Gravitation).<br>
<br>
<br>
II. Classical PhysicsPrint section<br>
 <br>
<br>
Physical laws generally accepted by scientists before the development of the theory of relativity, now called classical laws, were based on the principles of mechanics enunciated late in the 17th century by the English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton.  <br>
Advertisement <br>
 <br>
Newtonian mechanics and relativistic mechanics differ in fundamental assumptions and mathematical development, but in most cases do not differ appreciably in net results; the behavior of a billiard ball when struck by another billiard ball, for example, may be predicted by mathematical calculations based on either type of mechanics and produce approximately identical results. Inasmuch as the classical mathematics is enormously simpler than the relativistic, the former is the preferred basis for such a calculation. In cases of high speeds, however, assuming that one of the billiard balls was moving at a speed approaching that of light, the two theories would predict entirely different types of behavior, and scientists today are quite certain that the relativistic predictions would be verified and the classical predictions would be proved incorrect.<br>
<br>
In general, the difference between two predictions on the behavior of any moving object involves a factor discovered by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, and the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald late in the 19th century. This factor is generally represented by the Greek letter  (beta) and is determined by the velocity of the object in accordance with the following equation:<br>
in which v is the velocity of the object and c is the velocity of light (see Light). The beta factor does not differ essentially from unity for any velocity that is ordinarily encountered; the highest velocity encountered in ordinary ballistics, for example, is about 1.6 km/sec (about 1 mi/sec), the highest velocity obtainable by a rocket propelled by ordinary chemicals is a few times that, and the velocity of the earth as it moves around the sun is about 29 km/sec (about 18 mi/sec); at the last-named speed, the value of beta differs from unity by only five billionths. Thus, for ordinary terrestrial phenomena, the relativistic corrections are of little importance. When velocities are very large, however, as is sometimes the case in astronomical phenomena, relativistic corrections become significant. Similarly, relativity is important in calculating very large distances or very large aggregations of matter. As the quantum theory applies to the very small, so the relativity theory applies to the very large.<br>
<br>
Until 1887 no flaw had appeared in the rapidly developing body of classical physics. In that year, the Michelson-Morley experiment, named after the American physicist Albert Michelson and the American chemist Edward Williams Morley, was performed. It was an attempt to determine the rate of the motion of the earth through the ether, a hypothetical substance that was thought to transmit electromagnetic radiation, including light, and was assumed to permeate all space. If the sun is at absolute rest in space, then the earth must have a constant velocity of 29 km/sec (18 mi/sec), caused by its revolution about the sun; if the sun and the entire solar system are moving through space, however, the constantly changing direction of the earth's orbital velocity will cause this value of the earth's motion to be added to the velocity of the sun at certain times of the year and subtracted from it at others. The result of the experiment was entirely unexpected and inexplicable; the apparent velocity of the earth through this hypothetical ether was zero at all times of the year.<br>

I dunno. Should everyone who can't benchpress 200 be deported for their weakness? Given steroids? Should anyone with a genetic defect be castrated to extract their tainted DNA from the population? Should we burn books, make Jews wear stars on their arms? Create the new master race? What's it like standing on that slippery slope?<br>
<br>
I tend to dismiss arguments like this because they'll support the most ridiculous of conclusions. My stance is that nobody that is serious thinks that political equality is the same as biological equality. The only real-world society to connect these two notions in a nontrivial way was Nazi Germany, and look what happened to them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  A male gets aroused by a female in order to get the female pregnant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Eh? I'm a male and I've been aroused by females many times; never once has getting the female pregnant had anything to do with it. In fact, up to this point, and for quite some time into the future, I'm gonna make damn sure NOT to get the female pregnant. Welcome to the age of contraceptives and alcohol, Aldrin. People have sex for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  pleasure</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> now. Procreation is optional and usually discouraged. In fact, some societies consider procreation such a burden on the planet that if you try to have more than one child they'll euthanize the second one at birth.<br>
<br>
Evolutionary pressure is just that, Aldrin. Pressure. If homosexuality were as contra-evolutionary as you claim, it would have been selected out. Saying evolution works against homosexuality is like saying evolution works against bipedal mammals with large brain mass. All someone has to do to contradict the argument is say, &quot;yet here we are.&quot; Fact is, in this day and age, the world is overpopulated as it is. Evolutionary pressure no longer leans on us to procreate.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for your argument, much like the hunter-gatherer society, the equation of sex with procreation has been left behind by progress, I'm afraid. So about the only thing that's left is the equation of sex with pleasure. And who are you or I to tell someone what pleases them? Liberalism (political or otherwise) is allowing people to decide for themselves what pleases them. This is an activity between two parties. As long as both of those parties consent to it, and it doesn't harm other outside parties, who is anyone else to interfere?<br>
<br>
You say your stance on this is not moral. What is it then? You are clearly imposing a standard on people that has NOTHING to do with evolution or any other science. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13524">Margana Malevolent</A><BR>Warlock<BR><A href="http://www.fnurt.net/amici">Amici</A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhaagen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haagen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/22/02 5:22:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/22/02 5:52:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bjornn different my A$$ he just jipped me</span><hr size=1> Actually Fluffy, not all Native Americans were into agriculture.

I strive to improve my living conditions by hoarding gold, food, and sometimes keys and potions. I love adventure, fighting, and particularly winning - especially when there's a prize at stake. I occasionally get lost inside buildings and can't find the exit. I need food badly. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
