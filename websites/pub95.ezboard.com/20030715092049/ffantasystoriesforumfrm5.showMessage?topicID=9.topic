The nightmares had been getting steadily worse. For the past several days she had been violently ill. It was a kind of ceremony among the Plague Bringers; only the strong survived. She was in the final stages; she had begun to sweat blood. Her life at this time was endless convulsions, complimented by hallucinations; wonderful, beautiful hallucinations in which she witnessed everything in its pure form. A dystopic world in which pain and suffering were god. It was not long before she could not distinguish between the few dreadful moments of sanity and the world her mind had created. The pressure in her head was getting stronger. She felt as if her head would explode if as much as a thought entered it. All she could do is focus on the pain, which fortunately for her was not a bad fate. She almost enjoyed it. She fell to the ground and screamed. Her body once again twisted and contorted in an attack of convulsions. Her eyelids were forced open and darkness poured from her pupils. Fire enveloped her heart and charred it black. <br>
When she eventually woke up she groaned as a smile spread wide across her face. She stretched her limbs and slowly opened her eyes. She could see the stars through a hole in the sealing. She sat up and looked at her surroundings. She was sitting in a shallow pool of blood. She saw the roots growing in through the earthen walls of the cavern, and the cobwebs that stretched from ceiling to floor. This gave her an indication of just how long she had been there. Her fingernails had grown considerably and resembled claws in the dim light. She lay back down, closed her eyes, and immediately fell asleep. <br>
<br>
As she slept the blood that formed the pool around her slowly turned black and was absorbed into her being. Six months later she awoke. The air in the small cavern was cold and stale. She slowly stood and walked over to the entrance to the cavern where she had left her cloths. As she dressed she wondered how long the whole process had taken. She could feel the new blood being pumped throughout her body, filling her with a sensation that was quite hard to describe. It was as if someone had gathered together all the most pleasurable experiences and ran them constantly through her system. It was as if her flesh was being burned off her body, and she could do nothing but laugh about it. It was as if the gates of hell had been thrown open and she was death herself. <br>
When she had finished dressing she swung open the door to the cavern, exposing a long dark hallway, hollowed out of solid rock. She moved slowly and silently. As she made her way down the seemingly endless hall, a voice whispered to her, and echoed all around. “Where have you been?” She kept her eyes low and thought before answering.<br>
“Paradise. What did you see?”<br>
“Darkness.”<br>
“It is a beautiful thing . . .”<br>
“What is?”<br>
“To live in fear.”<br>
“What is to be feared?”<br>
“Waking up.” Paradise froze in her tracks. She took a deep breath, raised her head, and screamed. It is rumored that the scream was heard all throughout Norrath. There was no ear that fell deaf to its ringing. The very sun fell from the sky, and darkness gripped Norrath. The dead plunged out of the earth and began to march upon the cities. The heavens rained down fire, and the lakes, rivers, and oceans turned to blood. <br>
<br>
An old and decrepit man walked slowly down the corridors that lead to his study. His hair was silvered and his eyes were sunken deep within his skull. He quickly pulled out a piece of parchment that was made from flesh. He drew his dagger and slit his wrist. With his own blood on the knifepoint he scrawled the words: The Prophecy has come true. He placed the scroll in the claws of a crow sitting at his window, and instructed it to take the message to the shrine of Bertoxxolous.<br>
The leader at the shrine at the time was a man named Alexander. Alexander gained the throne by virtue of his birth. He was also the leader of a new sect of Necromancers, the “Contemporaries”. These were Necromancer’s who had abandoned the ancient teachings and dismissed the former structure, leaving all the followers in utter chaos. That is, until the crow flew in through the window. <br>
Alexander recognized the seal on the letter as that of the Oracle of Plague. He waited to open it until he was at council. When the elders had gathered around, he opened it and revealed it’s message. “What is this prophecy?” he asked, his ignorance making the traditionalists angry. <br>
“If you had done your studies boy, you would know what the prophecy is!” replied one of the elders. “This prophecy must have taken place not more then 6 weeks ago if this note is from the oracle. There was a legend, Alexander, which foretold of the coming of a leader. She would descend from the heavens, riding the moonlight exactly 3 months after the stars were in alignment.” The old man stopped for a second and did some calculations, “that doesn’t leave us much time.” He walked over to the window and looked out at the stars, his voice lowered and he took on an air of respect. “And when her foot touches the earth, the heavens will open, the sky will rain fire, the oceans, lakes, and rivers will turn to blood. A new day for Necromancy will begin.”<br>
“These tales you old men tell to amuse yourselves, really I wish you would stop wasting my time. If you will, remember the last person who tried to remove me from the throne. I will do the same to this prophet of yours, if she ever makes her appearance.” With that, Alexander left the great hall. The old men cackled in the dark. <br>
<br>
“Are you sure you locked the gate?” Asked Desie again.<br>
“And I locked the barn, and put Stephi to bed, and did everything else you wanted me to do.” Replied Sarah. “Don’t raise your voice to . . .” Desie’s speech to her young daughter was interrupted by the sound of a pack of wolves, howling in the distance. “I hope your father gets home soon.” The two girls walked over to the cabin window and peered out into the foggy night. The fire that had been burning fiercely in the fireplace suddenly died, and a little cloud of smoke arose from the ashes. The girls shuddered. “That’s a bad omen. Quickly, go get your sister, we must get down to the cellar.” No sooner had they reached the cellar than the earth began to rumble. It was an earthquake, the only earthquake that that part of Norrath had ever seen. <br>
When they had woken up the next morning, they found themselves relatively unharmed. As they climbed up the ladder and swung open the doors, the sunlight burst in and hurt their eyes. The air was clam, there was not a cloud in the sky, and the soft, melodious song of the sparrows was barely audible from off in the distance. In fact there was nothing that seemed to be disturbed by the earthquake of the night before. As the sun continued to rise above the horizon however they noticed something unusual. The sun was rimmed with a circle of red. The redness grew and grew until it consumed the whole of the sun. It was as if the sun was bleeding.<br>
A great darkness fell upon all of Norrath. It was not the darkness of night, but rather it had a unique quality that is rather hard to explain, there was something about it that made it feel as if it were penetrating your body, reaching deep within your soul. This darkness was not just the lack of light, but rather it was something tangible. An eerie calm set over all of the forest, not even the animals brave enough to make a sound. Out of the darkness one could hear giggling like that of a small child. One realized that it was not a small child however when the giggling quickly converted to a savage cackling. A figure stepped out of the shadows. It was a girl, perhaps the most stunningly beautiful girl anyone had ever seen, but there was something about her that overshadowed her appearance, the same something that makes your skin crawl. She kneeled, and bent down to kiss the ground. When she did, blood flowed from her mouth, it was abosorbed into the ground and spread like a cancer, infecting all the water sources. The oceans were overflowing with blood. The girl stood again and looked over at the small family of woodelves that were watching her with wide eyes. One of them was crying. Her eyes met those of the mother. Blood began to shoot upwards in her body, every ounce of it racing to her head. Her eyes turned red and she began to gasp for breath. Her daughters tried to help her, but stopped when her head exploded. Or maybe it was that they stopped not because, but as her head exploded, for at that same instance their innards were being liquefied. The girl enshrouded herself in the darkness glided softly by the corpses. If one wanted to, one could follow her by the tracks of dead foliage that she left in her wake. <br>
Alexander was trying to hide his anxiety. He knew the elders were right, well, maybe not about everything, but something was definitely happening. The earthquakes had stopped, but the water had not returned. He could hear the people above ground praying to their various gods for the plague to end. He knew it would do no good. For the time being he just sat and tried to continue on as if nothing were happening. And truthfully, he was doing pretty well at it. That is until the screams came echoing down the long chambers of the Shrine of Bertoxxoulous. The most valued shadow knight, the best fighter in all of Norrath was posted at the main entrance until things returned to normal. It was him that was screaming, and it was his head that slowly rolled through the hall and came to rest at Alexander’s feet. Alexander picked up the head and looked at it. “It’s a bloody shame.” He lazily threw the bloody lump off behind his shoulder and sounded the alarm. Immediately 20 clansmen rushed in and awaited orders. “The door, don’t let anyone in, someone has killed . . .” Before Alexander could finish, a great wind came in through the door and filled the hall. Everyone was blown against the back wall, except for Alexander who remained in his chair. Then one by one, from left to right, the throats of the clansmen began to bleed, and continued to do so until the head was severed completely from the body, and rest on the floor; all save Alexander. Alexander struggled in his throne; unable to lift a finger, he scanned the room to find the source of these bloody deeds, but saw no one. A few minutes past and he could still not move, but all was silent. Then, he heard the sound of a little girl giggling. The blood that had pooled on the floor of the great hall, began to form letters. “Les vrais pardis sont les pardis qu’on a perdus.” (The true paradises are the paradises we have lost.) Then, out of nowhere, a girl appeared in front of him, and all the torches in the hall were extinguished.<br>
Alexander regained consciousness several weeks later. It was not long before he would wish that he never had. Much had changed in the six months that he had been unconscious. The first thing he noticed was that he had no strength; he could only stand for brief moments at a time. His muscles he assumed had atrophied. The door to the small chamber that he was in was locked. He remained in total darkness, the only window in the room having been boarded up. Between the times of restless sleep he could hear chanting, but not in common tongue. The chants were in a number of various dead languages, ancient languages that because of his abandonment of the old ways, he had forgotten all about, and could not decipher what they translated to. He kept himself alive by eating the few rats that he could catch running through his chamber. He lost all sense of day and night, and he started to loose his already feeble grasp on reality. He began talking to himself. He had no perception of time so he doesn’t know how long it was that he lived like this, but it was quite some time before he had his dream. He had dreamt that he was being pursued. He was running hopelessly through the night, stumbling over every pebble, having to stop and catch his breath whenever he could. He could hear a girl giggling from out of the shadows; he was desperately trying to find her, to find safety. At one moment he had an opportunity to glance behind and see who was pursuing him, and what he saw was perhaps the single most frightening thing he had ever seen. It was not so much that his predator was physically appalling, but upon seeing him Alexander knew everything about him, and it was this insight that frightened him. For you see it was himself. He was what he feared most in the world. The giggling got steadily louder until it woke him up. But it didn’t stop. He opened his eyes and saw a girl standing above him, looking down at him. She was holding a torch. This was the first light he had been exposed to for quite some time, he turned his head and closed his eyes, waiting for them to adjust. He heard the girl whisper into his ear, her hot breath making the hair on his neck stand on end. “Alexander . . . “ she said, “what did you see?” He thought about this before he responded,<br>
“Fear.”<br>
“It is a beautiful thing,” the girl continued,<br>
“What is?”<br>
“To find that you are your own worst nightmare.”<br>
He cried himself to sleep that night, and he slept more soundly then he ever had in his entire life. When he eventually awoke, he found there was a torch on the wall illuminating the room. There was a piece of bread and a cup of water on the table. He ate greedily and drank deeply. When he was finished, the door swung open. When he saw the hall that lead away from his room he knew where he was, he had been in a meditation chamber, an old ritual of the Plague Bringers to gain insight and to ‘find yourself’ so to speak. He certainly had, but he still had many questions. He slowly made his way down the long chamber and headed toward the shrine. As he passed the other followers of the Plague Bringer, he noticed that they were all wearing robes, robes that had been banned from the congregation while he was leader. It was obvious that he was no longer leader. When he arrived at the alter he found the same girl that had woken him. She smiled and walked over to him, offering her arm as support. He gladly accepted and she guided him to a chair where he sat, gratefully. Their eyes met, she was still smiling, and he had the look of a man that just destroyed his own past. “What has happened?” He asked slowly, having trouble forming the words, each syllable causing him pain as it rolled off his tongue. The girl silently reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a small vile, after uncorking it she offered it to him.<br>
“Drink this, “ she paused, her left eye twinkled, “you will feel better.” He slowly reached out and clutched the vile. She guided his hand to his lips and leaned back his head so he could drink. When he had, a new sense of vitality moved throughout his body, he felt as he did before everything had happened, before the ‘prophet’ arrived. That is when he realized whom he was speaking to, it was she, and it was the girl who had been prophesied about, that had entered the Shrine the night he didn’t wake up. He tried to keep his realization a secret.<br>
“What was that?” She stood up and took a seat opposite him. <br>
“I acquired that from a old priest I met in the temple of Solusek Ro. It is rumored that it is the blood of Bertoxxolous himself. The priest that gave it to me said that . . .” she trailed off and looked away, “but that’s a story for another day. I’m sure you’re much more interested in what has been going on while you were in the meditation chamber.” Alexander nodded. “Well first let me introduce myself, I am Paradise. I lived here a long time ago, in fact, I knew your father . . . “ She proceeded to tell him that while she was journeying through Odus in an attempt to find the ancient scrolls, she had had a vision. She had been ordered by the Plague Bringer to restore the ancient ways to his shrine in Qeynos. She described to him what she found when she arrived, for he had trouble recalling. “I found the shrine in utter chaos. The shrine room was dirty, it hadn’t been used in years, the congregation had forgotten all of the ancient ways. You had been the chief advocator of this,” she paused and smiled a little, “so I gave you some time to think about it.” She revealed to him that it had been close to three years since he last walked through the corridors of the shrine. “The ancient ways have been restored. I have given control of the shrine back to the circle of elders.”<br>
Alexander’s mind was filled with so many thoughts he felt his head might explode. He was filled with bitterness that he had been removed from the throne, he resented the fact that this girl had destroyed all that he had done when he was emperor. But he was also confused. There was something about this girl, the twinkle in her eyes, her soothing voice, he didn’t know what, but it made him trust her. <br>
They walked together through the halls, Paradise informing Alexander of all that had happened while he was away. “Our clutch on Norrath grows everyday. There is not once city that we now do not have influence in. Kane Bale, the leader of the Qeynos guard is now working for us. The Freeport Malitia are also our sympathizers thanks to our sister, Opal Darkbriaer. With help from our friends in Neriak, we are currently under negotiations with Mistmoore Castle. The discovery of Kunark has also increased our numbers” “Kunark?” Alexander asked with an expression of confusion.<br>
“A few years ago a continent was discovered across the ocean to the south east. Lizard men. They’re a shady bunch but overall they have proven to be an asset.” Alexander nodded, afraid to ask what she meant by ‘lizard men’. <br>
“Where are we going?”<br>
“The main hall, the elders are hearing a trial.”<br>
“What was the crime?”<br>
“Treason.”<br>
“On whose part?”<br>
“Yours.” Paradise smiled at him as she opened the double doors leading to the main hall. The whole shrine had gathered and the elders sat on a stage looking down upon the hall. There was a wooden seat in the middle. Alexander sat in it. The whole hall fell silent. One of the elders began to speak. “Alexander, you are here because you have committed the act of treason. You abandoned the old ways and let chaos hold our clan captive. As punishment for your crimes and as an apology to our Lord, Bertoxxolous you will be put to death.” Alexander’s face changed into an expression of terror, and then to confusion. “Do you have anything to say before the we proceed with the execution?”<br>
Alexander stared calmly at the clan elders. “Why did you keep me alive? Why didn’t you kill me when you had the chance?” <br>
“We’ve always had the chance. If we had done it any sooner you wouldn’t have learned anything. Perhaps now, in the precious few moments of life you have left, you realize your mistakes.” Alexander stared at his feet. Tears dripped from his eyes, not because he knew he was about to die, but rather because he knew they were right, and he resented them for it. “Would you like to do the honors Paradise?” Paradise smiled and for a brief second revealed a row of sharp teeth. Paradise slowly walked out into the hall and stood in front of Alexander. She stood, waiting for him to look up. Slowly he raised his head, and his eyes met Paradise’s gaze. At this point he was sobbing. “Please, please…don’t kill me . . . don’t. . .” “Welcome to Paradise.” With that Paradise thrust her hands into the air, and Alexander’s flesh began to rot and fall off. In roughly a minute there was nothing left of Alexander. He had been screaming the entire time. <br>
<br>
The prophecy had come true, and order had been restored to the Shrine of Bertoxxolous. It is rumored that Paradise still lives, deep underground. Around Qeynos she has become somewhat of an urban legend. Whenever someone is found murdered, or goes missing, it is blamed on her. It is said that late at night, in the aqueducts, if you listen very carefully, you can hear her giggling. But of coarse you don’t go to the aqueducts. Blood stains the walls. <br>
