BTW, humans being able to think and behave logically is what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.  It's not that humans as a whole don't behave logically, it's that some people choose not to behave logically or have flawed logic to begin with.  I think I know what you meant, but I'm not sure of your choise of wording.  I mean after all, if we didn't have logic then we wouldn't have any of the comforts we have today and we could never solve a problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usensupafly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SenSupafly</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/22/02 3:14:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bjornn different my A$$ he just jipped me</span><hr size=1> Only monkies win sh!t flinging contests.<br>

I'll try to keep them short.<br>
<br>
1.  Native north americans were not 'hunter-gatherers', as you stated (or stone-aged).  While my background is not cultural geography, I do know that agriculture was well developed in all native cultures south of the subarctic.  Corn, tomatoes and potatoes are fine examples of north american agriculture that was brought to Europe by colonialists.  The Incan's, prior to the wipeout of their civilization, had advanced systems of accounting and taxation.  Accurate records were maintained of all personal belongings, even the number of pairs of shoes in each household, through a system of strings knots.<br>
<br>
2.  At the time of the discovery of North America by the portugese / spanish, the population of North America exceeded that of europe.  However, genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism and lack of immunity to diseases which had been present in Europe for centuries, caused the population to destabilize.  However, most natives were killed by disease, not war or social darwinism.<br>
<br>
3.  Seek help.<br>

Agriculture was not &quot;well developed&quot; in North America outside the area controlled by the Aztecs (I confused the Aztecs, Incas and Mayans, so if I use the wrong one, I apologize. I believe th Aztecs were the only truly agrarian society in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> North</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> America.)<br>
<br>
What particular crops they may have grown is not as significant as the methods by which they grew them. A victory garden in my backyard does not suddenly make me the equivalent of a commercial farmer. I did say that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> vast majority</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were hunter-gatherers. Whereas the Europeans of the period had entered the industrial stage, the Americans had barely entered the agrarian stage, with the Aztecs, Incans and Mayans being the farthest developed. None of them ruled over even a major portion of the continents.<br>
<br>
At the time of the discovery of N. America, the Mayan, Incan and Aztec cultures were already beginning to decay. The suggestion that a few hundred or even a few thousand Conquistadors could destroy a civilization that, by your reckoning, must have numbered in the millions is absurd.<br>
As for predisposition to alcoholism and lack of disease resistance... hallucinagenic and other drugs had been available in the Americas long before alcohol made its way here. As for disease... a century before Columbus discovered the Americas (whether anyone else had previously discovered them is irrelevant; Columbus had never seen them before, so in this context it's adequate to say he &quot;discovered&quot; them,) western Europe was ravaged by the black death, bubonic and pneumonic plague. A disease not native to western Europe but brought there from the orient. There was virtually no sanitation, what medical treatment there was was most often worse than the cure. The disease killed 2/3s of the western European population... yet a century later they had rebounded, and were expanding. It's curious that the Americans, facing much the same situation (with a much smaller focus of infection, and a time period of isolation from further infection) would be so terribly ravaged simply because the diseases they encountered was alien to them. Later, it was a practice among some unscrupulous European-Amerians, to give blankets that had been used by smallpox sufferers to the then-native Americans, in an effort to spread disease and kill them. But that was centuries later.<br>
<br>
I suggest the cause of the alcoholism was cultural emasculation, so to speak. The apparent superiority of European culture (guns, steel weapons, etc) combined with the self-assurance and aggressiveness of most of the European invaders, in my opinion, caused the Americans to lose faith in themselves and their various cultures. Not all of them, and not suddenly, of course. Much the same would happen to the world if space aliens were to land tomorrow with ray guns and teleporter beams and what-have-you. We might survive better because we know that it's merely advanced science, but one cannot underestimate the effect of morale, for good or bad.<br>
Interesting that you should mention war as a cause of the death of Americans, because it's often overlooked that the various tribes of N. America did not play well together, to begin with. <br>
<br>
As for seeking help, alright, I'll call 911... what's your address, so I know where to send the ambulance?<br>

I'm going to paraphrase what you said cause they came from two different posts, and it's a pain in the butt to actually cut &amp; paste 'em.<br>
<br>
First, you complained about the commercials &quot;falsely claiming 1 out of 3 women experience domestic violence.&quot;  I'm not sure where you come up with &quot;falsely&quot;.  I also haven't seen the commercials.  But I come from an upper-middle-class white background.  The experience of people I know:<br>
<br>
1. My first wife had suffered domestic violence in a previous relationship<br>
<br>
2. My future wife also suffered domestic violence prior to knowing me.<br>
<br>
3. I have 3 sisters.  Two of them have been hit by their husbands.  (One since divorced.)<br>
<br>
I could go on...<br>
<br>
No, listing these doesn't prove anyone's statistics.  But domestic violence DOES happen.  And as long as people turn the other way about it, it will CONTINUE to happen.  Those commercials are an attempt to get people to:<br>
<br>
A. Realize there IS a problem.  ONE man hitting ONE wife is a problem.<br>
<br>
B. Disapprove of the problem.<br>
<br>
You are helping to perpetuate the problem when you try to deny the severity of the problem.  This is not a &quot;liberal&quot; versus &quot;conservative&quot; issue.  It's based on the basic principle that people shouldn't hurt the ones they love, and that women shouldn't get beat up by their husbands.<br>
<br>
Unless you think women SHOULD get beat up by their husbands, or that it's OKAY to hurt the ones you love, then I'd suggest you don't discount the attempts people make to fix this problem.<br>
<br>
Because it IS a problem.  Just because you don't personally see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.<br>
<br>
Is it one third?  You know, it may be, it may not be.  Does it matter what the real numbers are?  It happens a LOT more than it should (which is never).<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The other comment -- you complained that people say &quot;women can do anything men can do.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't believe they are saying &quot;women can do anything men can do, and do it as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
There ARE things men do better, on the average.  Men tend to be stronger and run faster.  Women can't play on the men's hockey team because they would get slaughtered.  Everyone knows this.<br>
<br>
The entire &quot;women can do anything men can do&quot; drive is based on centuries-old attitudes regarding women.  If you go back far enough in time, you'll find cultures where women were adored and honored.  Then get to western civilization certainly by 700 AD.  Women were little more than property.<br>
<br>
That attitude has NOT gone away.<br>
<br>
I don't know why the right wing is threatened by offering equal opportunity for women.  I don't know why anyone needs to look down on things like women hockey teams.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I'd also like to comment on the term &quot;politically correct.&quot;  This isn't directed at anyone in particular.<br>
<br>
Just because someone aggrees with the PC stance doesn't make the stance wrong.<br>
<br>
It's currently PC to think men shouldn't beat up women.  I learned this lesson when I was 4 years old -- I don't think PC has anything to do with whether it's right or not.<br>
<br>
When I state how I feel, it has little to do with what's PC.  My opinions are based on what *I* feel is correct, PC or otherwise.<br>
