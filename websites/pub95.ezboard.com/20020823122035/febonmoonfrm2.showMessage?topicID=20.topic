I found the Knights of Greenmist guild, and started my training. With all of the faded memories of past lives, the Knights seemed to call me. So, I went to them and began this new life.<br>My life was normal for a young broodling. Much hunting in the Field of Bone. The city outskirts of the Lake of Ill Omen also held some good prey for one of my kind. The Swamp of No Hope held no hope for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    . Warsliks Woods also held death for me.(<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I will be back to those woods, and ruin the lives of those who call it home.)<br>One day, while hunting outside the Ruins of Kaesora, a strange creature appeared before me. My innate senses told me I could not attack and win, but I did indeed attack it. It was a strange looking thing, and I, as a defender of Cabilis, was not about to let it ruin my lands. It had probably ruined it's own. That was why I thought it had come. (~shrug. Seemed reasonable at the time.)<br>Vines crawled from the ground, restraining me.<br>&quot;What do you do to me, beast?&quot; I asked the creature.<br>Giggling, he replied, &quot;Easy, young lizard. The roots will go away when you calm yourself.&quot;<br>I was surprised to find that this creature spoke the tongue of my people. This put me at ease... a little.<br>He (I found out it was a male) introduced himself as Faedaer Ryverwalker. Shadows of the Ebon Moon. Woodland Priest of Tunare.<br>I knew Tunare as an enemy, but something about this &quot;Wood&quot; elf intrigued me. (I think it's funny they call themselves wood. They have very soft skin. I checked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ).<br>This Faedaer explained many things to me. First, what a druid is. Nearest I can figure, is they're elven shamen. We spoke of the land of the humans. We spoke of the land of elves and dwarves. He told me of an icy land. He told me what little he knew of the moon, Luclin.<br>I found that the humans would hate the sight of me, and try to kill me. His brethren, the elves, and their neighbor dwarves would do the same. He told me of the dangerous lands of ice. The dwarves of... Thurgadin? who would tolerate my presence, but the lands surrounding their city were probably too dangerous for me to travel. He told me the races of the moon, as far as he knows, have nothing against Iksar either. Supposedly, their is a race of cat-men that call the moon their home. I'll believe this when I see it.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>Finally, he spoke of his &quot;Family&quot;. This &quot;Shadows of the Ebon Moon&quot;. He told me I could find a life amongst them. Quite a happy one. Surrounded by family, safer than the life that many Iksar travel. We are loners. I didn't like my fellow broodlings. I found them foolish, for the most part. I guess they will die and be reborn to other lives. If I see them in my life, I guess they will have gotten more serious.<br>The druid gave me some money. He said I was poorly outfitted, and I should at least get some armor. I found a smith who made me some banded armor. I wear it now. (I sure wish he'd given me more money. The armor took all I had, plus what he had given me.) He told me, if I wished, I could join this &quot;family&quot; of his. That was what I liked best of this creature of Tunare. Something told me I should join and fight for this &quot;Shadows&quot;. So I did. And I do.<br>Two things I want from this life. One...to bring honor to the Knights of Greenmist. Two...to bring honor to my adopted family.<br>I have traveled to the lands of the humans. (Strange places, these humans live in. Barren deserts, skirted by green lands). I have traveled to the lands of the elves. (This Faydark place is a corrupted version of Warsliks Woods. Much safer, though<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). I have been to icy Thurgadin. (I cannot describe this place. One would have to see it. It's cold. I can say that). Once, I visited the moon. (There are cat-men.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I saw one in the Nexus. I didn't travel beyond there.)<br>Among my new family, the human Sinsen, and his companion Fanima, have taken to me for some reason. I hunt with them. I hope to be strong enough one day to hunt with the rest of the family. For now, it is enough that I hold the family's honor. May I do it well...May my companions do so as well...<br><br>Dredmor<br>Knight of Greenmist<br>Knight of the Shadows <p></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> at: 2/9/02 6:40:22 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>2</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fanimawizzy/Dredgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Worshipper of Cazic-Thule</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 6/6/02 5:17:51 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I see you, scowling at me from a distance.<br>You are brave now...<br>I pull you to me, with spell or arrow<br>You come, ready for battle...<br>I slash, pierce, crush and bash you<br>You fight back, starting to feel it...<br>I start to drain your life, your strength<br>You feel it more strongly...<br>Your life is fading, I take it little by little<br>It comes...<br>Right before you run, I look into your eyes<br>I see the fear<br>The fear of death<br>The fear of pain<br>The fear of my Lord<br>I send you to Cazic-Thule<br>Feel his might as you have felt mine <p>Dredmor<BR>Knight of Greenmist<BR>Dark Knight of the Shadows<BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fanimawizzy/IthinkIlikeit.jpg></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> at: 7/1/02 6:17:27 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>23</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fanimawizzy/Dredgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   An adventure in the fiery hole of Solusek's Eye.(SolA)</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 7/1/02 6:20:06 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I was traveling in my home town of Cabilis when I was contacted by Frolikas about a trip into Solusek's Eye. After acquiring transport from a hobbit acquaintance to the West Commons, I met up with the group. It was myself, my brother Frolikas, a half-elven Paladin named Ameera, a woodland priestess named Alota, and a brother in darkness, the blue-skinned necromancer, Alail.<br>Searching through a pack of maps that Faedaer had given me, I asked Alail, the group's leader, where we should go. He stated that the bar room might be a good idea, so off we went. The way was clear to the window in the stairway, and we all ducked through and moved on. I went to see what was ahead of us, and we were besieged by 3 little red monsters -goblins. They packed quite a punch and they brought friends, but we dispatched them fairly easily. The trip to the bar room was very rough, but we made it. A single goblin had remained behind the bar when we had rested from the break-in. I went to get him, and we killed him with little difficulty.<br>We then proceeded to the room next to the bar. I looked in a closet, and all of the sudden we were fighting 3 goblins again. Not much trouble. I looked in another closet, and there was a drunken mage with an air pet. Seemed odd for a &quot;fire&quot; goblin to have an air pet, but he did. I attacked him and we found ourselves besieged once again. We managed to kill everything and rested up for another attack.<br>The goblins seemed to appear on a set pattern, but I was unable to figure out what it was. I attacked a wizard, and suddenly there were 5 or 6 goblins on us. We managed to kill one, and then Frolikas went down. The paladin followed shortly after. I swear, at this point if I'd been a warrior, I would've gone berserk, so I decided to play dead. Clinging to the last bit of health I had, the goblins fell for it (I must've had 4hp left, although I didn't look). Poor Jabaner, Alail's undead conscript, didn't have a chance. He did, however buy time for Alota to form a gate and get out. Alail was also able to play dead before Jabaner fell.<br>So, Alail, being full of health, made a run for the exit so he could buy coffins to summon Frolikas' and Ameera's corpses to a safer spot. Thankfully, he made it.<br><br>I found myself in a very bad predicament. An inferno goblin was patrolling right where I lay, so I couldn't sit and heal. After about 5 minutes, he brought a friend to help watch over me. Sure, they thought I was just a corpse like the others, but that wasn't healing me any faster.<br>Then I heard it. &quot;Died by LAVA....&quot; or whatever gibberish the goblins yell at the people they're attacking. I knew not who it was, just that it wasn't me.<br>I shouted, &quot;HELP! I'm by a drunken goblin. Please help if you can&quot;<br>Shortly after my cry for help, he appeared. A human Disciple. Never had a human looked so good to me. At that time, only an Iksar such as Vear would've made a better sight. I recognized him as a monk, due to his very light gear. Ahhhh, the joy of watching a monk destroy creatures that are so far beneath them. He did not let me down. He tore through the goblins like they were melons. Crushed bones and blood spattered everywhere. When all was dead in the room, I stood up. He then bandaged me in the most amazing way. With the use of 4 bandages, he healed me better than I ever could've done with even 20. I gawked in amazement. <br>Gathering my thoughts, I thanked him heartily, gathered shadows about me and made a run for the exit. Just as I got there, Alail appeared, and started summoning the corpses of our fallen comrades. I stood guard over Frolikas while he performed resurrections.<br>Quite the adventure. I'll never forget it. I can't wait to try that camp again.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Dredmor<BR>Knight of Greenmist<BR>Dark Knight of the Shadows<BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fanimawizzy/IthinkIlikeit.jpg></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> at: 7/1/02 6:59:41 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>29</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udredmorvazknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dredmor Vazknight</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fanimawizzy/Dredgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: I tire of humans</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 7/3/02 3:22:33 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I spent a couple of days (game time) in the commons trying to slaughter enough orcs so that the humans might like me. They still won't sell to me, and that bothers me. While checking a merchant, I noticed this fool Guard Tolus glowering at me. So, I asked him what his problem was. He made the usual Iksar slurs that the inferior races are so fond of.<br>So I killed him. He fell quickly and easily. I wondered when searching his things what kind of Militia pays their soldiers so little. They equip them with rusty weapons as well. Must be why they get soldiers the caliber of Guard Tolus and not the fine Iksar Legionnaires and Crusaders of my home.<br>Anyhow, word spread fast, apparently, that I had killed the fool, Tolus. Now the militia-men were glaring at me. One little death, with no one around to see and suddenly they're threatening my life. How do they know I did it? I did, but how do they know?<br>Anyway, I tire of these humans. So, I went to the commons, and with the help of Anucrabriem, we slaughtered the fools for days. (again game time) Now when I see them, they scowl at me. I scowl back, and if I think I can kill them, I will.<br>Pitiful fools. They know not who they are dealing with when they put their lives against a Crusader of Greenmist. The Freeport Militia has me and Anucrabriem on their most wanted list.
