<br>
I keep reading about people wanting a few days a week to be FFA in the planes and let the rest be scheduled.<br>
<br>
What I think people are missing is that the guilds that want FFA (for the most part) are those who are after Epic Mobs.  Therefore, unless you schedule a FFA day on days when the Epics are always up, you aren't really accomplishing anything by making those days FFA. (was that convoluted enough?)<br>
<br>
I don't care about any loot from the planes other than parts needed for Epic Mobs.  Leaving those mobs up just because someone else has the plane scheduled 12 hours later just extends the spawn time on these things.  The faster they go down, the faster they respawn...meaning more spawn over a month versus waiting several hours (sometimes days) for them to be killed and to respawn.<br>
<br>
Schedule plane clearings for loot all you desire, but I do not consider the schedule to cover epic mobs. <p><center><img src="http://www.legendsoftherealm.com/legends/images/RoshaSig3.gif"><br>Innoruuk<br><a href="http://www.legendsoftherealm.com/legends/">www.legendsoftherealm.com</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ularelsolostaran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Larel Solostaran</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#778899>(10/3/01 11:22:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.netcom.com/~atlarian/Dragon/lance24.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I must be missing the point</span><hr size=1> Well considering the proposed FFA/FiF days are on the common patch days,  this makes it on the days most likely for the Epic mobs and such to be up. <p>Larel Solostaran<BR>

  Actually many of your planar epic-type mobs are on a random timer (24-72 hours) AFTER the server is re-set.  Thus having FFA on patch days would not increase the likelihood of encountering the mobs needed for certain epic pieces.  <br>
<br>
However, such a policy would indeed allow more access to &quot;uber-mobs&quot; such as Cazic Thule and Dracholich.<br>

After you kill one, that spot is on a 72hr or so timer.  After the timer expires, any miniboss can spawn granted it is not already up.  If you are clearing while mobs respawn, there is a chance you could kill the same miniboss 2 or 3 times in one raid.  So actually it would increase the chance since the timer would be recycling faster if it is killed the second it spawns.<br>
<br>
The problem with FFA is that more then likely when you go up there won't be mobs up, or if there are mobs up there will be fair and they will be random.  People seem to have it in their minds that if we go FFA more mobs will be up when they port up more often.  When in reality, it will be just the opposite.  Instead of non stop pulls of static spawns, you'll have non stop roamers and few static spawns(with armor or epic pieces) to kill.  FFA also means that any person can go in and solo if they want to and claim loots.  If they want to solo next to your group, they can, you can't even complain because it comes with the policy.<br>
<br>
The FiF idea has the same problems.  Mobs are not likely to be up, and still anyone can come in if they want.  FiF would be just another summit just not so formal.  FiF would be asking others to stay away if you're already there, but you can't force them to.  If they have 50 people that want to port up and clear 3/4 of the zone in the time you're clearing 1/4, they can and you can't do anything about it.<br>
<br>
You can say hey lets petition a gm for PnP.  All the gm will do, if anything, will make the two(3? 4? 5?) groups of different people random for the zone.  You could be the group thats been there all day, or the group thats been there 5min and win or lose..and thats that.  Or the GM could just say its a zone like any other, whoever attacks it first gets dibs.  Won't that be fun?<br>
<br>
Fact is, nothing will solve all the problems.  And any resolutions brought to the table will always have its problems.  The summit was created because 2 years ago more and more guilds were forming and people were going to the plane to find someone else already there, or no mobs up at all.  The summit was created to solve the problems brought about by the exact issues everyone is proposing (FFA, FiF).  Those problems were bad 2 years ago when there were 10, maybe 15 planar guilds.  Now there are so many planar capable guilds I wouldn't want to even try to list them.  FFA, and FiF will only be a bigger problem then it was before. <p>Topo!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/urosha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rosha</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 347<br> <font color=#778899>(10/3/01 12:48:29 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I must be missing the point</span><hr size=1> You all keep making it sound like guilds that want FFA will be clearing the whole plane all the time.

We will all just ignore the fact that you want  your Staff of Elemental Mastery Earth, Arent in a guild, and if it werent for the summit and the ability to get people to come to &quot;your&quot; raid because you &quot;booked&quot; the planes, you would never get a shot at it.<br>
<br>
Having a booking system gives YOU an advantage because you can put in a &quot;PUBLIC&quot; raid, and then get people to sign up to give YOU your epic loot because the planes are officially &quot;YOURS&quot; for a day. <br>
<br>
Which makes &quot;YOUR BOOKING&quot; the valuable part that you trade for the looting rights. You say the rest of us are greedy.. maybe so, but you have to admit that you are arguing for a system that gives you some more leverage. Your own self interest  keeps you on the side of the summit.<br>
<br>
FFA or FIF being a bigger problem? Yes, for some. No for others. It would be a shift in power, and a shift in power is always opposed by those it would be shifting away from, and welcomed by those it would be shifting to. <br>
<br>
I for one would just be glad if it was changed to be a fair shot for all those that could take it. Instead of a easy mark for those that want to break the rules and take it anyway. <br>
<br>
See past YOUR own self interest topo. YES this would cause you to loose the ability to setup a raid for your personal benefit. But since you are gonna be poached anyhow, what good does that raid do ya.<br>

Well, okay, let's get personal in an EQ sense.  I firmly support the Summit.  I understand the problem with epics, and I want a new Summit to address the problems of higher levels who have to go backwards to go forward.  I believe in at least trying FFA for several days a week, preferrably on the usual patch days.<br>
<br>
I do not want my epics.  I will not ever do my epics.<br>
I refuse my epics, because it turns some folks into Loot Mutants and Arseholes.  Stick your &quot;epics&quot;, Verant.  I lead mixed raids into POH/POF to show folks the beginnings of the organization and cooperation required to do bigger things in Norrath.  The Summit allows them to learn, and do it for one night without having to deal with every moron and kewl dood jackarse they have to deal with all week in EQ.  My guild does ALL loot, including epics, by random rolls, guests included.  We only reserve sellables for the guild to pay for peridots, hatestones, which we provide for all our guests.  We have freely invited those from ANY guild to get an extra shot at their epic pieces, a crap shoot with others who need them.  There are NO pre-arranged drops for ANYone, including RR's.  We have raids totally open to any who wish to post on our public forum.  ANYone is welcome to join our raids.<br>
<br>
I try to be fair, but I see an extremely small group of very vocal advocates of FFA.  I don't see them speaking for anyone other than themselves.  And, frankly, when you sift thru the rhetoric and manure, it smells of &quot;WE WANT IT, WE WANT IT NOW, AND DON'T CARE WHO WE SHAFT TO GET IT!&quot;<br>

Please feel free to attempt to ferret out my hidden agenda.<br>

<br>
Raidmaster - Sure I want my staff, doesn't every mage on the server?  I also want planar armor for my characters, doesn't everyone want to improve their equipment? Ok than.<br>
<br>
Yea I do public raids because for the most part I'm against the entire idea of guilds, at least in the way they are used in EQ.  90% of guilds are just together on the idea of getting items, I'm not joining a name just to get items.  I'll join a guild only when I'm friends with every single person in the guild and loot is absolutely 0 of concern.  If there is one greedy person in the guild, I won't be a part of it.  Hence the reason I've only been apart of 2 real guilds.  First one I left because of stress, second one I was kicked because I strongly disagreed with the ways things were being led and how it seemed I needed to kiss ass to get things and help.  I'm guessing you weren't playing back when guilds actually meant something, besides loot?  Back when guilds didn't &quot;recruit classes&quot; just so they could go get more loot.  Guilds were meant to be groups of friends to exchange information and to help communication, not to just simply organize loot hunts.<br>
<br>
Regardless of my guildstatus, my public raids have nothing to do with it.  I go on other guilds guild raids too, and I sure as hell wouldn't want to skip class to go on their raid and then get there to find no mobs to kill.  Gosh I just wasted my time.  Sure we could do something else, but that wasn't what was planned.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You say the rest of us are greedy..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I did? I don't believe I did.  In fact, I think scheduling raids is about as ungreedy as it gets.  Wanting to go at any given time and not wanting to respect others time is greedy.<br>
<br>
This &quot;shift of power&quot; as you put it would obviously be benefiting you since you are so for it.  I could careless where it goes, I rarely even play anymore.  However, I have played long enough and met enough people in the game to know what I'm talking about.  FFA would create more problems for the majority of the people.  How many guilds out there really could just log on at 4pm and go clear a plane?  Very few.  In fact, not many out there have 24+ planar level people on every single day of the week.  I'm guessing your from the defiant mr general sir?<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I for one would just be glad if it was changed to be a fair shot for all those that could take it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hrmm, again that fair shot is just gonna go to the few guilds that have a lot of high lvls online at any given time.  I guess all the guilds out there better start mass recruiting if they want to go to planes from now on.<br>

Also, said this before, but 90% or some high percentage of the parts of epics are outside the planes.  So epic items within the planes shouldn't even be an issue.

<br>
Unfortunately they're not, so to get them you often have no choice but to clear the rest of the zone.<br>
<br>
If you don't need those armor drops, then they rot... Armor drops that the next smaller guild might be drooling over.<br>
<br>
Now, Amici as guild needs practically nothing from the Planes for our main characters aside from a handful of epic mobs. Our twinks might wear the armor for a bit, but that's about it. It would be very easy to jump on the FFA bandwagon here because it would probably be of more benefit to us personally than a Summit. We could get a force together on quick notice and get up there for epic mobs.<br>
<br>
However, one of the things we in Amici value most about this server and this game is the sense of Community. We'd much rather see a community working together and helping each other out than a selfish bunch of loot whores running over each other the first chance they get. But, hey, maybe that's just us.<br>
<br>
In summary, unless you can point out a legitimate way to gank epic mobs in the Planes without taking out most of the regular mobs, we fully support a Summit existing. Although we'd be willing to try a few days a week FFA to see how it goes. <p><center><img src="http://www.fnurt.net/~buckethead/lhilesig.jpg" align=middle></center>

hehe you people STILL DO NOT GET IT.<br>
<br>
The summit is dead.<br>
<br>
Go ahead.  Meet and discuss the summit.  While you are all doing that the 3 or 4 guilds who want FFA will be killing all your mobs.<br>
<br>

<br>
FFA and FiF will result in a few things.<br>
<br>
Large guilds will be able to dominate the planes for extended periods of times.  They will clear quickly and sit a group or two of alts on a 2nd CPU and pop respawn until epic mobs or minbosses pop.  At this point, they will be able to mobilize a large force quickly and kill them.<br>
<br>
Large guilds have no use for the armor drops.  They ALL admit that they have no need for the armor.  How much armor will rot that would normally go to someone who needs it? <br>
<br>
Now we already see how large guilds treat smaller guilds regarding non-planar epic mobs.   They run them over.  FFA and FiF will create even more havok as the large guilds claw each others throats out over planar mobs.  <br>
<br>
The issues of NK and NA guilds running over everyone or popping in before you and taking mobs cannot be dealt with by a summit.  Those guilds just suck.  Plain and simple, they are asian/european guilds that have shown they are self sufficient and do not need to support the community or support of the community.  My only hope is that the server is split and the trash leaves.<br>

No, Beamish is a more accomplished writer than RMG.<br>
<br>
Sorry, no, the Summit isn't dead.  We just lack some commands.  I suggest we ask Verant for these:<br>
<br>
/inflated ego off<br>
/greed off<br>
/loot less important than people on<br>
<br>
The future of a Summit is uncertain.  And people just like you will continue to try and abolish it.  Not a lot different than those who openly break it.  Except maybe you DO fear the &quot;loot mutant&quot; tag a community can hang on you.  So full of your own self proclaimed superiority, you no longer need to be mere humans.   And, if we finally see the &quot;honor and respect in FFA&quot; you all so doggedly insist will occur, I have a feeling we will all need a large &quot;arsehole&quot; list.<br>
