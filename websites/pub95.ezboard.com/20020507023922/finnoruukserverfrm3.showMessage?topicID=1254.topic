<br>
Let's say for example that someone has been farming Hadden for over two weeks. Based on his spawn rate, he's definitely dropped plenty of earrings, so I think that puts this activity clearly into the farming category. If said farmer has no desire to give up his camp, is there anything one can do?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

And, there has been farming of the likely suspects for as long as I've been in Norrath, i.e. things like Hadden and Phin.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the few times I've ever been tossed into the situation, talking to the &quot;farmer&quot; has always worked out well.  If you think about it, what's just one spawn to them?  I remember a person who was owning the old oracle robe, who not only said &quot;Sure, take him down&quot;, but also helped the folks trying it.  A little communication never hurt anyone.<br>
<br>
Yup, there is a fishing pole in Siren's Grotto that gives EB, AND adds 3%(?)  to your fishing skill. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

PnP is frowned at mostly, but there comes a time..........  <br>
<br>
If you go day after day and try to camp your desired mob only to find the same guy there farming it, I think it's time to call in the PNP rule unless he's willing to share on his own.  There is such thing as camping a mob for a rare drop, but farming day after day and refusing to share is wrong.  <br>
<br>
Just make sure that you've given him the time he needs and you've tried to talk sense into him before you petition and call PNP.  Who knows if he's going after a rare drop and he hasn't gotten it yet maybe he'll even just give you the item you need to get rid of you.  Not familiar with this mob so don't know the deal. <p>Lewes Therin Telamon<br>

You can simply insist that he share.  If he won't agree, then you have to /petition.<br>
<br>
However.<br>
<br>
This will make it a tad difficult for you, over the long run, if you get a rep for it.  The only time I ever PnP, is to teach some twit who PnPs what it really means.  ie, some bozo decides to skip 3 spots up the AC list and grab the camp, insisting on sharing.  I brought 22 people in to help share.  This was annoying.  Earring farmerbrown may be equipping his entire guild for a kedge raid...must the entire guild show up and sit there?<br>
<br>
I must admit to being rather doubtful.  This person is sitting at the Hadden spawn 24 hours a day?  I rather doubt it.  My guess is that he/she and you have the same play times.  So vary yours.  Set an alarm and get up at his spawn time, middle of the night...and have your char sitting there waiting already, so that it is clear you are campig the spawn.  Risky, this. <p>"You're only young once, but if you do it right, once is enough."<BR>

How you may ask?  Well in my opinion when a friend (b) comes to releive the first farmer (a) and farmer (a) stays logged on or even logs off and then when they log back on releives farmer (b) and continually repeating this cycle after many kills and loots.<br>
<br>
I would interact with the person and possibly camp with them...  dont KS but show you are willing to wait and not leave.  Maybe even have friends sit with you.  Annoyance would drive them away as well as the pressure of having you there.  If all else fails Pnp and /petition do work but can make you look bad.<br>

<br>
As for them being there constantly, being self-employed I sometimes play during the day, sometimes at 4 in the morning, so it's not because we have the same hours. Also, when the server has gone down, whether planned or not, as soon as I am able to log back in they are already there, so it's definitely attended.<br>
<br>
I've gone so far as to create a character who sits nearby. Every time I login to play and every time following a server outage, I check to make sure they're still there.<br>
<br>
I hate to enforce PnP. The only times I've ever petitioned when playing, were back in the zoning bug days where you would fall through the world for 10k damage and lose your corpse.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll be able to convince some of the folks I know to help me do the EB necklace quest. Seems like less of a pain.<br>
<br>

1) this is the nicer route which Chubbies would NOT do: envoke PnP (play nice Policy) and petition before that so the GM will get there after hes done handing out BJs to the people on the legends server.

<br>
OR <br>
<br>
2) THIS IS WHAT CHUBBIES WOULD DO: you can say &quot;Hey you you have been here forever dude I pay just as much money as you. Time for you to take a hike&quot; he will say with 100% certinty &quot; @#%$ you &quot; This is where you open up a can-0-whupass and kick his @#%$ !! Say &quot;Hey you stupid @#%$ im gonna kick your @#%$ and then im gonna kick you in the @#%$ and when your mommy comes home from the &quot;I have a weenie son who cant share camps in EQ cuz he too much of a @#%$ @#%$ @#%$&quot; class for parenting skills she wont even be able to recongize him by dental records or his &quot;Last save&quot; and to finish it off find any wepon that drops - turn it side ways - and stick it up his candy @#%$&quot;<br>
