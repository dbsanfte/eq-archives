My group of men that followed me up the hill was okay but was noticeably smaller. We had a small diamond shaped formation around trondle. <br>
<br>
&quot; I want the Second light infantry in flanking position in  two minutes , Toramok wheres my damn axe you friggin pansy &quot;. Gurgled trondle.<br>
<br>
&quot; Geez he's gone &quot; I murmured . &quot; hey guys get over here &quot;. My group came to where I had told them and we tried to comfort trondle.<br>
<br>
A flash of recognition came back to the Old warrior. <br>
&quot; Hey , your guhawwwkkkchh * spitting * , your tumpy , nice moves kido , tell my family I love them very much and I'll protect them all , except for furtog the stupid s***  hahaha hack heck hegghh. Your all my boys now make me proud.&quot; Trondle cried in his last moment. <br>
<br>
Some wept others didn't , I wailed <br>
<br>
Lets make dad proud someone said. &quot; FOR Father &quot; * Kinda odd but you'd shout it if your were there *. I took my hand axes back into my hands and ran , it didn't matter were I went just so long as I killed a ogre.<br>
<br>
I found one a mudtoe with a bastard sword , he swiped low and I jumped over it. In midflight I decided I'b bite him because my axe hafts were splintering. When I landed on his belly I scrambled up and bit the ogre in the neck and tried furiously to rip off both his eyelids. The ogre was far from done and hit me hard with a gauntleted fist. I flew ten feet into a corpse , a dwarf one and from there I saw. I tried to stand but my ribs were shattered and brought me great pain. I tried to rest but a shadow came over me. <br>
<br>
It was a monster of an ogre and it had a sword coming at me full swing * this is it , at least they'll sing songs of us , maybe even me * I felt the sword cut and pull stomach open. Nothing came to my lips but peace. I looked to the ogre and watched its death as Vash and Somli used a giant ogre spear to topple the ogre and cut the arteries in the neck. For a moment Vash and Somli stood triumphant , but a whur came from out of my fading sight and hit somli in the left knee totally shattering his leg. <br>
<br>
I knew we were all goners when I didn't hear any more dwarves screaming. Then the last ogre I saw came and it killed vash away and prepared to squish my head like an overripe fruit. I didn't seem to care * ohh s*** here it comes I thought* . Then peace eternal peace. I saw Horin bye a table drinking with legends , dwarves elves humans and big humans even little gnomes. When the saw me they ushered me away and I fell forever it seemed.<br>
<br>
&quot; I think he's waking &quot; whispered a deep barotone voice<br>
&quot; yeah right Somli &quot;<br>
&quot; I'd pull that out of his nose Bero &quot; someone said matter-of-factly.'<br>
&quot; Well I aint you and you ain't me&quot;<br>
&quot; His eye &quot; said someone excitedly * must be sagnus *.<br>
I opened my eyes and saw beros beard dangling over my face and he was doing something to my nose.<br>
* what a surprise hehehe *<br>
I grabbed the beard and yanked down hard on the beard and gave the face above it a right cross once or twice.<br>
<br>
&quot; Offhh ouch &quot; cried a voice * definetly Bero *<br>
&quot; hehehehe told you not to play with his nose hair you halflings armpit &quot; bellowed somli.<br>
&quot; He's awake &quot; said Sagnus and vash together.<br>
<br>
&quot; Whats going on , where am I and whose next you troll loving wine drinking fair haired pansy asses &quot; I shouted with good cheer.<br>
<br>
After my reunion with my squad I learned that we were all that was left . Out of the brigade only six hundred remained out of nearly 9,000 bright brave courageuos drunk foolhardy and married dwarves.<br>
<br>
&quot; Thats over a ninety percent casualty rate&quot;  Sagnus said solemnly.<br>
<br>
Everything was quite for a moment but then something unimaginable happened. Vash smiled and handed me a flagon of dwarven ale.<br>
<br>
&quot; We got a parade to get in , and word has it were getting promoted tenfold!!!&quot; said vash to me.<br>
<br>
I don't remember anything after that but I do remember waking on a carriage of sorts in front of at least the whole dwarven kingdom. I paraded waved * and secretly drank too * until we came to the palace.<br>
<br>
&quot; You there &quot; cried a booming voice. EVerything stopped. <br>
Come here it cried . I turned my had and holy happy sheep turds it was King Kazon Stormhammer in full Battle Uniform. When I look upon myself I was In clerical robes * Good dear Gods I look like a baby *. <br>
<br>
&quot; You lead the charge up that hill boy?&quot; questioned the intimidating dwarf <br>
<br>
&quot; Sir Yes Sir &quot; <br>
&quot; Cut the Crap , you and your squad are heros boy , And your all getting your own commands and the Light of brell * What the light of Brell!!!!!! * ( the light of brell is harder to achieve then the medal of Honor and has been given out less then thirty times over the span of a milenia )<br>
<br>
&quot; You Saved the Dwarven Kingdom boy , I suppose I should say Captain now . And Your Friends as well &quot; said the King in a trifle more Jolly Mood.<br>
<br>
&quot; Sire where are they if I may ask???&quot; <br>
&quot; The Brig for Supreme Drunkeness , Brawling , use of a good mug in a fight . Wipe that Look of your face its only for a week that the'll be in there. &quot;<br>

I hope I ask not to much?&quot; I said trying to act dignified.<br>
<br>
&quot; Alright your squad is pardoned but I want all of the survivors to meet in my castle for a debriefing. You'll get your time with your families tomorrow , but we need to discuss military matters and such &quot; replied the king commandingly.&quot; ohh also your having a tavern built in your honor , we heard you were especially brave Captain irontoe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Sir It will not be named after me&quot; I stammered<br>
&quot; What , you dare refuse a honor your own king would bestow upon you??? &quot; said the Startled king.<br>
&quot; Yes sir because the honour is not mine to be given to entirely , over 8500 other dwarves died defending this places and they made a much bigger sacrifice than I , lets call the place some with irontoe in it , after the uni... family that fought and died.&quot; I said boldly<br>
<br>
&quot; I like you &quot; said the king.<br>
<br>
After the parade I collapsed , I talked back to the King , the King , If getting in a lot of fights makes you seem weird then battle totally changes you.<br>
<br>
That night dwarves and a few elves met at the council called by king kazon. I recognized a few elves but almost none of the dwarves other than my own squad.<br>
<br>
&quot; First tonite we annouce new weapons &quot; Bellowed the king. &quot; We cannot always ask for the help of our elvish allies so I had a few gnomes create this!&quot;. The thing had a handle and a sort of mini bow placed horizontally on it.<br>
&quot; This is a crossbow , it can punch through most armors easy enough , now imagine at two rows of dwarves armed with these weapons behind a shield big enough to cover their whole body , now imagine a cavalry attack head on and our dwarves don't have pikes. Well they fire and the next row comes up and fires , now either rider or horse is killed or seriously wounded and the charge is broken , any questions???&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Next we are going to raise a 12,000 man army to attack the ogres, I know that the elves will give us their help with at least a few thousand bows which will make this force potent. I've also learned that their are mercenary bands of humans with horses that sell their services , we can hire them and then we have the primary three ground attack types.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was quickly getting bored and wanted to train my troops but I figured I probably didn't have any yet.<br>
<br>
we talked long into the night we discussed the ogre stratedgy which was goblin like in that they surprised and overwhlemed , they didn't use much for tactics.We also recieved our awards with much ceremony in front of a three course meal which was torture because I couldn't remember eating since the battle ( was healed during battle and remained unconscious btw ).<br>
<br>
&quot; Wish they'd hurry and give us the damn medal &quot; Somli tried to whisper.<br>
<br>
&quot; Whats was that Captain Somli ? &quot; asked the King<br>
I said &quot; He said He wished the ogres 'd hurry  up and fall on our damn metal , it would've made things easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Wheres the fun in that &quot; said the king sarcastically ( I think ) ( I swear the King and Trondle are related ).<br>
