<br>
The police have come up with a timeline and they believe that she was killed somewhere along Silver Strand state beach.  The clue that set them off is that Mr. Westerfield (the prime suspect) had paid the park fee to camp his trailer there stating he'd only be there for two days.  He overpaid... he had paid for four days.  So the park rangers had knocked on his camper door to return his money, and Westerfield had responded to their presence in a startled, somewhat paranoid fashion, and hurriedly left the park without staying his full due.<br>
<br>
They believe that Danielle was kidnapped for sexual purposes, due to the large amount of child pornography they found in Westerfield's home (on his computer).  Two days before her disappearance, Danielle had sold him Girl Scout cookies.<br>

<br>
I've heard a few things, and I'm not entirely sure that they're right, but it does cast a shadow of suspicion on more than just the neighbor.  I'm seriously thinking it's something like Jean Benet happening here.<br>
<br>
From what I've heard, Danielle's parents were members of a wife swapping club, and either the day before, or the day of, the kidnapping, her mom was seen with the neighbor-man in a bar (just the two of them).  Not that wife-swapping people are inherently bad, but it's just a little something that makes me think not all is as it appears :| <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/28/02 5:58:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Help find a missing girl</span><hr size=1> Something else I find of interest in this thread.  So much condemnation for this &quot;person&quot; (though I hate to put him in the same species as myself), yet I hear no condemnation about all of the Child Porno he had.  It sucks for this little girl and her family, but think about the children potentially still living in abuse who'se pictures and such put these ideas in this guys head.  I don't see that in the news stories either.  They may mention it, but I don't hear any uproar.  Oh I forgot, the Liberals control the Mass Media and this would infringe upon someone's rights wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
The only reason I will say that I hope that this was the little girl that they found is that at least we can know that she is no longer suffering.  There are things worse then death.  <br>
<br>
We live in a society where sex and violence is used to sell things like cars, and is pervasive in our entertainment.  And then we get upset because some people decide to take things even further then is &quot;socially&quot; acceptable (which is already a pretty @#$@$@ up low standard).  I'm in no way for a repressive religious or militaristic government crackdown.  But we reap what we sow as a society.  Which unfortunately means those of us who aren't $%^#-ups  but believe in laissez-faire end up with dirtbags like this.<br>
<br>
I hope you and your community can learn to feel somewhat safe again Jeisse, it would sure be nice if we had never had to have this thread or any like it : ( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/28/02 7:29:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Help find a missing girl</span><hr size=1> Along with what you said Ugle, I'm worried that this guy is being hung before his day in court.  I'm also wondering if he will be found guilty mostly because of the child porn they found.  Now I'm not saying that child porn is good, I believe it's sick as heck and I also have a young daughter and son so don't believe I wouldn't like to get my hands on people who abuse and hurt children.  I also believe that the chances are good that this guy is involved in the killing or did it himself, but I'm not going to hang him until the trial is over and he has been found guilty.  As Tabbran said, there could also be other things involved.  Could it involve how they may have been &quot;swinging&quot; in a locked garage for most the night?  What happened to their home security that they had installed?  There are still many things that we don't know.  Once again, the link that gives some look at another possible part of the story is:<br>

Danielle's parents did participate in swing parties, and were said to be having one at the time that she was abducted (and that's why they didn't notice that she was taken from the house).  There are theories that suggest that Westerfield was jealous that he was never invited along to these parties, so this was one of the ways he lashed out.  Theories also exist that the parents were involved.  I don't ever fully trust what I hear on the news, because the media are biased and they will report only what they want to report.<br>
<br>
One of the kids who works at the local supermarket said that Mrs. van Dam and Mr. Westerfield have hung out before and were on friendly terms.  So there's a lot of really strange &quot;what if's&quot; in this case.  The only solid incriminating evidence against Westerfield right now are the traces of blood they found on his camper cushions and on the jacket he wore the weekend of her disappearance.<br>
<br>
And yes Ugle, child porn is a disgusting fact of life and has taken on even more popularity due to the medium known as the Internet.  Sadly, I don't think it can be stopped.  I agree with your statement though, that there are more people to blame in this tragic event.<br>
<br>
There were pink and purple balloons being hung in shopping centers in my neck of the woods here in San Diego.  Those were Danielle's favorite colors.  The weather was sunny, warm and beautiful... but despite how perfect of a day it seemed, there's one family here that didn't get to enjoy today.. and they will be going to bed knowing for sure that they will never be able to tuck their daughter in at night again.<br>

I hope the justice system doesnt fail us on this one and that if he is guilty he gets his full dues and if not they find and punish the one/s responsible.<br>
<br>
Truth of the matter however is that &quot;we&quot; are never safe anywhere.  There is no neighborhood, city or town anywhere that isnt subject to these events.  We live in in a world where we all believe &quot;It cant happen to me&quot;, but more than often it does, and then we lash out and get mad at society, government etc.  We should all ALWAYS be aware of whats going on around us, take every precaution in every situation and still then pray and hope that it wont happen to us.<br>

Amazing! <br>
I am the mother of 4 children....... Who ever it would be that would even have sick thoughts toward children deserve to be neutered and left dangling for the alligators to feast upon!<br>
<br>
Regardless of what the parents were doin it is still a tragic thought of what that child was goin through...... <br>
<br>
could it be that when Westerfeild showed up she left willingly with him..... Someone she trusted<br>
<br>
Was the mother in on it...... I check on my kids sometimes 3 times throughout the nite.....Dont know about the rest of you....<br>
<br>
So many questions and most will prolly go unanswered......<br>
Hopefully our Judicial system will not just hang this one man for something that multiple ppl could be involved in....<br>
I for one have faith in our system but I do know that there are alot of ppl in Jail and on death row for something they didnt do or something that others should have joined that person in jail for.....<br>
<br>
<br>
This day and age anything is possible and nothing would surprise me....<br>

Long live the day that the world is free from sick ppl and children can frolic in the yards with no worries! <p>Palidinaya
