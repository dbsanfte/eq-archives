<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
FACT:<br>
<br>
Nanana (retired according to my knowledge) from Patronas Veritas guild had MoM &quot;run over&quot; her not once but 3 times for Ragefire in Sol B. The 3rd time a GM was called in and the outcome was MoM getting the spawn only due to the sheer frustration felt by Nanana resulting in her leaving the lair.<br>
Before she left, MoM members &quot;graciously&quot; in the presence of the GM told Nanana they would help her &quot;camp and take down: the next spawning of him. <br>
This promise never came to pass.<br>
<br>
FACT:<br>
<br>
MoM &quot;ran over&quot; myself for Ragefire not once but twice in Sol B in the following two cycles of spawn.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ONLY way Nanana and I achieved our epic kills of Ragefire at that time was for us to &quot;camp&quot; his spawn at the same time. She worked during the day and I stayed there during the day. She would log on and I would camp out for sleep till it was time for her to go to work. <br>
<br>
I do not recall seeing any MoM tags there helping during that time as was promised to Nanana. With the help of many, many friends and guildmates over the course of those 8 - 9 days straight, we both on the final night went to TD oasis and turned in the items at the same time for our epics.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
These are not facts they are misunderstandings or flat out lies. Any cleric epic that came out of SolB for MoM involved camps that were a minimum of 40 hours up to a maximum of 72 hours. At any given point in those camps, SOMEONE would have been aware of your presence. We had great fun in those long weekend camps. We would take shifts maintaining the spawn of giants, play trivia games, send a secondary party to Efreeti room, and scare up wicked pulls to run them to Naggy's lair. You could not have possibly been &quot;run over&quot; as you so claim in the killing of Ragefire that resulted in an epic for ANY MoM cleric. They have all involved entire weekends of our time waiting and waiting...<br>
<br>
The one and only epic that Braanor recalls us being lucky enough to not have to camp involves just that...good luck. Angelika, there is NO WAY you will convince me that any MoM member ran over you if you were actually getting geared up to take out Ragefire. And by getting geared up I don't mean, your monk twink Fd in Naggy's lair phoning all your friends to hurry up and log in. If there was a respectable amount of people actually doing the RF circuit, we would bug out and wait for a typical weekend RF camp. There has NEVER been GM involvement in the epic of our cleric as far as the quest is concerned. We were in fact petitioned for making monster trains to the lair from Efreeti or bats/bugs but that is all. Nothing else worth remembering.<br>
<br>
I believe you have your guilds mixed up. It wasn't us. I'm sure of it. We have been run over by other guilds in camps that we hoped to get something out of and know the disappointment involved when you aren't the one on the lucky end. It is for that very reason that MoM makes it a policy not to allow such behavior. I am an officer of MoM, a very vocal one at that. I have been in this guild since it's inception and an officer since the very early days. If an individual were to be involved in such activities, I assure you they would not be a member of MoM for much longer. I would personally see to it. I don't stand for behavior of that sort. Most people (if not everyone in the guild) know it.<br>
<br>
Sylly,<br>
<br>
You are not a person who has helped MoM get epics, so come down off your pedestal. You many have helped individual members get epics who eventually joined MoM, but that does not give you the right to claim that MoM screwed you over after &quot;supposedly&quot; being such a big to us in the past. State actual facts. Do not twist things to suit your arguments. It has been brought to my attention that you &quot;might&quot; have been in attendance at one of the Faydedar killings for one of our druids. One does not = &quot;them&quot; as stated in your post. You are no &quot;friend of MoM&quot; that I am aware of. Meadbh is, Brett is, Belarios is, and a slew of other people who would take me too long to mention. &quot;Friends of MoM&quot; are people we know well who actually encounter us more than one time. Being around once makes you present. Being &quot;friends&quot; involves more than one encounter.<br>
<br>
I was actually recommending that MoM members stop responding to this thread since there is very little fact being spouted. That was before I came here and read what was actually being said.  <p>--Otoole Frostypants, tradeskill junkie.

<br>
You, sir, are a liar and a hypocrite. I was helping Nanana camp Ragefire at the time. She had a group of five or more down there at all times keeping fire giants clear, watching the lair, etc.<br>
<br>
It was Methods of Madness who had a dual comped mid-level-30's monk twink feigned in the lair, coming in, feigning for an hour, logging out, etc. over and over again. It was YOU who performed the actions which you are frowning upon in this post. We were standing directly in front of the monk, so we know he saw us; he was also sent tells and says but to my understanding never responded. Not a single fire giant was killed by MoM nor did a MoM cleric (or any other member besides mr. random 35 monk) show his or her face ONCE during the entire camp.<br>
<br>
That all changed once your dual comped monk saw Ragefire up. You brought your zerglings in and took him down despite the attempt of Nanana to amass her force. And it's not as though we failed an attempt. We did not even get ONE shot at the dragon, even though our cleric was the one who did the camp. We were *run over*.<br>
<br>
And that's fine, if that's the way you like to operate. But at least come out and say it, instead of being cowardly and deceitful. We'd all appreciate knowing who it is we have to look out for.<br>
<br>
Say it with me now: &quot;Methods of Madness is not afraid to run you over.&quot;<br>
<br>
I knew you could.<br>

This happened 9 months ago and I've long forgotten the names and faces involved. All I know is that my friends and I spent a good number of hours camping Ragefire in the presence of one Methods of Madness member, who was a feigned monk. You can either accept the fact that I don't just make stuff up because raar I hate you and u r evil and stuff la~... or you can find someone who keeps logs for 9 months. Neither are likely. And I'll bet if someone posted logs or screenshots, you or some other troll would be here saying &quot;u faked that.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for why you never saw a rant on these boards? Nanana and Angelika are calm and rational people and realize that ranting on this board never solves anything. People trolling &quot;werez ur proof d00d&quot; (when, no matter what proof you present, they won't accept it) and other people that deny multiply-corroborated, factual accounts of the situation make this forum totally worthless for that purpose. They're smart enough not to waste their time here.<br>
<br>
I know better than to think that MoM gives one flying care about my opinion. But I just wish you (and everyone else who gets a kick out of doing this sort of thing) would stop lying in public about the way you do things.<br>

Asking for proof is trolling when  you know there is none.<br>
<br>
In courts of law, when there is no hard evidence, eyewitness accounts are taken seriously. I am one such eyewitness. How many eyewitnesses will it take, Dastin, to convince you that your guild did this?<br>
<br>
My guess is you just don't want to believe it. I wouldn't want to believe it either. I like to be proud of my guildtag, just as I'm sure you do. And this is something that you can't possibly be proud of.<br>
<br>
You can believe or disbelieve my account of events at your whim. What you'd better believe is that your guild has a lot of skeletons in its closet, with more accumulating by the day.<br>
<br>
And that's the only reason I posted this. MoM are repeat offenders. They've done stuff like this before. This indicates that they'll likely do it again, given the chance. What happened 9 months ago is done and over with. I just wanted to share it so that, when it happens again (and I'm sure it will), people won't be so shocked.<br>

Nine months ago the 3 camps MoM did were marathons with full guild involvement.  I remember a rant about that monk in RF problem, just wish I could remember who the real culprits were.  Was a good rant if I remember right.<br>
<br>
Like I've said before, the longer this thread goes, the more &quot;truth&quot; people who aren't involved come up with.<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, let's all give Inny.com a rest on a topic that can't be solved and only is degenerating into half truths and wild claims.  It gets no one anywhere except to entertain.  Seeing as how it's been awhile since there's been a really good flame/rant war maybe we just all needed this.<br>

<br>
Whats fair in this game? who made it that way? we the players didn't make up these time consuming camps up, seems alot of this game ends in some dissapointment for somone and I for one do not like that part of the game.<br>
<br>
No one in MoM wakes up in the morning and says &quot;hmm... wonder who I can screw over today&quot;..<br>
We give everyone a chance or try to work something out.<br>
<br>
No Sylly we were not in VP we had an alt in the zone like alot of ppl did and we made the run over, we knew there was another group in there for Rage and used the PNP to its entirty,we never rushed it or ran over anyone.<br>
<br>
I to would be dissapointed if I had failed on an epic mob and lost the mob to another guild BUT that is how Verant has set it up I would much rather it be a &quot;turn in mob&quot; but as Verant stated long ago , that they don't want to flood the server with cleric epics...thus the reason they made the spawns the way they are sad but true.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with how most of the epics are set up and how you need to have lots of people on hand to drop a single mob to aquire an epic, in this case the &quot;click stick&quot;<br>
<br>
Until Verant does something to make it less competitive we will continue to see posts like this (<br>

  As far as veiled sincerity: hardly.  I am very sincere about protecting my reputation when I see it wrongfully attacked.  I am also sincere about people forming their own opinions using facts, not accusations.  <br>
  The end of it is, as far as I am concerned, is it comes down to &quot;yes you did!&quot;, &quot;no I didn't&quot; with the &quot;yes you did&quot; in this case having conflicting stories.

Ok. I'll buy that it *could* have happened, purely on accident. But not with malice of forethought. I'll concede, but only barely! Now, review what Angelika said. She said we have run her and her friend over for a total of ******5***** times!!!! Incredible. <br>
<br>
I still highly doubt your claims because you are only *now* supporting it happening *1* time because we have stated that only *1* of our clerics got his epic without the avg 60 hour camp. Funny how the accusations keep changing here. Had they been the least bit true, there would be some kind of consistancy in all these claims.

Dear Solusek people, since when did it take 5 minutes to zone out of VP.  Sylly I guess you have never BEEN TO VP.  You don't zone out, it is a die, die, rez, rez process.  It takes a good 30 minutes or so to get everyone out of VP if one of the portals wasn't cleared.  <br>
<br>
As for MoM running people over, hardly.  I have been guilded for some time now and never saw such acts.  I know, we are &quot;BIG_GUILD_01&quot; and you may feel the need to think that &quot;BIG_GUILD_01&quot; wronged me and this is the time to point it out.  I also read this board often and never ever saw the &quot;RANT&quot; about &quot;MOM THE BABY KILLING MEANIES&quot; anyplace on here or the old boards.  <br>
<br>
Truly, this thread has grown weary and should get deleted since it is accomplishing only a few things.  <br>
<br>
1) reinforcing the reason's MoM will never help YOU<br>
<br>
2) that you shouldn't speak without proof or cold hard facts<br>
<br>
3) that this thread was started due to a &quot;Miscommunication&quot; and you felt like throwing in your two cents just to try and tarnish a name that can't be tarnished.<br>
<br>
4) this server has some serious vultures on it that like to rant on message boards then ask/beg for help<br>
<br>
<br>
Seems to me that some of you may have had a bad day, needed something to vent on......<br>
<br>
Though, I offer this little bit of advice.  Those that live in glass houses, should never throw stones.<br>

The actions of your players dictate the goodness of your name. I threw in my two cents because an officer of your guild came in and posted some lies about a situation I was involved in. When the people in charge go around lying in public, your name becomes tarnished, whether you like it or not.<br>

And we arrive at the one correct sentence fragment in your entire post. Only too true. But are the vultures the people who put the time in to camp the mobs? Or are they the people who swoop through and snatch the prey without regard for the situation? You do the math.<br>

You don't even know who is in MOM without copy and pasting the roster.  You assume that we are a way that you can't prove or back up.  You come here to keep a thread alive so that you can look so &quot;phylosophical.&quot;  As for the attacks you made to my thread and this one I am typing now.  Grow up, get a life, get out of your house and bother someone else.  I fear that you may take this game a bit more seriously than the rest of us.  You prove it by continually coming to this thread to post your hate.  I know some in Amici and I think they are nice, but you...I don't know how you got in.<br>
<br>
You lack class, you lack character, and worst of all you lack modesty.  You are just twisting out words and ranting your little rant.  I am sorry to tell you this also...you are not the Malevolent one.  That person knows who they are.  You are just a copy cat wanna-be.  <br>
<br>
I know you are going to do your neat little quote thing with this post, I know you are going to rant on what I tell about you.  I implore you to do that since it is fun to watch you debate this mediocrity.  Your point is useless and all you are doing is crying over some spilt milk that you think MoM did.  Funny how you are the only one that has come foreward and claimed your claims.  Even Angelika stopped posting when she knew she was wrong.  Then you started up with your latest lies.  Do you really need this much of a hobby?  Are you this bored?  Does your guild's site not contain anything interesting to look at?<br>
<br>
Might be time for you to take a step back and realize that you are a little bit pompous and a whole lot of ignorrant.  Without proof of your accusations they are &quot;Hearsay&quot;, even if you are an eye witness.  If you can't name names or point people out in a line up.  You are dead wrong and expect to not be taken seriously.  So, since you don't have these.  You are attacking us and twisting our very words like teenagers in highschool trying to out &quot;Cut down&quot; eachother.  This has turned into a &quot;your momma so fat...&quot;  thread.  <br>
<br>
You don't know me, you don't know my guild.  As for being on my no port/no buff list.  Funny, I didn't even mention that...how many people must have you on one that you automatically thought it?  I really hope that someone can come here and say nice things about you.  Everyones Shite stinks, are you as good a person as you claim.  Have you never wronged anyone?  Methods of Madness has stood as an honorable guild for as long as it has been around.  You will never know this due to your being on the outside.  Methods is a self-sufficient guild that needs only its fine people and resources to continue to do what it does.  Everyone in the guild is &quot;Hand-picked&quot; for traits of honor, and virtue.  1 month trials ensure that they are up to par with what the guild was made to stand for.  This guild has been honorable for its entire existance.  You arn't tarnishing anything here Haagen...you are only disrupting your reputation as a liar, and a bigot.<br>
<br>
You blame MoM for your problems and that is all there is to it.  They are your problems.  You don't know MoM from anyother guild and never have you been with us on a hunt.  We do have friends that join us and they have posted on this thread.  They come with us and we help them/they help us.  Maybe if you weren't so busy bashing this guild you may have gotten to know us.  Now, I don't think any of us would help you even if we needed to break your neck to end your suffering.  I am not going to activley seek you out to not help you.  Nor will my guild, since you really don't matter on a server of 2500 people, you are as insignificant here as you are in reality.  So, don't get yourself high and mighty thinking that you are in our prayers.  You are not that lucky.  Why not just simply stop talking completely and walk away.  Alas, you aren't capable of such things....since you feel the need to bash people and twist their words.  Well...have fun with my post.  I really don't care how you twist it or bash what I say.  Since, the people that I wanted to get this message, heard it loud and clear. While you, remain as clouded and resolute in your bigotry.<br>

<br>
I've known Angelika nigh on to forever now, and [bold]strongly[/bold] suspect that she has not remarked further on this post as she avoids useless rants like I avoid exp!<br>
<br>
In point of fact, MoM did nothing wrong here, as Rikishi has noted.  The camp sux0rz because VI does not want the epic coming into the game any faster than present and they did not want to tie up volunteer and staff resources policing their previous implementation of the camp in sol b.<br>
<br>
It is because of this design by VI and the rants that result from the RF camp that I do not have an epic, nor any intention of getting one anytime soon.  (Shucks, I have the spell, necro has the mana, let the rezzing begin!  Epic?  We don't need no steenking epic!)<br>
<br>
Ugle:  hehe, Actually, there are still a few of us around who sit at zone lines and buff and heal as we chat....  Sure wish that trend had caught on more widely.<br>

And I know you didn't do it out of malice. You did it because you wanted a cleric epic. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just amazing the lengths you'll go to to get it.<br>
<br>
As for the story changing, well, it's not, and I'm not sure where you got that from. I was only there for one of Nanana/Angelika's ragefire camps. There were many other camps at which I was not present. I am stating what occured at the _ONE_ camp that I was present at. What occured at that ONE camp is what I posted above. As for the other camps I was not there and can make no eyewitness statement. But I am prepared to take Angelika's word for it, and you should be, too. That's how trustworthy she is.<br>
<br>
Dastin: I was there, you were not. It is I who am telling what I saw, and you who are disregarding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      But I understand your situation perfectly; you have people on both sides who were there telling you two different stories. And of course you're going to believe your side over mine. I never expected otherwise.<br>
<br>
Proven: I'm flattered that you have the time to type a reply that long. Too bad your post is nothing more than a ridiculous flame against me personally. In case you missed it, I have nothing to do with this, other than being a witness to the whole sordid affair. Post something relevant and I'll show you what I can do with my nifty little quote feature. Until then, why not start a new thread to flame me? Call it &quot;Margana's mama so fat&quot; or something. Have some respect for the 99.999% of the population who thought this thread had something to do with your guild ganking spawns and nothing to do with what Proven thinks about Margana personally.<br>
<br>
lihom: You're exactly right.<br>
<br>
Nzaz: I think after some of the recent posts that this thing might be better off in Rants? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->         <br>

Guys listen its this simple, I've been friends with people in MoM for a long time some of my best friends in the game are in MoM. I do *not* consider myself someone who thinks its ok for people to run over other people to accomplish their goals, ask my friends. I know that MoM isnt the type of guild to do that, otherwise wouldnt that be hypocritcal of me to think those things were bad then helping my friends there do that? There is nothing that annoys me more then a hypocrite so I wouldn't be like that. MoM has a bunch of good people, look at those people and talk to them first before you judge them.<br>
<br>
Thank you have a good day!<br>
<br>
P.S-Stop fighting!<br>
P.P.S-Someone give me a sandwhich I am hungry! <p><img
