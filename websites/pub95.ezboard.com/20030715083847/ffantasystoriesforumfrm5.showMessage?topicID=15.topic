There was an eerie stillness in the air, like the water below the waves, or the calm before the storm. A girl with long flowing black hair stepped out of the midday shade and into the blinding light of the sun. Only now did those around notice her. She stumbled forward and fell to her knees in front of the ancient timepiece. She knelt there, her hands hanging loosely at her sides, looking up at the dial. Her eyes changed colors quickly, from white to red to black and back to white again. Bright red blotches appeared on her skin, and it sizzled and cracked as if it were burning off. Those around her watched this sight, not quite knowing what to do. Some lady’s averted their eyes. The men just stood there open mouthed, not believing what they were seeing. Someone called for a priest; others called for guards. When the first priest arrived, she was only half conscious. The priest held her head and looked directly into her eyes. The girl faded into unconsciousness as she mumbled, “Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que’on a perdu”. The priest gathered the girl into his arms and carried her back to the temple. <br>
        When the girl woke up, she was in a dark room, with only one small shaft of light coming in from between the cracks in the ceiling. She however, could not see the light. Her robes were torn and ripped, and scarcely covered her body, let alone kept her warm. Her hair was greasy and knotted, her skin was covered with dried blood. She slowly pulled her lame body along the ground until she came to a wall, and propped herself up against it. She tasted blood in her mouth, and spit. Her red lips now had a ring of dirt and filth around them, as well as a large scar on the left side that ran down from her eye. She tried to wipe the dirt off on the back of her hand, but to no avail, her hand being just as dirty as the rest of her. <br>
        She heard a rat squeek to her right, and jerked around to identify the source. It was then that she realized she could not open her eyes. She leaned back against the wall, and slowly raised her hand to the level of her eyes. Her slender finger slowly traced the crosshatch of stiching that was rendering her blind. She licked her lips and giggled.<br>
        “Why do you laugh?” The girl turned her head in the direction of the voice.<br>
        “Why?” she giggled again. “Why, I have not another tear to shed. Besides, this sorrow is an enemy.”<br>
        “I was under the impression that sorrow was your ally.”<br>
        “Sorrow was my tool, and once again it stings my soul.”<br>
        “How so?” The girl had no answer for several minutes.<br>
        “My . . . my mother murdered . . . my daughter dead . . .” The girl stuttered and slured her words. She was not really aware that she was speaking them, she was only half there. The other half of her was stuck in her own delusions, reliving the events that lead to her presence here. <br>
        “How did your daughter die?” The girl grinned wide, showing her sharp, pointed teeth. <br>
        “I . . . I killed her.”<br>
        “Do you regret that?”<br>
        “I regret nothing.”<br>
        “Surely, there must be something . . .”<br>
        “I have done a thousand dreadful things as easily as one would kill a fly. Nothing grieves me more then I can not do ten thousand more.” The man remained silent, only his quick breaths could be heard in the still air. <br>
        “It is good that you acknowledge your death. It will be easier that way. You may have your last words, or you may bequeath your possessions.”<br>
        “Nothing . . .”<br>
        “Your secrets will die with thee.” The girl made no response. “Speak so that although you die, you may live on.”<br>
        “If I must speak, I must warn you, I will speak of things that will vex your soul indeed. For I must speak of murders, rapes, and massacres. Acts of black night, abominable deeds, complots of mischief, treason, villainies ruthful to hear, yet piteously performed.”<br>
        “Say on, so that your life will not be in vein.”<br>
        “Existence is in vein!”<br>
<br>
        And so it is that the girl began to recount her story. Below is chronicled what she said. We can only pray that her story not be read in vein. Knowledge is to be gained from the reading of it, knowledge that may be hard to swallow.<br>
<br>
&quot;My earliest memories are of my mother. She found me one night in the streets, I was very young. She took me home and cared for me as if I was her own child. She taught me the secrets of the Dark Arts, she is who turned me into what I am today. I love her for it. She stood as tall as I do now, and her hair was black like mine, although her's curled around her face, not straight like mine. I remember her lips most of all, they were always the deepest darkest color of red, they stood out on her pale face like a rose. She had a way about her that made you feel like you were floating. When you were with her you could not imagine life without her, and when you were apart from her, you were frozen in anxious anticipation of her return. She was delicate like a wilted flower, sweet like the richest chocolate, but she was fiercer then any lion. In fact as I looked back on her, in retrospect, back when she was still alive, she reminds me of a cat very much. Her eyes glowed in the darkness, and hidden behind her beautiful exterior she hid her sharp teeth and claws. She taught me at a young age that there were two types of people in the world. There were those unworthy of life, and those that needed to die. When she was young, she watched as her entire family was burned at the steak for being heretics. They were burned, right there in the town square for everyone to see. She told me once that as she watched her mothers flesh blister and melt, their eyes met. <br>
Ever since that day she had been taking revenge on those that had killed her family. Taking vengeance on their families, and their friends families. She taught me the true meaning of the word ‘hate’. Soon, I was taking part in this tempest of death. Together we brought terror to the good people of Norrath. I learned the true power and beauty of death. I learned how to control it, to bend it to my will. I was young and I was arrogant. I overestimated myself and underestimated everyone. One night I was returning home with the blood of several elven children on my hands. I was too filled with pride to notice that I was being followed. Unknowingly I lead a group of paladins to our secret house below the city. It was not me that they were after, it was my mother. They waited outside for her to return, and when she came, they beat her. They took turns on top of her. They left her there, choking on her own blood, in front of her own house. If I had been more trained in the Dark Art, perhaps I could have saved her. But I could do nothing. I held her head in my lap as she died. Her lasts words to me were spoken with hate, pain, and suffering. Not a day of my life goes by without me wishing that it could have been me to die in that sewer, not my mother. Those feelings increased as it dawned on me that it was my foolishness that led the men to our house. If I had not gone out that night, my mother would still be alive. I promised myself that no one would forget her name, not as long as I was still alive. And for many years after her death people would cringe in fear at the very mention of her name. I would write her name with the blood of my victims; soon there was not a person in all of Norrath who did not cringe at the mention of 'Lamia'. <br>
I hated myself for a long time. I blamed the death of Lamia on my own stupidity. It was many years until I was able to forgive myself, it took many victims. At first I killed because I wanted to be like my mother. Then I killed in reaction to her death. After that I killed simply for the love of the game. The ear splitting scream of those who beg for their pathetic lives. The toddler who doesn't realize the seriousness of his own death. The brave knight who realizes his own incompetence and failure only just before he is slain. The father who finds his children cut open from throat to stomach and mercilessly beats his wife because he thinks she did it, despite her pleas of innocence. All these things and a thousand more, still make my heart beat happily now as I sit here thinking about them.&quot;<br>
The visitor stirred uncomfortably in his chair. &quot;You're sick.&quot; The girl shook her head as if to reject that comment. She stared blindly up at the direction she imagined the man to be in.<br>
&quot;Am I?!&quot; The man said nothing. &quot;AM I?!&quot; The girl took a moment to regain her composure. &quot;I am your creation! Don't you understand that? It was your hate that left my mother an orphan. It was your intolerance of difference that forced me to fear for my life every day when I was growing up in the city. I am a direct product of all the negative emotions in your society. You call yourself decent hard working folk who dream of peace and prosperity, well . . . there is more hatred, contempt, anger, frustration, sadness, guilt, and mediocrity in your cities then you choose to acknowledge. It has to go somewhere. It doesn't just disappear. And now it has come back to bite you in the ass.&quot; The girl laughed. &quot;But you've never paid any attention before, why should you now. . . <br>
&quot;A few years after my mother's death I became a priestess in the temple of Bertoxxolous. Lamia was predominant among the plague bringers and the other shrine men thought it only natural that I follow in her footsteps. I moved up the ranks quickly, my natural predisposition to the supernatural allowing me to advance faster then is customary. Before long I was the High Priestess in the shrine . . . people took orders from me, and I from Bertoxxolous. I was the youngest ever to sit on the throne, and the first female. When I came of age, I underwent the Right of Decay. A ceremony among the plague bringers that only the high priests are allowed to undergo. Traditionally the priest dies during the ceremony, and the predecessor then steps up to take his place. I alone managed to survive the ceremony, although I died for the first time. The ceremony takes place in the Chamber of Decay. In the chamber there is a pool of blood on the ground. It is said that the blood is the blood of Bertoxxolous, left from when he was in human form and walked Norrath like a mortal. I followed the ancient volumes to the letter. First I disrobed, and then lay in the pool. The acidic blood quickly went to work, seeping in through the pores in my skin. It infected me, turned my blood bad, made my organs fail. My blood boiled and turned black. Large sores appeared on my rotting flesh as my blood pushed itself out of my body and joined the growing pool that I was laying in. My skin grew tight and thin, it cracked and blistered, exposing the bone underneath. Just as they would in death, my hair and f fingernails continued to grow. When my body had finally stopped resisting, and all the blood had exited my now frail and empty shell, I died. 'and in this mortal sleep of death, what dreams may come . . .' and come they did. I dreamt of Lamia, and of her death. I dreamt of all the nights I spent at her grave. I was walking through the cometary, and as I walked the foliage around me, that touched my bare feet, would wilt and die. I found myself seeing life through they eyes of others. I was being reincarnated, over and over again. I lived a thousand lives. I was a wood elf bard in one life, who used to sit by the fire while my father would sing songs and tell stories of the olden days. I was a high elf cleric another time, I spent my time at hospital, helping the terminally ill deal with death. When I was a Dark Elf enchanter I can remember my house in Nektolous Forrest where my wife used to cook the most delicious meals. Yes, I was reincarnated many times as a man, a boy, a girl, a woman. When I was an iksar I used to swim through the many streams, rivers and lakes of Kunark, diving deep underwater to see what I could find. I fought in many wars, and lost a lot of friends. I have seen enough bloodshed to last ten thousand lifetimes.&quot; Here the girl paused. Tears were seeping out from beneath her sewn eyelids. She waited for the frantic scratching of the man's quill to stop before she continued. &quot;And if I learned one thing from living so many lives, it is that no matter how much love there is in the world, there is always at least double that amount in hate and fear. No matter how many new lives are brought into this world, there is always an equal number of deaths, of murders. If there is one unmistakable truth to be learned in life, if there is one certainty, it is death. Death is the only thing you can count on in this world, the only constant. No matter what I tried to do to prevent it, death would always win.<br>
&quot;Every time I would come back, I could remember the events of my previous lives. Not as one remembers the events of yesterday, but like one remembers a dream of the day before. I learned after a while that it was pointless to fight with death, so I learned to embrace it. I don't know how many times I committed suicide, scores. I wanted to put an end to my eternal cycle of reincarnation, I thought I had learned the lesson, that if I just accepted death I would finally be set free. But that was only part of the lesson. I had yet to learn the rest.<br>
&quot;I found that after living so many lives I had become very good at observation. Observation is an important skill. To understand people, to know them better then they know themselves proves useful in all situations. So I dedicated myself to observation. What I learned is that people stumble blindly and foolishly through life, wallowing in their own stupidity. It is as if they are in a trance, a state of deep sleep. The only times I saw even the briefest spark of life, of truly living, is the moment when they know they are going to die. People only think about the past right before they die, as if they are frantically searching for proof they were ever alive. More often then not they don't find it. When you know you are going to die, you come to a full realization of 'mortality'. Your mind explodes with thought, with imagination, with intelligence. You see your mistakes, you see your victories, you see how numb to the world you have been until that moment. That is when you are truly 'alive'. Your senses awaken, your being is stirred. At that moment anything and everything is possible. It is truly a blessed condition, believe me.<br>
&quot;But of coarse this revelation comes always too late. For just after you have this revelation, you die. When I first realized this, is also the first time during my reincarnations that I remembered my first life. I remembered killing with Lamia, I remembered how exciting it was, how thrilling. This must be why. That little surge of life in the victim right before he meats death. And then it donned on me. I realized why I had been so easy to learn the Dark Arts. I realized why I had always been a little different then the other girls my age. I acted as a kind of beacon for life energy. Every time I killed someone, I would absorb that burst of life and become that much more powerful. My mind reeled with the possabilites and I quickly put my theory to the test. I began killing again. I slaughtered thousands, the more the better, and if I died in doing it, so what, I would simply be reincarnated and would then continue my rampage. Every time I killed I could feel my victim's energy flow into my being. It is a miraculous feeling let me tell you. After a few lives and many years, I developed the ability to absorb the energy of those who died that I did not personally kill. I received a constant flow of energy, never failing, never faltering, always making me stronger. I became more powerful than your feeble mind could possibly imagine.<br>
&quot;I was camped in the woods outside of a city one time. I was currently in the body of a Dark Elf warrior. My sword dripped with the blood of my victims. I snuck into the city at night and would sneak from house to house, bar to bar and kill as many as I could. On this night I felt particularly strong so I decided to charge the gates. If I killed the guards my task would be easier in the nights to come. I didn't much care if I died in the attempt, I knew it would not be the end of me.<br>
&quot;As I fought the guard, the moon fell from the sky, leaving the night sky void of all light, just a pure black canvas. I fought bravely, killing many knights. I swung my great sword as easily as one would swing a rope, it felt light as a feather. The knight's armor was crushed below it's massive destructive force. The alarm was raised and I was greeted with an army of knights, but I did not retreat. I ran at them, violently swinging my sword above my head, lopping off the heads of any knights brave enough to get close to me. I moved quickly, my black armor blending into the shadows splendidly. But soon enough they surrounded me and overtook me. I went down under many swords, laughing ever second until the breath would no longer come, and I closed my eyes and went limp.<br>
&quot;But this time I was not reborn. I was put into a body, but life was not restored to me, at least not in the traditional sense of the word. I found myself weak. Not the same weakness that always accompanied inhabiting a baby, for this time I was in the body of a grown woman. I could feel the heart beating steadily in my chest. I could feel the blood pulsing through my body. All my muscles had atrophied. The blood that coursed through my body was black and thick. After what might have been a few days I could open my eyes. I peered up at the darkness, at the one shaft of light darting in through a crack in the ceiling. I faded in and out of consciousness, I slept for days at a time. And once, when I was awake, I discovered I had enough strength to stand and to walk. I had been restored. I was inhabiting the same body that I had first had. I was the same girl. The girl who had been found by Lamia, and grown to love her. The same girl that lead the men home who killed her. The same girl that had become high priestess at the Shrine of Bertoxxolous. The same girl who had died in the Right of Decay. I had not aged a day, and never would again.<br>
&quot;I would not know until later exactly how long I had been in the Chamber of Decay. It had been several lifetimes, although I had lived many more. When I walked out of the Chamber, I found the temple in chaos. There was internal warfare. New guard versus old. And new guard was winning. The leader of the new guard was a young upstart who didn't recognize the value of the old ways and the teachings in the sacred tombs. It was not long however until one of the elders recognized me. He recognized me not in a physical sense, like he had once known me, but rather recognized me as the child of the prophecy. He confronted me and helped me to remember my past lives. We worked secretly together, preparing me to take the shrine back. I learned that I still possessed the power that I had gathered during my reincarnation loop. And I still had the ability to gain more. Soon the power was all I needed. I found that I no longer required food or drink. My body had stopped aging. <br>
&quot;When I was ready, I took back the temple by force, killing many of the new guard, and reestablishing the ancient ways. The shrine quickly gained power under my control. We expanded and had influence in every corner of Norrath. In Qeynos we had gone from a small annoyance to a massive devastating force. People fled Qeynos by the hundreds. Those that stayed came to a rather messy end. We built temples all around Norrath. We more then doubled the number of faithful. And I sat on the throne of the whole operation. I became the material of fiction, of fantasy, of myth. There were bed time stories about me, tales told around the campfire, legends sung about by bards. &quot;Get home before the night descends or Paradise will get you!'&quot; The man suddenly gasped and dropped his quill. He should have known who it was. This girl, this being of pure evil, it could only be. He had thought that she was just a myth, a scary story to tell children to get them to behave. No one could have as much power as legend says that she possesses. He knew it was her, but he told himself with every fiber of his being that it was not. He laughed awkwardly.<br>
&quot;You? You are Paradise? We must have hit you a bit too hard . . . hahaha. . . you're delusional!&quot; Paradise remained silent for a beat and then continued her story, completely ambivalent of the man and his petty thoughts.<br>
&quot;All the time I grew more and more powerful. I cried myself to sleep every night. I cried not out of sorrow but of joy. Soon this world would be mine, and not even the gods could take it away from me! It was then that I found myself wanting a mentor. Someone I could train in the Dark Arts, someone who was worthy of receiving instruction from me. I watched the young Necromancers of the shrine, meeting each one, but none seemed worthy. They all had their hearts in the right place, but there was something missing. One night I was strolling along the beach, my mind lost in thoughts, when I stumbled upon the body of a young girl. Her clothes were torn, her skin was covered in sores, dirt sticking to the drying blood. Her hair was matted and she smelled awful. She must have been dead for days. She looked like she had been through hell and back. Upon closer inspection I noticed that her mouth had been sewn shut.&quot; Paradise slowly rubbed her finger along the fine stitch work that now held her eyes shut. &quot;I knew that this girl must have suffered much before she died. She knew what sorrow was. It was then that I decided that she would be the one. I would adopt her and raise her as my own. I cut my wrist and let my blood drip onto her lips and onto her eyes. I took her home, and laid her in my bed and I waited. She slept for several nights. While she was sleeping, I removed the stitches from her lips. I worked slowly, delicately, being careful not to injure her perfect skin any further. By the time she woke all that was left were two rows of tiny pinhole scars. When she did awaken she was understandably confused. But in time she accepted what had happened to her. I could sense that her power was great, greater perhaps then mine when I was her age. In her previous life she had not been taught even the most basic aspects of the Dark Art, so we started from scratch. She slowly mastered the most basic of spells, but had great difficulty. The others her age far surpassed her in skill. She would come to me, crying, asking why she could not play like the others. I wish I had had an answer for her. But alas, I myself was at a lose as to what was holding her back. So it was that one day I decided to test her.<br>
&quot;We were walking one night, through the Forrest, when we stumbled upon a young Paladin. He looked strong and was but a few years older then my daughter. I quickly stepped into the shadows, a spell that my daughter had yet to learn. When he saw her, he saw the mark of evil on her. She tried to summon the dead when she realized that I was no where in sight, but quickly lost concentration when he shouted at her. He threw down his bags and grasped his sword. He ran at her and before she could react, had hit her in the back of the head with the butt of his sword, rendering her unconscious. I simply watched from the shadows. If my daughter truly had the power that I knew she did, she would find a way to win. I followed the Holy Knight as he carried her limp body back to his camp. He bound her wrists and ankles with thick rope, and tossed her down next to the fire. He began to take off his armor. I realized that he planned to have his way with the unconscious girl. But I did not interfere, I trusted my daughter to take care of herself. Sometimes being a good parent is to know when not to interfere. The knight stepped in between her legs, and began to undress her. As he was fumbling with the string on her pants, she came to. She lunged forward and over the top of him, sending him flying in the other direction. She rolled over and held her hands into the bright flame of the fire. She screamed out as the flames licked at her flesh. She saw the last bit of rope burn away and quickly untied her feet. Her hands were bright red and had started to blister already. She stood up just as the knight had picked up his sword. The knight came at her, his sword held high above his head. He brought it down, aiming at where her head had been, but she was quick, and stepped to the side. As the knight stumbled by (all his force caught in the downward motion of the blade, which found no target) she spun around and with one swift kick to the back of his head, sent him flying and crashing into a nearby tree. The knight got slowly up and dropped his sword. He came at her this time with his fists. He swung at her head, but she ducked down, narrowly escaping the blow. She crouched on one leg and with the other sweeped his legs from out from underneath him. He fell and she jumped on top of him, pummeling him with her fists. She beat him hard, broke every bone in his face. Tears flowed freely from her eyes as she took out all her anger and frustration on the unlucky knight. His blood splattered all over, covering her in a shiny red coat. He had been dead quite some time when she finally stop beating him. It was then that I stepped from the shadows. She sat there, straddling the dead knight. She looked up at me with eyes that could have made the darkness itself cry. I held my arms out to her and she ran to me. Together we walked home, and got her cleaned up.<br>
&quot;What I had seen that night proved my suspicions. The girl had power, any fool could see that. But she could not channel it out of her body. It stayed within her frame, and only would be released when she made physical contact. My heart wept. Why my only daughter, why is she affected thus? My daughter . . . MY daughter can not and will never master the High Art of Necromancy. I was crushed. I didn't sleep for weeks. She was a fighter, there was nothing else to say. I knew my people would not accept her as she grew older and realized her abilities. They were not very tolerant of those that could not master the Dark Arts. They would kill her. It was the law of the Clan. So I made a decision. Four years after I had picked her lifeless body off the beach, I turned her away. I told her I didn't care where she went, or what she did, only that she could not ever come back. I cried. I loved her. She didn't understand, and hated me for it. It would be many many years before we were reunited.&quot; Once again Paradise paused long enough for the mysterious scribe to stop writing. His next question did not surprise her in the least. &quot;What was your daughter's name?&quot; A slight change in the expression on Paradise's face gave away that she was remembering a touching thought. Her lips curled into what was somewhere between a smirk and a grimace.<br>
&quot;She was Creepy . . . Creepy Girl.&quot; The scrib made a grunting sound once again as if he did not believe the girl. He simply could not fathom that he was sitting there speaking to Norrath's worst nightmare, who just happened to be the mother of the Legendary Dark Monk, Creepy. He decided to hold his comments until she had finished her story, so as not to upset her.<br>
&quot;So what happened in the years following your daughter's departure?&quot; Paradise smiled now, as one would smile remembering happy days from their childhood. Sun soaked beaches with a cool wind. Water that was as clear as the air. Laughing and splashing with your family in the gentle waves. But Paradise was having her own happy thoughts. Thoughts of bloodshed and villainy.<br>
&quot;In the years after Creepy's banishment I fined tuned my craft so to speak. I mourned for the required amount of time after her leave, for she was truly dead in our minds, but I could not let the guilt and pain consume me. Not that it was a conscious choice, it was more like there was nothing left to be consumed by it. I had said good bye to my conscience many lifetimes ago, and as far as my soul, it just could not possibly become anymore scared. But there was a change in me after she left. I found myself no longer so interested in being the empress of the Necromancers. I told the clan to give me pardon and honor for my experience, but not a scepter to rule the world. I devoted myself to the finer parts of death. Quality, not quantity was now my modo. I devised thousands of new ways for slowly killing a man, each more splendidly horrific then the last. I re discovered that there are few things so absolutely exquisite in life then another person's agony. I delighted in watching the reaction mother's had when they came home and found their infant children stripped of the flesh, floating in pools of their own blood. I laughed when grown men broke down in tears to find their dead wives in the arms of another man, but never find the man. There was no end to my joy when I would dive into the dreams of sleeping mortals and pursue them there, only to have them wake up and find me standing over their beds. It is the form of the murder that is important, style is everything. I truly had some great times. I would love to relate them all to you, but alas, my time here grows short so I will be brief.<br>
&quot;It was more then a decade later when I was finely reunited with my girl. It was at the festival. On this particular year, the festival was held at the Shrine of Bertoxxolous in Qeynos. I had waited anxiously for the festival for many months. But this festival was to be different from the ones I had previously attended. This was the festival in which I received a gift from the dead. I was walking through the festival, watching the people trade their wares. There was a group of gnomes in one corner, selling all manner of mechanics, gears and levers and small clock mechanisms. There was a young Dark Elf who had set up shop next to the gnomes; she was selling gems of every shape and color, only the color of her eyes out shown her jewels. I was talking to her about her gems when I felt a familiar hand on my shoulder, and a soft, young voice whisper in my ear, &quot;mother!&quot;. I was overjoyed. For the first time in a long time, and for the last time, I let my emotions take control of me. For days I walked around with Creepy, talking of the past, never letting go of her hand. We were together again and that was all that mattered. I did not understand why we should be together, why her, why me. I was as of yet ignorant of Bertoxxolous' plan. All I cared about was that my daughter loved me. And I loved her. And we were together.<br>
&quot;She had grown over the years that we had been apart. She had gotten stronger, and wiser, and more skillful, but like me she had not aged. She told me that she had spent the time living on the shores of Lake Rathe. Although more recently she had been traveling, visiting every land of Norrath. She told me of the many adventures she had, of the strange and wonderful things she had seen, and of the villainy she had been the perpetrator of. The tiny pin hole scars around her lips were still there. They would never go away. <br>
&quot;Her hair was long now, straight as ever, but she wore it elaborately braided in the back, giving her head a slender look, leaving all attention on her face. Her eyes were the same gray they had been when last I had seen her, but the gray was deeper, more defined, more . . . experienced. Her skin was a beautiful shade of white, not so pale as my own, but beautiful nonetheless. She had grown indeed, but she was still young. It was staring into her sullen eyes that I came to a realization. She had told me that she wanted to stay here at the Shrine with me. She was so young, so vibrant, so full of . . . life, so to speak. The temple was old, was dusty, was decrepit, and no place for someone like her, she would never accept the ancient ways. ]<br>
&quot;That thought and the constant and heartfelt urging of the temple elders, made me decide a second time, to tell Creepy to leave. The first time it had broke my heart. This time it broke it again. Some things however, are just not meant to be. It was after I had sent her away that Bertoxxolous had called upon me. Bertoxxolous, that snake. He told me what I wanted to hear. He told me that the others do not matter, that it is what is in my heart that is important. He told me that I should go out and find Creepy, and bring her home.<br>
&quot;When I did find Creepy, it was in the plane of Plague. &quot; Paradise shook her head and laughed while reminiscing. &quot;It was part of Bertoxxolous' plan. He had grown jealous of me and wanted Creepy to kill me. When she refused he held her captive, used her as bait to get me to come to him. I came. And let me tell you, hell hath no furry like Paradise lost. <br>
&quot;Bertoxxolous was old and weak. Being alive since the beginning of time has its toll I suppose. He, like countless mortals before him, died by my hand. That fool . . . he thought his omnipotence could save him . . . he thought I was a mortal . . . well, he doesn’t think much anymore. Being dead and all. I killed the god I had spent more then a lifetime worshiping, just to save the life of my daughter. Funny, isn’t it? That love can be one of the greatest destructive forces?<br>
“I made the decision just then that Creepy would come live at the shrine with the rest of us. Over the next few months it became perfectly clear which shrine men were against her presence in the shrine. When I had found out who they were, I killed them. No one in MY shrine would reject my own. It is so very satisfying to kill those you have known since their births.” Paradise paused a moment here, just long enough to fondly remember the occasion. <br>
“After my cleansing of the shrine, I feel into a deep depression. I had spent many lifetimes destroying anyone and everyone. I had killed a god. I had slaughtered my fellow plague bringers. What had I left? Was there no one who could oppose me? It appeared as if I was unstoppable. I could destroy a whole village with a wave of my hand. Truthfully, it was just too easy. I had lived long enough without ageing that I had realized I was immortal, or if not immortal, was already dead. What could I do for the rest of eternity? I had no ambitions to rule the world, just to destroy it.<br>
“It had now been about 20 years since I had killed Bertoxxolous. With him dead, Creepy and myself worked extra hard to strengthen evil’s grip on Norrath. We traveled together, destroying cities, burning farms, ousting rulers. It is a fair sight indeed to see an undead army cut down 50 score troops form Erudin. We lived in Paineel for a while, after our campaign on Erudin. We taught there, at the university, which Creepy seemed to have a natural talent for. I on the other hand, naturally less of a socialite then my daughter, spent most of my time in the Library. It was there, in the Library that I discovered the secrets to . . . everything.<br>
“It was deep in the archives that I discovered what I thought had only been legend. It was by far the oldest book in the library, dating back thousands of years. Older then even myself. Legend has it that it was the words of Cane, the first Necromancer, as recorded by the scholar Miragul. This book was made from human skin, and written in the blood of a dragon. It’s theories of Necromancy were really quite elementary, modern day Necromancers having progressed significantly in the knowledge of the Dark Art. It was the prophecy that intrigued me.<br>
“The prophecy foretold the death of all Norrath. A cloud of darkness that would descend upon the world and swallow it up, consume it, destroy it. My first translation of the text gave me ‘darkness’ but the text seemed to hint at something more. Darkness is something that occurs in the absence of light. This darkness had no fundamental restriction on it. This ‘darkness’ was alive. The text made it sound as if it was something tangible. Its very presence meant death, no one could survive it. Cities would burn, temples would fall, people would die. <br>
“As I kept reading I learned that a girl would be born, the only person that could summon this darkness, this apocalypse. She was not to be born from any mortal, nor the child of any god. Not even the Nameless himself could father such a child. She was to be born out of the intangibles in the world; out of hate, fear, pain, suffering, lust, greed, anger, contempt, and every other imaginable sin. Every injustice the world suffered added to her creation, every crime against man, nature, or divine. She was destined to die a thousand deaths and live a thousand lives. <br>
“It was obvious the prophecy was speaking of me. I fit all the criteria from history to physical appearance. There was no question. My heart raced as I read, my mind reeled. It was all so magnificent, so perfect, exactly what I had been looking for. <br>
“However, there was a catch. The prophecy spoke of another girl. One not as powerful as I. Just as I was created from evil to usher in the ultimate apocalypse; good also created a child, a child that was sent to stop me. This child would be the daughter of the Nameless, and born of a mortal woman. The Nameless apparently didn’t want his precious creation to be destroyed, so he created a tool to stop me. A tool that would do whatever it took to kill me. For the first time in several lifetimes, I was scared. For days I had nightmares of a shady figure chasing me over endless distances, through all of eternity. I told no one of the prophecy or my dreams, for my own safety. I locked myself up in my private chambers night after night, researching. I ordered the entire Library of Paineel sent to the shrine in Qeynos. I could find no other references to this prophecy, no clues as to the identity of my enemy. <br>
“It was late one night, that I came to a revelation. I had been so crazed to find out whom this girl was that I never stopped to truly analyze the situation. The prophecy said that I would not be harmed until the day of the apocalypse. Would not be harmed . . . why wait until that day? Why not kill me the first opportunity you could? Then it donned on me, the harsh reality. Because I am for all intents and purposes, immortal. That wouldn’t pose a problem for the child of the Nameless I guessed, but they would have to fight every heretic in Norrath to get to me. Unless . . . unless it was an inside job. So I began to think, who knew the most about me, my strengths and my weaknesses, who knew where to find me at all times, who had free access to me and to the shrine, who would never be suspected? I hated the cruelty of the reality, but admired and respected the Nameless’ cleverness. My daughter. Creepy. She was the only person I truly trusted. I giggled at the simplicity of the Nameless’ plan, the sheer brilliance. Creepy had helped me kill thousands. She was as evil as they come, but the death of those would be nothing in comparison to the end of all creation. By saving the world, her past sins would be forgotten. It was clear what I had to do . . .” Paradise paused here and took a deep breath. It was obvious that she still felt pain, even if she didn’t admit it. The scribe’s facial expression had changed somewhat; he no longer was amused with the delusional girl. He had the look of horror on his face, a look of disgust. He still didn’t believe a word of her story, but he had found himself caught up in it anyway.<br>
“It is in actuality, very hard to kill the child of a god, especially one of the Nameless. Well, it would be for any mortal, but not for myself, I in fact, found it very easy. The Nameless could not match my power with his creation, so he devised it so that I would never know that my own daughter was destined to kill me. This was not the first time I stared fate in the eyes and laughed. The Nameless underestimated me. He didn’t think anyone would slay their own daughter, especially over a prophecy written thousands of years before my birth. Why didn’t my love for my daughter conquor my fear of an ancient piece of parchment? Even if I believed the prophecy, certainly I could not find it within myself to slay my girl. Wouldn’t a mother sacrafice herself before letting her child be hurt. Well, any mother but this one.<br>
“After I had solved the mystery, I did not debate for one second what I should do next. I had killed my conscience many years before, and it would not speak now. I found Creepy sleeping in her bed. I slit her throat, with as much ease as one might slaughter a calf for the sacrificial alter. I pulled her limp body from her bloodstained bed and carried her to the alter of Bertoxxolous. I laid her body on the alter and laughed at the nameless. Blood still poured from the gash on her throat, she faded in and out of consciousness. Although Bertoxxolous was dead, disease still flowed from his temple. I let the disease take her. Her skin began to rot. “You see this!” I yelled at the heavens, knowing the Nameless was watching. “You see your child!?” It was then that Creepy regained her consciousness and stared up at me with sad eyes. Her hand reached up at caressed my face. Her lips parted and she mouthed a single word: ‘mother’. Her rotten hand fell back to the alter and her eyes closed for the last time. I stood back and watched as her flesh slowly deteriorated, until she was nothing but a skeleton. I looked carefully at where her face had once been. Her skull was stained red with blood. Her empty eye sockets seemed like empty voids, that if you stared into them too long, they might consume you. I threw her skeleton off the alter and it broke into many pieces. I ordered the remains removed from the temple and destroyed. It was done, now nothing stood in my way.” The scribe’s quill stopped. He emitted a heavy and heartfelt sigh. <br>
“With your daughter dead you were free to usher in the apocalypse. Why haven’t you?”<br>
“I will when I please, and NOT before.”<br>
“So, how did you end up here?” Paradise waited a beat, and then began.<br>
“Guilt is like a seed, and once planted in you it grows and grows until it destroys you, or you make amends. I killed my daughter easily, even joyously, because I knew it would secure myself and my power. But over the next few weeks I became overrun with guilt. And in this case there is no way to make amends, my daughter is dead. Her remains were destroyed . . .”<br>
“So the guilt can only consume you . . .”<br>
“Will it consume me?” Paradise was silent for only a moment, but in the stillness of the chamber it felt like an eternity. “I guess we shall see. It did after all, lead me here. I became obsessed with finding a way to release the guilt that weighed so heavily upon me. I knew I had all the time in the world. Time. That’s what it is all about in the end. When I stumbled into your square at midday, I walked right into the lion’s mouth. I wondered how much more time would pass before you killed me. It was the ultimate escape. I came here to be destroyed.” Several silent minutes passed. “I will speak no more, do with me what you will, I will not resist you.”<br>
Time froze. People everywhere stopped dead in their tracks. Frozen, immobilized, completely ignorant of what was going on. A blue haze descended upon the city and swept through like an ice-cold wind. Paradise was the only one not affected by its effects. Then, as quickly as it had come, it had gone, and the normal progression of time resumed. “How am I to be executed?” asked Paradise in an indifferent tone.<br>
“Executed? Who said anything about execution? We will be releasing you outside the city wall today. You have served your sentence and taken your punishment, you will soon be free. You will be, at any rate, as soon as I finish up this paperwork..” The countless pages that the scribe had taken as the girl had spoken were gone, in their place were a few scrolls; records for the local jail. The guard did not remember anything about the girl sitting in the cell in front of him. Paradise leaned her head back, against the wall. She was coming to the harsh realization that she could not die. At this time, she did not know what power had saved her. Was it a god? Was it the Nameless? Was it her own subconscious? She didn’t know. In any case there was something that didn’t want her to die. <br>
An hour later the guard rolled up and put away his scrolls. He unlocked the bared door and escorted the girl to the city gate. It was late evening and the sun crested beautifully behind the trees of the surrounding forest. “It’s a beautiful sunset lady, too bad you can’t see it. Who did that to your eyes then? Not very attractive is it . . .” Paradise hung her head low and replied, almost in a whisper.<br>
“I did.”<br>
“You did that? To yourself? Awful strange thing to do if you ask me, but I never did understand you humans.” When they got to the gate the guard simply let go of her arm and told her to keep walking. “You’re on your own now. And don’t come back young lady, you know your kind ain’t welcome here! Next time we might not be so lenient!” Paradise stumbled forward, slowly disappearing into the shadows of the forest. <br>
And so the city slept on, never knowing the girls name, who she really was, or how close they had come to death herself.<br>
They say that time heals all wounds. Whoever said that was a fool. Paradise would never forgive herself for the death of her daughter. The scars around her eyes would never go away. She decided that she would get her vengeance. She would destroy all of the Nameless’ creation. Not in one great apocalyptic catastrophe, but a piece at a time. She would savor her revenge. The cities would burn, the people would die. It would be magnificent. So, in the end, perhaps the prophecy did come true.<br>
