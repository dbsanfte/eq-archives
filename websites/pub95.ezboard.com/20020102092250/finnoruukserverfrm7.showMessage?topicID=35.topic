Her chin rested on her knees and her dove-gray eyes focused on nothing on the western horizon. A gentle breeze lifted her pale blonde hair away from her exotic face. She sighed as a touch of a smile curved on her lips. <br>
Her life had so many strange twists and turns. Being a child of a druid and a paladin had its rewards and its downfalls. And having an ogre for a soulmate was the icing on the cake! <br>
She remembered her early childhood well. She was well loved and cherished by her parents, Lenore and Choco Bravehard. She wasn't spoiled by any means, but her parents were generous with their gifts to her. She showed no magical abilities as a child, so she could not follow in her mother's footsteps as a druid, nor her father's as a paladin. At a very early age, she showed an adeptness that clearly marked her path. She was wandering around the gates of Freeport, as her parents sat a ways away from the constant threat of the militia, as they were considered criminals. She found an abandoned sword on the ground, and before it could be taken away before she got hurt, that skill made itself known and her life as a warrior began. <br>
She trained hard and advanced quickly. Her teachers were proud of her, as were her parents. <br>
<br>
And Rallos Zek decided he wanted her to fight in his name. <br>

Strange dreams filtered in her mind. A man of great strength was coming to her, and he was her destiny. And before his face was revelaed to her, she would wake up. Frustrated, as this dream repeated over and over, she released that anger in only one way she could. She defeated her enemies. <br>
And she wondered who this man, her supposed desitny, was. <br>
 <br>
*She hunts. Sweat trickles down her face, neck, and back. The mighty bear is a formidable foe, and just when she is sure she would lose her life, a final, crippling blow, a scream of rage torn from her throat, the bear falls dead at her feet. Weakened, she falls beside the bear. Too weak to even bandage her wounds properly, she slowly fades into the blackness. <br>
Suddenly, a face is above her, offering her cool water, and she winces in pain as she struggles to sit up. Her eyes try to focus on her savior, and...* <br>
&quot;AARRGGHH!!!&quot; <br>
The warrior shouts. This always happens to me! she thought. Just when she is about to meet her rescuer, she wakes up. She sighed heavily. She removes her cloth shirt she uses for sleeping and dives into the cool water of the lake. Clean and refreshed, she dries off and dresses, then prepares her morning meal. She really was beginning to hate that dream. <p>Lenore Bravehard

She can't stand mysteries. She lays on her back, looking at the stars. She finds the constellation of Rallos Zek and says her nightly prayer: <br>
&quot;Lord Rallos, grant me the strength to vanquish our enemies and the power to succeed in your name.&quot; <br>
Her eyes close as her fire burns enough to keep predators away.<br>
<br>
*The dream comes again...the bear, the fight, the face. As her eyes focus on her rescuer, she sees the face of an Ogre. His red eyes peer at her, well his good eye anyway, as one is scarred over. She notices one ear is missing, but he has a kind expression. <br>
&quot;He is your destiny, my daughter.&quot; Rallos Zek whispers, just before she awakens.* <br>
<br>
Well, at least my savior has a face now. she thought ironically. And what is with the whispers? My destiny? An ogre? It was too much to comprehend on an empty stomach.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The warrior sits and mends her wounds, having been set upon by a pack of orcs that happened upon her. She had not fully recovered her strength when a large bear turned on her. She fought, staggering from the beast's claws, thankful for the protection of her armor, yet cursing it for its weight. Sweat streamed down her face, and stung her eyes. She felt rivulets of sweat run down her back and chest, making her hot, and tire even quicker. Calling upon her last reserve of strength, she relased a loud bellow and fell to the ground beside the bear, having spit its skull open, killing it. She lay on the ground, her breathing labored, blood seeping into the grassy plain. Her vison blurred. So, it ends here, she thought. Not on a battlefield, but by a stupid bear. She felt her life slowly leaving. So be it.<br>
All she could do was wait for Rallos to come for her as she slipped into oblivion. <br>

She struggled to open her eyes, but could not. Then, something cool was forced between her lips and she drank. A gentle voice coaxed her. Well, sort of gentle. <br>
<br>
~As the life and death drama between human and bear was being fought, a ogre meandered from the tunnel carved from the mountains that seprated the deserts of Ro to the Commonlands outside Freeport City. He was not sure why he was here. All he was told, and by Rallos Zek himself, that he needed to seek out the humans, but primarily The One he had seen in his dreams. He had felt her spirit calling to him on the winds, and he felt her presence as he stepped into the cooler plains. He suddenly stopped, as he felt the human's spirit fading. She was in danger, and she was dying! Calling upon the wolven spirits, he commanded them to guide him to the fading spirit. <br>
As he ran, he remembered having seen her face in his dreams. A human as his destiny? Unthinkable. As a child, human flesh was given to him as after meal treats. But as the dreams became more frequent, and her face revealed to him, he found himself having feelings for her, almost close to love. He only hoped he could find her in time.~ <br>
<br>
When he did, he was relieved she was still living, but barely. He wiped her face with a cool cloth, and coaxed her to drink some water, and spoke gently, which is a feat unto itself for an ogre. What he deemed as gentle, could be considered a roar for some. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ow,&quot; the human mumbled painfully, as she sat up. Her wounds were bound and she looked around for the booming voice. She found an ogre sitting a few feet from her. <br>
She did not shrink in fear, as she seemed to know him. Then it dawned on her. It was him, the one from her dreams, her destiny. <br>
&quot;It's you,&quot; she said softly, as he shifted on the grass to be closer to her. <br>

The ogre was mixing herbs and other things in a bowl, and would apply them to her cuts. As he moved, his charms would rattle, almost musically. She had never seen an ogre before, except in her dreams, and never seen a shaman. She studied his face, crossed with deep scars, one nearly closing his right eye. And where his left ear should be, was a large scar. Aside from those scars, she liked his face. It looked kind. Almost good looking, really. <br>
&quot;Thank you for saving my life.&quot; She spoke. <br>
He smiled. A lopsided smile, but a smile nonetheless. <br>
&quot;Me glad to. Me name be Gug.&quot; he said as he thumped his chest with a fist. <br>
&quot;Pleasure to meet you, Gug. My name is Jolene.&quot; So, now, my desitny has a name, each thought. <br>
&quot;How did you find me?&quot; Jolene asked. One minute, she's near death, and the next, talking with her destined mate. <br>
&quot;Me feel yoo. Me heer yoo call me. In dreems.&quot; Jolene nodded. She too, had heard him in her dreams, saying he was coming to her. <br>
&quot;I heard you too.&quot; she said simply. The unlikely pair continued to look at each other, uncertain what to say. Jolene stuggled painfully to her feet, and walked up to him. He was still sitting and she could look into his face. She reached out a hand, and lightly touched his face. She then placed a hand on either side of his face, and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. <br>
Puzzled, Gug spoke. <br>
&quot;Why yoo do dat?&quot; She shrugged. <br>
&quot;It seemed the right thing to do.&quot; He liked the feel of her lips and the feelings it brought up in him. So he returned the favor. <br>
&quot;Yup. It seem right ting to do.&quot; he agreed. <br>
He beamed a wide smile at her, which she returned. Her heart flipped in her chest. <br>

She learned all about him, and he, her. <br>
&quot;Funny, yoo look no like elf.&quot; She giggled. <br>
&quot;I suppose not, but my mother is half elf, my father human. I took after him in looks it seems, and I also inherited the night vision of my father. Blind. However, I will live longer than most humans, due to the elven blood. You will like her. She is a caring woman.&quot; <br>
He thought on this. He would like to meet her mother. <br>
&quot;One more ting. Yoo said yoo be a, umm..&quot; he struggled on the word, &quot;owcast? Why dat?&quot; <br>
Jolene smiled. <br>
&quot;Well, I sort of imposed a solitairy life upon myself. Not many friends do I have. All my friends are considered outcasts of society. Necromancers, Shadowknights, Rogues, Trolls, Tier'Dal, Ogres, all these that most societies would rather see dead.&quot; <br>
Gug pondered this. <br>
&quot;Must be hard for yoo. Da child of two peeple who belong to da ones dat want all us..owcasts..ded.&quot; <br>
&quot;Yes, my loyalties are split. Part of me says go do Rallos's bidding, another part says no. So I have chosen my enemies carefully. Since I had the love of my parents, I have compassion for others. I cannot partake in wanton slaughter.&quot; Then she grinned. <br>
&quot;But I am not above it should the occasion present itself. Got to protect my own life, yes?&quot; He grinned. <br>
&quot;Yup.&quot; <br>

Gazing out on the western horizon, listening to the sounds of the waves caressing the beach, the call of ocean birds. Her life has been rewarding, yet challenging, since meeting her Big Teddy, as she affectionately calls him. And just recently, he made her his woman when he carried her off in the ogre fashion. And the two seemed to clearly lead a charmed life, the unlikely union of two children of Rallos Zek, of different creed. Why Rallos wanted this was unknown, but who was one to question him? <br>
Her biggest challenges were that she was not welcome in his home city. Although she was a child of Rallos, the patron god of most ogres, they did not seem to care. She was human, and the enemy. Nor, it seemed, he was welcome among her people, save her parents, who thought he was wonderful. <br>
She did have to smile, though. He did manage to persuade the halflings he was good. When she found him one day sitting with the town guards, exchanging jokes, she felt a happiness in her heart. She knew ogres weren't evil, just misunderstood, and one deputy even said as much. The militia of Freeport made Gug look like the little Faeries in the Faydark, and people said ogres were evil? A good look at the head of Council there, Lucan DeLere, proved that ogres were the least of Freeport's problems. <br>
<br>
Jolene closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. <br>
And gagged. <br>
&quot;Ack! What is that horrible smell?&quot; she coughed and held her nose. She turned to face her mate, who was busy stirring in a big black pot over the fire. <br>
&quot;Me make new majik drinks. Make yoo strong.&quot; <br>
She looked at him dubiously. <br>
&quot;You sure about that?&quot; she leaned over the pot and looked at the bubbling green brew, and covered her nose again. He laughed at her. <br>
&quot;Smells like something the orcs drop on the ground that you have to avoid stepping in.&quot; <br>
Gug laughed loudly. <br>
&quot;Me seen doz piles. Dey do stink. But dis actly taste bedder dan it smell.&quot; <br>
She eyed him skeptically, but took a tentative taste, and was surprised of the minty flavor. <br>
&quot;Sure don't smell minty,&quot; she mumbled. <br>
He looked at her and smiled as he took her in his arms and gave her a soft kiss. <br>
She watched as he poured the liquid into bottles and washed the pot, preparing it for the next batch. As the vile brews simmered, they ate their nighttime meal, and settled onto the sand, and watched the sun set. <br>
&quot;So where do we go tomorrow, Teddy?&quot; <br>
&quot;Hmm, go bak to Overdere?&quot; <br>
She smiled. It was ironic she could walk freely in that isolated outpost, yet not in the city of Ogguk, or Neriak. <br>
&quot;Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I have need of supplies.&quot; <br>
He nodded. They would go. He lifted her into his arms and lay her on the pallets they shared. He held her close, and she used his arm as a pillow. She yawned and kissed his arm. He kissed the top of her head. <br>
&quot;Goonite, me liddle Candie.&quot; she smiled. She liked his little pet name for her. <br>
&quot;Good night my Teddy.&quot; <br>
Then they closed their eyes <p>Lenore Bravehard
