Are you now attempting to change the definition of First in Force as placed in the Summit you wrote and we all agreed to?  Seems to me it says &quot;18 people&quot; not &quot;18 people that have already successfully broken the plane.&quot;<br>
<br>
If &quot;First in Force&quot; = 18 and Guild Foo has 18 planer level people there, they they are &quot;First in Force&quot; and anyone else can go find somewhere else to play.  Of all people, Wolfypaw, I would not expect you to redefine the terms mid-argument.  And Ugle is right.  The guild that is First in Force, ie; has 18 people there, owns the plane and can ask intruders to leave.  Personally, I don't really care if someone is FD up there when I'm there with my guild.  When Amici took advantage of a First in Force day and a The Defiant SK was FD in the zone the entire time, I quite frankly didn't care.  I was nervous that a bunch of TD would come swarming into the zone but TD has been doing quite abit recently to polish up it's tarnished reputation (ie; not doing questionable things and apparently keeping a lid on some of the more &quot;outspoken&quot; members).  My estimation for TD has gone up considerably as a result.<br>
<br>
This Order of the Charred Heart monk, however noble his intentions, was in violation of Summit III as written by you and agreed to by the various guild leaders of this server.  I'll note that the aforementioned TD SK seems to have been guildremoved from The Defiant.  I think it's an ironic circumstance when The Defiant (I am assuming here) disciplines a member of their ranks for presumably violating the summit in the very manner you are now condoning.<br>
<br>
Now, perhaps my facts are mistaken and Dead of Winter did not, in fact, have 18 people present for this raid on the Plane of Fear.  Regardless, they had more forces assembled than did Order of the Charred Heart (a guild for whom I have the highest respect, based soley on the membership of Balfor Honorblade).  I cannot, and will not accept that the monk had any right to be in plane that day regardless of the presence of Dead of Winter as 1 monk does not a &quot;First in Force&quot; raiding party make, as defined by you in Summit III and agreed to by the various guild leaders of this server.  And in not being First in Force, the plane was not owned by the guild represented bu the monk, and therefore the guild represented by the monk should not have had any forces in the plane at all (read: the monk). <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

If it is a FIF or FFA day, you can have 1, 2, or 17 people in the plane.  If someone comes in with 18 people, then you leave or /q as appropriate.  If you are 1 person and 17 members of some other guild are there and ask you to leave, well according to the summit they aren't FIF yet and really can't do anything.<br>
<br>
With the way things are today though, 1 group could be considered FIF for anything but golems, draco, and CT.<br>

Another fact is they didn't ask me to leave, one of them asked me to /q with something of a cryptic (to me at least) reasoning.  Didn't say anything about who they were, why they had the right to ask me too, for how long or anything like that.  I've already admitted that I unwittingly left things open for problems to arise by being afk, and that won't happen again.  So, for those of you (I think just Ugle) who assume that I'm some crazy maverick that's out there just to train others for my own benefit, you're just plain wrong.  This isn't open for debate, I know my intentions, you don't.  Simple as that.<br>
<br>
Now, as long as people are hanging on technicalities, here you go.  Definitions that I read in the summit gave no one the right to ask me to leave, that is until LoD got there, and they chose not to.  But guess what, had I been there (at the terminal) and someone asked me to leave, I would have.  I can totally understand that you can't trust everyone, and not everyone knows me.  I wouldn't have liked, but I wouldn't have taken it personally either.  I never, NOT ONCE, said that I refused to do so, this was never an issue to me.  Some people are reading this into the story, but it never happened.  By the time I came back to my terminal LoD was just starting to zone in, so I stayed.<br>

First from personal experience and several other posts about them on a different subject OoCH is probably one of the better guilds on our server which holds their members to a higher standard than most, and Tunzell is one of their better peeps. If you want to get technical then DoW only had 12 members in plane by their own admission and therefore by summit agreement did not have enough to claim FiF so that if shissar did spawn and Tunzell called for more guildmembers and friends to come and their total was greater than 18 he could have asked Dow to leave. As it was no one at the time could claim FiF so for DoW to ask him to leave was wrong. <br>
 Second he stated he was Afk, god how many times have I done that? a crp load waiting Fd'd for Rharzar to spawn while I was off doing something else only to periodically check to see if it spawned, and I am sure that I am not the only one.<br>
 The only real point of contention was if Tunzell trained DoW or not? the rest is really a non-issue at the time. I wasn't there at the time so there is no first hand knowledge on the incident only a reasonable doubt to that having been the case. The reasons for this are as follows 1. He was stated as being on the north wall while DoW was breaking in to the west, now thats a heck of a run without getting your ass reamed by the mobs up.<br>
 2.There was more than one person (other than members of DoW) in zone which could have been one of them? don't know but by knowledge of OoCH and its members, and reason Tunzell was there makes it unlikely that he would have done that?<br>
 3. Motive: what was his motivation for this act? just being a jerk? wouldn't be consistant with observed past behavior. Trying to keep Dow out of Plane? well as stated he could have easily gotten FiF if spawn popped and DoW did not have it at time (easily because there is at least 12 non OoCH members that I know of that would have ran to assist if asked, myself being one of them).<br>
 Is it possible that events occurred as stated by DoW members, yes but not necessarily probable. There was obviously a cluster phuque that happened and DoW was at the recieving end of it and for that am sorry, if you need the 18 to keep, even just for numbers I dont mind helping others and there is nothing on PoH, nor PoF that I need or desire now cept to help others, this holds true for DoW, OoCH or not quite as uber as others guild_01.<br>
 Maybe something can be worked out between Tunzell and Dow, or OoCH and Dow to smooth things over, if you give them a tell without spite, or anger most likely you would get it. Again just my 2 cents worth.<br>

the problem with your little summit is you've always tried to put number restrictions on things.  first it was &quot;you can only have 6 guests!&quot; and now it's &quot;have to have 18 to be FiF , sorry!&quot; but the summit isnt going to work as long as you keep trying this horse @#%$ because you'll have people like this @#%$ monk that &quot;@#%$ on other people's pancakes&quot; (Bodkin sucks ass , but that always makes me laugh  =/ ) just because they feel like it.<br>

The only reason I brought up the numbers was that the FiF per summit was used as an issue not that I really care about what it takes to break Fear. <br>
 The point I brought up is still valid and has as of yet not been disputed rationally (if thats possible) by you and that is the issue of intentionally training your group.<br>
 You have shown by your own words to be of dubious belivability although there are several other DoW members whos words I respect, unfortunatly you continue to make it very hard to respect you or your opinions. If you can please dispute the issue at hand without resorting to constant vulgarities ( mine was used to show that yes indead I can be a jerk too, just not as proficient as you seem to be)<br>

<br>
Would it not make more sense to go on SCHEDULED days to avoid this so called @#%$.  I will say that I highly doubt Tunzell trained you, as I was grouped with his chanter for most of the night this went down, and all he had been doing for the past days with his monk is sit there FD and watching to see the Shissar shouts.  He would have no reason to train you people, as far as you seeing him do this, did you not say there were others monks there, did you see his specific &quot;Zend... has fallen to the ground message&quot;, or did you just see some monk, and by your own admission &quot;wears a fungi tunic which just about every other monk on the server wears&quot;.  Could it not be that the other monks in the zone possibly did this.  We know it wasn't just you up there, we know that you did not have 18 up there which is what is needed to &quot;per the summit&quot; call it FiF, I don't care if you can break it with 5 people, we can break it with that many too, but that is beside the point as its not what the summit says.  <br>
<br>
In the end though this post was really to point out that single quote.  Would it not just be easier to schedule a planes trip, and not have to deal with anyone else?  <br>

The three days of FiF/FFA were put in there to allow people more chances to get what they needed from the Planes.  If someone got trained in WW or PoG, would you post that &quot;Well, you shouldn't have been there then?&quot;.  If this post was about two Guilds that headed up there at the same time and were now catfighting about who got there first, then you might be making a valid point.  But there was nobody there except a couple FD Monks from what I see posted.  Nobody else here seems to be saying that DoW didn't have any right to be up there.  DoW's complaint is that with all the extra roamers it already takes them working efficiently to break it, and when somehow @#%$ gets trained all over them, their day is gonna suck.  But wait, it gets better then that.<br>
<br>
Then, rather then starting a big public flame, they just tell the Monk where to stick it.  If the Monk had nothing to feel guilty about, why not just blow it off?  Kunzell chose to start this so that we could all hear HIS side.  Fatty and some others posted how things went down from their perspective.  Ever seen someone arrested during a civil disturbance?  If they weren't caught on tape they say &quot;I didn't do anything, I was just standing there, I'm innocent I tell ya.  And besides, I'm in a good Guild and we would never do anything like that&quot;.  That crap doesn't fly here anymore then it would in most courtrooms.  When @#%$ hits the fan in a zone, whether or not you had anything to do with it, if you're somewhere where they can see you and they get unexplainable adds, they're going to blame you.<br>
<br>
And I am a little confused here.  Kunzell, you say you were halfway across the zone if I read you right.  Kaurik says that one of the people dying targetted you with %t.  Is there some spell that they had cast on themselves that let them see you all the way across the zone, through the hills and buildings and such that let them target you?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uarisai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arisai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 9:29:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  !</span><hr size=1> I think what people need to realize is that Kaurik is joking around 100% of the time.

I understand that FFA / FiF are there for people that don't want scheduled days, but on those days things like this can happen.  Now yes I understand that even on a scheduled days you can get poached, people can still zone in and hunt and you really have no backing against them according to VI rules.  But the community follows the summit for the most part, and if you go on a scheduled day then you don't run into any problems like FD people sitting in your zone.  <br>
<br>
Now, with regards to this training stuff, me personally until I see an SS or something I'm gunna go have to going to have to side with Tunz on this.  Just my personal opinion.  Targeting can get fudged easily as I'm sure everyone has at some time or another clicked randomly into the air or the ground and come up with some random mob that is on the other side of the zone.  There were other monks in the zone, Tunzell was on the other side of the zone paying no attention to his monk except to check every once in a while to see if he saw shouts.  And we already know that these group of people had been having problems that day.  Now I can't remember who but there is a saying &quot;with all things being equal the simplest answer is usually the right one&quot;.  So what is more likely, a monk that was AFK got up trained mobs halfway across the zone just to kill some people that he doesn't care about.  Or that a group of people, that already had problems before during breakin got bad aggro from one of the people doing CR zoning in and getting aggro on a mob that started a chain aggro??  I'm gunna go with the chain aggro from zoning in during CR. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utunzell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tunzell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 12:08:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sorry DoW!</span><hr size=1> Okay, more silliness.<br>
<br>
Dalynia, what are you talking about?  Where did you get your 'facts'.  Where in this entire thread did it say that DoW had 18 people?  Where in this entire thread did I rufuse to go?  How do you know that your alleged TD SK was /guildremoved for such behaviour?  Oh wait, reading what you put down there leads me to belive that you aren't even sure that the SK is not TD anymore.  I guess the actual facts are just to much to deal with eh?  BTW it's Balfor HonorBOUND that you refer to not Honorblade, no biggie, just an example of how close you seem to pay attention to detail.  You're right that he's a great guy though.  Look, I have run into many Amici peeps, you guys are great, I wish you no ill will.  You just need to read everything before you post things as facts.  Either way, Wolfypaw was going off the facts that were presented to him here, and made an edjucated stand.  I think you owe him an apology, but that's just my take.<br>
<br>
Ugle, the arguement of why would someone innocent of such accusations publicly exclaim it is just plain stupid.  Now you've changed your arguement on this thread with nearly every single post.  Each time I counter, you change whatever your issure is, and drop the previous one.  There's no point in my addressing you any further.  Dakin is right, they should schedule a raid if they don't want to deal with others being there.<br>
<br>
As for me being targeted, my guess is this.  Subject gets trained by a monk; subject sends a tell to monk A, with no response; subject sends a tell to monk B, then recieves a 'wasn't me' reply; subject decides that monk A is the culprit and makes up the targeting issue to gain support.  Now that it's turned into a big deal, for subject to admit what he's done would be much harder then just sticking to his story and trying to save some kind of dignity.  I guess someone is saying that he did a %t just trained me before death, but that's impossible since I wasn't there.  So maybe he had the time before death to do the /who.  Dunno, but one and/or several of them are FoS somewhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubalforh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BalforH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 2:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sorry DoW!</span><hr size=1> Howdy all:<br>
 Well after following this thread for several days I thought I might jump in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Im not sure how but this thread has evolved into such a heated topic but it has. The premiss was simple, Tunzell felt he had been falsely accussed and simply wished to clear his name. Personally I would have ignored it.<br>
<br>
 1. I have know Zendareth/Tunzell for a very long time, I can state with complete confidence that he did not do what he was acussed of doing.<br>
 <br>
 2. Having a monk FD in the zone on none scheduled days does not violate any guidelines set forth by the summit. If the zone is claimed by a guild (having sufficient forse to do so as set forth by the summit) said guild can request that the afore mention monk the vacate/q.<br>
<br>
 3. As Tunzell previously stated he was not the only char in the zone awaiting the spawn of the everelusive shissar.<br>
<br>
 4. Dalynia..thank you for your kind words. I wish I had thought of Honorblade I like it better then Honorbound <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
