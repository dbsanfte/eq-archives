That's understandable, and it's to be expected.<br><br>Not a problem.   Dollaine was hosting the raid.  He did pretty well, all things considered.  Everyone there was told that all items will be rolled by all attending, with the exception of the Pally book.  Fair enough...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>7 fully buffed groups took Naggy down in under 2 minutes.<br><br>The items Naggy dropped were the following:<br><br>Cloak of Flames (2)<br>Hammer of the Scourge <br>100% Weight reduction bag.<br><br><br><br>Not a problem.  No book for Din, but ah well.  We randomed on the first cloak.  Someone named Trenity won, and there was much rejoicing.  Yay...<br><br>We waited, and waited.   Finally someone asked &quot;Are we gonna roll on the next cloak?&quot; <br><br>To this, Dollaine responded with the following. (And BOY were we shocked)<br><br>&quot;I'm going to keep the cloak for myself.  I'm the leader of this raid&quot;<br><br>Well....   People started freaking!  &quot;How can you Ninja an item right in front of us like that?&quot; &quot;Who the hell do you think you are?&quot;  And so forth.<br><br>Dollaine was adamant for a while, but I guess the /tells must have been pretty extreme.  He finally said &quot;Fine, then I appoint this cloak to ... Bjornn Bearamon&quot;<br><br>So the yelling continued.  And the rants, and the outrage shook the zone.<br><br>Picture 40 of us staring at this idiot that we spent the last 4+ hours waiting on.  He was without remorse.<br><br><br>Anyways, Bjornn finally spoke up and said &quot;I'll let the people random on it&quot;.   My good friend Nelifus won the roll.<br><br>It took another 20 minutes and MANY rants later before Bjornn parted with the Cloak.<br><br><br>Now remember... The hammer and the bag haven't been mentioned....<br><br>After asking around, I found out that Bjornn was given the hammer.  Hmmmm....<br><br><br>So no problem, right?  Guy's an idiot.  Decides to pull the Greed card out right in front of all of us.  Fair enough.<br><br>So Nelifus ports us to the WC spires.   We arrive JUST in time to watch Dollaine, Bjornn, and two others (Someone named Havern, and another guy, can't remember) randoming on some &quot;undisclosed&quot; item.<br><br>So Neli and I tossed in our votes for the hell of it.  BAM.  Neli won <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    A quick &quot;Take That&quot; was all I heard from Nelifus before I logged.<br><br>I had to run a character over from Oasis to Freeport.  While running through, I noticed a shout <br><br>Bjornn shouts &quot;PC on Blight Hammer of the Scourge&quot;<br><br>Hmmm..  So I sent him a tell saying &quot;I am on to you pal&quot;<br><br>I was kind of upset <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>So Bjornn starts sending me tells.  &quot;What's up?&quot;  &quot;You there?&quot;<br><br>I ignore him.  Dollaine then jumps in by sending me a tell...  Hmmmm.. That was quick...<br><br>Anyways, it ended with Bjornn shouting out in the zone &quot;What is wrong&quot;, and I spilled it in EC.<br><br><br>Someone then shouted out that Bjornn was Dollaine's ALT.  not sure if this is true, but I am betting that it is.<br><br><br><br>First off, I don't like stirring up trouble.  I'm a fair and reasonable player.  I don't like to rock the boat, but this was insane.<br><br>In essence, we got Dollaine a 100% WT reduction bag (No idea what actually happened to it, but he IS a monk...), a hammer of Scourge, and had to TAKE the CoF from him with force.<br><br>It was aweful, guys.<br><br>So I'd just like to pass this on for all to decide on for themselves.  All in all, I enjoyed the raid.  I liked what we had accomplished, and I liked how everyone came together.  Unfortunately, the raid was orchestrated by an EXTREMELY greedy individual.  Pretty bad when the &quot;Raid Leader&quot; is the ninja looter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So odd..<br><br>Currently, Dollaine is in Elder Tribunal.  ET is a great guild in my opinion.  Many of my friends are in ET, and they're all a great bunch of guys.  This one slipped through the cracks, I guess.<br><br>No idea what ET will do about him.  They were notified about 10 seconds after he tried to Ninja.  My guess is that he'll be asked to leave the guild.  He's not a good representative of what Elder Tribunal stands for, that's for sure.<br><br>So for all other Guild Leaders, be advised.  Dollaine is not a good person.  Not at all.  I know that I will refuse his admission to Elysiam's Triad if he ever tries to apply.  I'd like to reccomend that other Guild Leaders do the same.  A person like this doesn't deserve a guild tag, IMHO  <br><br>I also have all the screen captures if you want.

Day one was great, he seemed cool and all.  Next day he's talking on guild chat and doesn't seem to have a clue about who we are or what we did the previous day and starts asking us about how much he could sell all his shaman gear for and should he delete his epic stuff or not?  He was TWO fights away from his epic (he said the day before), so Bashedo and I ask him why in the world he would want to delete his stuff when he was so close.<br><br>&quot;Oh, this isn't the real Bjornn, he and I traded accounts and now he's playing a monk.&quot;<br><br>Ok, wtf.  So he's removed from guild.  We didn't want to have anything to do with that kind of stuff.  A few days later, Dollaine starts sending Nomerc a bunch of tells explaining the situation.  I told Nomerc that I read a bunch of unfavorable stuff about Bjornn on the rants section of Inny.com and how he's being accused of theft.  Turns out that before he was guild removed, he was asking if we had any items in the guild vault that we had no need for (we were discussing reorganizing our guild vault) since he wanted to start a twink.  Good thing our policy is we don't give out items in our vault unless you've been on the guild for 90+ days (we just finally started recruiting outsiders, which to us NKs that have been together 5 years now... that's scary).<br><br>Then Nomerc gets into a convo with Dollaine and he's saying that he's just going to use his current guild (Elder Tribunal) to get his epic, and then he'd like to hang out with us again.  Merc says this to guild and all of us are saying &quot;Hell F no we don't want scum like that!&quot;  This is why strangers to us are scary hehe.  Then yesterday I see a character on guild named Bailey and I ask who it is.  Level 38 half elf druid, never heard of him before.  Turns out it's Dollaine.  He logs out before I could /guildremove the scum.  He was also very reluctant to tell us who he was, and now I know why.<br><br>Sounds like Bjornn (his other alts are Vooloo, a 31 bard, and Bailey, a 38 druid) and Dollaine are in this scam together.  Don't trust either of them, since they're so eager to ruin their reputations over greed. <p><img src="http://notoriouskillers.com/jeisenne.gif"><br><br><br><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35259" target="PushFrame">Jeisenne Naerisse</a></b><br>Beguiler of the 59th Solstice<br><a href="http://www.notoriouskillers.com"target="PushFrame">Notabilis Kruoris</a> of Innoruuk<br><br><br><i>Of all the times I've been alone<br>and thought of drastic things<br>Of all the times I've been an angel<br>I get broken wings</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubonestriker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bonestriker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/3/02 2:54:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://jayhawks.net/~watts/Images/Bonestriker_portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Well I'll be damned</span><hr size=1> As of today, Dollaine is no longer an initiate of Elder Tribunal (he was never a full member).

Also thank you for telling us about Bjornn.  Bjornn has been attending our raids recently as a guest of Dollaine (and had expressed interest in becoming a member).  Thanks for saving us some time.<br><br>And yes, Bjornn and Dollaine are friends.  Dollaine has (known) alts of Drollaine and Mollaine.  The officers of ET will also investigate to see if Havern had any role in this event.  However please give him the benefit of the doubt until we find out more.<br><br>Finally, Elder Tribunal is sorry for any aggravation our initiate caused, and let us know if there is anything further that can be done.

My experience has always shown me that he is an honorable player, and I'll be dammed if he was Bjornn.  Besides, I think he's the current guild leader of Vigil, which is a small guild but they do high level raids ALL the time, so I don't see why he would stick his shaman (if it was Bjornn) on a smaller guild.
