--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;Don't do that, Sarah...&quot; Dean started. &quot;Rylen is gonna hurt you again. I can only be here for some times, bu-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He won't do it again, really!&quot; She stamerred.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saah... Have you even seen this guy?&quot; He sighed into the reciever.<br>
<br>
&quot;.....No, but-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT THE HELL!? I thought you met this guy, like he lived in Granite of something. But you've *never* even *SEEN* him?&quot; He was getting irate very quickly. &quot;Please tell me you got a pic, a REAL pic, at least?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; She shuffled the phone around. &quot;Look, my dad needs the phone, so we'll carry this conversation on tomorrow, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine. Peace.&quot; Dean hit the button, and the telephone beeped off. Great. Sarah was going back to Rylen. ~Seems like everything really does elude my grasp.... Does God *really* like me, or am I *really* just that lucky?~<br>
<br>
&quot;I've had enough of this.&quot; He moved his aching back off the recliner &amp; strode around the wooden counter. He planted the phone back on the charger, slipped on his Vans, and walked out of the house. He forgot a shirt. He forgot to take his dog chain back off. He forgot that he had two knives strapped to his belt...<br>
<br>
He seemed oblivious to it all. Dean wasn't in the real world anymore, anyways. Slipknot was playing in the background as he closed the door to his apartment. &quot;This is a seed, It festers and breathes, My heros are dead, They died in my head....&quot; He scared Mrs. Weatherbee, as he constantly does, with his spiked, black hair and menacing, red eyes. He changed them on occasion. ~Thank Loki for tha spells...~ Dean thought.<br>
<br>
After he walked out of the building, he realized he wasn't even out on the streets. There was no blackened trash cans. No mail boxes, cars, lamp posts... The wind blowing didn't carry the stench of exhaust and at least a few newspapers on it. Instead, the aroma of stagnating hot dogs from a corner vendor was replaced by the scintilating smells of fresh daisies. The stars were shining, more brightly than most nights... The canopy of green was scattered, only letting a few glimpses show every so often. It was almost uniform, the way the forest made her light shows...<br>
<br>
~I looked to the ground. Fresh dirt &amp; grasses underfoot, along with ivy, belltops, &amp; the sporadic mulberry bushes, were all I could see. The low hum of the lamplights and cars were now a breeze russling the leaves. I breathed in the fresh air deeply, and sighed. Tranquillity...~<br>
<br>
Dean was walking along Dunn, incoherent to his surroundings. An officer rode past, barely noticing a man shuffling along, seemingly out of place of his surroundings. Nothing unusual here...<br>
<br>
It was about midnight. Most people were in bed, or rushing off to bed. Or partying. Either way, not many street crawlers were out prowling, &amp; backed away from the short, muscular, well-armed freak. Baggy pants can conceal all kinds of guns, after all... Dean turned the corner, out onto main street. He was going towards Cherr Crop, the only real strip joint around.<br>
<br>
~I heard dull echoes in the distance... laughter? Of course, the elves were always joyful, active in their nightlife. It made perfect sense. I ran towards them. A flashing light blinded me, as if it were a warning drone. I'd encountered them before. I promptly threw a dagger at it, to the upper right corner, and it swerved away, injured, no longer interested in me. Foolish sentries.~<br>
<br>
After a dagger plunked into the man's shoulder, pinning him to the seat, the Ford F250 ran onto the sidewalk, crushing a local drunk. He didn't know what was coming upon him, though, as he was preoccupied with the millions of ants trying to get into his skin. Dean marched on.<br>
<br>
The red eyed freak finally came to the door of Cherr Crop. Dean wasn't concerned with the bouncer, though. He smiled curtly to the hulking white man, bald, &amp; with a pair of studded rings on each hand. Dean jumped onto his shoulder, spun around, and caught a fire ladder before the big man could react. He looked up, saw the shirtless clown shimmying up the ladder, and decided he was cool to pass.<br>
<br>
Dean got to the roof, three stories up. He knew this level quite well; it was the rave level. Bright lights, techno beats, &amp; all kinds of drugs were all that really mattered in the dark room. Flashes. Sounds. Touch. Smoke. Repeat.... Dean had more important things to do. He dragged off of a dooby, &amp; passed it on, thinking this literal roach didn't like being burned alive much, &amp; thought the elves may stick to their customs. <br>
<br>
Surreal (cont)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 The wisps of smoke trailed from Dean's lips as he opened the door, &amp; climbed down the spiraling staircase. There were pads all on either side, as most of the ravers fell off the rail, too obsessed with the little pink gummi bears running around their shoes.<br>
<br>
With all the skill of a circus acrobat, Dean jumped, twisted, and caught a ceiling bar. This was hooked to seven different lights, &amp; everyone grooved all that much harder as the light swayed across their bodies.<br>
<br>
~Ah, to swing on the branches once again... I love this free falling feeling! Spiderwebs down below to catch me, elven folk to rejoice in my own magickal addition to their show. Now, to find the king again, &amp; find Him...~<br>
<br>
Dean swung from one light fixture to the next, finally jumping down onto a table. Three slopped girls started in uprorious laughter, &amp; held out dollar bills. &quot;Shake it, baby! WOOOOOoo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean smiled kindly at them, grabbed a shot glass &amp; downed it, &amp; hopped off the table. &quot;Sorry m'lady, 'tis not appropriate for one such as me to entertain one so fair as thee.&quot; He bowed at the middle, &amp; scampered off, dodging the &quot;dancing elves&quot; &amp; &quot;bards&quot; upon the stage. This was the live music section. There were soundproof walls to keep the techno and the live metal seperated. Dean, with his &quot;extrasensory hearing&quot;, could still make out the general beats of the rave.<br>
<br>
Vaulting between the curtains, &amp; making his way back stage, he found Mike again, or &quot;Michealangelo the Great&quot;, as his &quot;title rightly called for&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Michealangelo! Just the king I needed to see!&quot; Dean exclaimed.<br>
<br>
The semi-fat black man w/ dreads &amp; a very Bob Marley look hugged Dean tightly, clapped him on the back, and said, &quot;Hey boy, good to see you again! What can I get you?&quot; He saw the gleeful look in his eyes, and Mike groaned. &quot;OOOHH no, not this again... You realize you've torn up more than you've helped conserve, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My apologies, Michaelangelo the Great, Kind, and Wise.&quot; He bowed again, in the same graceful way. &quot;I feared for your life. The vile drow had their arms at the ready, and-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea yea, I heard ya a thousand times already, maan..&quot; Mike sighed. &quot;He's down at the bar again. He keeps bribin the bouncers for entry. I usually tell them to accept bribes anyways- anyone who can pay high for entry can pay high for drinks.&quot; He stared Dean in the eye. &quot;Don't break my vodka.&quot;<br>
<br>
~I grinned. The elf king loved little as he did his barbarian's vodka... I agree wholeheartedly. As I ran back out to the stage, the bards were playing a piece I absolutely loved! The melody enwrapped my very soul, &amp; I began to move my body involuntarily to the sound. Ah, how elven magicks can instill such pleasures in the mind...~<br>
<br>
The stage was quieted, then grew in an uproar as this dangerous little punk kid ran out on the stage during a cover of Digg. A classic, to say the least, but this local band pulled it off nicely. &quot;I Would love to beattheface of anymotherfuckerthats thinkingthey can change me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean roared in with the chorus, &amp; jumped off a speaker into the jumping crowd. Amazingly, he was caught, &amp; not much injury was sustained. He ran like the wind to the long hall filled with pentagrams, red writings, eerie sounds, &amp; a very Halloween-type theme to it. Only this was actually scary.<br>
<br>
~I ran through the Cave of Misery. This place sealed off the bar from the rest of the palace. In case of any intruders, not being of high elven descendance, one would turn and flee at this site. I was the exception, I was told- after all, I am more than just human. Either way, I made my way through the tables &amp; such, towards the bar. There, I saw a dark man with a trenchcoat covering all of his body, save the long white hair that billowed out behind him. Targon.~<br>
<br>
&quot;TaaarrrrRR-GOOOOOOOOONNN!!&quot; he roared. The man turned around, startled, with a drink in his hand.<br>
<br>
Seeing the bare-chested, sweat-covered, knife-happy kid again, he downed the last of his cognac, leaned to the bartender, &amp; whispered, &quot;I'llberightback, baby...&quot; she pretended to giggle, &amp; made a fist &amp; clapped it into her hand as he walked towards Dean. She nodded at him, &amp; threw up her hands in a devil's horn sign.<br>
<br>
~The man approacheth. I stand my ground as I have before, as I will continue to do, as I can do naught but do. I must, for it *is* the honorable thing to do. He may kill me with some trickery of magick, but I will not see it this day. He cannot kill me, not yet.<br>
<br>
I stepped towards him. He queried, &quot;Why dost thou call me by my birth name?~<br>
<br>
&quot;Why the hell you keep callin me Targon er wotever, kid?&quot;<br>
<br>
****ack, can't write more, tired.... fite scene next entry. stay tuned &amp; all that jazz, I guess, if NE1's readin this...<br>
<br>
Surreal (again...3)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 ~The vile dark elf had trespassed for the last time. Granted, yes, I did tend to associate with the drow on occasion, but this one was nothing of the sort that I cared for- No, this man pretended to be something he was not, &amp; was a plague on all those around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Step from th' bar and the ladies, Targon. We shan't have more of your treachery this night.&quot; I spat upon his shadow silk boots. &quot;Leave, lest this bar become a bloodbath.&quot;~<br>
<br>
The dirty drunk named John Assler, commonly known as Targon in Cherr Crop nowadays, stroked his brownish-black stubble that grew on his pale chin. It seemed as if that was the only hair that contained color on his entire body. His hair was, indeed, long and white. The black gloves on his hands only added to Dean's proclomation (in his own reality, that is) that this man was surely a dark elf. Barbarians and ogres filled the tavern, yes, and human girls danced upon the stage with lights and poles and little (if any) clothing, but Dean's attention was rivetted at this man.<br>
<br>
&quot;I beseech thee one last chance, drow...&quot; Dean crouched into a fighting stance, leading with his left foot, hands straight and stiff. The four feet between them seemed infinitely smaller as the crowd gathered around. They've all seen this fight before, so most just went back to their private parties or staring at the dancing girls.<br>
<br>
The wooden floors creaked as John stepped away from the bar. He kicked his stool back, saying, &quot;This is America. This is a free country. I'll hit yer ass with a lawsuit so fast-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why haven'tCHA, Johnnay?&quot; an onlooker mused.<br>
<br>
John frowned. He knew he was beat, &amp; he'd been kicked out of all the other joints and bars around town for scraps or too much drinking. It wasn't his fault he was a bad drunk, really...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not leavin, kid, so...&quot; John spoke as he slowly turned towards the counter again, &amp; grabbed a bottle. He spun and swung at Dean while shouting, &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;<br>
<br>
~I ducked the blackjack produced from his cloak, &amp; dropped to the ground quickly. Before Targon could react &amp; bring it down upon my unprotected skull, I grabbed and ankle &amp; promply lifted it above his head. Targon fell to the ground, more magickal items spilling from his pockets. I saw a crossbow, much like the ones others have carried when infiltrating Cherr Crop. The glorious palace never falls, though, as my constant protection keeps it as thus.~<br>
<br>
Dean grabbed the glock from the ground with great agility, whisked it to the bartender, and landed his knee on John's shoulder. The pinned drunk started flailing around, knocking Dean in the side of the head. Rolling with the momentum, the sweat-coated freak rolled towards another table. He slammed into a chair, knocking it over.<br>
<br>
The drunk was up with suprising speed, and grabbed the chair. He brought it down on Dean's head, splintering the back off it. As John broght up the chair for another blow, Dean kicked him in the stomach, twisted around the standing man while on the floor, and brought his legs up to kick the back of John's kneecaps. The drunk fell.<br>
<br>
(ack, skool suXor, teacher screamin, bell ringing.... yea, writin more l8r <br>
<br>
Surreal (part 4)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 ~Targon fell, and I was atop him in moments. The fight ended shortly thereafter, as I disposed of the savage creation. The beast, the vile drow that all the elven races hated at birth, fell beneath my fang. His crimson life force spilled onto the floor for the last time, and I was hauled to my feet before I was even allowed to taste the sweet, salty blessing of victory. In mid-lap I was carried by the bouncers from the front. Never before had they the gall to assault me; why now? Why, after I had disposed of the greatest enemy of all the Wakening Lands? Why?~<br>
<br>
Dean was hoisted to his feet by two burly bouncers. Both were bald, both in open shirts, but the white one had nearly two hundred pounds over his leaner co-worker. The burly mexican held the people back with his other arm as he lifted Dean's left side. Blood ran down the young man's bare chest, and his knife was clutched in the other massive bouncer's hand. Together, they made their way through the the throng of people crowding around. They were like jackals, all of them, waiting for a feast of the eyes, and Dean gave them one... oh yes, he did. There were no virgin eyes after this night (if you could consider them virgin eyes in Cherr Crop)<br>
<br>
By the time he was hauled up to Mike, Dean was in a fury. Another bouncer joined in the carrying of the tiny, enraged man. Mike wasn't in the least bit surprised to see blood streaming down his chest. His eyes went wide when he was told by the knife-clutching bouncer what exactly Dean did.<br>
<br>
&quot;He straight up *bit* tha @#%$'s neck off, boss,&quot; He said.<br>
<br>
Mike's eyes went wide. His peaceful, Bob Marley attitude was replaced by a wide-eyed look of fear. &quot;H-he... he... what?&quot;<br>
<br>
The other bouncer, now restraining Dean totally in a full nelson while the other grabbed his thrashing feet, cried, &quot;He killed him! He killed that Targon dude, man!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;John Assler...&quot; A tall, lanky whie man with a long white beard crept out from around a corner, and Dean became suddenly still. His eyes went from the blood red they had glowed to previously to a deep, understanding brown. &quot;His real name was John Assler.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But then-&quot;<br>
<br>
Big Mike was cut off by the stranger. &quot;Dean, in case you couldn't tell from the garb, manner, etiquette, and all around accent, is not quite... sane.&quot; He strode around to the bouncer holding Dean's legs, and eased the young man's feet back to solid tile. &quot;At least, not in this state.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, he sure as hell seems to know you.&quot; Dean's eyes were wide and star-spangled; he was oblivious to &quot;Michaelangelo's&quot; words.<br>
<br>
&quot;The great Zedicuss Zu'ul Zorander...&quot; Dean whispered. His tough, near-black spikes began softening. &quot;Wizard of the First Order...&quot; Breaking the bouncer's now relaxed hold, he kneeled, fist to his heart, and bowed his head low.<br>
<br>
Turning back from the spectacle, the lanky old man garbed in a black trenchcoat and hat that covered all his features, spoke to Big Mike. &quot;He knows things. Granted, not accurately and not of any relevance in this world, but if he were interpreted, and things put into *our* terms, he would be a sort of prophet.&quot; A bewildered look crossed Big Mike's face. The man removed his hat and opened his coat. Beneath was an armani suit, neatly pressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;John Assler, or Targon in Dean's mind,&quot; he began while striding towards the band, &quot;Was a dark elf, or drow, and would have killed you and your entire club. Truth be told, John Assler was just some poor schmuck, down on his luck, that was ready to shoot up the bar before Dean interfered each time. The previous two times he just felt sorry for himself to be taken by a younger man, deepening his self-pity.&quot; He lit a cigarette, and tossed the remaining pack of Marlboro Reds to a table nearby. A punk woman, mid twenties, with spiked red &amp; white hair and a leather skirt, picked it up and walked off with it. He didn't seem to notice, or care either way. &quot;Dean stopped it. In his mind, he knew. In our world, he knew. Though the reasons were different, the results would have been the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned back towards the bouncers who appeared to be dozing off, and promptly shoved each of them. &quot;You appear to him as orcs or ogres of some sort.&quot; Then he turned to Big Mike and the fat dooby in his hand. &quot;And you are an elf king, kissing your ring and breathing magic into the air. Though these ideas make no sense here, they make perfect sense to him, &amp; the basic ideas get through. He just makes things more... fantasy-like.&quot;<br>
<br>
~I knew the signal well. I thought I saw it three times before, but I knew it too well. Perhaps the Great Wizard was testing me this time. Yes, that was it. He was testing me. I knew the signal from the dreams he kept sending me. Yes, First Wizard Zorander sent me the dreams, I knew it now! It all made perfect sense. The puff of smoke came again. It was the wrong shape, but it went in the right direction. The next was probably it...<br>
<br>
The snake smog. That was the signal.<br>
<br>
*GO!!!*<br>
<br>
Before the ogre guards could grab a hold of me, I had my dirk in hand again &amp; was vaulting up the musical constructs. These artifact walls produced sound at a high rate. If I could only ride on the notes of the bards... Would it work? Of course. Wizard Zorander would assist me here. He would make them solid for me, but *they* wouldn't know.<br>
<br>
How could I be so STUPID!? Elves are fickle people, now...<br>
<br>
But why would the death of a foe be taken so badly?<br>
<br>
I leapt. The ogres didn't have a chance. The musical constructs toppled to the floor as the blumbering buffoons crashed into it in an attempt to apprehend me. Fools, all. I had Wizard Zorander on my side, disguised though he be...<br>
<br>
The notes constructed to solidity underneath my feet. Before the holding spell wore through, though, I leaped again, this time catching the vines in the trees above. Nature and science all in one place; ah, the possibilities of this new world we live in. Perhaps I should speak with Urza, after all.<br>
<br>
Surreal 5<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 ~The bumpin bass chords...<br>
<br>
The trippy guitar riffs...<br>
<br>
The drum rolls, echoes; fascinating...<br>
<br>
&quot;Set your eyes to Ziii-ooonnnn... JudgeYA people riiiight oooonnnnn&quot; Echoes the messenger's voice. Zion...<br>
<br>
I set about at once. The musical notes carried through my body an extacy never before introduced; and it was all because of my own body, my own mind. I knew what I had to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me Mr. Dead maaaaaan, Do you have the answer-errrrr<br>
How you can get to heavaaaaan, Do you 'ave the answer-rrr?&quot;<br>
<br>
Zion. I would create this place. I would create it, I would be the supreme being, the ultimate entity. I could do nothing else but thus. This was not fate, nor destiny, nor the will of some omnipotent being. This was my choosing, my will, MY desire. I must do this.<br>
<br>
My hand waved. The image before me shimmered, and the notes passed into my body once again. I kept them echoing inside my head, that I might know them intimately &amp; ultimately by the time this ordeal would end. I flowed with the music, the emanations, &amp; my body flowed with it.<br>
<br>
The trees moved aside for me to see, &amp; there were more and more ogres filing up into the upper level of the elven fortress. Still pursuing me, they were... Pursue me no more they shall.~<br>
<br>
Dean stepped back into the shadows. He knew how to get out of this situation. He was, after all, the Conglomeration. As such, in his mind, he was the ultimate Rogue, Theif, Assassin, whatever. Different fantasy worlds, different names, same ideals. He conglomerated into that position once again, and the shadows were once again his blanket.<br>
<br>
The rave lights blinked and danced back and forth, and one bouncer of the five sat down directly underneath a black strobe light. There were two girls freak dancing, rolling on Xtacy, touching each other all over, one in fishnets &amp; a red tanktop, the other in a leather skirt &amp; not much... well, nothing else. He was occupied.<br>
<br>
~Sickening. The elves don't even realize their peril in the rapture. I might do something of this, but what have they done for me? Naught that I remember. As such, I need to build Zion. Farewell, Cherr Crop.~<br>
<br>
A DJ was on one wall. Two bouncers fanned out to block the roof access behind him. Dean noted this, &amp; watched the patterns of searching the other two... well, not-totally-occupied bouncers went in. Dean was across the room, hiding behind a small plant in a side room. It was dark, had great bass, &amp; there were millions of &quot;chck-chck-chck&quot;s of lighters &amp; lit cigarettes &amp; joints, along with the moans of pleasure coming from the unfortunate souls who were too @#%$ up to notice someone's hands down their pants. Or, well, not too unfortunate, but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
~The ogres lifted one elf off his chair &amp; threw him half way across the room. They were stronger than I thought, even for ogres... The other one, to the right side of the dancing grounds, chugged down three ales from a table of dwarves.~<br>
<br>
The bouncer closing in on the room Dean occupied helped lift a drunken man to his feet, &amp; put his arm around his girlfriend's shoulders. He told them to leave before he hurled on the tile. The other, closer to the roof access, carded two young looking females, &amp; proceeded to get their numbers. He let them slide, of course...<br>
<br>
The light came on in the room. People groaned, pants zipped back up, &amp; joints were hurriedly swallowed. &quot;Is there a shirtless little freak in this room?&quot; A handful of shirts were thrown at him from all angles. He started spouting off at the drugged up youth, and Dean quietly slipped behind him.<br>
<br>
~The ogre never knew I saw me going. I slipped behind him, close to the door, and hid behind an artifact plant. My guess is it was a water dispenser for the burned out elves. Technology and nature, all in harmony...<br>
<br>
Across the room, the ogre oggling the dancing women stepped over to the bard in the corner, near my exit route. Now... Decisions decisions... Vaulting upwards to the vines &amp; branches, &amp; swinging my way back up the way I came is one option. But one less quarrelsome and with less strife. The other was...~<br>
<br>
Dean jumped.<br>
<br>
He landed in the middle of a crowd of people after leaping from the top of a coke machine. They cried out, and the bouncers looked in his direction. Slowly bringing his head up, he grinned at them. The red gleam was back in his eyes. The lights around Dean seemed to have little effect in penetrating the gloom that engulfed him. Shadows seemed to cling to his back, crouched legs, neck, shoulders... He seemed a red-eyed demon from hell.<br>
<br>
That was the exact illusion he wanted. The shadows shucked form his body, but light seemed to slide off his corded muscles just the same. A bouncer dove for him, and Dean dodged left with amazing agility. He ducked &amp; rolled, sprang to his feet in front of one bulky sumo wrestler/hired thug, and jolted up into the air above even the DJ's turn tables. The other bouncer, showing off his muscles to another lady, turned &amp; dropped his jaw in amazement.<br>
<br>
Their awe was short lived, though. Quick as a whip, they all snapped towards the little satan spawn as he scrambled up the stairs, but he was out of sight, the door clanking on the metal trim, by the time they got up the first step.<br>
<br>
A flight later, spurred by shouts of &quot;Two weeks vacation!&quot; and &quot;DOUBLE SALARY!&quot;, three of the five bouncers were rushing out the door. There, highlighted in all the lights of the city streets, stood Dean, straight and proud, atop the ledge. &quot;Hey kid, c'mon back in here!&quot; a big black bouncer shouted. &quot;Its not worth it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean turned and looked at them. His eyes simply glowed with a unmatchable brilliance in the night lights. The neon signs paled in comparison to the gleam of insanity in those eyes. Dean lifted his remaining knife and drew it across his left shoulder as he looked back out towards the city.<br>
<br>
&quot;Valhalla will never be the same without my presence; you know this, yes?&quot; The crimson spilled from his shoulder. A few drips from Dean's elbow hit the concrete.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey...&quot; said the sumo wrestler. &quot;Its ok. They won't give ya that big of a fine! It-it was self defense, we all saw it!&quot; The other men behind him agreed with grunts and heartening chuckles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Karana will want to speak with you all,&quot; Dean said. He painted a circle with three dots onto his chest. &quot;He'll be angry that you let his only foe live.&quot; The confused bouncers did nothing. Their open button-down shirts, stained with booze and ash and blood, swayed in the breeze. &quot;*Semhamforash... Fuer gamma ost druaka... Mi andir! Mi sentrosi! Mi vasi! Mi SENTRO-O-O-O-SSIIIII!!!!!&quot; Dean swan-dived down.<br>
<br>
Surreal, 6<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 ~The visions swam. The pools of clear, crystallic waters shimmered as the ripples rolled across the previously unbroken surface.~ And he was pleased.<br>
<br>
Dean's world was three days in the making. He wasn't sure exactly how long it would take him to perfect it, but he was going to do it, by golly! Three days straight, never erring, never stirring, always perfecting. Three days since he'd eaten anything. His muscle mass had started to fade away, and the ripples beneath his skin started showing away to bone. What little flesh he had to begin with was nearly gone.<br>
<br>
The apartment was far worse, though. In the first three hours, he was bombarded in his little tranquill utopia. Bombarded by noises, sounds, and phone calls. Shards of what used to be a television screen lay all around, the largest piece being held in a death grip by Dean's left hand. The right one had long ago been severed to the bone, &amp; the blood was far too thin in that hand now to carry out the visions. He had to be more careful with his usage of his own life force. Unlike God, or what people acclaim as God, he was *not* infinite.<br>
<br>
That is... if *HE* was to begin with...<br>
<br>
On that note, Dean snapped again, this time not on a kitchen appliance (as he thought the blender was mocking him) but on the telephone. The answering machine, though, suffered the most wrath. There wasn't a piece that could even be considered a piece anymore. It was broken on Dean's rock-hard forehead, then melted onto the carpet. The carpet that caught fire was screamed and cursed at for being so damn weak. Dean took to setting the &quot;unfit&quot; fibers aflame, therefore purifying his world.<br>
<br>
Paradise. Ah, yes, the glorious place was almost complete. All that was needed was a few good banjos. Dean set out to complete the requirements for his utopia.<br>
<br>
He grabbed a few different lengths of used dental floss and hairs he'd collected from the floor &amp; under the chairs. The recliner was torn to shreds, and the fluff was used to &quot;feed the needy&quot;. A few hair folicles fell from that flurry, and they were all tied together in harmony with a piece of barbed wire to the kitchen sink (which was now promptly adjacent to the counter...) and the door to the refrigerator. Icewind Dale opened (aka, the freezer) soon after, and ice cubes were used to create the Great Lakes. Soon, Lake Michigan was home to the happy Beebles, a breed of stuffed teddy bear people that Urza himself had bred.<br>
<br>
~Urza. Find Urza. MUST find Urza!~ Dean ran towards the now shattered windows and dove out in a swan dive yet again. After all, he had to chase the phone (that he threw out three days ago). As before, when leaping from the concrete ledge at Cherr Crop, winds picked up, blowing to a pure gale, and Dean plunged his knife into the bricks, and slid to a stop. Bracing his legs onto the brick, he backflipped onto the top of a limousine.<br>
<br>
Dean rode around town (after the Cherr Crop incident) until the sun roof finally opened up and he crammed into the limo. Appalled by a rude, bare-chested young man, the snobs tried to kick him out of the car. He retaliated in a manner that any sane human would have when confronted by a troupe of cocky Erudites, whether under form-spells or not. He ate well before the driver took him home, and his jaw bone was added to Dean's collection.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there were no limousines to hitch a ride from this time. On top of that, the shard from the T.V. shattered on the brick, and Dean fell more rapidly. With a shout and a quick command of &quot;VASSSIIIIIIIIIIIII!&quot; The gale turned to a hurricane, a twister that literally materialized beneath him. A homeless man on the street corner dropped his jaw in amazement, looked down to his bottle, and threw it into the sewers.<br>
<br>
Dean landed on the top of a dumpster, now cleaned out from the gale. His legs gave way as he wobbled off the dumpster. His face was ashen, eyes as dark as a raccoon's. His bones were nearly popping out of his skin, and the gashes across his right palm were infected, black, and @#%$. He was a vision of plague and disease. He didn't seem to notice.<br>
<br>
~&quot;Hmmm... I'm nearly out of mana, and I only have 13 hit points left... I think I need to find Urza, and fast. He can heal me back in no time.&quot; I looked to the young brigand next to me. His hands were wrapped in cloth, as was most of his body. He couldn't have been very warm. He had a bottle of brandy in his hand. I grabbed it, took a swig, and poured a bit on my injured hand. Then I doused my arm. Maybe I should save a few hp's next time instead of Cannibalizing it all...~<br>
<br>
Dean thanked the man, and hobbled over to the park. This is always where he met Urza. It was dark out. Urza always came when it was dark. Hey, maybe even Wizard Zorander would find him again! Ah, the possibilities.<br>
<br>
Finding it the only rational solution, Dean plunged his hand into the near-clear waters of the man-made lake. The water changed colors before his eyes, and Dean was pleased. &quot;My utopia has been reached...&quot; He muttered. He growled out with renewed strength, &quot;ReechammmiiiiiiiiIIIIII,&quot; The water near his hand glowed blue while the lights stained the rest of the life-giving liquid a green hue. When the water changed red, that around Dean's hand stayed bright blue.<br>
<br>
He drew from the rest of the water as much strength as he could, and oddly enough, his hand actually started to heal! The puss was expunged, the infection, for the most part, purged! The hand began stitching itself back together, and was looking like it could actually refrain from being amputated when he removed it from the water. Though the lights stained the crystal liquid green, the water started looking red from the blood.<br>
<br>
Sitting back on his haunches, Dean looked to his right. He found some clovers there, and popped them into his mouth. A bit of nourishment couldn't hurt until the 2 great men he needed to see got there. Now, if only there was an elf or goblin around....<br>
<br>
(the magick IRL will be xplained soon enuff, don't worry. I know this is all a bit hard 2 follow, so bear w/ me, my ultimately few friends)<br>
<br>
Surreal: Enter the Planeswalker<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Brian kicked the hack again. &quot;*sigh* Nick keeps fuckkin this up...&quot; The odd looking, skinny little kid with a blue hoody and glasses was one of the best hackey sack players around. Only problem is... he was no where near as good as Brian.<br>
<br>
The hack went behind Brian's head. His black hair, pulled back in a pony tail, and the addition of his big frame, wide shoulders, &amp; large build, gave him the look of a white samurai. He was commonly called a monk by his fellow D&amp;D players. He studied Aikeedo (sp??) and a few other martial arts, and was always honorable, tranquil, and charismatic. He really was a monk, by all accounts.<br>
<br>
Before it could hit the ground, he kicked it back up over his head. He hit up the hack with his left knee, then to his right, stalled it on his right foot, and flipped it up to his head. He let it drop from his head, &amp;, just as it hit the ground, flipped it up off his foot, barreling straight at Andrew's head. The chubby, freckled, freakish looking kid with glasses was horrible, but he tried. With a misplaced kick, the hack went over towards Nick, and he stalled it on his head. The hack came back up towards Brian, and nailed him in the face. It didn't phase him.<br>
<br>
The street lights were on to his back, but they were fading fast. The fountain off thirty feet to their left changed colors erratically. The water glowed as a scrungy, dirty lookin kid knelt next to it. &quot;18, by the looks of him...&quot; Brian thought. &quot;What's he doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
The air blew. The other two members of this hack circle looked off in his direction. Andrew shifted his black shorts. Nick said, in his naturally condescending tone, &quot;Dude. What the hell is he doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like he's jackin off in the fountain,&quot; chuckled Andrew. His mind never left the gutter. When he got a sarcastic glare from his friend, he said, &quot;No, seriously, the water's changing colors!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, Andrew was a bit on the insane side. Spent a few months in the loony bin for clinical depression &amp; trying to run away, then attempted homicide towards his parents when he got back. Nick was a rider, &amp; did little else. He was a grease monkey, an engine head. Brian, on the other hand, was an artist, a bit of a sorcerer in his own light, and understood the sublime disturbances that were taking place throughout the streets. Winds blew the newspapers all around, not in one direction. The water was rippling all on its own, each different water spout changing a different color. He was intrigued.<br>
<br>
So was Dean.<br>
<br>
He turned his head to look at the trio of men kicking around a little ball. They seemed to do some fancy footwork. Hey now, no sense in waiting for Urza forever, right? Might as well have a bit of fun. Dean slowly rose, the shadows clinging to his back once again. The red glow returned, as before, as a look of joy. The other two, kids at best, started to back away, mistaking it for rage. ~Ah, how the color fluxes diffuse human inhibitions...~<br>
<br>
Dean picked up speed and ran at the samurai-looking hack master (as his title rightfully named him). Brian tossed the hack up with his right, and roundhoused the little ball straight towards Dean's forehead. He recognized the look of glee.<br>
<br>
The kids ran. Dean merely bounced the sac off his forehead, and kneed it up while he jumped into the air. Three feet off the ground, Dean spun-kicked the hack towards Brian. It impacted on his chest, &amp; rolled down his stomach to his feet. The hack master kicked it up with the outside of his left foot twice, then spun for a right-legged spin-kick. It nearly whizzed by Dean's head, except that the sickly looking short man slid one foot along the ground, and kicked up with the other, nearly making his legs go at a 180 degree angle. The hack was stopped, and hit his matted hair.<br>
<br>
~Such a human as this I've not seen in years! How delightful! And here I was beginning to think that *I* was the only gifted human to grace this earth. Well, I and the great wizards. How rare for a human to be skilled beyond elves... We shall test him further!~<br>
<br>
Light fluxes took little concentration for the highly intelligent (if a tad neurotic) sickly young man. Dean knew a few tricks to bend light and change the color spectrum to human eyes. With a wink of his left eye, the hack was vaulted up from Dean's head, and came back down on his forehead. Dean hit the little leather ball filled of sand towards Brian, and brought his right hand up into the light from the street lamp. All around the ball, light shifted, blurred, &amp; made it look as if it were inside a TV with fuzzy reception.<br>
<br>
The blurred hack sped towards Brian with inhuman speed. Without thinking, Brian reacted. The monk slid back into a fighting stance, touched his wrists together with half-closed fingers, and pushed his hands in front of the bullet-like hackey sack. With literal, visible ripples emanating outward from the hack, it slowed to a stop inches in front of his hands, almost like in the Matrix. The only difference was that *this* was *real*. ( &quot;0_o' )<br>
<br>
Amazed at his own abilities, Brian pulled his hands back and stepped back a few paces. The hack dropped to the ground as he removed his hands. He gasped, and exclaimed, &quot;Wo- wah! W-wwwwHAT was- How did I *do* that??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis all in the questions, my friend, not the answers.&quot; A voice echoed behind them. &quot;I do believe you must be departing now, before you get yourself hurt; or, possibly, mixed up in something you *don't* want to get yourself into.&quot; A dark man stepped from behind a green dumpster. His black boots echoed across the gravelly, worn pavement. The same light distortion appeared around the man as Dean had used on the hack. Then, everything was normal again. The baggy, leather pants and fishnet shirt did little to pronounce this man's utter brilliance, but his unusual eyes said all he needed to about himself. A hazy gray, like a spring's storm, rolled through his eyes; the eyes themselves were piercing, penetrating. They stared directly into your soul, like an osprey gazing into clear waters for its prey.<br>
<br>
The tall, three foot spikes atop his head gave him even more of a height advantage, even over Brian, who was fairly tall himself. This new freak was already a head taller than the taller of the two. He clasped a fist to his heart as he pressed the back of his left forearm to Brian's chest &amp; pushed him away. The chains dangling from all his joints that connected, finally, at his chest clinked together as he said in a strong, powerful voice, &quot;Hail, Dean of the Truthblood Guild, Male of the Lion Clan.&quot; He pulled a stone from his pocket that glowed with a blue brilliance. A puzzled look crossed his face, then was washed away quickly like a rushing river.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, Urza Planeswalker,&quot; Dean answered heartily. He pretended not to notice the look of concern on the great wizard's face, and hastily took the glowing stone from his hand. Dean clutched it in his right palm, and the light shone through his flesh. The glow then spread throughout his body, dulling and dying as it spread. Soon, the task was accomplished, though, as Dean reopened his palm, revealing a totally revamped hand. His muscled bulged back to their original size and strength, and the color returned to Dean's face. A smile of pure joy crossed him, and he said, &quot;Oh, thank you, Master Urza! You have no clue how weary the creation of the perfect plane IS on an earthly vessel!&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian stood, dumbfounded. His jaw was open, and drool nearly started pouring out before he gathered his senses. &quot;No. Wait. Urza.&quot; The tall man turned towards the monkish man. &quot;Urza Planeswalker. From Magic: The Gathering. No.&quot; He pointed a finger at the chain-linked freak. &quot;It's fantasy, man. It's make-believe, it doesn't *exist*!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but it's not, and it does, child!&quot; He said. Spreading his arms out wide, a green light emanated from his arms. &quot;At least, that is, *now* it is real again.&quot; He turned to Dean, and said, &quot;All because of the Key. Because of you, They won't know what hit 'Em.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean's eyes were as wide as dinner plates. A sparkle from the street lamp glistened of his eyes that were starting to glaze over with tears. &quot;N.....no... They.... They know- They're here? HERE!?&quot; Dean slumped down to the ground. &quot;This can't be... They... They're here already...&quot; Rage building within him, Dean grabbed a hold of Urza's chains. &quot;BUT I JUST STARTED!!!!! MAKE THEM GO AWAY! MAKE THEM STOP!&quot; <br>
<br>
Surreal 8: Breach<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;Dean,&quot; Urza calmly stated. &quot;They haven't opened a portal yet. They're not spilling in, they're sneaking in, one by one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean was in a panick. The young man was heaving in and out, hyperventilating. &quot;One by one?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One by one,&quot; He said firmly. Urza put a hand on his smaller ally's shoulder. &quot;We can defeat them, too. One by one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean's jovial grin retured. &quot;OK!&quot; He backflipped in the air, and landed back on the blacktop. &quot;Wheeeee! Neo ain't got nothing on me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian raised an eyebrow. &quot;Who's 'They'?&quot; He asked Urza, as Dean was busy trying to fly after the pigeons.<br>
<br>
Urza sighed at the display of newfound powers, and calmly stated, &quot;They threaten the Balance of Life and Death. We're balance right now. If it tips either way, we're screwed. That's the short version. Got it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; Dean had calmed down. He was standing directly behind Brian, sheilded from view by the massive men. They moved, and he stepped between them, &quot;Men,&quot; he began, &quot;This is the day we begin the clan once again. Are you with us?&quot;<br>
<br>
Urza nodded, adding his fist to the pact. Brian asked what the clan was before putting his in. Dean grinned, and said, &quot;The Lion Clan. Protectors of the Balance. We are they. We are the elite. We are almighty.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the loose cannon jumped off the edge of the building, landing on a dumpster as before. He took off running, and papers flew up behind him. His speed was incredible! &quot;My GOD! Get a timer, we got a new world record! Olympics, here we come, baby, hehehe...&quot; Brian chuckled to himself.<br>
<br>
~Must get home. Must perfect any holes that They're coming in from. Can't let Them get my home. Can't let Them get my HOME!!~<br>
<br>
Dean ran into his apartment much the same way he came in- the window. What was the point of the door? It was locked for a reason, after all. After a bit of concentration, along with a caulk gun lining the walls and sealing cabinets &amp; the door, Dean layed down on the rooftop on top of a few pigeons he'd stoned for a morning meal. No one was going to STEAL MY PIGEONS, GODDAMMIT!!, as he put it.<br>
<br>
(Ick, sorry for the crappiness of this, but I'm not in a mood for this story. Had to get it out of a rut. There must be NNNNO PLOT! It's just a boy having good natured fun. Just introducing a few chars, so if anyone has some fresh ideas of things Dean can do [such as tying cars together with wire cable and watching them try to tow each other in rush hour, microwaving cats, or just beating the crap out of random jerks on the street] THEN GIMME SOME IDEAS!!! YEA ideas.Thanks, your opinions matter to me, TELL YOUR FRIENDS, hehe...)<br>
<br>
Surreal 5/6/2<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 He belched.<br>
<br>
The tacos at this place gave most people gas, some diarrhea, and others even a bad cas of food poisoning. However, the Health Board guys haven't been able to shut down Taco Bill's yet!<br>
<br>
Dean gulped down more Sierra Mist in an attempt to end the prolonged agony of tasting these tacos. If he had anything besides the food stamps he found in that flower vendor's boots...<br>
<br>
He got up from the brown plastic booth and walked across the semi-sticky, brown tiled floors. &quot;The real question,&quot; He muttered, &quot;Is were they brown *before* they were put down, or not?&quot;<br>
<br>
The drink dispenser had no stickers and no way of telling which nozzle produced which kind of substance. Yes, substance. It's not even fair to call the slushies &quot;liquid&quot;. Dean knew which one shot out the Sierra Mist in the jet stream, so he kept going back to that one, as there usually appeared to be nothing wrong with the drink. Second from the right. He pushed the cup in, and a hole was blasted in the bottom. Frowning, Dean drained the last few delicious morsels into his mouth. Delicious? We spoke too soon...<br>
<br>
Dean started spitting and coughing as if his life depended on it. Someone peed in the Sierra Mist! Oh, this was the last straw. Someone was going to die.<br>
<br>
A hand clutching his tattered black beater, Dean vomited on the floor. He looked up just in time to see the disgusted face of a Taco Bill's employee start wince and grab a mop. Dean was up in his face when he turned around, the tall Mexican nearly toppling over him. Dean was smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, man, get out of the way! You just puked all over de floor, and now I gotta clean it up!&quot; Dean stood there calmly. Hands clasped behind his back started working at leather straps that covered his arms. The back of his belt held a small blade that was fitted over the pinky and extended down the length of the hand, and three inches down past the wrist. It was serrated, and still not clean from the last usage...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, dude, out of the way!&quot; He brushed Dean aside with the handle of the mop. The young man stepped aside, perfectly content with finding the employee in the kitchen responsible for this. &quot;Wha.... fr....*dork*, man...&quot; Dean caught all the mumbling from the Mexican he needed.<br>
<br>
A Vans was quickly lodged up the massive employee's ass. He howled, and tried to bring the broom back behind to hit Dean.<br>
<br>
The agile little freak had already moved in front of the Taco Bill's employee. Dean kicked him in the face, loosened a strap on his left arm, and proceeded to wrap it around the big man's neck. Muscles strained, and the big man tried to sit up. Dean brought his foot around and heel kicked him in the ribs, sending him back to the front of Dean's knees. &quot;Who changes the drinks?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kkkkk-k.... air...&quot; Dean loosened the straps a bit, and headbutted him down. &quot;Johnny changes it, he UUHHHH--&quot; Dean had already flown over the counter and tied the big man to a leg of the Taco Bill statue. Dean was nearly into the kitchen before a loud crash was heard, followed by a few screams.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heeheehee! Bet he splattered good!&quot; Dean giggled as he opened the door. It was like hell had opened up before his eyes; friers, chopping boards, meat cleavers, mixing bowls, grime and food, mold and condaments, roaches and salsa spread out before him. And, all in their little chef ghetups, were little skinny men running around like chickens with their heads cut off. A &quot;Buh-KAAAAWWW!&quot; resonated, and everyone stopped what they were doing. &quot;Ole'!&quot; they shouted, and went back to dicing and filling of taco shells. I guess a chicken DID get it's head cut off... Grease boiled and sizzled.<br>
<br>
Dean worked his way through the throng like a shadow until he found a Johnny name tag at the deep fat frier. Oh, this was tooooo easy.<br>
<br>
Dean tapped his shoulder. &quot;Are you Johnny?&quot; Yes, came the expected reply. The vengeful little man slit upwards with his finger knife, from the left of the navel, up up and up, severing the right nipple. He grabbed Johnny's face with his other hand, and dunked the back of his head into the deep fat frier. Before his screams were noticed, Dean already had a batch of taco shells strapped in, submerging his head totally, and preventing his escape. A female employee screamed, and Dean slit her throat quickly. &quot;Shut up.&quot; He told her as she bled on the ground. Ah, the quick deaths of the lucky...<br>
<br>
Dean grabbed a meat cleaver and stood on a little stool in the crowded place. One leather strap was missing from his arm, he noted. Gotta pick it back up... &quot;Attention, please. Attention, walking dead! I was disturbed here during my consumption of what could only be classified as &quot;food&quot;. I was going to think of something charming and whitty to say before I did this...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean grabbed a second cleaver and plunked them both into the nearest &quot;chef's&quot; head. &quot;But then I thought, '@#%$ it'.&quot; A butcher knife was lunged at him, and Dean expertly dodged it, swaying his body to the right. He brough his knee up, dislodged the stumbling black man's balance, and wrenched his hand from his wrist. The screams stopped quickly with a boot to the neck. The butcher knife stuck out the back of a latino woman's throat, and then there were two more Johnny's left. Two more? Damn, is this confusing...<br>
<br>
The two boys were cowering in a corner. They both weilded vegetables as weapons; one a pair of tomatoes, the other a head of lettuce. Dean grinned wide, and his eyes glowed red again. He grabbed a cast iron skillet in one hand, and a spatula in the other. &quot;Which one of you pissed in my drink?&quot; When they both pointed at each other, he cooed, &quot;Gooood.&quot;<br>
<br>
By the time Dean left the kitchen, there was one child with his head splattered all over the walls. He had three horizontal slits across his abdomen, as well. The other was not so lucky... a sharpening rod was sticking from his ass, both nipples and a nose lay sizzling in the skillet, and he had spatula lacerations all over his face by the time his eyes glazed over. Dean was a gory mess. People started screaming when he started walking out to the only exit, gas can dripping behind him.<br>
<br>
Dean splashed a few people. An old lady slapped him. He slapped her back, but the finger blade severed her cheeks. Her fake jaw hung limp like a lifeless fish. The yellow plastic of the booth took a red tint, and most of the furniture started melting as the gas splashed over it. &quot;Ladies and germs,&quot; Dean shouted, &quot;You all disgust me. You're stupid, moronic, and have no value or worth in this world. I'd give a full fledged lecture on how to treat people, but, well...&quot; He struck a match. &quot;Where's the point?&quot; The flame dropped. Just as it hit the gas, Dean was out the door, and the match went out. People started screaming and trying to get out. More shoved at the door, but it didn't budge. Dean was already walking away, whistling a happy little tune, with a massive wedge holding the door in place.<br>
<br>
A teenage girl with a pink tanktop and Tommy jeans started running for the kitchen exit. &lt;-------must have worked here before... She was the first to die from the spreading flame burning along the trail from the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Behind Dean, as he walked calmly out of the parking lot, he cursed himself. He shouldn't have set fire to the place. It blew up behind him, the windows shattering with the combustion of the trapped oxygen inside. He really shouldn't have...<br>
<br>
He left a strap in there, after all. <br>
<br>
Surreal 5/6/2; Coffee?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;Look, Julias,&quot; Bridget began. She was stunningly beautiful, blonde hair, curves to die for, legs that went all the way up. Her black platform boots and leather pants just made her more attractive as she sipped her double mocha latte.<br>
<br>
A twirl of her pink highlights that always matched her pink open-back shirt got his attention back on her eyes. &quot;You're wrong, as usual. The Three-fold Law isn't bullshitt. I've encountered it before when I've hexed someone.&quot;<br>
<br>
A skinny white guy with glasses roared from the leather sofa beside her. His drab flannel shirt and white T-shirt didn't look so out of place with his faded jeans, but the designer, fashionable looking hightops didn't fit in anywhere with his basic design. &quot;HAHAAAA! Janett, you hexed yourself, you fool! You burned a picture with you AND your math teacher! Don't you remember? The entire class caught mono because of you, and not the traditional way this time, hehehe...&quot; A pillow slammed into his nose, nearly breaking his big nose.<br>
<br>
The muscular black man sitting across the table had a nose ring like a bull and a black button down shirt on that somehow showed off his muscles even better. The all black wardrobe was commonplace among these coffee goers for some reason... &quot;I'm still relating back to the Satanic theory of emotions. You were angry, and you tried to evoke the extremes of your human nature to bring-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, shut up about the Satanism, no one cares. That's not even real magick,&quot; She had black, chin-length straight hair. A fraggle rock shirt and tight pink pants clashed against the knee-high black boots. She was sitting on a man's lap who had a nose ring similar to Julias's, but gold, and millions of tattoos on his arms. His black jeans were cut up a bit, and chains dangled everywhere from the man. His hair was spiked and fraggled. &quot;Right, John?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno, Beth, I'm kinda inter-&quot; he was cut off by a kiss. It lasted for what seemed an eternity, and everyone was disgusted yet again. &quot;Nevermind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine. You all can take your Satanism or Wicca or whatever the hell you two practice-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gnosticism!&quot;<br>
<br>
The geek shook his head. &quot;Whatever. Liber Kaos, you fools. Chaos magick is the only real thing here. The truth? What truth?&quot;<br>
<br>
Julias laid back in his seat again. &quot;Oh great, here we go again. 'The Chaaaos Theory',&quot; he sneered. &quot;Shut up, Dork.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dirk.&quot; He stated calmly. &quot;Seriously. If you don't believe in it, can you really do it?&quot; Janet looked annoyed and gazed out the window. &quot;Janet, you accomplish Wiccan spells easily enough. Do you tend to benefit from beneficial spells to your friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, you nut,&quot; she laughed. Janet patted him on the head, &quot;Except for you. Everything I try on you seems offset by your natural...&quot; she glanced at Julias. &quot;Gift?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take that as a compliment.&quot; He grumbled. &quot;Julias. You can hex a mother @#%$ like no one I've seen. You get the ugliest, nastiest bombs laid on so many people. Does it ever not work?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't at first. Then I figured out what I was doing, Dork-ay.&quot; He sipped his tiny cup of cappucino. &quot;What are you getting at?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all perception. Janet is gorgeous because her spells reflect back to her. You're imposing because you give off a 'dont' @#%$ with me vibe' from the curses.&quot; He looked to the snuggling couple. &quot;You two seem to have enough love to fuel a city. I take it it's from your Gnostic 'enlightenment'?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heehee, of course, silly!&quot; Beth went back to mouthing.<br>
<br>
Dirk stood. &quot;That's my point. What you believe is what is. I believe in Chaos magick. Things happen without you making them. It works for me.&quot; He sat down in the recliner again, and the legs came up automatically. &quot;I rest my case.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's got a point,&quot; Julias said. &quot;By your Wicca @#%$, Jan, I'd be one uuuuugly mother @#%$. But look at me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're one uuuuugly mother @#%$,&quot; She mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Magick Cup tomorrow. Everybody, come.&quot; A redhead slapped down a handful of fliars on the table. She was stunning, but not as ravishingly desireable as Janet. Her hips swayed as she walked away, hugging tight on her jeans. As everyone was leaning in to grab one, Dirk bit his finger. Mmm mmmmm...<br>
<br>
Julias slapped him. Dirk smirked. The black man's coffee spilled all over his lap. &quot;YOU'RE DEAD, PUNK!&quot; He yelled. Dirk was up and nearly out of the coffee shop, but ran into a little man. He had spikey black hair, leather straps clinging to his arms, and baggy black jeans. The man played with a chain dangling from his collar, and put his hand on Dirk's shoulder. &quot;Go sit down, kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
A leather glove on his right hand sparkled at the holes at the knuckles and a few gashes in it. &quot;I couldn't help but overhear your conversations on magick.&quot;<br>
<br>
The group looked at him oddly and with raised eyebrows. John spoke first- &quot;There's a wall there, kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; There was a long, awkward pause. No one said anything, each sizing the other up. The man reached for a flyer. &quot;Magick Cup. Should call it Chalice. Cauldron, maybe. Cup?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a problem with my fliars?&quot; Came a brash voice from behind. He turned to see a beautiful redhead with bright green eyes staring at him. Her long, crimpy hair was quite attractive, he thought. Soft, fair, skin, great legs, nice stomach... &quot;My fliars??&quot; she asked harshly.<br>
<br>
&quot;All but the voice, I like.&quot; He said. &quot;You're hosting this... par-ty?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be there. Casters of all kinds. I hope to see something worthwhile.&quot; He started to walk away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Magick isn't for show, you moron!&quot; She screeched. She turned back to the table with finger on her forehead and temple. &quot;God, I hate bigoted morons.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pff. Yea. Magick. For show. Moron is right.&quot; Dirk stood, and put his arm around her. &quot;It's ok, Sarah.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get your hand off me.&quot; She said with a sneer.<br>
<br>
Pursing his lips, Dirk sat down quickly. The wall beside them shimmered. Beth's eyes twitched, trying to make out what was happening. The wall shuddered this time. Fingertips brushed along the surface, like they were swimming in it! Then they parted, making a hole like a portal. The man's spikey head poked through, and said, &quot;Moron, eh? Not for show, eh?&quot; The hole solidified, and Julias stuck his head out, trying to see him one last time, but he was long gone. Empty streets. No alleys...<br>
<br>
&quot;What. The. FFFUCK!&quot; <br>
<br>
Surreal, 6/10/2<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 He exposed the neck.<br>
<br>
He exposed the *neck*.<br>
<br>
He. Exposed. His. Fukking. NnnnnnnnnnnnnnNECK!<br>
<br>
That was the last mistake that burly carrot top ever made. He was bulky, he was strong as an ox, and looked like he'd seen more fights than Private Ryan. That didn't matter jack when Frosty entered the picture. Though he didn't have the killer instinct as the rest of the CoC, he still had the knowledge of violence that the rest had. He knew how to fillet a human. He knew how to make a man's skin into fashionable clothing, or just his hands into gloves so the police would be busy trying to track a dead man while he was out drinking again. Frosty loved to confuse those of lesser intellect.<br>
<br>
This big freak had disturbed him during mass consumption of vodka. Smirnoff, and no less. That was the first mistake. The second mistake was jutting his finger into Frosty's chest. The cold-eyed killer didn't like being touched. Physical contact always represented a threat, and a threat was always removed, like, ASAP.<br>
<br>
The third and final mistake was exposing his neck. Frosty was waiting for any sign of vulnerability, and now he had it. The massive fool was leaning down to get closer to the little man. He was bending at the waist, and craning his head upwards to keep his face directly in front of the blue haired, quiet, trench coat-clad assassin. The white gloves on his hands were usually enough of a sign of his profession for most people to keep away. This guy was either incredibley insecure to have to take on Frosty to keep standing among the &quot;pack&quot;, or incredibley stupid. Either way, he was going to die.<br>
<br>
&quot;Awww, is da momma's boy going to go cry in his drinkie some mowww-urrr?&quot; He cooed in a condescending tone. Frosty didn't hesitate any longer.<br>
<br>
In the sleeve of his blue trench coat, Frosty kept Icingdeath. The crystal blue dagger had slit more throats than he'd like to admit, as he tends not to brag. After all, killing a man in close range combat while he had guards stationed every five feet, then living to collect the bounty, is quite difficult. And he's done it countless times.<br>
<br>
The cold blade slid up from it's holster on Frosty's forearm and into his palm as his hand arced upwards. This was going to be a quick kill. No problem, no complications. When Frosty's hand stopped seven inches from Target, the fires in his eyes lit. The blue flames darted to the left to see the man with a hand on his arm. He looked back to the red headed brute. His green eyes were wide, and his right hand was coming up fast towards Frosty's stomach. Damn! The vodka made me slow, he thought. Plan B.<br>
<br>
The white gloves served multiple purposes; fingerprint masking was just one. Frosty's left hand came up faster, as his agility outmatched everyone in this city. The titanium tips on his fingers popped out, exiting the little holes they always ripped open on a new pair of gloves. He's used these ones before, however, and the tiny blades had no problem exiting- not that they ever did, the points were diamond tipped.<br>
<br>
With a swipe like a cat, Frosty left massive gashes across the big man's face. The blood that ran was more red than his blazing hair, and he screamed just before Icingdeath penetrated his throat, stopping any other sound from exiting his lips. Blood ran hard, and coated Frosty's white gloves red. Damn, another pair ruined...<br>
<br>
Another one came in from the right- the one who blocked the knife in the first place. He wouldn't block it again. The trench coat swirled, and Frosty round kicked the fool in the face. His head slammed into the bar, and Frosty grabbed his hair, tilted his head back, and made one clean slice. The precision was amazing, the force nearly severed the head clean off. Frosty turned to see three more angry faces nearly charging, and stopped like his face was a red light. His blue tongue snaked out and licked one side of Icingdeath clean. This blood was disgusting, too irony and a bit salty. He still swallowed it for effect. Blue lines started appearing on his face. <br>
<br>
DAMN! The makeup is running again! I guess the alcohal raised the blood temp anyways...<br>
<br>
Frosty had natural blue melanin (sp?) in his skin. There were two streaks on either side of his face, from where his sideburns should start, down to his chin. There were two downward spike-like colorings above his eyebrows, pointing downwards from the hair line. As the cover-all face he put on earlier started cracking, the blue lines showed like big, neon lights shining from Frosty's head. More hard rock from the juke box started up. &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; from Powerman 5000 started up, and the markings started to pulse to the bass chords.<br>
<br>
Frosty smiled, and the blue light started pouring from his mouth, as well. The blue flames flickered in his eyes, and the blue little assassin could see once again in infrared. His eyes switched back and forth from the normal color spectrum to his infravision. His left eye started twitching, and the bar came back into focus. The other three had already ran, and the bartender was standing with his mouth agape. He handed the entire fifth of Smirnoff to Frosty with a trembling hand. The little blue man grabbed the bottle and strolled out of the bar, gulping as he went. The lights shone brightly in the night, and they quieted down a bit once the vodka reached his stomach.<br>
<br>
He muttered to himself as he walked down the sidewalk. He sidestepped a crack and nearly bowled over a kid on a bike. Frosty took no notice. &quot;It's happening too often now. I have to create a better synthetic skin. Maybe something that isn't going to crack once my body temp hits 50...&quot; He kept his thoughts in his head as a squad car rolled past. The officer went by incredibley slow, and on the left side of the street, as if checking on Frosty. Luckily, he rolled away without confrontation. He continued mumbling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sodium benzoate isn't going to withstand the pressure, but I might be able to add a compound with chloride and CO2 to create a...&quot; He stopped to take another swig, then stuffed the remaining quarter of a bottle in a little girl's bicycle basket. She stopped abrubtly, and proceeded to down the bottle without question. GOTTA love the slums!<br>
<br>
He continued rambling, then reached into his pocket. There were a few chemicals for masking forensics when the teams might actually be called. He looked up when a shadow crossed his face. There, clinging to the light once again, in normal darkling fashion, was a little black goblin. He was clad in the loincloth, once again, and little else. Despite the knotted muscles covering his body, darklings were relatively weak; they were credited on stealth and intelligence over all else. He rasped out, &quot;Frosty, baby. You just got that little girl killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked back, and, sure enough, a car slammed into a wobbly bike, that was piloted by the little girl, in the middle of the road. The tires screeched, and the pink fliers on the sides of the handle bars were torn. Chuckling, Frosty turned back to the darkling. &quot;Red?&quot; He looked down. Hiding in the shadow of the trenchcoat was Red, the miniature assassin. His claws worked better than most knives, and, being a darkling in general, he had limited mastery of the arcane. Vicious as all hell, darklings were a breed of shadow stalkers, waiting for the prime opportunity. Except Red when he was around Frosty. They hit it off at a relatively young age, Frosty at 6 and Red at 732. They became fast friends when Red realized that the little boy wasn't traumatized by the &quot;monster under the bed&quot; routine, but was rather intrigued. As he matured, Frosty was taught to live in the shadows. Hence, the current occupation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brr. I'm cold, ya freakin ice box. Can't have residents see me, though.&quot; With a bit of wiggling and foot work, and globe of darkness enveloped the tiny genius. &quot;Ok, shrunken now. I'm in your inside pocket next to the-&quot; he gasped, &quot;Z-28, .35 caliber, fully auto, 28 round clip! I love you!&quot; Frosty walked home with a midget in his pocket. He stabbed a hobo and let Red have a bite, first, as to keep him from devouring the current room mates. Somewhat tipsy, Frosty stumbled into Dean's little world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bro. I'm here. Got a black gobby with me, too.&quot; <br>
<br>
Surreal 6/11/2<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Dean sighed. Frosty was back, and you know what that means; more cops, more women, more STUPID PEOPLE, and more of that jackass. And Red. Pffft! That black goblin was the epitimy of stupidity. And rambuncious(sp?), too. He was always breaking something...<br>
<br>
*CRASSSH!* Speaking of which...<br>
<br>
&quot;REDDD!&quot; Frosty yelled.<br>
<br>
The darkling looked up, his ears slightly drooping. The big, crooked, pearly teeth showed plain as day against his lips when he smiled, acting as if the big bowl full of salad broke on its own. &quot;Whaaat?&quot; He said, innocently.<br>
<br>
Dean sighed again. Now all we need is Shaggy, he thought bitterly. &quot;GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!!&quot; He roared.<br>
<br>
The scary little man with leather straps covering his arms and black fingernails was pointing at the door. A spike drooped in front of his face, and Red and Frosty started busting out laughing. Dean sighed, raked his hands through his spikes, and slumped into a torn-up recliner.<br>
<br>
Just as the last two bags of chips (being the last two containers of edible food in the apartment) were busted open, Dean sprang up, a big smile on his face. He grabbed a meat hook from the coat rack, where most of the other disembowling tools lay, nicely arrayed. Dean stalked out the door, and Red looked up, his frightening face being hilariously stuffed with potato chips. Wood cracked and hinges busted, and there were momentary screams. A *thunk thunk* was heard, and Dean was seen shortly thereafter with a pair of meat hooks dug into a fat, middle-aged man's eye sockets. He dragged the old man into the apartment, dropped him, and rolled his hands extravigantly towards the open doorway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ta-daaaaaah! Your new apartment, right across the hall. Just cleared out, and still fully stocked! Woooo!&quot; Frosty just looked at him blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhh...&quot; He couldn't get out a fully developed sentance before he and his goblin-like companion were rushed out of the door, and it was slammed on their face. Staring at the splintered wood framing his new apartment, Frosty looked down to Red and said, &quot;Ummm... can you fix doors, by any chance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do I look like, a handy man?&quot; the darkling grumbled. With a flick of his fingers, the tiny black figure was engulfed in shadows, and disappeared completely.<br>
<br>
Back in his room, with a dead fat man burning on a spit, Dean covered his face in his hands. He ran his long fingernails through his hair, and kicked over the unsavory meal. He walked to the broken window and stepped out onto the fire escape. Looking down at the hobos and junkies, he sat on the rail. &quot;I'm gonna eat someone...&quot; he muttered to himself before jumping down the three stories. <br>
<br>
Surreal, 6/12/2<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;~And if you want these kind of dreams, It's Cali-forni-catioooon~&quot; the stereo blared. Frosty stared at it blankly. The new apartment was much better than Dean's malfunctioning, disjointed, completely destroyed place, but this was Nerd Palace. He went through the faded, white, metal cabinets looking for food. There was, of course, Ramen noodles in every variety, Spagehti-O's, frozen waffles in the freezer with rocky road ice cream...<br>
<br>
He was stocked well for a good long time. Besides, he still had the MRE's in his pocket; military rations lasted a long time, after all.<br>
<br>
The browning carpet wasn't anything spectacular, and this man definetly lived alone- after all, there was a hardly used couch with a few pillows on it, and a black leather recliner pointed towards a 13&quot; TV set with an antenna on top. There was no remote. Frosty cursed, and went on to the bathroom. No, wait, he didn't wanna see it.<br>
<br>
Instead, he went to what could only be considered the bedroom, and nearly fainted with glee. This man was a science nerd!! WOO!! There were chemicals of every kind laying around, test tubes and beakers, acids and bases, tubes and corks, burners and chemicals; lucious, precious, CHEMICALS!<br>
<br>
There were weapons galore in the closet, too. A few were rusty, but hey- that just means more Iron(II) Oxide for the lab, now didn't it? There were hooks and scythes, scimitars and sais, nunchakaus, staves, spearheads... This was going to be a nice restocking fortress for when I'm being chased by the POPO... he thought.<br>
<br>
Across the hall and out the window, Dean descended atop a dumpster yet again. The lid wasn't fully closed when he hit it, and curiosity outweighed his hunger. Dean opened the top to reveal bags full of white powders. This is where he usually just walked away, disgusted, but he thought better of it this time. Supplies were always good to have, and he didn't exactly have a job...<br>
<br>
Hoisting the bag over his back like Santa Claus, Dean walked down the streets. A junkie girl with dark, raccoon looking eyes and tattered clothing, tugged on his fishnet shirt like he was God. He smiled down at her, then hurriedly stopped her from unzipping his black pants. &quot;Woah woah woah. You can have your fix; s'not like it's mine or anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Little baggies were in abundance in the big black garbage bag, and Dean quickly loaded up a half a handful into the bag. Her eyes were wide as oranges, and she immediatly ran off with a syringe in her hand. God damned junkies.<br>
<br>
By the time he got to the street corner, Dean was already being confronted by men in trenchcoats and freaks and all types of people. Old business men with their snazy Armani suits even confronted him; obviously, he didn't know the precise value, and just kind of handed it out for whatever he could get for it. It's not like it mattered to him anyways. All Dean really wanted was enough money to go grab a few things; straps, motors, handcuffs, anything that could be used as a torture rack, a few new, big, knives... you know, the basics. And maybe a new spit and some condaments.<br>
<br>
An hour passed. The garbage bag was nearly empty. He had accumulated over a thousand dollars, and Dean was quite content with his earnings. A few of the same people, drugged up like a cancer patient, stumbled over to him to buy more. It wasn't really his concern if they died or not; after all, it's *their* life they're wasting.<br>
<br>
The street lights started to shift again; the trees started coming back, and he knew that he'd go crazy again and end up in some elven forest or foreign embassy or something if he didn't go eat something. That's when gunshots busted open windows by his head.<br>
<br>
He'd been bored, so Dean put the last of the @#%$ into bags and stuffed them in his pocket. No sense in lugging around a big garbage bag, right? Right. That was a very smart thing to do, considering the people supposed to pick it up had seen him slinging it, and were quite pissed when they found nothing in the dumpster. Time to kill.<br>
<br>
Dean started running, and did a baseball slide under a street cart that was probably going to be used in the morning... Not anymore. Rapid fire from uzis and glocks riddled the steel of the cart, and Dean ran back into the alley. He thought he could, at minimum, fly up to the rooftops and get out of here. The biggest complication was that there were no clouds to beckon, and the wind was blowing in the wrong direction; it couldn't reach into the alley from the only entry angle.<br>
<br>
Walking calmly, lighters flickered and various things were lit; joints, cigars, cigarettes, blunts, whatever. Either way, Dean counted five of them, all done up in snazi black suits. One had sunglasses and a red tie. Most likely, the big man here; target #1.<br>
<br>
The with the red tie walked forward, tossing a 9 around in his hands. &quot;Look, man. It's like dis; you got my @#%$. Give it back, and we kill yaz quick, capeesh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dean relaxed visibly, pointed towards the man, and said, &quot;You're not Italian, dude. And your accent sucks.&quot;<br>
<br>
His face got a bit red before he calmed down. &quot;Ice 'im.&quot;<br>
<br>
Surreal, 6/19/2<br>

 &quot;So, what is it if it's not a blue collar?&quot; She parted her delicious red lips, and licked them slowly, twirling a lock of her red hair. The fiery carrot-top was definitely begging for... a good time?<br>
<br>
He cleared his throat, and acted to ponder about it for a second. &quot;Mmmmm, a red collar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Red? Why do you say that?&quot; she said in her southern accent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Red,&quot; he whispered as he got close to her ear, &quot;Is the color...&quot; he blew a wisp of hair aside gently, &quot;of *passion*.&quot; Brian nibbled softly on her diamond earring-studded earlobe, and kissed her neck. Her knees seemed to go weak, and she leaned against his body. They continued walking for a bit, Brian cracking jokes in his black karate gi, embroidered with white trim. His white belt was symbollic, of course; he surpassed his triple blackbelt instructor after that night with that Urza freak and the crazy Dean kid. Either way, this woman was absolutley seductive, perfect body, beautiful face; he even met her at a martial arts tournament, held in New York.<br>
<br>
Now, they walked along the street on this dark night with the moon glinting off her dazzling red slip dress. It hugged every curve on her body, and was alluring, to say the least. Brian kept his arm around her waist, and a hand on her curvaceous hip. He nearly pitched a tent just from touching this beauty; until he heard the gunshots.<br>
<br>
Taking off at full speed, the monk, now clad in appropriate attire for the trade, slapped his sandals on the sidewalk as he ran. Brian was three feet from rounding the corner down the alley when a burst of red light like an explosion erupted from the containment of the brick buildings. He was blown away, and landed on his back. His beautiful female counterpart helped lift him to his feet. Cautiously, they proceeded.<br>
<br>
Brian peeked his head around the corner, and gasped at the sight. A dumpster was blasted apart, and trash was blown everywhere. He inhaled the stench of burning flesh, and looked to see a multitude of legs, some with shoes melted to the ground, and others knocked aside. There was one pair with white pants, or what remained of them, down on the ankles, slightly frayed and ripped. Garbage and remains of clothing and cheeseburgers, papers and bags, bottles and leftover food, were blown everywhere. She shrieked at the carnage displayed.<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAH! You're not going *IN* there, are you?&quot; Her eyes were on the brink of tears from panic, and she clutched his shirt in a death grip. Solemnly, he nodded his head. &quot;Don't do it! I'm begging you, don't do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What if there's still someone in there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's disGUSting! It reeks, and the police will be on their way soon enough! NO one can miss a sight like that.&quot; Brian stared into her eyes, a look of steady determination printed across it like it was carved in stone. &quot;If you go in there, I'm leaving!&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked at her again, eyeing her intently. Ohhh, damn it. This was the worst part of my morals, he thought. Getting screwed for getting screwed. I didn't even take an oath of selibacy!(sp?)<br>
<br>
&quot;FINE!&quot; she shouted when he turned the corner. He was hoping against hope that she'd still be there when he came back, but he knew she wouldn't. Oh well. It's not like he really remembered her name. He chuckled over that fact while he scanned for anything that could give him a clue as to what happened here.<br>
<br>
His eyes moved over to a dark figure, sprawled across the ground. His jeans had been blown away, along with all the hair on the front of his body, and any remnants of clothing were smoking and blackened. He's the only one whole, Brian realized. He crept over, stepping across a McDonald's wrapper and some empty packages of kid's toys. They were still smoldering too.<br>
<br>
Staring down at the smoking face and bullet riddled body, recognition finally crept across Brian's face; Dean! His wounds were mostly coagulated from the blast that seemed to rip from the entire front of his body, but blood still flowed sparingly. Carrying him bride-and-groom style, Brian ran into the streets, shouting, &quot;NINE-ONE-ONE!!&quot; Hell, it was dialed commonly enough in the area, after all...<br>
<br>
He looked to the right, and up the sidewalk where he had come from, and an old man in a sweatshirt and plaid vest with dusted gray slacks looked at him wide-eyed. He said, &quot;Here, get him in the car, quick!&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian settled Dean down into the car, thanking the &quot;dark-skinned stranger&quot; for his help. Brian slammed the door shut quickly, and jumped into the passenger seat. Speeding through the, luckily, uncrowded city streets like a bat outta hell, they made it to the nearest hospital in five minutes. Brian rushed him in, and thanked the old man again. He rushed in through the automatic doors screaming, &quot;SOMEONE HELP!&quot; <br>

 He opened his eyes slowly. White light poured in, and the scent of sterilization filled his nostrils. His senses were horribley deprived in here, considering the workout they get on the streets. He missed the millions of sights and smells bombarding him at once...<br>
<br>
Then he tried to sit up. Red, hot lightning flashed through his torso. He screamed like a banshee as he felt the searing pain rip down to his toes, up to the top of his head, then doubling back to ensure maximum discomfort. His head reeled, and everything looked so incredibley surreal... but Dean knew this wasn't one of his episodes. This was unnatural. He could feel the stink in his nose, the contamination in his body, of the chemicals that flowed through his veins.<br>
<br>
He felt the IV in his arm acutely. The flow of morphine, or whatever that feel-good drug was, felt heightened, and the pain subsided; slow, achingly slow, but it ended.<br>
<br>
Dean looked around at his surroundings. There was nothing but white in here; white sheets, white curtains, white marble, white lights, white desk... there was a bit of brown on the desk, the tiny television set in front of him, and the flowers on the desk gave the only flash of color in the room.<br>
<br>
It hit him like a flash; he was in a hospital. Dean doesn't *DO* hospitals. Aggravated beyond the word &quot;anger&quot;, he tried to sit up again, thinking himself stronger than the searing flashes he felt. Struggling to his feet, and growling all the way, Dean inched towards the door, step by step, and tore off the gauze. The remaining three feet seemed infinite in his intoxicated stupor. Dean realized he was dragging the IV behind him, and tore the tube out of his arm with a vengeance; only then did he notice the blood pouring out of seven, exact, precicely round holes. They were scattered around, one in the center of the chest, three on the right side and shoulder, one to the left of the navel, and two on the left breast, just above the nipple. Startled by his previously unseen wounds, Dean started feeling incredibley woozy.<br>
<br>
The room started to spin. The lights all came in from every different angle, and Dean's vision went hazy. He fell forward, still convinced he was just fine, and caught the door handle. It flew open with his body weight, and he fell onto the sterile marble tile that led out of the room. He didn't even notice the machines in his room before, but they were all beeping and blaring now. God damn it. Who turned out the lights?<br>
<br>
Three days earlier, Brian had brought him in. They started screaming and rushing into action, like most doctors do. They bombarded him with questions... &quot;What's his name?&quot; &quot;Has he been doing any drugs?&quot; &quot;Who is his next of kin?&quot; &quot;Where did you find him?&quot; &quot;What the HELL happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
After the initial drama, when Dean was brought into the emergency room, Brian started making some phone calls. They had his residence, as well as a number found in his back pocket; in the last remnants of clothes that weren't scorched. He started with that number.<br>
<br>
The phone rang next to Frosty's ear, making him jump. The biological refrigerant he'd been working on shattered in the beaker, and he cursed the gods of the sun. Picking up the phone that had never rung before, Frosty growled, &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this, uh, Frosty?&quot; a voice asked from the reciever.<br>
<br>
Gritting his teeth and uttering a guteral rumble, he half-grunted, &quot;Goway!&quot; He put on the white beater to cover the scars that glowed with a blue luminescence. He walked out into the not-so-airconditioned hallway and started sweating. Stalking into the room, the phone rang again. A nervous twitch visited Frosty's eye. He picked it up, and nearly yelled, &quot;What!?&quot;<br>
<br>
From the other end, he heard a voice saying, &quot;This is the Greenview Hospital. Is there any kin of a Dean.... Scram... Cross-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea yea, whaddya want? What the hell did he do now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thought that might keep you from hangin up on me,&quot; the voice chuckled. &quot;My name's Brian. I'm a... colleague, you could say, of Dean's.&quot; Frosty grunted his acknoledgement. &quot;He's been shot...... Hello? ....Hello?&quot;<br>
<br>
Frosty had already jumping out the window.<br>
<br>
Brian and Frosty both saw Dean as he stumbled out of the room, bathing the floor in blood. They had just picked him up when a flurry of nurses lifted him from their arms and set him on the bed, reattatching this, refilling that. They finally got him back in shape, and closed the door behind them. <br>
<br>
Surreal, 6/22/2<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;How did he jump out?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not a problem. He does it all the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;:: grunts ::&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The big question is.... how the hell did he live through that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian chuckled at the blue man that seemed to glow every now and then. &quot;I figured you of all people would have known that,&quot;<br>
<br>
Frosty's eyebrow went up. He sat down on the now empty bed, and took a bite out of his hamburger. Sipping the coke, he swallowed. Around the remaining mixture of food, he growled, &quot;Tha fffffukk izat s'posed ta mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian stared blankly at him. The little man with blue eyes stared into his very soul, and seemed to freeze it. Running a hand through his long black hair, which was taken out of his fighter's crop when he came to the hospital, he took a critical glance at this oddly dangerous man. He seemed to move with a grace and confidence unkown to most men. It was as if his every action was cold, calculated, and efficient. He even sat with awareness, like a fight could spring up at any moment. Shaking off the shock, he remembered the question. Continuing to chew the onion ring, he swallowed hard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahem. Well, uh... the... magic... thing?&quot; Frosty stared blankly at him. &quot;The reason you glow? The spell?&quot; Brian was getting nowhere.<br>
<br>
He ran his fingers through his hair again. Before he got started, Frosty cut him off. Standing from the bloody bed, he asked, &quot;Magic? You seriously expect me to believe that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian laughed aloud. If only Urza was here to explain this... A blade was at his throat, and his laugh was cut short. Frosty's menacing grin returned, inches from the cornered monk's face, and the blue glow from behind his teeth gave Frosty an ice-like quality. As if his cold skin didn't already... &quot;Talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Magic! It-it's real, it-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stutter, and I dig in deeper. Repeat yourself, and I dig in deeper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YES! Ok.&quot; Brian swallowed to keep himself from stammering all over the place. &quot;Magic... can be done. It's possible. But only if you believe it can. Without belief, you can do none of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blade dropped. Frosty hooked a finger under his collar, and wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead. &quot;Now, why didn't you just blaze me with a fireball or something if you believe it can be done?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian grinned evilly. His dark gaze settled on the blue assassin, and the black hair framing chizled face gave a vibe of total malice. &quot;Because I didn't have my lighter.&quot; The zippo appeared in his hand almost instantly, and Brian flicked the top open and sparked it up with one motion. The flame appeared, and Frosty's eyes went wide. Fire. Death. Fire. Death. FIRE!<br>
<br>
Waves of heat shimmered around the blue assassin. His body needed extreme cool, but this was... HOT! Brian's hair lifted with the heat, like it was making it wave in the air. He extended his middle and forefinger together, and flipped his wrist up. Heat seared upwards, and the room flared red. Curtains and sheets caught fire. &quot;Hot enough for ya?&quot;<br>
<br>
Roaring with the fury of a caged animal near its death, Frosty threw off his trenchcoat. The blue luminescent scars glowed with unmatched brilliance, staining the light purple. As Brian's hair settled down, the blue won over, and the room turned quite cool. The small flames that caught smoldered down and smoked. The air got uncomfortably chilly, but Frosty didn't mind. The blue glow stopped, and so did his voice. Looking up, bewilderment showing in his emotionless eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you feel that wave of power pass through you?&quot; Frosty nodded. &quot;That was the will; what makes the magic work. I don't care whether you believe it or not, but you *are* magic. The glow? The external coolant? Maybe not if you believe, but if you *need* it, you'll have your magic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Frosty ran a hand through his blue spikes. He picked up his trenchcoat, and started walking to the window. Regaining his confidence, he snarled, &quot;He went this way. I can find him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot;<br>
<br>
He sneered back, &quot;Maaaaaagic? No! That's horsesht. Red can do it,&quot; Frosty tapped his shoulder, and the window blew open. In flew a little black goblin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaah~!!&quot; he shouted.<br>
<br>
Brian raised an eyebrow, but didn't feel like starting up the magic issue again. Frosty saw the puzzled look, and stated, &quot;It's. Not. Magic. Innate abilities, maybe. Tricks, skills, techniques. Don't call it magic; it sounds so god damned stupid.&quot; Brian shrugged, and they walked down the fire escape. &quot;Now,&quot; Frosty asked, &quot;Again. How'd he live?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brian climbed down the rusty ladder, following the inane ramblings of the dark gnome. &quot;He exerted a massive blast of energy, one he most likely thought was his last. He probably expended his mental energy all on that blast. It cauterized(sp?) the wounds, killed the dealers, and blasted into some buildings. As far as the rapid healing...&quot; They stopped while Red sniffed at the ground near a street light. Frosty looked at the monk, who shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dude! He's back at his apartment. Duh!&quot; Red stood, regaining composure and sophistication. Brian now saw the intelligence, not merely a pet. &quot;Anyways. I have a few matters in the outer fringe of Nebtulos. A few darker garinjahs have decided to start trouble and break the peace treaty struck in Hoolloo Gnosis. We got another resource war on our hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The garinjahs? I thought they were allied with nurr'ok forces.&quot; Frosty turned a quizzical eye on his miniscule friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were. They think their materialistic views of the mining and technological advances taken towards the mining of the tin give them the upper hand.&quot; He glanced to Brian, then back at Frosty. &quot;Pff. Some races think all might goes to science and technology. They don't understand the value of aetheric balances and psychic manipulations, or projection of will.&quot; Red went back to muttering dark equations drawn in the shadow of the two big men. Dean rounded the corner, seven scars on his chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, science and magick is closely linked, Red. The only problem is that humans are one of the few races that believe their minds aren't capable of projecting their will. They don't believe what they can't see or prove. Others believe only in that. Not enough blending.&quot; The darkling took in the friendly face with a toothy grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice to see ya, kid. They said you had seven extra holes put in ya. Glad you made it out alive,&quot; Red clicked and pointed his finger like a gun at him. &quot;Hehehehehe... bang.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A> at: 9/22/02 5:29:31 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8>Stories by:  Mindles Kali</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
