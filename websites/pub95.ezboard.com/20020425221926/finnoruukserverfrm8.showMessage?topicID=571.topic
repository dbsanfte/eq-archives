I see his other wizard friend sitting naked in scarlet desert at the zone to grey, so I pop him a dmf so he can get his corpse. After I did my trade, I turn a corner and see a named golem up but the same wizard I just dmfed pulls it with a snare, while dragging his corpse. (he was still naked)<br><br>Now this is funny I thought, since a naked wizard has a very limited mana supply to take down the named mobs, which have a lot more hit points then the normal ones do. He's naked and I'm still invis but I know he can see me since I gave him dmf.<br><br>I follow him.<br><br>Sure enough the mob starts to pound him into a bloody pulp, and he starts asking me for help. I tried to root it a couple of times but he pulled it to the hilly area and I kept getting line of sight or oor messages before it would cast.<br><br>If your asking for help, DON'T EFFING MOVE.<br><br>He dies, I look around, noone is there. I /assist the mob and it has no agro, so I start to kill it.<br><br>Enter, the stupid wizard again that I mentioned from before. He starts casting on the mob and I'm telling him 'sorry dude, my pull, its not going anywhere'<br><br>He's still nuking the thing, and I'm trying to tell him he couldn't even think about ksing me on a mob with that many hit points especially if I had dots on it already.<br><br>He out agros since my dots don't do much damage in the first few ticks, and root breaks it starts chasing after him.<br><br>He pulls the named golem BACK to the temple area, and it was completelly spawned, NOONE was camping there. So he's running around picking up adds left and right, while I'm following him so I can be in range when my dots kill to mob so I can get exp.<br><br>By this time my darkness wears off and it starts bolting him like theres no tomorrow. <br><br>To this he accuses me of dispelling it, to break *HIS* snare.<br><br>I point out that his snare would not even stick if mine was already on it, as mine is more powerful.<br><br>So now hes running around with 8-10 normal mobs on him, and a named. Most, if not all, are unsnared. My dots kill the mob, he sees me loot it, he cusses me out, and zones to shissar temple.<br><br>Then he accuses *ME* of ksing his spawn. I asked him how I could cast my spells on him when it was running AWAY from me, chasing after him since his nukes out did the initial agro from my dots. I thanked him for the powerlevel, since I didn't even have to root the mob once it started running after him.<br><br>He starts crying 'he was my group member, its obvious I mean comeon were in the same guild' I tell him 'so? you had not touched the mob at all and I had time to cast *5* dots on the mob before you even touched it. I had to mem spells twice (epic, splurt, pyrocour, ignite blood, vexing mordina) cus I only use 2 slots for dots most of the time.<br><br>But wait, this gets better.<br><br>As it turns out, his friend (the one I dmfed) had died because he thought it would be funny to dispel his quad to break there snare. Then he starts telling me he was low on mana and was going to kite the mob while he was medding.<br><br>I asked him what engaging a mob he didn't have the mana to kill had anything to do with him picking up 8+ adds after that.<br><br>No response.<br><br>Next day I see him in the zone again. He starts quading near me, and every once in a while his add would agro over to me.<br><br>I have this little rule about people training me. If it does damage to me or my pet because of there incompetence, I get to decide if I want to kill it or not. 2 or 3 times I ended up fighting 3 mobs at once thanks to him. <br><br>I try to explain to him how agro works, and WHY his mob was running after me as he ran past. and how he could avoid it.<br><br>This only makes him reply with 'shut up I've gained x amounts of alt points in this zone, I know what am doing' (apparently he thought he was cool because he got his second title. /woopty<br><br>Later on in the day I'm not killing any mobs, just kinda chatting while I'm invis. He walks kinda near where I was and is watching what I am doing. So I pull a mob and start to root dot it. (honestlly I think root dotting in the grey is not effecient)<br><br>He starts dispelling the mob, which of corse breaks my root and snare, which makes the mob come after me at full speed.<br><br>'You want it? You got it' I tell him.<br><br>I feign death, mob bolts to him instead.<br><br>He kites it around, I stand back up and go back to root dotting it.<br><br>More dispells, I feign death again.<br><br>By this time the mob was at 20% life. I stay feigned, and he has to ZONE the mob because he can't handle it.<br><br>He comes back from zoning, and tries it again, more feigns.<br><br>Then he starts spamming me with some spell he is casting on me, no effect. <br><br>He starts putting items in the trade window when I'm casting spells in an attempt to interrupt me. (could be wrong but I think thats actually one of the more serious offenses) I cancel out of trade, feign death, turn off trades, go back to rooting my mob. <br><br>More dispels, more feigns, more watching him zone into shissar temple.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br><br><br><br> <p><HR><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59879"><img src="http://personal.bellsouth.net/~blnadri/gamiene.jpg"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/urosha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rosha</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/30/02 8:53:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord, could there be any doubt who this numb nut is???</span><hr size=1> Ah, I had a similar bad experience with this fellow last night.  I had been fear/charm kiting just fine for almost two hours near the Temple.  Then this fellow arrives in the zone and seems to take up residence near me (with nary a word).  I don't have a problem with people quad-kiting because I am just doing singles (and sometimes pairs).  It's not like there is a lack of mobs.  Anyway, all of a sudden I keep getting adds aggroing on me like crazy.  Mobs that were never near me before are suddenly jumping in on my fights.  I see this unguilded, level 60 Wizzy running around with several snakes in a loose bunch and a small group of skellies in another bunch.  He keeps insisting on running back and forth in front of me, dragging his mobs close enough to aggro onto me.  I end up having to zone.  I tried to help him out by running into his group of mobs and doing an AOE Fear on my way to the zone.  I guess it helped him because he zoned right after as well ... all safe and sound. <br><br>He does things like this a few more times.  Normally, I am a quiet person.  I don't like to get involved in arguements because they are pointless.  But I had had about all I could take.  I send him a tell similar to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;I don't know what is going on, but since you arrived in the zone I keep getting all sorts of mobs aggroing on me that weren't doing this before.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I basically get told that I am training him ... that I need to learn the zone, and that I must learn aggro management.  Oh, and let's not forget that I am an idiot on top of all that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I never cursed at the fellow, yelled at the fellow, or even outright accused him of anything.  He continues with a few tells; I guess trying to show he is superior or something.  I just keep being polite and telling him whatever.  His last tell to me &quot;I am so pissed at you right now&quot; (paraphrased).<br><br>So, be wary of this fellow if you happen to be in The Grey or another zone where he might be soloing.  His superior skills and knowledge of the game will set him apart and all need to heed his wishes. <p><table><td nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#990000 strength="1");font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'2pt'"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana,"><font Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Rosha Cristi<br><a href="http://www.legendsoftherealm.com">Legends</a> Bard of 56 {insert something musical here}<br>Everquest server of Innoruuk<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhaagen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haagen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/30/02 9:21:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord, could there be any doubt who this numb nut is???</span><hr size=1> I don't hunt in the Grey anymore because the idiot per square meter quotient there is WAY too high for me. But when I was there, I had problems with Drackos myself. <br><br>He never did anything so bad as outright dispelling a mob I was engaging, but he has quad kited directly over my head so many times that I lost count. There was also a particular evening where, whenever he would get a rockfiend add, he'd run right over to my camp and root it within meters of me. This didn't just happen once, it happened 3 or 4 times that evening. I am not a rockfiend trash can, thx.<br><br>I should also point out, in all fairness, that my experience is not by any means limited to Drackos, although he is perhaps the largest single offender. The Grey is chock full of quad-kiting morons; the list is too long to type out. For my part, I've found that the XP rewards from hunting here are not large enough to warrant having to deal with these people, so I choose to hunt in different zones. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13524">Margana Malevolent</A><BR>Warlock<BR><A href="http://www.fnurt.net/amici">Amici</A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhaagen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haagen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/30/02 9:23:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uravantasuffer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravanta Suffer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kindly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/30/02 9:50:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord, could there be any doubt who this numb nut is???</span><hr size=1> Ah yes the rockfiend trash can.

Secondly, I avoided problems like this by hiding in a corner where mobs didn't spawn or wander near.

One of ten was the former.<br><br>Oh, one thing I do like about this board.  Posts created by Gamiene are always near the top and always follow the same pattern.  First, Gamiene, in one way or another, asserts her superiority over the rest of us (not really a bad thing...but when it refers to things that haven't been proven 100% or close to 100%, it's usually a very stupid position to take because it's hard to defend).  Then arguments break out between the more outspoken members of the board.  Then little fires break out in places.  They end with Gamiene losing her composure and flaming while the rest smile, knowing they've won--again.  I can't recall a single post that didn't follow this pattern.<br><br>The last post had a damned fine example of this when Gamiene completely misinterpretted another person's post after a few people made damned fine points that slowly tore apart whatever she said in the beginning of the post.<br><br>Negoldar Splitshadow<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Ret.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>Level 48.408 Half Elf Rogue <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugamiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/31/02 6:51:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord, could there be any doubt who this numb nut is???</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sounds to me like you don't have a defense Gam.
