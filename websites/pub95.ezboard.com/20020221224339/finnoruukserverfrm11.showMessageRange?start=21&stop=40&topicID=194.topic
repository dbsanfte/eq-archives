Your perspective is different than some others Ugle.  I posted my sympathies because I read a story about a young girl who was robbed of life, and she and I shared a common hobby, that being EQ.  In my mind, all I could picture was this girl playing EQ with her friends, dueling another guildie until her father walked into the room and shot her!  That made my heart ache.<br>
<br>
When I read a local newspaper and learn that some child had gasoline poured on him and torched to death by other children, my heart aches and I sometimes have tears come to my eyes when I read about these event.  Why?  I don't know and often I don't like it and am embarrased by it.. but that is me, and that is part of what makes me a unique individual.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, I believe that many of us don't understand your original post Ugle because we don't understand where you are comming from completely (or speaking for myself, I do not FEEL where you are comming from), and perhaps you don't know where I am comming from.  I was simply expressing somthing from my heart cause I am a person that needs to express feelings.<br>

So to call someone a Black Beret now would only mean that they were in the military (I don't know though if that's just an Army thing now or if all the services are doing it).  So I could call a Ranger a Black Beret.  I could call a cook in a Field Support unit a Black Beret, or a PAC clerk in a Transportation Battallion.  It really means nothing now, the honor of that Beret is lost, thanks Monica and Bill.  If they were going to pick on a Beret it would have been less controversial if they had used the Crimson Airborne Berets, but I guess she didn't look good in that color.....<br>

I know the difference in the berets but it sure sounded like he didn't.  You think you must explain the berets to me?  You are also showing your ignorance by saying that it's issued to all service members, even though you do try to backtrack later in your post.  It's just an Army thing.  It also wasn't something that the Clinton's chose.  I do not like those people but I can't say they caused this problem.  I'm someone who will be forced to wear it when I PCS to my next station.  While here in Hawaii I get to keep the headgear I prefer.  As far as the other services, look at the AF and see how they like to twist things to make some of their jobs seem more important.  They also give out a beret to many of their people depending on their job, such as their form of the military police.  They think that means they &quot;earned&quot; them.  Yeah yeah, everyone finishes some sort of training in the military.  Just because you go through a little school to learn your basic job doesn't mean you &quot;earned&quot; it.   <p>Kilamdar<BR>

Who is making those Black Berets?  Hmm, a company in Arkansas according to more then one site.  What is Bush doing about the Beret issue? <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/3/8/163625.shtml">www.newsmax.com/archives/...3625.shtml</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Could the former CINC have done something to look into this issue since it's obviously a serious matter for the Rangers?  Well, this CINC is......<br>
<br>
You also should have pointed out that from the mid to late 70's, there were some other units who wore Berets in the Army other then the current Ranger/SF/Airborne units.  I don't see why anyone would have a problem with MP's or whoever wearing Berets.  But they can pick their own dang color, to steal one that has the blood, sweat, and tears of so many Rangers was a slap in the face.  Monica wore a Black Beret in one of the more famous pictures of her and Clinton together.  And yet somehow I'm not allowed to criticize him.  So you don't think at all that the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; army where recruits get time-out cards in basic training has anything at all to do with this decision if I understand you right. <br>
<br>
I went on Active Duty right as Clinton was taking office.  I saw the difference in the Privates coming out of basic training within a couple of years.  People were getting out in droves, good, senior people.  And many of them told me it was because of the direction we were heading in.  We still have the finest fighting force in the world, with the finest soldiers.  But the Military now is not what it was in the 80's and early 90's.  Sure we have better equipment because of technology, but as far as our training?  We are now &quot;An Army of One&quot; if you read the recruitment posters.  Pretty sickening thought to me since Esprit de Corp, teamwork and discipline is what units used to be about.  I'm sure for the most part it still is, but the degradation of these core values didn't start under a Republican President. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugamiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 12:45:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> Ugle writes:<br>

I've been in the reg Army for 14 years now and served in the National Guard before that.  When I was in the Guard I was in turbine engine repair (helicopter engines).  After joining the Army I became a 67H with a B7 identifier (OV-1D Mohawk Crewchief with the ejection seat repair ASI).  Now I'm a 96D (imagery analyst) and stationed in Hawaii with Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC).  I'm a Grave Lord from 2 years of work at it.  I'm single so I have all my spare time to use on games.  BTW, I also don't play any longer.  Read the papers and watch the news and you'll know one reason why.  Thanks to the Army I've been to Saudi Arabia (8 months for Desert Shield/Storm), Korea for over 2 years, Bosnia, Germany, Cuba, Thailand, and many other places.<br>
<br>
I joined before Clinton took office.  I went through basic back in the mid 80s.  You want to talk about differences in the way things were in the Army when I joined compared to when you joined?  You had it easier.  Regulations changed to make certain punishments or exercises illegal for example.  <br>
<br>
For being anything other than a REMF, I can't since they had to cut out over a half inch of bone from my foot since the bones were fusing together.  Without people providing the information needed or other support then the front line wouldn't get far either though.  It's the teamwork thing you know.  As for the berets, the black beret belonged to tankers before the Rangers got them.  How did the tankers feel when it was taken away?  I hate berets.  I wore one for 4 years and it didn't keep the sun out of my eyes.  It didn't keep the rain off my glasses.  It's hot as hell when you're out in the sun with it on.  You need two hands to put it on properly.  <br>
<br>
If you want a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; Army then stay away from people like me.  In Bosnia I had a soldier taken away from me because &quot;SGT, you yell at her too much&quot;.  I caused her to cry a few times I guess.  You know what though, after a couple of weeks they put her back under my control because they figured out that she needed yelling at.  <br>
<br>
As for your statements about Republican presidents.  Of course any military person in their right mind would vote Republican.  The Democrats have a history of destroying our military and then bitching when the military doesn't have the stuff needed to do something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 3:29:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> I understand the issues of support.  Many of the behind the lines people work just as hard and put themselves in a still considerable amount of danger just like the Combat Arms people.  We had some kick-tail Wrenches who loved heading out in their M88 with their Grease Guns (And I mean the ones that shoot live rounds heh).  I had a lot of respect for most of those guys.  Every soldier has their place and role.  It seemed odd to me that someone in a non-combat arms unit would be so vocal in their arguments supporting the Rangers is all.  I can't comment on how things were before I joined obviously, so all I could comment on was the rapid changes I saw after I joined, I guess I deserve your flames for not knowing everything that ever happened before I went in.<br>
<br>
I also am trying to look for where you got the idea that I was for a kinder, gentler Army.  All I can find is where I spoke against it.  The idea of NCO's beating the hell out of soldiers to instill discipline to me does seem unnecessary.  In the grand scheme of things that kind of stuff did not quit happening all that long ago.  As far as making your soldier cry, not sure that's something to be admired.  I will say though that IMO, if a Soldier needs a time-out card, or cries under pressure, they need to be discharged because a person who can't handle stress should not be in an occupation where extreme stress will always be a possibility.  It's too bad in a lot of ways the way the Guard is structured though, it's detrimental to discipline.  On AD if you screwed up, your nights, your weekends, YOU belonged to me.  And we corrected the problems, and things were good.  In a Guard unit, they are going home Sunday night.  Even the loss of a <br>

I don't know that I would say it is completely fair to say that all Democrats ruin the military and all Republicans make it stronger.  The military took large cuts under Bush Sr. as well.  In general terms what you are saying is true.  But in our next presidential election, who knows?  There are some Dove Republicans that would be more harmful then some of the most Hawkish Democrats.  It's likely that there would be other issues that would sway the balance, but I don't believe you can necessarily say that because someone is a Democrat they hate the Armed Forces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoderrybadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oderry Badgerclaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 3:50:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clanbadgerclaw.homestead.com/files/face.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> USARangers now wear Tan Berets btw... awesome in BDU's, horrid in Class A's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 6:10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> The kinder Army thing was a generalization that I guess was too broad.  Should a NCO beat the heck out of someone?  Not normally, but there are times that wall-to-wall counselling is useful and gets the point across the best.  As for making her cry, it wasn't bragging, it was to show how some people try and use things like tears, or those darn cards that thankfully I've never seen, and try to use it to get out of what they consider &quot;stress&quot; when they just want to be weak.  To be honest, one of the times she cried was when she said she wanted to go airborne so I told her to drop and give me 10 to show she could handle the PT needed to get through the school (she had failed a PT test the week before BTW).  If she couldn't handle what little I did to cause stress then there was no way she could handle a school like that where the stress is way worse.  I guess it didn't help when she got on my bad side before we even went to Bosnia.  I was in charge of getting her and a second person to Bosnia to run our little commo van (only a total of 5 were deployed to Bosnia at one time from my unit and while there we didn't fall under Army command technically, was kind of cool) and at the 9mm firing range she almost shot me because she couldn't control the weapon.  That was the first time I had seen someone actually jump across the barrier and actually tackle someone on the range.  Three safeties quickly tackled her.  Then while in Germany for 2 weeks of specialized training on the way to Bosnia she would vanish for hours and show up late in the mornings so I couldn't account for her and her safety.  Did she earn some good tongue lashings, I thought so.<br>
<br>
It's not that I support the Rangers, but the fact that I hate the berets.  I also work with Rangers every day, and SEALS and Special Forces.  I named my unit earlier, it should tell you why I work with them.  <br>
<br>
The Guard, it's ok, but it wasn't for me.  I went AD right after my 6 month requirement was completed (must stay Guard 6 months after AIT before going AD).  <br>
<br>
Yes Oderry, the new tan berets do look nice in BDUs, and I'm sure they are a little cooler in the sun since they don't suck up the heat like black does.  But in a way, I'd have to agree with them on the pain of switching to begin with even though they stole it from someone else origionally.  I know the South Korean SF general was pleased when he was presented with his tan beret during my last exercise there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 6:27:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Look.

I just read a small bit of Ugles post.<br>

But, please explain something to me. <br>

Are you saying that we shouldn't care that people are suffering, unless we know them personally?<br>
<br>
That feeling bad that you've found out someone has died (god forbid) just because you did not know them?<br>

Are you saying this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utaurusl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TaurusL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 2:44:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> I think in reality what he is trying to say is...<br>

My point isn't that we should only care about those we knew.  My point is the hypocrisy of those who talk about how much they care ONLY when they knew that person or it's brought to their attention.  I've known for sure one person who played EQ on this server that passed away a while back, and I didn't hear anything about that person.  So maybe I'm just a little ticked that the person I know passes away, and nothing is said.  But I'm not the kind to start a thread to deal with any loss I've felt, so I didn't.  And then someone that doesn't even play on this server gets several threads with a bunch of people talking about how much they will miss her, or how their lives are worse now.  <br>
<br>
And perhaps a call to arms to people to be more aware so that just maybe, by being more aware we can lessen the number of stories like this we have to hear.<br>

If people were really as empathic in RL as they are on msg boards, they wouldn't be spending 20 or 30 hours a week playing an on-line game.

This is the part im mad as hell about .......<br>

As for making a public statement when someone dies and not caring other then at that time.... let me tell you Ugle you are soooooo wrong..... You wanna know how many times a day I mourn My lost friends and family??? You wanna know How I feel when I walk past a child who has a bruise on his face....You wanna know how many times I mourn in a day at my children struggling in a god forsaken town with schools that are no better then the halfway houses around here and do you know how many times I mourn that I CANT HOMESCHOOL them because of the cost..... I could go on and on but you still havent made a good point to me other then We need to think about it everyday and do whatever it takes to stop the next one from happening that is the only thing I agree on with you.... Im still wiating for you to tell me what it is you do to help stop it and why you are playing EQ instead of goin to spend time at that shelter for abused children animals or whatever..... <p>Palidinaya</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/upalibadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pali Badgerclaw</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/19/02 9:39:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 10:01:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> First of all, I don't play EQ anymore.<br>
<br>
Second of all, do I want to know how you feel when you walk past a child with a bruise on his or her face?  I thought you had kids?  My kids have done stuff to where if I didn't know better I would think someone beat the tar out of them.  Kids get bruises playing.  Good grief, if you grieve everytime a kid bruises himself and you imagine someone mistreated them, you have far more severe problems then I'll ever have.<br>
<br>
I don't volunteer on a regular basis, but I done some work along that vein.  I also feel no need to come on here to try to talk about how great I am, about how much I do for the world.  And I'm not the one on here trying to talk about how great I am, I'm not as much of a blatant hypocrite as those most of my ire was vented at.  But I obviously underestimated you, you must be a cross between Jesus and Mary.  So, are you Mary with male Organs or are you Jesus as a Hermaphrodite?  Enquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
Can't homeschool them because of the cost?  Excuse me?  I know quite a few people who homeschool.  Some of them are using their own curriculum so they aren't buying any of those courses.  Their cost to homeschool their children is -0-.  I also understand that in some states you can ask for the money in taxes that the schools would normally spend on that child and use it to cover your costs.<br>
<br>
* trying to be serious here*<br>
I may be jaded, but if you imagine any child that hurts himself was abused, truly believe that all of the schools in your town are no better then halfway houses, and truly believe that you are so superior to everyone because of your volunteer activities, you really shouldn't be working with emotionally fragile people, because you have some real issues to deal with.<br>
<br>
* back to flaming*<br>
You don't have to be a professional race-car driver to give someone driving tips do you?  You don't have to be a policeman to stop someone from committing a crime, do you?  You don't have to be a licensed psychologist to give someone advice, do you?  Yet my impression of your arguments is that if I don't give you proof that I do more then you do that I can't say that we should all be doing more?  You're mad as hell at me for insulting your ego.  You talk about all the problems you see in the world, and treat me like your worst enemy?  You have a problem with priorities Pali. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/20/02 2:26:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Okay Ugle.
