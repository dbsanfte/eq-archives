Let me try to address some of them in a constructive way.<br><br>Who are public raids intended to benefit?  Hopefully, it's folks who wouldn't be able to get to the planes otherwise, like unguilded people and members of small guilds.  Ideally, it's people who will get a real thrill out of going to the Planes and being able to say they went and surived.  For a lot of people who sign up, it's going to be their first planar experience.  The large majority of people who fit into these categories are going to be in the lower end of the level range, like 46-50.<br><br>Now, nothing says that you can't bring 5 or 6 groups of level 46-50 people into the Planes and succeed.  In fact, pre-Kunark, that was your only option.  But if you don't want to have a CR that lasts for days (which was another hallmark of pre-Kunark planar raids), you've got to have a few basic requirements for these public raids.<br><br>The raid leader has to be able to limit attendance by class.  I know there are a lot of soloing druids out there who could really use those PoF drops, but even if the first 14 people who sign up are all druids, you can't take all of them.  So the raid leader has to be permitted to turn people away on this basis.<br><br>The raid leader has to be able to exclude people who are known ninja looters, generally disruptive, or otherwise beyond the fringe of acceptability.  This one is self-explanatory.<br><br>The raid leader has to be able to invite a small number of experienced people to flesh out the raid and make it work.  This might mean recruiting clerics for PoF.  It probably means bringing high level friends to pull and serve as main assist.<br><br>With today's equipment, either plane can easily be broken with a group or two of experienced higher-level players.  If you have these people in place, you can bring along a bunch of level 46-50 people and have fun farming armor drops and killing in the Planes all day.<br><br>Oh, and allow me to suggest as a hard and fast rule, no loot should be reserved on a public raid.<br><br>This, to me, is the ideal scenario for a successful public raid.  It's not as pure, and maybe not as public, as taking the first 36 people who sign up, but it's a lot more likely to work out for everyone involved.  If a raid leader doesn't have the discretion to do the things I mentioned above, the likelihood of a successful raid is slim.<br><br>Solonaro Stormheart<br>59th Outrider of Amici <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(12/27/01 12:50:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> Public signup doesn't mean you can't specify some general guidelines -- only 4 druids, 4 rangers, 10 clerics, that kind of thing.<br><br>And I believe the rules on Inny.com are updated.

This is what was originally written....<br><br>====<br><br>The goal of public events is to provided people who are not in a planes-going guild access to the planes.  This includes the unguilded or members of guilds that just do not raid the planes.<br><br>There will be ONE public event on the calendar at a time.<br><br>Innoruuk.com will moderate a SIGNUP SHEET for people who wish to host (perform as raid leader) a public event.<br><br>Once the current public event has started, the next host on the signup sheet should register the next event in a timely fashion.  Failure to promptly pick a date (within 3 days of the previous event) indicates a lack of desire on the hosts part, and the event calendar moderator is free to pick both an event and a host.<br><br>Picking a date far into the future will result in a similar response.<br><br>All public events will be PUBLIC.  A signup sheet will exist ON THE INNY.COM FORUMS.  The host may define reasonable limits based on class counts.  The host may also exclude a small number of people based on bad reputations.  The signup sheet must be made available IMMEDIATELY after posting the event on the calendar.<br><br>To help ensure the success of the raid, these rules will not limit attendance on public events based on guild affiliation. For instance, you may not be able to find enough unguilded clerics to go to Fear, or you may want an experienced puller to assist on the raid.  However, as a guideline, it is expected that the vast majority of attendees of public events should be unguilded or in guilds that are not attending the planes (either scheduled or FFA).<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/8/02 5:42:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> Bump.

I was planning on bucking up and getting a hate raid together. Now, I know from personal experience that public raids do NOT work on weekdays. Simply put, no one shows because they are all working, in school, etc. I also cannot schedule a raid on Friday Night because it conflicts with my work.<br><br>So I scan a bit down the calendar and find a perfect Saturday to run a hate raid. March 23rd. It's a saturday, it's unbooked, it's during my vacation and it gives me plently of time to level up, get advice on the new hate(it's been a while), recruit peeps and some knowledgeable friends, and other whatknot that goes with planar raids.<br><br>Then I look down, boom...... March 30th, Plane of FEAR raid. One week after I want to schedule my raid, which means now I have to submit, be wait listed, and then when the March 30th raid is gone, I have to wait ANOTHER 2 months to run a raid, because the calendar will be full again. In the mean time I cannot recruit anyone cause I have no definte date. Leveling for the raid won't matter cause it will likely be postponed for months and what do I do for raids in the mean time. My guild is far too small to do anything of note. (Love you guys, but it's the truth.)<br><br>If I go ahead and put it up an admin will take it down once they see it, or when large guilds start complaining that there is more than one public raid. This summit has not protected my right to the planes, it has done exactly the opposite, locked me out. I'm left with two options now, scrap my plans or poach the plane.(Which won't work, no unguilded person wants to be on for that and I doubt several stargglers will be able to fend off a large guild)<br><br>So, enlightened purveyors of our great summit, tell me how I'm supposed to go to the planes? (And keep in mind that guests on guild raids usually get squat, so don't throw me that option.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugoddessr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess R</A> at: 1/16/02 12:33:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthistlebane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thistlebane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/16/02 11:40:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> Get yourself several groups together and go on a FFA (or FIF) night.

And have to tell people that I want to bring that I have no idea when the raid will be.<br><br>Wolfy, you are missing the point entirely, the only thing stopping you from running a raid is you, and this farked up summit.(Note, those are sepreate enitities and I am not holding you personally responsible for the summit) Personally, I would be more than happy to bring you up to hate on my raid, but the problem is I can't schedule or hold one because of the summit rules and my guild isn't large enough to have a spot of their own. To clear up Thisltlebane's point, weekday public raids do not work. I have tried running them in the past and never had enough people to pull it off.<br><br>Now I have already stated in the past before summit III was launched that I felt limiting public raids was a bad decision. When you have a public fear raid scheduled and block out the ability to schedule a public hate raid, it is bound to cause problems. FFA days do us no good, we can not organize on weekdays nor can we compete with large guilds who can put together raids on the spur of the moment.<br><br>I repeat what I said before. How can I make a raid when the rules are so limited? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 8:58:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> I still don't see how you're worse than me.  I'd like to schedule an event now, but I can't either, because OotW has one scheduled.  And there's a public event scheduled, so you can't schedule one, either.<br><br>That puts you and I in the same boat, as best I can tell.<br><br>If we say &quot;unlimited bookings&quot;, then it just means the calendar is going to fill up for 6 months out.  I don't see how that helps anyone.<br><br>There are enough people who insist on part of the calendar being FFA.  We've seen the poaching and other problems if we don't allow for some FFA.<br><br>I'd LOVE to hear some solutions that actually address all the forces here.<br><br>1. There are limited resources available.  Thank you verant.<br>2. There are a lot of people who want access to those resources.  Thank you, epic quests.<br>3. There are significant numbers of people who want FFA days.<br>4. There are significant numbers of people who want scheduled days.<br>5. Everyone seems to agree that we should strive to share the limited resources as fairly as possible.<br><br>To be quite honest, I don't see a plan that balances those forces better than the current plan.  I'm sure the entire server would love to hear ideas -- if they address all those points.  But if you try to &quot;fix&quot; one point at the expense of another, you'll undoubtedly run into serious opposition.<br><br>However, if you're desire to attend the planes is for the mundane armor drops, it's EASY to get those.  You just need to make some friends.  Make some friends in guilds that are popping in for epic drops.  Make some friends in guilds that are there for armor drops.<br><br>Then do some homework.  Is the plane free at 7 PM Tuesday?  If so, start sending tells.<br><br>The west wall camp can be broken with 3 groups averaging level 53.  I'd do it with 2 groups if everyone were 55+.  I'd do it with 1 if they were all 60 and used to working together.  Yeah, you might evac a few times -- it may take an hour or two to break in.  So what?<br><br>Or you could just watch for AV or another hyper-duty guild to go in for epic drops, then bring in a group or two after they have moved out of west wall.  It's FFA after all.<br><br>The armor drops are easy to get.  It's the epic drops that are hard.<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugoddessr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess R</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 9:10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> I am going for armor drops, and I'd imagine most people who would attend wuold be going for armor drops as well.

It's just a different set of people getting $h!t on.

There are a lot of guilds that take guests on their raids.  And you could always just keep an eye on when a big guild is in Fear and ask if you can come in and loot what might rot.<br><br>Really, the armor drops there get wasted a LOT.  OotW and AV formed an alliance on Tuesday -- all we wanted were epic drops in Fear.  We left a lot of yard trash behind when we left.  A fully broken plane with probably one half of the mob still up.  That makes it a cake walk to go in with just a few groups.<br><br>And if you had been on my friends list that day, you'd have gotten a tell asking if you wanted to help out.<br><br>If all you want are armor drops, then you should be able to find room within the existing system to get them.  But you will have to make an effort.  However, I suggest to you the effort required is FAR less than the amount of work it takes to plan and execute a public event.<br><br>You just need to make friends with people.  Not with uber guilds or anything like that -- just friends with people around the server.  I'm not suggesting kissing up or anything like that, just friendship.  And then make sure your friends know if their guilds are doing planes, to please let you know if you could go, too.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uaalyien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aalyien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 4:07:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> heres my 2cp worth on this subject... most planar guilds from what I see schedule the next raid a month out or within the coming month. there raid occurs and the next raid is scheduled and so on.<br><br>Without doing the math I would state that on average over the last 3 months each planar guild would have on average 1 fear or hate raid per month.<br><br><br>So imho it would be fair to allow 1 public hate or fear raid to be scheduled for each month, with say a limit of 60 days from the date of scheduling.<br><br>This means that no more than 2 public raids on the calendar at once and the cant be scheduled further out than 60 days.<br><br>I can not imagine a guild that would schedule a raid 2 to 3 months out and give up 2 raids before then so why should public raids be allwed to have a date that  blocks others running earlier raids.<br><br>The only reason i say 2 public raids is to allow for a hate and a fear raid to be sheduled with a proviso that there is on average one raid every 30 days much like other guilds do.<br><br>On a side note I am a 51 cleric looking to get up there in the plains on ffa so send me a /tell in game <br><br>Aalyien <br>51 Vicar <br>Officer of Ardent Elite  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 10:48:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Public Hate/Fear Hosts</span><hr size=1> FYI: I'm only reading this because I needed to post something else in this section....<br><br>Your idea has merit except it makes twice as many public events as a single guild event.

What?<br><br>Back the truck up!<br><br>I already asked to host a public hate raid and you told me what to go do with myself!<br><br>Frankly aaiyen is right, guilds are not slowed down by the 1 at a time rule because most of the uber guilds if they need to do it will simply go on an FFA day and dominate the zone. Planes capable guilds will get 1 event run every 6 weeks at the most because it is easier for them to put a riad together and they can do raids on mondays and sunday nights.<br><br>Public raids need more leeway because they are MUCH harder to put together. They can only be run on the weekends beacuse you won't get enough people on a weekday because of RL issues. (I know this from experience) Also, more than one person may want to run a public raid and it's not fair to tell one of them no, when you allow nearly 100 GUILDS to schedule raids on the calendar.<br><br>The real reason no one is trying to run a public raid right now is because some guy who hasn't event posted anything regarding his raid, or any expected guest list, has posted a raid already and you have locked all other public raids out. Simply put, the summit lmits public raids too greatly. In fact when Aldrin tried to make a case for public raids he was literally jeered out of the chat room.<br><br>The bottom line is guilds don't want there to be public raids, so the summit did everything short of banning them completly. I made case after case of this during the pre summit arguments and then when the summit came I was sent my invite an hour before it started while I was asleep, so I could not even plead my case.<br><br>Now I have asked for a public hate raid, so don't insult my intelligence by telling people that no one has asked to host a raid. I am sure there must be others too, who want to host but are intimidated by the opressive rules regarding public raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=198.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=198.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=198.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=198.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.threadControl?topicID=198.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=198.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=198.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4>Innoruuk - Guilds</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
