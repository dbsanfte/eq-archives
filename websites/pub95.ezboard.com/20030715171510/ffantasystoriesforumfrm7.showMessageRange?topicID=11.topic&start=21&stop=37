One more drink and a place to lay down, he'd get his sister squared away in the morning, not now.

Stumbling around, she was anxious to find someone that she could befriend. Not knowing anyone and having no friends, jess wanted to go out and see if she couldn't fix that. This was so against her usual character, but it was lonely not having anyone to talk to. She walked to the bar looking for something to drink before starting her quest for a friend. Sitting next to a boy at the bar she smiled at him but was faced with a snarl that was quickly followed by the mublings of a drunken stupor. Not wanting to get a scolding for anything she quickly downed her drink and looked out on the floor. People, loads of people, all dancing. The lights in her eyes were matched by the lights in the club, smiling she felt shy, but determined to find a friend. She patted the man on the shoulder and gave him a few dollars and walked away to find a friend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordlygnome>LordlyGnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/4/02 9:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The shadow darkens</span><hr size=1> He smiled as he saw the man fall, he knew, he always knew, the torment that mortals choose to endure, he loved to smell the fear from their bodies.

He laid his hand on the man's chest making this poor soul screem in terror of his darkness. He could hear someone, a girl, she could sense him...

Too bad they are too foolosh to know exactly what they were dealing with. A small smile formed at his lips as he opened his mind toward this &quot;nightkat.&quot; <br>
    &quot;Hrmmm, you think you know what you are dealing with? You think you can kill me or even try? Tell me this, how can you kill what cannot be alive, what has survived countless ages, who has seen kings rise and fall. You will do good to keep this secret of yours to yourself.&quot; <br>

It was as if they all had just... vanished. What was going on? Was she going crazy? It wasn't two yet, and someone can't just leave without a trace. Maybe she was crazy... A hand. Someone placed a hand on her shoulder and jolted her out of her thoughts faster than she could handle. Squeeking and spinning around, she nearly tripped over the air that got in her way and half fell on whoever the hand belonged to. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ur... um... gosh, I'm sorry!&quot; Laughing nervously she regained her balance. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Feeling mortified to say the least, she looked up at none other than Matt - the stranger who was so quick to get away. That wasn't what matter though, what mattered was that he came back. &quot;Hey there stranger.&quot; She flashed him one of her mischevious and cutely silly grins. Hopefully this time around he'd be ready to talk.<br>
