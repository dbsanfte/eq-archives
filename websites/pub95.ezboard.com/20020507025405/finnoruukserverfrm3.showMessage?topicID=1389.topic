I've tried the usual suspects, Karnor's, Mist, etc., but have found myself hanging around for very long periods of time with very few grouping opportunities.

I have no desire to guild hop for the rest of my playing days, so I'm waiting for a good match. That's hard to do based on some charter on a website, which may or may not accurately reflect the guild as a whole.<br><br>I should note that I still enjoy the game, lately I've been running around bandaging new players with my nifty 70% bind wound abilities, but I'd like to also take part in some level appropriate activites.<br><br>I'd appreciate any advice from all corners.

Sure you can solo EXP MOB's at 51.  Even a Warrior or Rogue can do that.  My suggestions are:<br><br>Start a different class to take a break.  If you start a class that can solo well, you might find that soloing isn't all that fun in a MMORPG heh.<br><br>Buy a second computer.  You always have a group, and you can at least have the two of them talk back and forth, argue, etc.<br><br>Keep doing what you are doing.  I group with Guildies occaisonally.  Usually that's mostly for when I'm going to go camp stuff they might be able to use, or stuff that might be little/no EXP for me, but might be great EXP for someone 4 levels lower then me.  Being in a lot of guilds doesn't mean you always have a group to hunt with.  I'd say 98% of the time I'm somewhere for EXP it's not a Guild group, so being Guildless doesn't mean you automatically are at a big disadvantage.<br><br>People that have known me don't invite me to parties because of my Guildtag.  They don't invite me because of my Uber Equipment, because I don't have any.  They usually invite me because they've grouped with me before and know that I'm not usually an idiot.  Or they just need my class heh, either way works.  I have always enjoyed the sub-50 game much more then the post-50 game.  Except for twinks, I generally didn't find someone would rather hold the party up waiting half an hour for a 56+ res when they were sub-50.  They took what they could get, or looted their stuff if they could get back.  That doesn't mean I'm gonna suicide down to 46 or anything, but IMO the gamestyle does change some.  It's up to you to decide whether you'd rather start playing like a post-50, or start a new char.  <br><br>There's a lot of life after 50.  Some people say life doesn't START until 55 or so, I say that there is life after 50, but it's a different one then you had before..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umukael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mukael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/18/02 8:06:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1389.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is there life after 50?</span><hr size=1> I've been in my 50s longer than my spawn of 1-49.

Nobody will ever stop you from leaving a guild that you just don't &quot;fit&quot; in.  Sometimes Guild Hopping will finally get you into a place you are comfortable, as long as you don't use them and lose them.  <br><br>As far as what can you do post 50.  Try Chardok pick up groups at zone in, out, or fort.  Get some experience and get yourself a good name.  Later move to Sebilis, I would say at level 54 ish.  For Naggy and other such raids, look for guilds whose membership is mostly in the high 40s and low 50s, they are the ones you will find in those type of raids.  Many times they aren't even asking you to join them.<br><br>What I have to say makes the best chance for you to find groups or happiness in the post 50 levels is a good reputation.  Not only do you have to know people, but they have to know you and trust you.  There are many players in their low 50s who somehow managed to sleep through the learning of their characters and have no clue what they are doing at the higher end game.  Pride should not always lay on your played time at 51 being 14 days compared to some of us with over 110 days and not even 60 yet.  Know your class, know your skills, and know your limitations, that makes you valuable.  Know how to play with others and that makes you priceless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugamiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kindly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/19/02 5:09:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1389.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is there life after 50?</span><hr size=1> Quoth Gecho:<br><br>&quot;As for why I haven't joined a guild yet, why does every guild that invites me, say &quot;Want to join us?&quot;, instead of &quot;How'd you like to hang out with us for a few weeks and see whether we are a mutual fit?&quot;.

Once you get used to being guilded, you'll never go back, imo. Theres something about that extra chat on your screen that just makes your day.<br><br>So, in my opinion, seek out your best friend and ask(if he is in a guild) if you could hitch a ride to their next event, whether it be a picnic in oasis, an epic event, or hell, a raid on Vindi or vox. the magnitude of the guild doesn't matter, its the people in it.<br><br>I had crap gear(and i mean crap) till i was 54 and decided to tempt fate and go guildless for a few days. I realized i wasn't cut for guildless-ness and went out on a limb to meet new people, make new friends and joined a new guild. regardless of the power of the guild, the people i met in that guild remain to be my best of friends in EQ, and I'll never forget some of the events I went through while in that guild.<br><br>Guilds are around so you could meet new people and enjoy their company...basically just another chat channel...raids come as a secondary thing in all cases. If someone denounces you because of your gear, stand up and say you worked for it, and if they don't shut up, make 'em send me a tell and I'll tell them the story of the poor elf who made it big by being courteous and understanding. <p><a HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48885">Baowulf Mistheart</a><Br>hierophant of <a HREF="http://www.innoruuk.com">Innoruuk</a><Br>member of <a HREF="http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthetruedominion">Fortress of Honor</a><br>my twink, <a HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48292">Inkyspots Ondaground</a><br><a HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96944">i wish i was...</a><p align="center"><ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank"><imgsrc="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/mythresult/gorgon.jpg"border="0" width="330" height="175"></a><br>I took the <ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank">What Mythological Creature Are you?</a> test by<lj user=peacefulchaos> !</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uchingwon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chingwon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/19/02 2:18:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1389.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is there life after 50?</span><hr size=1> Hey there fellow scaled one.<br><br>I know what it's like to go through the hell of 50+.

I'm an unguilded 57 mage, and while there may not be a tag next to my name, I still am in a certain sense a part of a few different guilds, and I'm sorta feeling them out to see if I fit with them.  Alot of people are always trying to get into the next biggest and coolest guild, but that isn't the best way to go about it.  Guilds that give you invites quickly are dangerous, and just because you don't have a tag above your head doesnt mean you can't have a good time with those that do.  With 50+ play I think you just need to be extremely patient, and enjoy the people you play with.<br>  In regards to where to find groups when your a 51 monk, it going to be hard in any popular place you go to, because there will be a few other 55+ monks with their epics there.  I might look into some of the older dungeons for exp such as Guk or Sol b.  I honestly don't know the state of these dungeons today, but they are where i leveled before kunark came out (to 50) and I imagine they are pretty empty and still decent exp.  <br><br>Another thing you have to fight is that alot of people have made monk twinks, and thats just difficult.  Not many people are playing mage these days wink wink.<br><br>Rownin Nero<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utaurkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taurkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/20/02 8:05:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1389.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hitting the planes</span><hr size=1> I did not read through all the posts here, but I have a few comments/suggestions.<br><br>First, I was so excited about hitting my 50's and when I reached 50 I found it to be somewhat disappointing.  I could not find groups for the life of me.  To get the groups, I would spend my time in KC, running to different camps asking if they needed help.  If they did not, I would ask if I could hang out outside of the group and pound mobs.  Usually, they would pick me up once a group member left.  It sure beat sitting at the zone LFG (I would still do so while helping kill mobs though)<br><br>Once I was able to put a few levels in, I worked on my epic.  It is amazing how much an epic will help with getting groups.<br><br>Further more, I found that once I was 53, I could get groups in Seb, so spent time there till 55ish.  I am now in a great guild with a mostly 50ish players evenly spread from low 50's to 60's.  I almost always group with guildies, and there are always some who want to xp.  Chardok is the place of choice now, and once we get a few more keys for some more guildies, HS will be our next stomping ground.<br><br>Just my 2cp worth<br><br> <p>Taurkon  54th lvl Rake of the Scenites</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugecho.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gecho</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/22/02 2:06:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1389.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hitting the planes</span><hr size=1> Thanks again for all of the suggestions.
