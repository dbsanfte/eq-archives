The white elves just don't got the aim of the tree elves, Pappy alwasy said...<br>
<br>
Brutus's rage started to grow as he saw a few arrows thunk into the ground next to the little girl. The inkie got hit, but still tried to protect her. A black elf aiding and elf of the woodlands...? Well, these *were* odd times, and Brutus, a barbarian, was aiding the dark elf as well...<br>
<br>
Three arrows flew once again. Undeen was chanting to keep his internal focus. Brutus was quite confused as to why anyone still needed the words, but he found droning chants aided meditation, so why not? Brutus's magics came much quicker, though, as he merely projected the animals spirits that clung to his soul, as if it were a life line in the absence of the gods. His wolf pet, with the throat of yet another elf in its mouth and gnome blood upon its face, dissapated into mana-rich mist. The mists swirled outwards, and three wolf heads appeared before the arrows, snapping their powerful jaws shut on the oncoming barrage. The few plate-clad elfs that had been able to perch in the trees fell back with fright. <br>
<br>
Brutus smiled to himself as he walked over towards the chanting elf. During the unleash of power, he hadn't heard the command, but had grabbed onto Undeen's arm. The wizard eyed him, almost venomously, until Brutus let go with the realization that he wasn't in the Faydark anymore....<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh..... Undeen, sir, where exactly... are we?&quot; The big man asked, wary of his surroundings.<br>
<br>
&quot;... ... .....Kunark. And why do you call me 'sir'?&quot; With some annoyance in his voice, he also corrected, &quot;And it's 'Lar'Tese'.&quot; He sighed; barbarians. Whaddya expect?((&lt;----appropriate dialogue control, sry))<br>
<br>
&quot;Brutus, they call me. We be in a time of war, elf. I'm not one to claim to be above battle and plunder.&quot; Brutus knelt down, and scooped up a bit of dirt from the ground. He let it fall, and the wind picked it up in a swirl, making a muddy halo around his head, a few feet in diameter. &quot;Oi was wand'rin through the forests of old, the planes to the south of m'homelands, 'nd Oi was lookin fer a werthy soldier ta rally meself with.&quot; By this time, the circle looked to be solid. Blue light shone forth from it, and the spirits of the wild Kunark flooded through, wrapping themselves around Brutus.<br>
<br>
He realized Undeen looked almost slightly surprised. &quot;Aye, shamans are weak nowadays. Too much faith in the gods. Not enough in the world around us. I draw the wand'rin spirits to meself. 'Tis how I grow in pow'r, why Oi been travellin, 'nd why I seek mighty allies. After all, me scale wulfers er hungry!&quot; Brutus patted a half-transparent scale wolf that appeared at his side. The barbarian sat, and began trickling his inner force to the spirits he'd acquired, feeding their ravenous appetite. The shaman's eyes snapped open, and the mystical creatures backed away and dissipated. &quot;Undeen... Where's yer army? And who're these kiddies here with ye?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uundeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Undeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: its high elf FIGHTIN TIME!!!!</span><hr size=1> Undeen chuckles dryly as he looks around, making sure everyone was there.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Good.  Got the barbarian, the girl, and the Vah'Shir...  And myself, obviously.  That's all that matters.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
turning to the barbarian, a slight smirk on his lips, flashes of the recent battle of the Lake of Ill Omen.  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Army was lost recently in a battle in the Lake of Ill Omen.  A place not far from here, on this very continent.  Though all my army but myself and five or so others died, it wasn't exactly a lost battle.  We intended to destroy the docks of Firiona Vie.  The Iksar of Kunark destroyed both armies, and are believed to be marching on the docks now.  Mission complete.&quot;  shrugging slightly, Undeen couldn't help but smirk, thinking just how close that mass of lizardmen are right now.  How close the docks are..<br>
<br>
Brutus just stared a moment, apparently having a little problem with the idea of an entire wizard's army lost.  &quot;So...  Where exactly is the rest a yer army?  Ya know.  The one's that lived.&quot;<br>
<br>
Undeen shrugged lightly, turning to the girl who was apparently somewhere along the lines of shock, and loss of her mouth with which to speak.  &quot;Neriak by now, I would suppose.  Though, I am most certain they, myself, and most a large chunk of Neriak's army, Oggok's army....  Oh nevermind with names.  I'm sure the rest of the 'evil' army will be coming to the docks in OverThere to defend it from the Iksar soon enough.  We're guessing that once Firiona Vie falls, OverThere is next.  Or perhaps Karner's Castle first...&quot;  a smirk plays over his lips, remembering the castle so well.<br>
<br>
Soon though, looking about, the sounds around him seeming a din rather that individual sounds, the smirk fades, replaced by a frown, and even something resembling anger crawls over his face like a plague taking the Karana planes.  &quot;by all that's still holy, it feels like it was a lifetime ago when the gods were here, and we were at relative peace...&quot;<br>
<br>
Brutus smirks slightly, watching the elf a moment before speaking.  &quot;Oi.  It was a lifetime ago...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://auction.2y.net/user/Bellona/gir2.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 11:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/Bellona/GIR.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~*(oh, i'm special now!)*~</span><hr size=1> Tani lookes around. Kunark? She had heard of it once before, but never had she been. With wide eyes and her mouth agape she watches the barbarian make a halo and summon a pet with nearly no effort at all. ~If I could do that... Then Tasgall would see how much help I could be! And then... I could do more important things.~<br>
<br>
Her thoughts flow fast and many. That was the kind of power she wanted. Magic. It was one of two paths that could lead her to her dreams. Just as her thoughts begin to slow she hears the word &quot;kiddie&quot; and everything freezes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kiddie? I'm not a kid!&quot;<br>
<br>
Anger flares in her eyes as she stares coldly at the over-grown oaf. Kid! He called her a kid! Young. Yes. Child. No. <br>
<br>
&quot;I-&quot; <br>

The feeling of something slick and scaley, yet hairy, rubs against her leg. With a scared and disgusted look on her face, she glances down to see some kind of dog... thing. Screetching, she jumps back only to trip and fall on her butt. The loud pitched noise scares away the animal and leaves Tani on the ground whining because that grotesque <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> thing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> actually <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> touched</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> her. <br>

For every pillar, or pyramid, or temple of power, there was a respective wizard in Erudin hired to teleport it's citizens to the location.  Without a care, Nallu walked up to the first he saw.

He called back the scaled wolf, and it came back to his side reluctantly. Small spikes scratched lightly on his legs as he held out his hand to Tani. She took it, with a bit of a fearful look on her face, and Brutus said, &quot;Me name be Brutus Derridius.&quot; He kissed her hand, and the girl chuckled as his beard brushed against her skin. &quot;And ye might be...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tani,&quot; she said. She giggled, and did a little curtsy, then backed away when she realized that... *thing*... was still watching her!<br>
<br>
Brutus didn't feel offended by the abrupt break. He patted the wolf on the head, and laughed lightly. &quot;Pleasure ta meet ye.&quot; The barbarian turned and introduced himself to the Vah'Shir. The two races were two of the few that still had the lasting peace between them without it being cold indifference. He turned from Derren, and back to Undeen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye feel nothing at the loss of yer men? Pretty cold, if ye ask me, Undeen, and Oi know cold...&quot; Icicles grew from the big joker's elbows as he sat on a rock, arms rested on his knees. &quot;Hehehehhh...&quot; Brutus didn't even have time to shake the icicles off his elbows when he heard the battle drums in the distance. He shuddered to think about having to do battle with an army of lizards that wiped out a great black elf wizard's forces. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut short by the hiss coming from behind Tani. Brutus's head whipped around to the girl, and his wolf was already growling instinctively at the lizard. Tani was still, eyes wide, and the iksar's deadly yellow eyes glowed out of the foliage... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uundeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Undeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/18/02 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Resolution</span><hr size=1> &quot;They weren't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> MY</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->~...&quot; Undeen's words were cut short by the hissing sound and quickly his head whipped around to look at the sorce.<br>

<br>
Undeen raised both hands up, his enchanted chainmail clanking slightly with his movements.  Slowly and carefully, Undeen began his chanting to create a nice shock of ice to touch the next enemy to come in to sight, but suddenly his spell fizles as a rare thing happens.  There is the sudden jolt through him, telling him the Wizards spires are in use.  It would take a moment to figure out which one...  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Don't have that moment just now.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Iksar... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Iksar</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. A gust of memories burst through her mind. Filthy, disgusting, evil creatures... Iksar... Scum of the earth, slimy, stinky, raunchy lizards... The list went on and on. Tani grins evilly. She would kill every damned one of those @#%$ reptiles if she had to. Thoughts of revenge and murder are stopped short. Time for plotting was not something she had, by now it would have noticed everyone staring at it and ready to kill it. They would not have a chance. Tani could feel its eyes burning against her back, it was aiming for her heart, they always aimed for the heart. The scaly beast jumps from the foliage. Its muscles rippled as it ran, straight and solid, towards Tani. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hehe...&quot;<br>
<br>
Instinctively her hands reached behind her and pulled two daggers from the sheaths in her belt that held them. Her knees bend and her body gracefully turns to face the vile creature. It was already in mid-lunge when she lowered the position of its target; poor thing was thrown off by the change of events. Gripping the handles of the daggers, Tani thrusts the first deep within the iksar’s head cavity and the second punctured its chest with ease. Her small arms add to the speed and power at which the repulsive animal flies and sends it up and over her. Ripping the daggers from its flesh she watches contently as it rolls in dirt stopping just inches from the cat-man's feet. She wasn't done with it yet... Rising to her feet, she walks cold-faced to the bleeding and barely living enemy. First things first. Tani grabs the iksar’s wrist and pins it to the ground with one of her daggers and repeats this with the other wrist. In silence she continues to rifle through its belongings, take off what little leather armor it wore and pocket any useful things it might have. Tani's grin widens as the Iksar attempts to sit up, only to be pulled back down by its own weight and the fact that it cannot free its hands with what little strength it has left. Tani yanks a dagger out of the gross thing's wrist. In its chest, she carefully carved letters and read aloud as she did so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Su... Sor...ger...e&quot;<br>
<br>
By now the last of the reptile’s life had gushed from its head wound and onto the soil. Tani smiled slightly. It reminded her of the river back home, only red! Gah, would this thing ever stop bleeding? She hadn't noticed how it was getting everywhere! <br>
<br>
Shrugging slightly she sits down next to it and pulls out a few tailoring tools from her pocket. The rest of the people who were their stare at her in shock. While she alters the leather to fit someone her size, all stay silent. Once finished she inspects her work. Very nice. Slipping her new armor on, she grabs both daggers and returns them to their rightful place in her belt. She stands and glances around. What were they waiting for? Tani's face turns blank. Blinking a few times she pauses. What... just... happened. Iksar. Bushes. Daggers. Blood. Death. Tani. <br>
<br>
She<br>
<br>
<br>
Killed<br>
<br>
<br>
Something.<br>
<br>
Fear brushes the back of her mind as she slowly turns around. There, only a foot or two away, lay an iksar's dead body in a large pool of blood. The sight was too much for her, but knowing she was the one to cause this was over kill to her mind. All control of her legs leaves her and she falls on her bum. That iksar’s life ended because of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> her</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> She</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> caused this. Tani shakes her head. No... No, it wasn't her. It couldn't be... She didn't do this... Tani looks down at her hand. Blood. Lifting her own hand to eye level, she stares at it. Terror chills her face. The men around her look to each other. What were they going to do? She was obviously crazy... Before anyone had a chance to do anything, a shrill scream pierces the air. Tani could not keep herself from screaming, nor could she stop. She killed. Murdered. Mutilated. Killed.<br>

Vermifax and his elves poured out of the trenches. His commrade Nickadimus was next to him. &quot;Hey you wolf do you think we'll make our way out of this one?&quot; Nick smiled at his friend's use of his alter ego. &quot;No brother. I think I'll die here today, but you are going to go back to our home in the trees and take good care of my daughter!&quot; The wolf smiled one last time and shoved his friend into a tree that quickly changed back to a woodelf and started to send his friend back to the butcherblock mountains. <br>
<br>
The wolf stormed into the fray with his short light blades dancing on the wind. Glorious! His family crest was firm in his hands on the pommel of his blades. They were the fangs of a wolf. His family seal on his breastplate the wolf with an arrow in it's jaws. Today he would prove his name proud. <br>
<br>
Vermifax screamed as he burst into the mountains. He had not wanted to go back and babysit his brother's daughter. he wanted to die valiantly in battle. Snarling at the Wolf for this he started to walk towards the dwarven city to fullfil his promise to look after his niece if anything happened. <br>
<br>
Entering the tunnels fangs ready to rend, the Wolf charged with a hatred that could drown out any other feelings. These things had left his daughter motherless, and were soon going to take his life as well, but not before he destroyed the tunnels and gave the elves a fighting chance against the high elves of faydark. &quot;For You MELINE!!&quot; he shouted as the cave grew quiet and dark. A wind pulled down from the opening and after it came flame that needed no fuel to burn, only the hatred of a man looking for vengence. Dropping to his knees he let the heat travel over him and smiled as the swords melted into his hands. Vengence is mine. Victory is Glorious!<br>
<br>
The cave collapsed and all the gnomes in the tunnel were killed instantly. But it did not stop there. It went into the city of Ak'kanon and killed many in the great liberary as well. <br>
<br>
In the screams of pain and the splash of blood there could be heard a howl in the distance. The Wolf had left his mark. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/18/02 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Glorious</span><hr size=1> Nallu reapeared.  He had hoped to arrive somewhere near civilization, possibly the western common lands or even the Faydark, yet the surroundings he saw told of a bleak and barren land.  Kunark!  he had foolishly gone to Kunark, and without being able to cast a spell, he couldn't get home.  As he turned to take in his surroundings, he noticed people!  People actually LIVE here besides the iksar filth.....fools!  As he looked closer, he realized something was amiss.  A giant man, no, barbarian with muscles that could undeniably uproot the mightiest of oaks, a dark elf of obveous magical talent, a wizard by his guess, and a wood elven girl, barely his age clad in leather armor with a red stain, blood, glimmering in the light.  Maybe they haven't seen me......  As quickly as one in a robe could run, Nallu hurried behind a spire, blocking himself from their piercing gaze.  He looked to the barbarian and shuddered.  The last he had met called him a woman for wearing a 'dress' and proceeded to lift him up while trying to drink his ale.  No, he wasn't in the mood to meet another of that race!  <br>

&quot;No! My father is the greatest elf warrior this clan as ever seen and no one will tell me otherwise.&quot; <br>

Vermifax stood and watched as she shouted at some old man with a cane. He felt like a rabbit in a hole now with the news he bore. How could he do this...<br>

Heather shouted again at the old man. He didn't know what he was talking about. She was furious once her father came back from his most recent take of action she would be able to prove it again. She could show this bunch of dwaven morons that she was the daughter of the Wolf. Turning around to head back to her small hut she saw Vermifax standing there staring at her. surprised to she him back she started to run towards him, but scanning the hillls she did not see any armed elves or her father. <br>
<br>
Understanding shone through her usual bright face. Vermifax didn't have to saw a word his stare told her everything.

Apparently this little girl wasn't as 'helpless' as she had appeared.  Why she... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This is too weird...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Weird or not, she was crying.  it had shocked her.  Acting before one could think of what they were doing.  It was the best way to kill.  Especially that first time.<br>
<br>
He moved down and kneeled next to the crying girl.  At first, he couldn't think what to do.  She was still scared of him.  then it hit him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She needs a father right now.  Not a wizard.  Not an enemy.  not someone that would worry if she'll run.  Someone to comfort her, and tell her she had done the right thing.

She needs a father, and it looks like that's me...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Undeen didn't hesitate.  He if he was worried about touching her, or her reaction to him, he didn't show it.  He just sat next to her, his staff dissipating away, and put his arms around her, hugging Tani into his chest and whispering to her.  &quot;Shhh...  It's alright.  You had to do it.  It was your only choice.  It's alright dear, it's ok.  You're safe.  You made sure of that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rocking her slightly, Undeen sat with the little girl and comforted her best he could, holding her and showing as much comfort and protection to her he could.  If she could make it through this, she would likely become a rather strong woman when she grew up.  Just like his little girl could have.  And his wife had.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Maybe I'm still needed as a father by someone after all...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

A single torch casts little light against the darkeness that fills the tiny room. A elegant chair with intricate carvings decorating it's rosewood surface holds a Feir'Dal. The elf was golden skinned, paled haired, and emerald eyed. Handsome on all acounts. Long strands of shimmering fair-golden hair spill over his shoulders. A soft cream and white dyed robed hangs loosely from his built frame. On his chest was an emblem that was becoming all too well known, too quickly in the new world. On the desk in front of him are scattered papers, open books, and stained yellow letters. His carnation pink lips part slowly as a smirk creeps across his face. From deep within his chest a sweet-ringing laughter echoes against the blank stone walls. <br>

She seemed to have Barbarian blood coursing through her veins! he mused silently. The black elf was holding her now; all elves normally looked the same to men of his size, but he noticed the distinct difference between the two races... yet they stuck together, nonetheless. Without even noticing the cat-man running past him, Brutus smiled warmly at the two. The spirit of Nneellee, his first wolf cub he'd been given as a pet, enwrapped the two in a soft blue luminescent embrace. &quot;The spirit of soothing...&quot; Brutus muttered as his best friend returned to his own soul.<br>

Find the Master.<br>
<br>
Foliage didn't even shudder as it ran. It dodged around trees with lightning speed, leapt piles of leaves, jumped ferns and dove under bushes. Not a single blade of grass on the plane stirred and not a breeze was conjured from the over sized panther. It stood nearly as tall as a troll, and glowed the same blue illuminescence as all spirits, but with the purple taint of its earthly body staining it. With a single bound, the panther was catapulted fifty feet.<br>
<br>
Find the Master.<br>
<br>
Now.<br>
<br>
The panther passed Kin. It smelled it. The Kin was hunting. Don't disturb the Kin. Find Kin later.<br>
<br>
It dodged a few more trees. See the Prey. The panther's transparent shell passed around the Erudite as if it were smoke flowing over a pillar. Scare Prey. Kin find Prey easier.<br>
<br>
Find the Master.<br>
<br>
Sniff. Close. Closer. FOUND! The panther leapt from in between two trees, sleak muscles glinting. The MASTER!<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Brutus stared at the panther as it streaked towards him. It ran past Undeen and Tani on the ground, and passed over them like a cloud of smoke. It phased through the barbarian, and he heard it all;<br>
<br>
Fires crackled. Sounds of steelsmiths in the distance echoed as hammers struck steel and anvils rang loudly. Scaled fingers knitted away as they interwined mithril or highly rare, imported Velium loops. Red-stained canvas tents stretched as far as the eye could see, scales glistening in the daylight. One above the rest. Sitting in a chair. &quot;Overthere... Dalnir... forces overpower...&quot; Gutteral sounds and clicks, hisses and grunts. Brutus crept ever closer to the throne... &quot;The world sssshall tremble, FEAR sssshall rule...&quot;<br>
<br>
The highest lizard had a red headdress on, with wild, brilliant colors. Yellow feathers and black paint complimented his frail but wiry body, and few gray scales shone forth. He stood from his throne, clasping a staff. &quot;Men will run and burn assss we have! Elvesss will feel the pain! Untrue trollsss of ssswamp will no longer anger Cazzzzic!&quot; The staff glowed with an erie golden light. It was as bright as the sun; and everything that it touched glowed. The glow faded, and it turned to a snake. The snake lashed out at Brutus, nearly catching his shoulder. The Iksar before the high shaman crouched low, claws spread wide, and started hissing madly. The shaman turned to Brutus; his eyes glowed with fire.<br>
<br>
The Iksar roared, and transparent spirits flew from his eyes. Spirits of dragons and griffins coiled out from behind the lizard. Wurms snaked toward him, and Shissir priests snuck out from behind him. A giant's fist came up, and down upon Brutus's head...<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAAAAAHHHH!&quot; Brutus was sitting up from his back in a start. A spear was already in his hand, and it was pointed at Tani's throat. The elf's wrist was in Brutus's hand, and he looked at both his hand and spearpoint. A bit embarassed, he dropped the spear, and stood up. &quot;Sorry...&quot; he muttered.<br>
<br>
Undeen pushed away a look of anger that seemingly flitted across his face. &quot;What did you see?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
Brutus smiled; did the man know about shamanic practices? Didn't matter. &quot;The sp'rits spoke again. This land is plagued. The Iksar high shaman is enslaving the sp'rits. 'E's got dragons 'n giants under 'is control-&quot; Brutus paused as he heard a low whistle, &quot;not to mention the Shissir.&quot; Uneed raised an eyebrow, as if asking how. &quot;Oi think the necromancers brought a few back fer their strengths. Only problem is tha' the shaman is usin the sp'rits, too... And he's enslaved nearly all the sp'rits on this continent. He's too bloody strong...&quot;<br>

War drums started in the distance, as well a the rumbling sound of distant thunder. They were starting the charge... &quot;They know we're here.
