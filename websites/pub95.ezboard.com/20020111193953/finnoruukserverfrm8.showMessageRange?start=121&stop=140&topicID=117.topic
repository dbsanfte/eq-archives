<br>
the world is made up of fear, hysteria, brainwashing, manipulation and so on.....<br>
<br>
by planting any small bit of information you can cause all sorts of stuff /rofl, how true or untrue, the subconscious plays in funny ways here too :PPP<br>
<br>
lets face it, the earth could quite do without human beings, myself included , for i dont really have any constructive criticism, and well only makes matters worse :PPP<br>
<br>
all in all, i think we will just destroy the planet and do something good for the universe, that is i hope before we move into space :PPP<br>
<br>
i like to say on escapades to life in space.....<br>
<br>
&quot;why destroy the earth of its resources and health, in vain of finding something that we dont even know exhists, when you could just make good of what we have here in our grasp.....&quot;<br>
<br>
hehehe, life could just be so simple.....the more you know, the more you want to know the more the world seems empty, the more youy hate, the more you cause pain, the more you want money, the more you strive for power, when its not power you want.......its LOVE<br>
<br>
&lt;hugs and kisses for all&gt;<br>
<br>
i am a fun poker!!!!...... /grin<br>
<br>
so like a few people have pointed out, why sit here and complain, when we know it isnt working and all we are trying too proove is our own demented realities, and maybe go out there and have an effect on others. spread the feeling of love and harmony so one day maybe the whole earth will holds hands and sing a happy song <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ))) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 574<br> <font color=#778899>(11/22/01 8:15:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> Kilamdar -- it would be nice to ignore people who have views that you feel come from a state of ignorance.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, those people are just as capable as anyone else of building nuclear weapons or flying airplanes into buildings.<br>
<br>
That's the reality.<br>
<br>
Imagine this for a second.  Imagine that you happen to know my parentage and use the correct term &quot;bastard&quot; to describe it.  Perhaps in your society, there's nothing wrong with that word, but perhaps in mine, there is.  How do you think I might react?  You would be standing there saying, &quot;But I only described the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
It doesn't save you to describe the truth, because far far FAR too many people react strictly on emotions.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to say, &quot;But we were right to do what we did,&quot; and those who hate us could sit back and say, &quot;oh, you're right, I'm sorry, I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's just so not going to happen.  If people hate you, there's probably a reason, even if the reason is based in the U.S. doing something for the greater good.<br>
<br>
If your someone who has been oppressed by the Saudi government, or whose families had a house destroyed by the Israelis, do you really think reason is going to do you any good?<br>
<br>
I know you weren't impressed with my using &quot;Three Kings&quot; as a reference, but if you were the Iraqi soldier whose family was destroyed by American bombs, do you think you're going to ever forgive the U.S., regardless of our intentions in Iraq?<br>
<br>
If you were an Iraqi who was told by Bush to &quot;rise up against Saddam Hussein, the U.S. will be there to help you,&quot; and then the U.S. *wasn't* there, and you paid the price, do you think you're going to forgive Americans?<br>
<br>
To these people, it doesn't matter whether we had choices or not, it doesn't matter why we did things.  To these people, they are hurting, and it's through American action -- or non-action -- that they are hurting.<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
Let's use an example.  Last night, we had a pretty good PoA raid.  You were awesome.  I was doing the best I could to make the raid a success.  And in the end, I made a mistake and now we get to refarm the first few islands for keys.<br>
<br>
What did I do?  I apologized.  It wasn't my intention to make that mistake.  But I made a mistake and I apologized to people for it.<br>
<br>
It's not anti-Wolfypaw to admit my mistakes.  It's just being honest and taking responsibility for them.<br>
<br>
I'm not anti-American.  I just feel that EVERYONE makes mistakes, and EVERYONE does things that sometimes don't work out well for all involved.  When it's world superpowers, there are going to be a lot of people who come out on the short end of our foreign policy.  And to deny that is irresponsible.<br>
<br>
I'm not anti-American at all, I'm just pro-responsibility.<br>
<br>
And BTW: I really want to thank you for coming last night.  You totally made the difference on the raid.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Wolfy, this is self-contradictory. One can neither fly a jet nor build a nuclear weapon in ignorance. More importantly, that you feel their views come from a state of ignorance doesn't mean that their views do indeed come from a state of ignorance. Perhaps your own are born in a state of ignorance on a particular subject, perhaps they simply have different values , or different goals. Someone who believes he's going to Heaven after he dies if he lives right is going to behave a lot differently than someone who believes that once he dies, that's it, he's wormfood. Which one is acting from ignorance?<br>
This is why I tend to be rather unpleasant in my views of the world. I gave up the need for my side to be right; it's enough that it's my side. It's like the summit; yeah, the summit is nice, and it would be great if everone cooperated with it, but Verant doesn't recognise it. And in the real world, in nature, there are no rules except that what keeps you alive and produces young is rewarded, and what interferes with this is punished, without regard to how nice a person you are or how deserving you are. Watching a lion eat the cubs of the male he defeated, watching a wasp paralyze a spider and then planting eggs on it to eat the spider alive once they hatch gives a good indication of how truly amoral the real world is.<br>
So we humans, capable of thought, work out philosophies to minimize this horror for our kind. Summits that work great until someone decides that there's more profit to be made by violating it, and realises that there really are no rules. By nature's rules, to paraphrase TD, the US could be *far far* worse to the other peoples of the world than we have been (hell, as of 1945, we could have *ruled* the world.) <br>
Here's a rabbit, a nice fluffy rabbit. Here's me, out in the woods. I'm an omnivore, and by evolutionary events beyond my control, I require meat (eating meat, btw, is one of the things that puts us above the other apes, but I digress.) The rabbit has a right to life, and will surely think I'm a no good s.o.b for killing it. I have a right to life, and will surely think that rabbit a no good s.o.b. for eluding me. But our relative rights are actually established by my ability to kill and its ability to evade. Other rabbits watching will hate me for killing Mr. Bun Bun. Other humans watching will hate the damn rabbit for evading me; both basing their conclusions on their own positions in the world. So too among nations there will be those for whom you can do no right, and for whom you can do no wrong. Trying to do 'right' by people who do not share your views of right and wrong will almost always be viewed as bad and received poorly. By the same token, trying to do 'wrong' by people who do not share your views of right and wrong will *not necessarily* always be viewed as bad. <br>
From all this (and more) I've simply concluded that it's best to concentrate about what's best for me and mine, and assume others are doing the same. It's not friendly, maybe, but at least the battle lines are a lot clearer. And when I do something for someone else, there's no false egotism involved.<br>

I can point out many things I saw wrong that a cheap movie military consultant would have been able to point out.  Here are just a few: <br>
<br>
Wrong rank was used in at least one instance.<br>
<br>
They used sewed on rank and such on the desert uniforms.  That was just authorized this year to sew everything on.<br>
<br>
The flak vest stopped a bullet.  That vest is mostly to weigh you down and for show.  It will not stop a direct hit.  It will deflect a glancing blow of flak.  There are vests out there that are much better than what we use, but I think that many would get upset if we tried to outfit everyone with them because they cost so darn much more than what we use now.  It's a two edged sword.  People want no deaths during battle but they get upset when money is spent to protect us. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

<br>
Then of course, an event in a movie cant be claimed to tell 'the truth' about something, as its only a movie (which in general tends to have faults and errors), but it might be easier to explain with referencing to a common movie that has good spread around the world. With a good explanation with one is trying to say, and then referencing to a movie in order to make what one is trying to say more clear is a good thing if it makes it easier for people to understand.<br>
<br>
But again, of course its not a good source for absolute information &quot;Hey there is sound in space! There is in starwars damnit, so there must be sound in space!&quot; =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#778899>(11/25/01 9:51:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> A problem with using this movie as an example is that the movie was made to entertain.  It was made to sell tickets and make some people money.  It wasn't made to give any truths.  Heck, in order for a movie to be based on an actual event doesn't take much.  We'll use this movie as an example of what I mean.  Let's say there really was a plot by some soldiers to steal that gold.  That's all a movie needs to be based on an actual event.  Just that one line, while everything else can be made up out of nothing.  <br>
<br>
The truth is as others have said, there are some things that are done as the lesser of two evils and that no matter what choice you make you are the bad guys.  You just have to do what is best for your country while stepping on as few toes as possible.  A more recent example is East Timor.  By what some are saying here, Australia deserves to be terrorized and have many of it's civilians killed because of what that country did in East Timor and that nobody should feel sorry for them if it happens because they deserved it.  Bin Laden has even named Australia as a target because of what they did there.  I'll give you the basics of what happened in East Timor in case you don't know already, and you can find the details easily enough on the web.  What happened is that Indonesia took over East Timor after another country gave them indepenence.  After years of killings because they wanted to be indepenent again, Australia was the main country to step in and help them gain their independence.   <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>
