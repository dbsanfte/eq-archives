I know my job in a group and my abilities pretty well. My younger brother Madrim knows basically what he can and is expected to do. What he doesn't know, he'll learn. As will I, as I gain in experience and ability.<br>
Now to what I'm wondering. What is it the rest of you do that aren't druids. I have a pretty good idea, but there are certain skills I hear about that I don't see used when I'm grouped with members of other classes. There are some used that I don't understand (in game mechanics. Sneak for example. What exactly does it do?) <br>
As raidmaster, I feel that this info might help me to better plan raids. I have a good idea what monks, SK's, rangers and warriors can do, and what their expected role should be. Wizards, I'm pretty sure of as well. An enchanter's role is self-explanatory if you've grouped with one? Er... a cleric's role is obvious, but they may have stuff beyond what I can see in a group. As may the other classes I've mentioned. I have no idea what a rogue should do, other than backstab. What does and can a bard do? Paladins do what? They're decent tanks, but I'd prefer a warrior -as a healer- any day. Although a high-level pally can be almost as good as a cleric sometimes, hehe.<br>
I have limited experience grouping with diverse classes. I can count the times on one hand I've grouped with bards and rogues. I've grouped with a Shaman once. What is it that you guys do?<br>
Any info would be greatly appreciated. If ya don't feel comfortable, or can't post here, then send a bard to <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: stygyanreaver@hotmail.com"> stygyanreaver@hotmail.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--> .<br>

My rogue most often uses it when a ranger or druid would use camo...  i.e. - to get past the orc camp in HP (when they could beat you down) without pulling them all. A rogue must also frequently use the sneak hide combo to use merchants as most have a problem buying and selling from Rogues...  Also, there are alot of bankers who are not KoS to anyone, the problem is getting past the guards to get to the banker...  Kelwin has snuck past guards who were KoS to get to a banker before...<br>
<br>
Bards - tank / buffer...  a bard can tank like a ranger, but their songs can be used during battle as well as buffers.  there are songs for healing, songs that work like breeze (commonly known as &quot;the mana song&quot; but which has a better name) as well as songs that make you stronger and faster and more.<br>
<br>
Pally's - tank / healer...  a pally's most valuable asset is the capability to perform a single full heal in an instant, no delay for casting and no mana...  they can taunt off the warrior and when they get beat down, fix it fast or even save the main tank from certain death when the cleric says oom...  it does have a 72 minute refresh time delay before it can be done again...<br>
<br>
Shaman - buffers / debuffers...  a shaman has excellent buff spells for the group members and debuffers for the target...  they can tank in a pinch and heal in a pinch as well...<br>
<br>
A rogue, though not a true tank can fill in if needed.  basically though (when skill gets high enough, they are damage doers like wizzies but at close range) A BS can do up to 1000 damage at higher levels and the poisons that can be applied to the weapons work like DoTs so a BS with poison can do upwards of 1200 HPs of damage at higher levels...   they also have a better sneak ability than the other classes which is very useful in corpse recovery if a battle went bad...<br>

The Paladin has 2 lives, one he/she was born with and one his God has given him to do with as he/she see fit. Be it for him/her self of for another. The LoH is a gift of last resort only because of it's long recast time and in my experiences of being a Paladin should only be used on myself (if soloing and in some cases if I'm the main tank and or group makeup) or the Cleric/Shaman.<br>
<br>
<br>
With that being said, and remember this is my experiences only... The Paladin, in post lvl 30 play, should never be the main tank. The paladin is to assist the main tank and deal as much damage as he can without gaining the aggro off the main. That means the Paladin should never taunt when assisting the main. When a MOB aggros on to a caster, especially the Cleric or Shaman, it is the Paladins job, not the main tanks, to taunt the MOB off the caster long enough for it to be rooted, snared, mezzed, or taken back by the main tank. Belive it or not, but the Paladin IS a very effective taunter! As for the Paladins healing abilities, as weak as they may be, is best used between pulls, not during the battle, so as to let the Cleric/Shaman medd up for the next fight. The Paladins shining moment comes when fighting the undead!!! Unfortunately, that still wasn't enough to keep me playing one . <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>6</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubagumntagum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bagumntagum</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: I need a couple of questions answered</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 10/17/01 12:00:04 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Well not to disagree with you Kel, but more of a clarification on what you listed. First off, just because you melee does not make you a tank. There is only 1 true tank in the game and that is a Warrior. A Warrior gets the best bonuses to defense and can take the beating the longest, and that is what a true tank is. As you have noted Fae (I think it was you that posted about the healing in the Raid section? or was it Cen?) that when Bel was tanking, he seemed to take much less damage then when a Ranger got the agro switched to him. This is what makes a tank a tank. Not the ability to do damage, as everyone knows that monks do the most damage output in the game over time, but are not considered tanks (though because they are the best pullers usually at least have the starting agro on them, so they can defend themselves but still not like a warrior). 2nd to the Warrior is Shadow Knight's and Pally's. These 2 classes are equal in that regard as one is not better then the other in tanking, but in a pinch can take over for a warrior and still live longer then any other class. That is it for tanks. All other melee based classes are not tanks. That isn't to say that they can't do their fair share of damage, but again damage delivered to an NPC is not what makes a tank a tank. This does have one exception and that is level. For example in Sol A I was in a group with Vear, Serthi, and Can. A level 47 Monk, 35 Warr, and a 33 Warr. Now if we were all the same level then the tanking rights would be 1st and 2nd the 2 Warriors, then me and then Vear, though Vear as main puller would have to hold his own till the Warriors could taunt the pull off him. But since we were not the same level, Vear was actually the main tank, then Serthi, then Can, and finally me. The 12 level difference between them changes the rules, but this was a specific instance. Also this would lead to a quick explanation of taunting. First and foremost when in a group, there should only be one person taunting. If the puller is a monk then he should only get the MoB mad enough at them just to pull. Once pulled back to the group, the only person that should be taunting is the primary tank. If the puller is taking major damage and fading fast, then secondary tank and if there is a 3rd, should all taunt just to get agro off the puller, but that is the only time they should taunt unless of course the main tank is just taking too much damage and the healer is oom. The reason is so that the MoB never changes direction, this is very important as you will see as you keep reading.<br>
<br>
Now this being said, that does not mean that having all of the other melee classes in your group is worthless. As I said, a tank is not defined as anyone who is melee, but as someone who can take the beating the longest. But the other melee based characters have a major bonus to attack strength. A ranger with 2 good weapons, double attack, and kick has a chance of doing 5 hit's per round! Use this to the groups advantage, as where can you do the most damage and land the most hit's to a MoB? From the back. When you are hitting the MoB from the back, you get an attack bonus and land more hits more often. If you get the agro and tank (now your hitting the MoB from the front) then you can't do as much damage plain and simple. Let's use as an example a 6 person group consisting of 1 Monk (puller), 1 Warrior (main tank), 1 Rogue, 1 Wizard, 1 Ranger, and 1 Cleric. Here is how the pull should go. First the Monk FD pulls so that only 1 MoB is following them. Once back to the group, the Warrior should have already targeted the Monks pull, and everyone should Assist the Warrior (not the Monk, if they pulled more then one MoB, this is very important so that you do not split the agro, as usually the Warrior will taunt the ADD mob first so that it doesn't go off an attack the Wizzy or Cleric). Once everyone is assisting the Warrior, if the Warrior doesn't get the agro soon enough, the Monk can FD to wipe all agro and the Warrior should pick it up and take over. While all this is happening, the Rogue and Ranger are moving to the opposite side of the Warrior to get to the back of the MoB, and actually should not be hitting while doing this so that Warrior is sure to have the most agro. Once they are behind the MoB, that's when the fun begins, because now the damage starts to happen. At this point now that all the Melee have engaged, then Wizzy is free to let fly and nuke as the hate list has a few people ahead of them (don't go crazy cause the DD spells do more damage quicker then melee does, but I don't have to tell a Wizzy that). Of course the Cleric should heal as needed through out this entire process, however, make sure that you do not heal the Monk too soon as that could change agro over to you rather then the Warrior and that is the quickest way to make a bad pull even worse. It's better to have the puller die (sorry Monk) then the entire group. This is just one type of group, and having an enchanter in the mix changes everything (and is a completely different looooong post in itself).<br>
<br>
Okay, so where do SK's and Pallys fall into the mix? Well first you should know what they are. A Shadow Knight is a mix of a Warrior (hence why they are tanks as well) and Necromancers. This makes for an interesting mix, first they do have the ability to somewhat heal themselves (through life taps) and they don't have to target themselves to do this, plus the NPC takes damage at the same time as a life tap takes health from the NPC and gives it to the Shadow Knight. Besides this, they have some nasty DoT's including one that can snare (though to a lesser degree then the actual snare spell). Put all this together combined with taunting and truthfully no one can out taunt an SK not even a Warrior because all of the SK's spells add agro. This doesn't mean that an SK should tank over a Warrior, however, if an ADD jumps on your Wizzy or Cleric, if you have an SK in the group he should be the first and only one to break away from the main pull to go help the Wizzy or Cleric (or healer in general) and all others should remain on the main pull. Oh yeah... note to wizzy's and clerics... DON'T RUN... we have to cast spells and use the taunt skill to get them off you within 1 Round (yes I can get them off you in 1 Round <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Taunt has a very short range and won't work if we aren't right next to the mob, however, if we run then we can't cast spells. So if you run, you die... stand still and only lose 2-3 bubbles of health at maximum. Also, don't heal others or attack the MoB... that only makes them madder at you and makes it harder for us to taunt them off you. As for the Pally, they are a mix of Warrior (again... tank) and Clerics. So yes, then can heal, does that mean that they should? No. They should be the very last choice for heals (other then their Lay Hands Complete Heal which if a pull is going sour, should be used to save the main tank so that things can have a chance of changing for the better). Why if they are part Cleric do I say they shouldn't heal? Simple, they are Warriors first. If the Cleric, Druid, or Shaman (whoever is main healer, and in some cases Secondary healer) are oom, and there is a Ranger in the group... the Ranger should break away from the fight and heal. Do the rangers have as good of a heal as the Pally's? Well no... but if the Main tank dies, and the Ranger is still fighting while the Pally is healing, then guess who is going to tank now. If the pull went so bad that the Main tank died, do you really think the Ranger has a chance of living that long? If the Main tank dies and the Pally gets the agro, the Ranger has a much better chance of keeping the Pally alive long enough to kill the MoB, and even let the main healer med up a bit so that the Ranger can jump back in. Besides this the pally can heal himself as well to help the Ranger, where as if the Ranger was tanking the combined heal's of the pally and the Ranger would be less then the damage the Ranger would be taking. And yes Pallys and SK's are exactly the same when it comes to tanking, so if you have a cleric and a necro in the group but no Warrior, then flip a coin as to who is main and who is secondary tank.<br>
<br>
Shamans are a totally different kind of class, and I think one of our Shamans could describe themselves better then I can as I have yet to play a Shaman. Though to put it simply, they are great buffers, and can be main healers as well, and can even replenish their mana quicker by converting health to mana and this is when a pally comes in handy, as they can spend their mana on healing the Shaman while the Shaman converts it to mana. I did this with Gumil in Sol A when he was oom after a long fight.. even though I don't have a heal I can take my health and give it to others. It was a small help, but still a help. They also have nice DoT's and Debuffs (like Kel said) and can really round out a group quite nicely.<br>
<br>
As for Rogues, well Blackpoint can really say it better, and if you read what she wrote in the Newbie section on Rogues, you will really understand Rogues better. And to quote her &quot;A rogue isn't a tank. Repeat, you are not a tank.  It is really hard to solo as a rogue because of your low HP’s.  Stamina boosts are important but a rogue wasn't designed to take a beating.  We can deal the greatest amount of damage in a span of 8 seconds (4 attacks + Riposte + Backstab) but we can't take a lot of punishment.&quot; This is just a small part of what a rogue is, but explains a lot. Check out what else she says as it is very well written.<br>
<br>
And bards, well these are the most interesting classes in Norrath. They have the ability to do damage like a wizard, DoT like a Shaman, Heal like a Cleric, recharge mana like an Enchanter, and fight like a Ranger. Now this is not to say that they can replace any of these other classes as they can only do all this at a much lesser degree. Also notice that I didn't say Warrior, that's because they take damage like a ranger. Worse yet, they don't get double attack, so they can't even deal as much damage out. To make matters worse, most of their spells are group based, so healing 6 players builds up much more agro then healing one even though the heal is much weaker then even a Rangers heal. A bard can &quot;spin&quot; songs which means they sing up to 3 (though I've heard of really experienced bards sing 4 at a time) songs at a time doing damage, healing, and giving strength to the group (an example, as there are many combo's). This will create a great deal of agro, as during this the bard can attack the MoB with a weapon while they do this. Unlike magic, a bard can sing and attack almost at the same time (almost because if you start your song while you are supposed to attack, you will miss the round). This is not to say that bards are not good in groups, it's just that if you don't understand how to play a bard, you will die... a lot. In fact there is much much much more to a bard, and a well played bard can be invaluable to a group, especially as an get out of trouble free card giving instant SoW (well Selo's Accelerando) to everyone in the group, provided you remain near the bard you can all outrun the MoB(s) to safety.<br>
<br>
Now considering I have just written a novel (see what happens when you take a few days off from posting) I will stop here. If you've actually read through this long post then feel free to tell me I'm wrong as this is mostly my opinion from playing these different classes and grouping with them.<br>

In a group, my first question is who is the main healer. At my age, I am still sometimes expected to be the main healer. Next question, if I'm the healer is who's the main tank and who's pulling. When I discover who the main tank is, I ask if there is a mage for damage shields. If not, I'll cast them.<br>
If I'm not the healer, then what? Am I the evac guy? I haven't been called on to do this yet, so if ya end up with me in a situation where we need one, be patient. I've done it twice, more importantly, I know how, but on the other side of the screen, I'm human. Practice will make perfect, just hopefully not dead, hehe.<br>
No evac likely to be needed? I'll throw damage shields barring the presence of a mage who has better. I'll ensnare. When I'm the healer, I leave this to rangers or sk's or necs, but I have the best snare out of all the classes. Next, I'll dot. I've got a couple mean ones that are stackable with most others. I understand that they pale in comparison to a nec/shaman dot, but they're stackable, so why not? <br>
I rarely nuke as ofttimes I have the role of backup healer. If a nuke will make a mob run, I'll throw one. Otherwise, I'll save my mana for a heal in case the main healer is OoM.<br>
I can be the puller. I really don't like to do this because it really really really really really pisses mobs off. I'll do it with a bad-azz tank, though, no problem.<br>
My buffs are decent. Chanters, clerics and shamen can all out-buff me, though. My buffs do stack well with most others I've seen, with the exception of the holy armor line, which my skin line will not stack with. My strength line of buffs seems to be stackable with shamen strength line, so as a buffing team, I think a shamen and druid would work well together. I may be wrong, though, as I have very rarely grouped or worked with a shaman.<br>
I'm probably missing something, as I always seem to have a different role, but like Bagum, did I just write a novel?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback guys. Please feel free to add -one and all- anything you can think of. Your help is greatly appreciated.<br>

When most people group they tend to think how can they help damage the MoB, but what they don't think about is that by healing everyone and pretty much taking away the possibility of getting killed that you can really do the most damage. When a tank (or anyone) gets low on health, the MoB is almost impossible to taunt off of that person because the MoB knows it's going to kill you and wants to see it through no matter what. Even worse, when you are low on health you lose your defensive skills and tend to get hit more and for more damage (your agility drops way down). This takes away from the damage being done, and makes everyone act differently trying to keep people alive rather then just concentrating on killing. By keeping everyone healthy they are always fresh and can kill rather quickly pretty much any pull... even a bad one. That was what happened one day when I grouped with an experienced Cleric and Druid, they virtually did tag team healing. Rather then wait for the Cleric to be oom and then have to pretty much count on the Druid to take over, they would each share the heals first the cleric, then the druid, back to the cleric, and then the druid again... and so on. This was very effective especially since after each pull rather then having the Cleric have to completely med up, the druid and cleric were no less then half mana at all times, so if we had an add there was still plenty of mana left to keep the healing going. Best part was we had a chanter with Clarity which made it one of the best groups I've ever been in. Combined with a Monk that was a master of FD pulling (he could split 1 out of 100 MoB's and just pull them one at a time all day) a Wizzy and me (I was actually main tank that time) it was a great group.<br>

Although, if this does happen and I am able, I will kite the remaining around, as Tinithiel has seen in the Frontier Mountains.  Also, as mentioned above, a ranger is not a tank.  The only time we tank is if there is nobody else available.  It is actually rather easy to have a ranger pull and get the aggro onto the tank before the ranger even gets hit.  Once the aggro is on the tank, then I will move behind the mob and do as much damage as I can with my possible five attacks.  Other than that, the rangers most important job, similar to paladins, is to get the aggro of the casters when it goes their way.  Most tanks will often not know this and try to do it themselves, but rangers can taunt, as Salian said, &quot;Second to none&quot;.  It is basically our responsibility to keep the casters alive by using our taunting ability. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>35</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cendarienthistletongue>Cendarien Thistletongue</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: I need a couple of questions answered</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 10/17/01 6:28:50 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Agree with Valendor here. Rangers can, if they will it, out-taunt other tanks. Mobs have this weird hatred of the lowly and feeble spell, flame lick. This spell hasn't left my spell gem slots since i got it. Just my 2 copper there. But should we taunt? Not if there is a fighter, no. BUT! There are many times when the fighter just can't taunt for shyt and I end up stepping in to take over, especially when the mobs are hitting my rogue-ish wifey or a magic user. <br>
<br>
About this &quot;attack bonus to the back&quot; stuff... Can someone show me where this comes from as to give it more credibility. At this point I am wondering if it is an old wives tale. Maybe. Where is it documented etc, or what is the origin of this?<br>
<br>
Lastly, here is my big beef with tanks i group with. SIT AND HEAL between pulls and use freaking bandages. This goes for hybrid healers as well, standing around when you could be medding for heals, YES HEALS. You know that 1/2 bubble of damage everyone seems to have after a fight? Give the main healer a break. I mean... some of these guys dont even use their own heals to cure themselves when the cleric is OOM! I can't count the amount of times I've survived a battle with 30 hit points. Healing yourself to full HP can save your butt along with your friends. Yeah, I get lazy a lot of times too, I won't lie *grins*. This is just a pet peeve, really.<br>

Take this quote from Allakhazam for instance &quot;Also, remember that you can do more damage to the rear of a monster.&quot; This if from his Newbie Info on Combat and is in the paragraph marked f. I have seen it on a number of pages, and I'm assuming that someone actually did tests to see if this was true or not. Though the best way to tell would be to dual someone and start off hitting from the front, without them fighting back. Take them down a few bubbles and calculate the amount of misses with the amount of hit's and take a look at average damage per hit, and average damage per swings (include the misses here). Now heal them up to full health and have them turn their backs on you. Do the same thing and calculate the same equations. It would be best if you had a warrior against warrior of equal level. You could also see how many more of less Critical Hits are scored on each side as well. That would be the only real way, other then hearing it from VI themselves.<br>

<br>
when I say tank, I mean what role <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> can</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you fill.  A ranger is half Warrior, half Druid in that order.  Though we can not take nearly as much damage as a pure warrior, we are still melee first...<br>
<br>
I would much rather have a Warrior, Pally, SK in the tank position, but I can tank if needed though it does put a strain on the healer...<br>
<br>
I have had to, at times, kite the mob in circles around the cleric until there was enough mana to heal me...<br>
<br>
When I say tank, I mean melee...   My rogue is no tank as any rogue knows, but in a group of casters, the rogue would be the tank...<br>
<br>
All role responsibilities are group dependant... <p><p><font size="5" color="#006600">Kelwin Jumala</font><br>

Snare is the best taunt I have. Of course I have no actual taunt skill like meleers, but watch me ensnare a mob too soon and get whacked for it. If I'm dotting, my flame-based dot will not allow a ranger's spell to land. I expect, however, when rangers are grouped with me and I'm healing, for them to snare the mobs. Usually, a person would snare the mob being attacked so it doesn't run when low on health. In a multi-mob fight where one mob peels off onto the healer or a caster, however, snare along with taunt IMHO would be a better taunt than the minor immolate spell rangers are blessed with.<br>
<br>
I've done the team heal thing before too. It's very cool, but most full groups seem to want me damaging and snaring when a cleric is present. It allows for chain-pulling if a chanter is in the group along with a strong tank (meaning not much healing needed anyway.) As a three-man crew, though that works great.<br>
I'm babbling, time to play. I got my bracer of hammerfall today, wanna go hand some hammers to the monks, hehe.<br>

I still have it in my top gem slot now and it will remain there through level 60. That with a successful taunt = instant agro which is almost unbreakable. Add to it a good double attack of over 100 points of damage, and just try to get that MoB off me.

<br>
The short answer -- but this would vary depending on the sham's level -- for the typical camp type group, our role is:<br>
<br>
slow mobs<br>
sow the puller (everybody if the camp is risky)<br>
haste the tanks (lacking enchanter)<br>
buff tank HPs  (lacking cleric)<br>
buff tank AC    (  &quot;       &quot;     )<br>
buff tank stamina and agi <br>
buff other stats if requested<br>
cast heals and regen <br>
dot (if not a short fight)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To ramble:<br>
<br>
<br>
You know that one about 'jack-of-all-trades master of none'... that's us, the shamen.  To be even more vauge, our role changes a lot depending on what's on the hunt menu, how fast the group is killing things and what classes are in the group.  And the role of the Shaman also changes as he gets older and has access to new types of spells Upto about level 20 we'll often mix it up in melee, tossing in a dot or two and a heal where needed.  Between 20 and 30ish we go though a bit of a lull, yet to have a our haste spells or our pet, and having weak slows.  We're no longer meleeing but our contribution to groups and ability to solo is a bit weaker that at our other levels.  As soon as we get regen and cannibalize, you'll often find us doing the canni dance, swaping hit points for mana and then regening up.  After about level 35 get their first pet and strong slows and we start come into our own.   <br>
<br>
Probably our most useful and class defining role, especially after our early levels and with mobs that have a lot of HP, is to slow mobs.  A slow mob means that tanks take less damage and live longer, healers have more mana, and the group will need less down time.  <br>
<br>
That said, it's not always worthwhile to slow things.  With low HP mobs, where no fight lasts more than a few rounds, or if you're rooting and dotting things to death, the mana is better spent elsewhere.  <br>
<br>
Aside from slow, we have two other debuffers: the malise series which lowers magic resistances and another spell line that lowers a mob's attack rating.  I hear malise sees a lot of action on raids and such, when it gets harder to make your spells stick, but the attack debuffs don't often get used in my experience.<br>
<br>
Buffs.  Slowing and buffing are what we're know for.  <br>
<br>
The best stat buffs we have are stamina and agility.  The stam buff adds HP and agi will add a few points of AC.  The agi isn't a major AC increase, so depending on how much mana is being spent elsewhere, it might not be worthwhile.  Some shaman also routinely buff str for tanks.  Extra str helps lets you carry more weight without it effecting your AC or running speed and it can add to your max possible damage (if you're already at the damage cap for your weapon at your level it won't).  <br>
<br>
Dex and Charisma see less action.  Dex increases the proc rate on proc'ing weapons and can help a bard miss less notes.  It also very slightly increases the rate at which you'll get weapon skill increases.  Charisma gets you a slightly better deal with vendors, and again helps bards play their songs.  Enchanters benifit from char, but they have their own buff for it, which, depending on their level, might be better.  <br>
<br>
Overall stat buffs don't make <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> much difference.  They likely won't make an encounter doable if it wasn't before.  They do look good tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Aside from the stat buffs, we have a series of HP, AC and haste buffs.  These are pretty high up on our to-do list, but clerics HP and AC buffs are better (as often are an int caster's self-only buffs) and enchanters have a better haste, so if they're in the group those roles will be theirs.  The haste buffs don't last as long as others buffs so if there are serval tanks to haste this can take a lot of shaman's mana.<br>
<br>
Rounding out the buffage are the resistance buffs, which  come out when fighting casting mobs.<br>
<br>
Besides the buffing and debuffing the other spells we'll likely use are healing and regen, nukes and dots, and root.  Root will do in a pinch for crowd control if you don't have an enchanter.  Our dots are pretty good and when soloing and at the earlier levels we use them a lot.  Our healing becomes less effective the higher we level, but it's not until the real high level game that they become almost worthless.<br>
<br>
Finally, there are the utility spells: shrink, sow, levitate, ultravision, see invis, bind, etc.<br>
<br>
Buffer/de-buffer, sow'er, kinda healer, root ghetto-mez'er, dotter and nuker... and Stuff (tm), that's us, shamen.  <br>

What are your abilities as your character. Great discussion on tanking and aggro and such. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I jumped into it.<br>
Original thought was I wanna know a little about how I can use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in a raid or even a group. I don't know you all. Some I've known for a long time, but grouping and knowing are two different things in this family Thanks to the raid on SolA and some groups in family since, I know some of you better in a combat sense, but... I guess as a druid, I may never group in a raid with a lot of you, and I need to know a little bit about how it is you view <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> your</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> character's role in order to group us well on raids.<br>
~wonders. Sorta hopes. What has he started this time? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
