The phat beats rolled on and on and on, infecting her very being. Suddenly no one was around. All that stood in her mind was the pulsing aura of the music, she could see it. Strands of blue, violet, and electric red danced around her body, hugging her curves and caressing her fair skin. Her mind was swimming though not a single thought dare break the serenity found in the remix. The sound quieted, the beat died down and the strands wore thin, she could barely feel their vibrations... The only thing heard was the mechanical dashes that sung quietly from Dj Irene's speakers. An explosion. The beat returned and the ropes of static hues shot directly through her body and pumped her heat in unison with that glorious drum. Her eyes snap open and a wide smile plays on her carnation pink lips. She could still see the colors... they moved her. Glow sticks stuck between her fingers she began turning and hopping with the beat, her hands dancing around together as if no bones existed in her arms. It was a sublime feeling - liquid. Movement with song without thought. A few E-tards in the corner perked up when they saw her glow sticks' light trail off behind her hands. A crimson vine weaved its way down her arm and guided her left hand in the motions; a violet took hold of her right and the blue the rest of her body. She was lost in the magic. bum bum bum bum bum-bum bum bum-bum bum-bum-bum bum bum-bum bum bum-bum bum bum-bum-bum... the beat changed smoothly. With a heavy sigh, she let the colors fade and her arms drop. Hundreds of people seemed to rush up on her that weren't there before. They were dancing much as she had been, but had there been so many? Groaning as the Dj pumped out h2bh tunes she sauntered off to the bar. Thank gods she was small, it made pushing through all the drugged up junkies easier. Bouncing on one of the many red and glow poka-dot plastic seats at the glittering bar she leans over with a big smile. She waited and looked at the older bar tender who had his head down mixing something for some bimbo with a fake I.D. FINALLY! He looked over and set eyes on her. Her short hair was up in it's normal pigtail do, and her clothes were as they always were. Big pants, tight shirt, lots of bright/glow/clear rainbow beaded bracelets half way to her elbow. Her eyes were a blinding hot pink tonight - glow in the dark no less. Her jet-black hair was streaked the same color. Two glow sticks lay lazily in her hand and two more dangled from shoestrings tied to one of her belt loops and tapped against her thigh. Young she was, but how young? She could have been anywhere from 14 to 18, you never can tell with those Kyds... <br>
<br>
&quot;Haaay Pops!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well aren't you lookin cute tonight? How's my little Miss Lite this evening?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehe, I'm fine. Hay! You seen Brite or Shadow lately?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nah, haven't been around yet. I'm sure they'll get thirsty soon though, honey, and when they do you know they'll come to me.&quot; He smiled sweetly at her; it reminded her of the smile her father used to give her. &quot;Can I get ya somethin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea! Shirley Temple?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Comin right up, Doll face&quot;<br>
<br>
She couldn't help but giggle. He was so nice... Spinning around she scans the crowd. Lite Brite, or Brite as known to most, was the closest thing (besides Pops) that she had to family, but they weren't anywhere in sight... Shadow, well Shadow was her counter part. They went to their first party together and the first song they doubled to was where they got their names. Sighing heavily she turns to the side. A man. Eyeing him up and down she noticed the dark attire... definitely not someone who'd want to talk to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here ya go sweet-cheeks, enjoy!&quot; She flashed a smile to Pops and then noticed the shady stranger staring at her. His eyes scanned her from head to foot. Chuckling and smiling nervously, she sticks out her hand as she sips her drink. <br>
<br>
&quot;eh-heh... M-my name's Moonlite. I... haven't seen you around here... You new?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dear god... where was Brite and Shadow??<br>

It was at that moment that the world came spinning back. He was no longer in the land of pure melody, and wasn't dancing on top of keyboards and note bars and the like. He didn't feel as if he was inside the bass drums. Instead, the light started blending his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Someone started to breakdance on the floor, and he stared at the kid puttin down some fancy moves. The blinking luminous beams seemed to reflect off of this guy at certain intervals, creating a sort of slide show. He grinned, and shook his black braided hair. The glowsticks were still going, and the beats were slowing down. So was the breakdancer... wait... wait... wait... GO! Just as the breakdancer left the floor, he leapt out with a onehanded cartwheel, and grabbed his right foot before ending, freezing in position.<br>
<br>
Bring the legs down... swirl, switch up, swirl, hand change, toe tappin toe tappin, make a P, stand, circle, head spinnin..... OUCH! get a hat next time... flip up, backflip out... the sea of people enveloped him. To every side was another body, touching, moving, bumping, grinding, melodizing like him. They didn't exist. Only the red beam that penetrated the blacklight every .7 seconds did, and the rythm, the rythm... &quot;Tha rythm, tha rythm!!&quot;  Popping his black pacifier into his mouth, he made his way back to Pops. Time now for a cooooool drink.<br>
<br>
Shadow's entry to the bar scene was cut short, however. The light-deprived area seemed to attract some other hooligan tryin to steal his name or something... but he didn't have the holographic black reflecty shirt! MWAHAHA- was that Lite? His attitude turned serious. Who's the guy? Okay, time for some undercover. Lite knew the drill.<br>
<br>
He walked up to the bar with a solemn look on his face. Black eyes stared up pleadingly at Pops, and he wiped his right temple, and flicked his eyes towards Lite. He gave Pops a short nod, and the friendly bartender gave a toothy grin. &quot;Hi stranger,&quot; he started off. &quot;Can I interest you in, I dunno, a Zombie?&quot; Lite glanced back, and gave a small, knowing smile that she replaced quickly. He always got Zombies, and stranger was a giveaway to let him be unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Shadow looked to perk right up. &quot;Hey, that'd be great, old man. Shove it out.&quot; He paid for a drink for the first time in.... well, a really really long time. He fingered the holes in the chainmail straps rising from the Kandy at his wrists to the blinking collar. Time for some eavesdropping... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 1:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A lite for your dark</span><hr size=1> &quot; moonlight&quot;   he smirked  lowering his shades..his eyes were normal..if you could forget his red [ well the outside of the eye...where color is..]<br>

The stranger’s invitation to dance brought a smile back to her lips.<br>
<br>
“I’d love to dance! …Only I don’t know how. Born with two left feet.” Clicking her heels together she giggles. Now that she knew where Shadow was… where was Brite? <br>
<br>
“So you new here?” Lite looked at Nightkat from over the top of her glass. Damn she was thirsty. Closing her eyes she let her head tip back and the rest of the drink slide down her throat. “Aaah! Heh-heh” Slamming the glass down on the bar, she leans her shoulder back towards Shadow, boy wasn’t about to forget she was there just yet… Nightkat was thinking about his answer… he was going to lie for sure. Most people didn’t like saying where they were from, no biggie, but Lite never understood why someone should be ashamed of their hometown. Pulling a pink highlighter from her pocket, she jots down something on the napkin that sat in front of her. Without looking behind her, she scoots the note down to Shadow. “SP2M  pass L.B. &lt;kissy face&gt; CP”. No one else could have possibly known what she was trying to say… unless they were Shadow or Brite. At a single glance he knew what it meant. ‘Meet at the spot at 2am, tell Lite Brite. Kisses – you’re counter part’. Such a sly little one she tried to be. The stranger never answered her he was distracted… Something behind him to the right was holding his attention. Lite leaned over and tried to see what it was, maybe that group of rambunctious K-whores… This was her chance to slip away. Spinning around her in her chair she caught Shadow off guard. Sliding from the sticky seat she leans against him - only centimeters away. Grinning mischievously she puts her lips right where his pacifier now sat once more. Of course, the binky was quickly dropped and forced the beads to jangle as it hit his chest. Giggling childishly Lite bites the pacifier and then rubs noses with Shadow.<br>
<br>
“ethkimo kithes!” <br>
<br>
Oh, how she loved to be mean. With two quick pokes to the side, delivered by the one and only shadish Shadow, she released the binky and all but fell on top of him. <br>
<br>
“Fine! Keep it then!”<br>
<br>
Trying her hardest to keep from smiling, Lite spins around and sits back on her seat facing Nightkat yet again. He was still slightly taken with whatever he had been looking at… But she wasn’t going to smile, oh no. Pressing her lips together, she glances to the side at the mirrors behind the bar and caught sight of Shadow. Her head jerked back to Nightkat. Just thinking of keeping a straight face made her want to giggle more. Crossing her arms under her chest she turns her nose up in the air and closes her eyes. Time to snub the CP. Time to see what cute reaction he would have this time... hehe.<br>
<br>
~*(o.O someone can jump in and play Brite. guy/girl young/old, you deside. Obviously Brite is another kyd &lt;:P duh&gt; and they're Lite's 'family', or at least she seems them as that.

The words money doesn't matter kept floating in his mind, keep yourself safe, don't get hurt, stop the madness, why are you so angry. All of those things were floating around his mind as he stood watching his opponent float around the ring. Everything that was happening was going to happen his way, he would win, he would kill, he would fight to keep his sanity. Everything had a price, and this was his. The horrible price he had to pay to protect those that he loved, why did he stand up with it all, why didn’t he just fall into suit and join in with the others to kill and destroy. It would be east for him to do. To just destroy, but he would have to start with his sister and kill her in her sleep. No that was no solution, never was, never would be, that was why he was fighting.<br>
<br>
All of these thoughts floated around his mind and he waited for the fight to start, all those things disappeard when he was kicked in the head, all of them gone all that was left was the instinct to kill. Kill. Kill.<br>
<br>
Blood, so much damn blood, why hadn’t he finished the fight when he had the chance? Why did he try to make things fancy, he had gotten a blow to his ego this night, but still held strong onto the win that helped him stand up. <br>

She knew she looked like a buffoon. And Shadow! He must of have been dieing of a seizure from laughing at her so hard. Not her fault she couldn't dance like he could... Masking her discomfort in laughter, she continues to dance with the dark one. Her eyes pleaded with Shadow from a distance. Couldn't he just come and butt in? Say he wanted to dance? A scolding glance was shot his way, and was returned with a sterner one. Was that a hint of jealousy she caught in his eyes? Hm, looks like the green-eyed monster had nibbled on Shadow just a little. Letting him leave her attention, Lite continues her sad attempt at being decent at grinding. This wasn't going very well. Nightkat placed his hands on her hips and drew her in closer, embracing close. His hands helped her move more with the beat. Maybe this wasn't so bad... She was getting better at it... right? She might be! Slowly they inched their way farther down, his hands still firmly gripping her hips. Lite could feel Shadow's eyes burning through her. She knew he would be angry. Wouldn't he? Or maybe he wouldn't be angry at all. Maybe he didn't even care. He should care... She wanted him to care; she wanted him to be angry. But then again she wanted him to come put an end to the dance, and he didn't... A tiny sound of crashing echoed in her ear. What was that? Instinctively she looked to Shadow. Damn the @#%$ crowd, she couldn't see through everyone, so she couldn't see him. Growling, she gets up on her tippy toes and bobs around. Can't everyone get outta the way? Pops! He was yelling at someone. Looking over in the direction Pops was, Lite sees it -a broken window. What was going on? Lite pushes her way through the hoards of people. It seemed like every time she pushed one out of the way, another was in their place. Grrr, idiots. Squeezing past the last few dancers, she burst through the club doors. A dim light cast by a street lamp lit the near empty parking lot. The black asphalt under her feet was grimy, dirt coated, and slightly sticky. How nice... Cautiously taking a few steps out, she glances around the corner where the window lay high above. A fight! Jesus Christ, there must have been twenty guys standing in a circle while two went at each other in the middle. Ug, men. Tony and Dan, two well known and very large, muscular bouncers, rushed past Lite. Tony patted her head on the way. They broke through group and separated the two fighters. She couldn't help but follow. Fights and car accidents - as horrible as they may be, you never can just walk away without getting the closest look possible. One of the men who was in the ring, the stupider of the two, decided to try and pick a fight with Dan. Biiig mistake. But that wasn't what Lite was interested in... She couldn't take her eyes off the second man. Something about him... the look on his face, the flare in his eyes... she'd never seen it before. Intrigued, she walks over and tugs on his arm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, lets get you inside before the cops are called n you get taken to the station.&quot; He hesitated, as anyone would do if a brightly decorated stranger came up and told them to come with them. This only made her pull harder. &quot;Come on! I don't bite, less you want me to.&quot; She was filled with giggles, as always. They managed to slide back into club un-noticed and camouflaged in the mass of people. Straight to the bar, of course. They both took a seat at the end.<br>
<br>
&quot;So... What's your name?&quot;<br>

Pops didn't touch the money he set out on the counter as payment. 'What's a few free drinks for my kyds' friends?' as he liked to say. He was such a sweet old man. Lite didn't order anything, she just sat quietly and watched the odd one drink. He must have sat there for three minutes staring at nothing before he realized she was there, and had been there since they sat. A smile danced on her lips and brightened her eyes as she noticed he was slightly embarassed for forgetting her presence, but she would speak before he could get a chance to figure out what to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi. My name's Lite. What's yours?&quot; <br>
<br>
Usually she would hug people but for some reason she felt a hug would not be accepted by him, so instead she extended her arm.

Staring back to his money laying on the counter, &quot;Barkeep, money for my drink is there. get me another.&quot; nodding at the man behind the bar Matt turned his attention back to the girl, a hand was there, he took it and shook it, she had a welcome grip one that wasn't so strong to show strength, but one that was light and friendly.

After all, that would instantly become their favorate shirt which you now stained, even if the stain was placed there while saving their life. Sighing quietly she looks at the bar. His money still sat there. Narrowing her eyes, she snatches it up and sticks it into his shirt pocket. <br>
<br>
&quot;You drink free. And I'm sorry about your money. The cops would have been called. And those two aren't the only bouncers here ya know. More would have came&quot;<br>

She could tell by the look on her face he wasn't listening and he didn't care. What a stubborn ass. She'd get through to him. She'd be nice untill her head exploded if that's what it took to get him to lighten up a little. <br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway. You from around here? Haven't seen you before.&quot;<br>
<br>
He wouldn't look at her. She knew she wasn't exacatally pretty (at least in her mind) but she thought people could at least stand to look at her once in a great while. Resting her elbow on the bar she leans over, nearly sticking her head right above his shot glass, forcing him to look at her. Her gaze was stuck and focused on his eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;I said I wouldn't bite...&quot;<br>
<br>
She spoke softly and sweetly, nearly whispering. Why wouldn't he look at her? What was wrong? Was it her?

Her mind reeled. He obviously had had it rough. She wanted to help him. There were a few people she could call, a few strings she could pull and possibly get him a place to stay... She knew of a few people that needed things done that she was sure he could do, but then again, she also knew he wouldn't accept her help, and that she probably couldn't help him. Sighing with frustration at nothing but her inability to make things better, she drums her fingers. If only she had a magic wand that could make everything better for everyone. That's what she wanted. She always wanted everyone to be happy, but very few were. Right now she wanted to be happy as well. But with the two only important people in her life no where in sight, it was hard to smile. <p><Br><Br><Br><Br><Br><i>Tender lumpings everywhere <Br>Life's no fun without a good scare</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uryvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 8:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A lite for your dark</span><hr size=1> standing up he looked towards the clock, &quot;I've gotta go.&quot; matt said as he threw his money for the drinks on the bar and starts for the exit, it was late and someone was waiting for food back home... he had to get that food, maybe there were still some people looking for a fight.. someone to take in the bet. maybe... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/14/02 4:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A lite for your dark</span><hr size=1> NightKat smiled, she  was a quick learner.. he was sitting back in the corner..notcing the smell of blood...fresh blood around..he focused on Lite..the guy..did he say his name was Matt? another Dreamer...and ..someone else..a harsh glare met his...Shadow....another Dreamer.. he had met 3 dreamers..more  in his  LOONNNGG lifetime..<br>

He didn't smile either. What was wrong with her? She had failed once again. Good old Lite messed everything up, she wasn't good for anything. Feeling sorry for herself and wishing the night to be over already, she crosses her hands across the bar and rests her chin ontop. What happened to Shadow... Did Brite ever show up... Where was that 'Kat' guy... What time was it... Where was her dealer? It was time to roll... A beat seeped into her viens and she felt her head begin to pulse in unison with it. Over and over again until it was throbbing relaxfuly. Slowly it drained her mind and cleansed her body. Not a single thing was wrong anymore. Tilting her head to the side so her cheek was smashed against her forearm, she lets her eyes slide shut. It was time to roll...<br>

The sleeves on his dark green hoodie were rolled up to his elbows and there were unmatching green reflecting stripes going down his jumbo legged pants. She knew by the feel of his hug and his freakishly warm - yet not hot, tempurature that it could be no other than the jungliest jungler out there - Stomp, or My/Mine as she liked to refer to him. (a pet name she kept for him because he was her cuddle buddy). Squeezing around in his grip she turns to face him and returns his hug lovingly. Stomp was Lites soulmate through and through. Though she loved him with every bone in her entire body, they never dated. It was as if dating was below them - together they stood on a higher level that didn't involve any of the petty things that made up a relationship. They were Together. <br>
<br>
&quot;How's my oh so sexi girl?&quot;<br>
&quot;Super fantastic!&quot;<br>
&quot;I'd accept no answer less than that&quot;<br>
<br>
He kissed her forehead lightly and they held the hug. She never wanted to let go. Nothing could compair the sublime feeling that envloped her entire body while they were close. Minutes crept by but the only thing she could feel and hear was his heart and when she closed her eyes everything washed away. But he stirred. His hand moved up and down her back slowly and comfortingly and then he patted her lightly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on babe, lets go to my room&quot;<br>
<br>
He didn't even have to ask. With their hands clinging to his tightly they made their way through the hoard of people. Passing under the moving lights, paranioa flashed in her mind. It turned her head around and slowed her pace. A man. In black? He stood out from the rest and did not move. Where was he looking? At her? No. He wasn't looking at anything, he was looking at everything... at once. For a breif second she swore she saw him dance - just three steps, but he was lost in the people before she really knew. Stomp tugged on her arm and pulled her around in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good thing you're not leading, we'd never get anywhere!&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling warmly he wrapped his arms around her waist and picked her up off the ground. Her arms encircle his neck and he enters the Jungle room. Feirce, heavy, and infecting music blared in the some-what small room. (small in the party sense). He set Lite down and stared at her a moment. She always hated when he did that - it made her feel so good about herself when she saw that shine in his eyes when he looked into hers. Feeling oddly selfconscious she put her hand out, fingers extended and palm facing down. A mischevious grin appeared on both their faces. This is what they were known for. His hand copied hers and as a new track was slipped in the mix they both jumped back a step at the same time so that their arms were fully extended. Thoughtless and rhythmic movement. They let their minds subside to the atmosphere and enter lock around eachother. Side by side and always touching in some way shape or form they danced. Not the bump and grind sort of dance - but the kind that you had no idea how to do and wanted to learn badly once you got a glimpse of it. Theirs was a mix, some odd form of liquid. (One of Lites favorate). It was as if they were acting as one. A single being manovering two bodies. They're eyes closed and the song smoothly transitioned into another. She could spend all night like this. All night? She was supposed to meet Shadow at the spot! He wouldn't mind Stomp coming... It was probably time to go, they should start heading out. But... just one more song, just one more.<br>
