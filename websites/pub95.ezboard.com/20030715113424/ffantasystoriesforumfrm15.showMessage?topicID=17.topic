<br>
Chapter 6<br>
<br>
&quot;Identity Revealed, A Dreamer Awakens.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For a long time a lone figure has watched over the people he had thrust into the horrors of facing things no mortal should. He had inadvertently caused the force that binds all reality to bestow unnatural abilities onto a boy who had just reached manhood. Further more he had to contend with the consequences that their descendants where drawing more attention by the darker forces. This ungod as some would call him was thankful that two simple humans had saved him, and as repayment he vowed to watch over and assist them in any way possible, for this bloodline had the power to save the gods, to restore that which the will of the eternity had created.<br>
<br>
It was a miracle, it just had to be, but still even after so many days Leona was still in shock at what had happened. Some mysterious force had transported them to the eastern commons just near Freeport. She was thankful for this, mainly because Zenki was being treated at the clerics guild. At first though they where fearful, mostly because of a supposed legend of a demon with eyes with the blackness of death, and hair as crimson as the blood of a thousand slain men.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and a dark elf woman quietly stepped in. This was very out of the ordinary since they where in Freeport and even more so was the fact that this was the woman's house. Leona had never heard of any dark elves being let live out in the open inside the city of Freeport, and even more so disturbing was the fact that she was readily accepted and liked by everyone who she talked to.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are you feeling today?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Much better, any word of.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zenki will be fine, though the clerics are fearful of treating him, save one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How is it that you know his name, and why are you doing this for us, also just who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I suppose you could say Zenki is my nephew, as for my name, I'm called Rita.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How is this possible unless...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is true that I'm married to human, though few seem to think so sometimes. I just wished you could meet Zenki's uncle and his cousin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave it to my parents to leave me in the dark on something I should have known about.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't except them to openly talk about my husband. To be honest I think they're afraid of him, much like most of the people who live in this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that why everyone is so nice to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually it isn't, they think of us as night and day, so they are genuinely being kind, also since both my husband son help the local fighters train the majority hold a respect for them.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was hard for Rita to believe the story that the clerics had told her at the guild. They all seemed to be deathly afraid of Zenki because of his appearance. All except for one, though she was still young she held no fear at all. This was all cleared up once the young woman told Rita just how the demon everyone was afraid of had saved her mother as well as her.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can you not be afraid, you've heard the legend!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know I've heard that legend, and I seen what they called a demon first hand when I was a child.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It let you live?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not only did it let me live, it also saved my mother and myself just as we where about to be killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
For all they said none of the clerics could understand why their dear friend Nadia still wasn't afraid. Even the guards of the guild where afraid, and it for them to be rattled so badly just at the sight of someone was beyond belief. This excluded Sir William of course, since he was the one who told them the story of the demon.<br>
<br>
For Zenki all he had was broken dreams, and nightmares of the battle with the demons he had fought in the Karanas. The only true time he had any rest was when he wasn't dreaming at all, the calm darkness in his mind comforted him. During all this time the Nadia had helped the clerics attending Zenki, she was the only one of them who dared to actually touch him.<br>
<br>
All she could do was wander around the city, Leona remembered the time she spent at the guilds here learning from the trainers. In truth she liked this city better than most since she could find anything she wanted here. She hated the fact that even if she did want to leave she couldn't because of Zenki, but at least now she had the time to pick up a couple spell scrolls she had been wanting for awhile. Little did she know that something had followed her and Zenki to the city.<br>
<br>
&quot;Despicable humans, can't we just destroy them all?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your so much like our brethren who fell in the Karanas, you underestimate these creatures.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't we just use the dark elves like we've done on Faydwer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This one must be handled personally, he's already become aware unlike the other.&quot;<br>
<br>
Things definitely where not going to be peaceful in Freeport, two more demons had been sent out after it was learned the two others had failed miserably. Their superiors where both angry and disgraced that something could dispatch their lesser brethren. There also remained the fact that someone else was interfering, making things even more complicated.<br>
<br>
Indeed someone was watching this whole scene from the shadows, and now it was becoming apparent that physical interference was going to be needed. From past experience he knew full well that Zenki was going to be unconscious for another day or so. Worst yet was now Freeport would be caught in the cross hairs when the foul creatures finally did decide to attack. This was something he couldn't stand for in the least, since his own family called this city their home, and in face he had grown quite fond of it as well.<br>
<br>
All the city was oblivious to the oncoming threat, even Rita who had been tapping her contacts for every ounce of information they had. Who or whatever was behind the recent events was in fact being very careful of who they worked with. With her husband away all she could do was send word to Qeynos and hope that Leona's parents came to make a visit.<br>
<br>
These hopes came true as there was a knock on the door, and none other than Zolf and Zinka quickly stepped inside. After having gotten word of how their daughter and Zenki where found they felt they had no other choice than to come. Not only that, but they didn't exactly trust her husband either, especially after the events in the past.<br>
<br>
&quot;So how is our daughter doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's fine, but she hasn't said what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear, what about Zenki, is he all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well he's recovering at the cleric's guild, and he looked like he had been through a war zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what of....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh our son is off to get some information on Faydwer, and his father is off traveling.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then that Leona finally walked in from her walk through the town, not surprised in the least that her parents had come. She was glad to see them, even if they had sent made her travel with Zenki. She still couldn't believe all that had happened though. Little did she or anyone else realize the fate that was about to befall Freeport as the sun began to set.<br>
<br>
The guards near the clerics guild never knew what hit them as a flurry of clawed strikes shredded their armor before the razor sharp teeth of the Reapers ripped out their throats. For them this was pure pleasure, it has be so long since they had the opportunity to kill humans, so this task was much more to their liking. They took great pride in their abilities, and thought that sending the low classed incubae half breeds before was a mistake. The two where now intent on turning this night into a night of blood filled gore before they finished their job.<br>
<br>
Sir William had just finished making his rounds, and it was his duty to escort which ever trainee's whom lived in Freeport from the cleric's guild to their homes for the night. Tonight it looked as if he had the pleasure of seeing Nadia to her home. Though, he wasn't expected to face the conversation that was about to take place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir William! How could you tell such stories of a demon when you know they aren't true!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything that monstrous has to be such a creature.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was a child I seen him myself, and he was no demon!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember it well, it did harm me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And didn't it also save Freeport when it was being overrun by those vile trolls and ogres?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That doesn't matter, I still think that man was a demon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why must you always be so stubborn!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Young people are to trusting these days, you'll soon learn that.&quot;<br>
<br>
As soon as they rounded a corner they befell the horror the Reapers had managed to cause. Blood and chunks of pink flesh littered the grown and slid down the walls. Pieces of bone and brain matter where all that was left of the guards heads. Nadia nearly fainted at seeing this sight, and Sir William did well to hold back the urge to vomit. It was then they spotted a set of glowing eyes in the darkness, and the glint of razor sharp teeth from a Reaper's grotesque mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, more lambs for the slaughter...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... What things we can do to them...&quot;<br>
<br>
Before another word or action could be taken, a lone figure, shrouded in black garments stepped out from the shadows and stood directly in front of the two Reapers. Then the person turned towards Sir William and Nadia, both where speechless as they gazed upon the figures eyes. They where the same as the demon from the legend, solid black, like the shadows themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Sir William how's the arm doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your that boy from all those years back!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More or less, even now your scared out of your mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, who ever you are, help us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So the child who called me a demon has grew up...&quot;<br>
<br>
The two Reapers where clearly insulted at hearing all of this, for anyone they deemed to be human or the like to be called a demon was insulting. This in turn resolved their decision to just what they would do to this person, having considered only maiming him for interrupting them before. They would get retribution for having been insulted so greatly, first by killing him, then by destroying the humans whom he seemed to be protecting.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will die now foolish mortal!&quot;<br>
<br>
A Reaper thrust its clawed hand forward as black mana began to gather around the tips of its nails. All that could be seen was what could be described as a sinister smile from the creature as darkness seemed to encircle the man before them. Soon the mass of darkness burst into flames as both of the Reapers laughed in unison.<br>
<br>
Nadia couldn't believe what had just happened before her, she was almost certain that who ever this person was, had now died before her eyes. What made things worse was the fact that she knew Sir William had no chance of fending off these beasts. To her there didn't seem to be a future, she felt she was now nearing the end of her stay on this mortal coil.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are the ones who are fools, you barely even singed my clothes.&quot;<br>
<br>
The flames seemed to fold away from the figure, then disappear only to be replaced by a crimson incandescent aura. Laughing was all they could hear from beneath the cloth mask as the man finally pulled the garments away from his head. It was definitely the same person Nadia had seen before, no one else could have hair that same color, or have this much power.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will show you that I'm far worse than these creatures, then no one shall make the mistake of calling me a demon again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whatever this man was, the Reapers now knew that he wasn't a simple human. In all their years of slaughtering people they had never encountered someone like this. The silence of the moment was becoming unbearable, and then everyone felt it. The ground beneath them began to vibrate, and then the earth under the man's feet began to crack.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll give you the pleasure of knowing your destructors name, I am called Ryo Kataoka.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then that Leona felt the small tremors from across the city, then she felt and overwhelming horror envelope her very being. The feeling was similar to when Zenki had fought before, but it was far stronger. She broke out into a cold sweat as she thought of what must be happening.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's Zenki! He has to be awake!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How can you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Before her father could utter another word Leona had ran from the house, heading directly for the cleric's guild. She wasn't sure why, but since Zenki was awake he might be causing untold destruction. Leona felt responsible for all of this somehow, though she wasn't sure why, the only thing she knew was she had to do something.<br>
<br>
Naturally her parents and Rita had taken off after her, though they hated to admit it they had let themselves become out of shape and found themselves quickly falling behind. Leona's parents had a good idea of what might be happening, but they dared not say it to Rita. They just had to be sure of what was really going on.<br>
<br>
Sir William was awestruck, never had he seen such a fierce fighter before. To make matters worse this was the same person he had heard was helping the monks train. This man named Ryo was actually enjoying the fight, and more so disturbing was it appeared he was toying with the creatures. For being so well built Sir William could hardly believe how nimble Ryo was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Despicable mortal... It is time I showed you just what we Reapers are capable of!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was hoping you would have more than this, your much slower than I expected.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a hiss and then Ryo found out just what the Reapers had been holding back as all four of the Reaper's clawed limbs began to strike out. This was much more to Ryo's liking as the beasts nails only found nothing or a catch of clothing here or there. What he hadn't noticed was the other Reaper had slipped off into the shadows, with a task set in it's mind.<br>
<br>
Leona in her haste had actually shoved open the door to the cleric's guild house, and had made her way through the guards trying to strain her to get to Zenki's room. When she seen the sleeping Zenki However, she was confused. All that ran through her mind was how she could be so wrong, and further more, what had caused her to feel the way she did.<br>
<br>
Finally Ryo had noticed he was only fighting just one Reaper, his attention was drawn away for just a second, his mind wondering where the other had gotten to. Then it dawned on him just as one of the Reaper's razor sharp talons caught more than just cloth this time, leaving a thin cut across his cheek Now the creature had gone to far, it was no longer play time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tiring are we, mortal?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have just advanced from being my play toy, to now being a victim....&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the Reaper could make another move it found a punch landing square across its fast, and then another in the form of an uppercut connected with it's chin, sending the beast into the air. It had never felt attacks this intense before, bone had shattered upon contact and blood had sprayed out into the air. This in turn left splotches of blackened liquid over the street and walls, along with fragments of dark bone matter.<br>
<br>
Nadia looked on slack jawed as she seen Ryo leap into the air, striking the grotesque creature back to the stone inlaid street below. He was like a man possessed, as thunderous blow after blow landed on the beasts body, sending skin and bone into the air as the force of each attack began to increase. The sheer magnitude of the strikes alone where causing the ground to shake violently as each attack connected.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not...pos....&quot;<br>
<br>
The Reaper didn't get the chance to finish what would be its last words as Ryo reached down with both his hands and grasped the monsters head between his hands. A sickening gurgle was heard from the beasts throat and then the snapping of bones as the creatures head seemed to explode in Ryo's hands. The next thing Sir William and Nadia saw was the now dead Reapers spine being torn from its body by Ryo's bare hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;It very well is possible, moronic creature!&quot;<br>
<br>
This all had given the now dead Reapers companion in bloodshed the time to find the cleric's guild, it was going to finish the task it was given. It was easy enough for it to slip through the shadows past the guards, not taking its time to marvel in the carnage it so wanted, as it rushed to find its target. Instead what it found was much more rewarding, as it seen a girl standing beside the bed of its would-be victim.<br>
<br>
Leona couldn't even utter a word as the Reaper emerged from the shadows in the room. This was something that she could have never imagined in her worst nightmares, and yet here was this thing, standing the room, claws extended and ready to lay waste to whatever got in its way.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will be a pleasure to shred your flesh and crush your bones before I kill this boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
The monstrous being fell on her with a speed unlike anything else she had seen before. All her mind could do was search for some way out, something or someone that might help her survive. Then her subconscious had found the solution as Leona spoke a barely audible sentence, it was now her only hope that it was heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zenki, please help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
These words did not fall on deaf ears, Zenki had indeed heard them, and his mind was beginning to clear as another voice filled his head. It was a voice he had heard before somewhere, and now it was here once again to help him. Somehow he knew it was going to help him in what must be done.<br>
<br>
- Zenki it is time to rise up and fight. -<br>
<br>
- How do I wake up? It hurts if I even move, let alone fight. -<br>
<br>
- You have the power, just use it, draw the strength you need to move from it. -<br>
<br>
- I...... I'm afraid, I lost control before. -<br>
<br>
- Just do what comes naturally, don't fight the urge, it's just a dream after all. -<br>
<br>
It was then that Zenki's eyes opened, he simply thought this was another dream, or nightmare as he viewed the scene before him. What he saw was a being like none he had ever seen, and it was holding Leona in the air by her throat, ready to plunge its free arm into her body and tear her to pieces. This was something that even he couldn't let happen even if it was a dream.<br>
<br>
&quot;No you don't!&quot;<br>
<br>
Within a split second Leona saw Zenki roll forward out of the bed and leap into the air, before she could make out anything else she found herself hitting the floor. In fact Zenki had hit the Reaper with enough force to shove them both through the stone wall and down toward the street below. She was glad that he had her as she struggled to regain her breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll kill you, and then I'll get to have the pleasure of killing her as well!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead and try!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Reaper moved forward, launching several attacks with all four of its limbs, trying desperately to satisfy its lust for blood. Instead it missed, only to leave itself wide open for what could only be deemed a foolish mistake on its part. The creature had underestimated what it thought was a boy, and now it was going to pay for that grievous error in judgment.<br>
<br>
There was a quick movement, far to quick for the creature to anticipate as Zenki's leg connected with the side of one of its knee's. This in turn caused the joint to practically explode on contact from the impact, leaving the beast howling in pain, and again wide open for another attack. For once it appeared as Zenki was finally going to have an actual dream, rather than the nightmares he had experienced before.<br>
<br>
Leona's parents had finally arrived at the Cleric's guild house, what they seen before them was surprising to them. They had never really seen a Reaper before, but they had found the chance to read scriptures describing their appearance. Indeed they could tell the material they read was in fact truthful, right down to their hideous appearance.<br>
<br>
The Reaper soon found itself in far worse trouble than it ever could have before as Zenki shoved his elbow directly into its chest, only to snap his arm back up and strike at it's chin with the back of his fist. Then there was a flash of light before the creatures eyes as Zenki had pulled its face directly down into one of his knee's. The very next thing it could feel was a foot lodged in it's back that sent it into a nearby street wall.<br>
<br>
As if he had done it many times before Zenki held out his hands, palms facing toward each other as barely visible aura surrounded his body. Then before Leona's Parents, as well as Rita they seen his arms part and a sphere of brilliant white light form between Zenki's palm's. They had all seen this attack before, and knew there was no hope of survival for the Reaper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Celestial Wake!&quot;<br>
<br>
The sphere had changed into a massive beam of energy that raced forward and struck the Reaper head on. Light filled the surrounding area as the Reaper's body was encompassed in the light, and then faded away as the light continued on up into the sky above Freeport and then dissipated.
