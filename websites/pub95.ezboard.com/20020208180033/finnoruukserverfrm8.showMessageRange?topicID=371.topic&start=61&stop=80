<br>
I was genuinely curious about your point of view of yourself in regards to that little anecdote.  You so often claim that people misunderstand you, that I thought it would be interesting to hear your view.  <br>
<br>
So as to churning the waters?  No. But self fulfilling prophecy seems to be something you specialize in, so I'm sure you'll allow me a brief paragraph of self indulgence.  About me not saying a word to you that was not a foundation for insult? PKB, your own words.  It's possible that the only thing I have said to you is insult, but it's like a vicious cycle, the only thing I've ever seen from you is insult, not just to me, but to everyone on the server.  You've certainly posted replies to me in threads where you had nothing to say prior to insulting me.  <br>
<br>
It's not worth it to me to dig up your old posts, the ones where multitudes of people interpreted the tone of your typing to be condescending and rude, but for you to say &quot;I didn't mean it that way, you all misread it&quot; is rather strange.  Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but maybe your presentation isn't quite working.  <br>
<br>
And as to my 'strafing runs' beginning with 'I'm just curious', like you said to others, prove it. *shrug*<br>
<br>
The reason I was curious, was that in the past, you have given the impression that you saw yourself as outside the majority, for whatever reason.  You didn't seem to be doing that in this post, but then again, as you've said over and over, people misinterpret your posts, so I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.  I don't expect you to care, or be grateful, but maybe you can see how the cycle perpetrates, and there's no breaking out of it, and it's not just on other peoples sides that this happens?  <br>
<br>
I agree, we are all in this group of monkeys, and participate in this learned behaviour. Maybe you have some suggestions, or solutions that would make things better here?  Clearly you do care about the community, or you would not have bothered to post. <br>

Everyone has their own mind, opinions and feelings.  I  highly doubt someone would &quot;hate&quot; you just from things they have heard about you Gamiene.  More so from things they themselves have witnessed, or have had done to them by you.  No one is perfect and to claim so is utterly rediculous.  Obviously you are disliked to a certain degree otherwise this post would have never been started.  Perhaps you started this post to generate some sympathy?  ~shrugs~ one will probably never know.  <br>
<br>
I have witnessed actions from you and yes, I have even heard stories of why people dislike you.  But my opinion of you is based soley on fact.  Also, you should realize, since I know you are a smart person, that if you attack someone's friend then you are going to recieve backlash for it.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Yet you almost seem surprised at the reaction you get at times.  <br>
<br>
Once you have burned someone, that person or persons is not likely to welcome you back with open arms and forget the incident which has upset them.  While Im sure you have been nice to people, you have also been hateful to people as well.  I say this with the knowledge that people are not going to have feelings of dislike for you with no reason to support it.  In the end, you have alienated yourself, and you have no one to blame but yourself.  While I will admit that people can change, once someone has done something to a person so many times, their opinion of that person will not change.  Its human nature.  <br>

Responding point by point is to discuss. Are you trying to tell me you really think I should never reply? Or that the act of responding to your statements is automatically argumentative? Or that the process of exchanging thoughts until we both see where the other is coming from is a bad thing? <br>

Actually, I think this is precisely what they do. No reason, but lots and lots of emotion. They don't 'think', they 'feel'. So the logic that would normally tell them there's no way someone who doesn't know them could *possibly* be deliberate in offending them is never experienced. All they know is they 'feel' offended... therefore, it must be on purpose. <br>
<br>
And yes, I'm disdainful of that. I think it reeks of lowest common denominator and I find that beyond sad.<br>
<br>
Once someone has demonstrated that tendency to me, I don't bother but long enough to lob the ball back over the fence. They can yell all they want about me doing it... but I couldn't if they weren't so consistent in sending it at me again and again. <br>

Person3: Actually, here's what I think.  Maybe it would be better if...<br>
<br>
<br>
Person1 is an insecure troll.  Person2 is being a sycophant.  Person3 is being a friend.  <br>
<br>
Aliya, I know you're trying to be person3 for Gamiene.  Give it up.  She doesn't come here for friends or even sycophants.  Some people thrive on and even get off on hatred.  You have to recognize these people and take a step back.  <br>
<br>
If you saw someone in real life acting like this you would figure they just need someone to be nice to them.  You would be there for them, no matter how mean and nasty they were.  That's the kind of person you are.   However, you have to recognize the unique properties of this medium.  A person that is a complete hate @#%$ here may be very nice in real life and have a dozen friends just like you.  For some reason, the darker side of human nature perhaps, they come here and want for nothing but angst and dissent.  The people who are the kindest to them are the ones they single out first for an endless stream of vituperation.  <br>
<br>
It is inconceivably difficult to change a person.  Knowing a person in real life you can only achieve the smallest changes over a long period of time through close personal contact.  It is immeasureably harder to change someone with a couple paragraphs of text on a message board.  They don't know you or respect you as a human being.  Your humanity itself is all but washed away when it's poured into abstract symbols, digitized, and transmitted across the harsh coldness of cyberspace.  <br>
<br>
Gamiene is not going to change no matter what you, myself, or anyone else here posts to these boards.  *This* is precisely the kind of thread that gives her what she craves.  Frankly, I don't give a rats ass about her.  She is going to pull this post apart and respond with anger and derision to everything I say.  Unlike her, this will not cause me pleasure.  I am posting because I see a genuinely kind person baring her heart to someone who will strike back with anger every time.  You are not human to her.  You are a digital plaything.  Recognize this, and spare yourself.   <p><TABLE><TR><TD><p><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/testuart/Corvansig.jpg" width="200" height="280" usemap="#CorvanMap" border="0"><map name="CorvanMap"><area shape="rect" coords="135,134,181,158" href="http://www.ashenvendetta.com" target="_blank"><area shape="rect" coords="128,165,187,182" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31367" target="_blank"></map></p></TD><TD><p><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/testuart/cordathsig.jpg" width="200" height="280" usemap="#CordathMap" border="0"><map name="CordathMap"><area shape="rect" coords="135,134,181,158" href="http://www.ashenvendetta.com" target="_blank"><area shape="rect" coords="128,165,187,182" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=42338" target="_blank"></map></p></TD></TR></TABLE>

Here is the reality &quot;sweets&quot;, my opinion of you stands.  Your view on things I find totally funny, since you want people to see things your way or you determine that they are automatically wrong.  In a sense, your way or the highway, aye.  Sorry things don't work that way.  Not once have I ever seen you admit that you were wrong on anything.  <br>

<br>
That being said, I grow weary of your endless ramblings and falsehoods.  Be sure to have your facts straight before saying something you know to be untrue.  I find it amusing that you have alienated so many people you cant even remember who they are.  -chuckle- as you would say. <br>

Problem is, you're doing the very thing you claim I am. Does this make you an insecure troll?<br>
<br>
I posted this thread to express what I see, and to hear the perspectives of others. You know... thoughtful discussion of where the disconnect is... it can't be 'all me' any more than it can be 'all you'. Or is that something you have trouble admitting? <br>
<br>
Do you really think if I only were here to stir up hate that I would go through the effort of initiating a discussion that I know is going to be fraught with posts like yours? <br>
<br>
I write for a living. I make damn good money at it and am published in a variety of outlets. When someone out here says they take something I've posted in a manner I did not intend it, the one thing I *do* know is it can't be due to how its written. Does that sound arrogant? It isn't, it is seventeen years of professional success speaking. <br>
<br>
So there must be some 'third thing' in play that causes it. I think that 'third thing' is assumption based upon lack of personal knowledge. So far, there's no real rebuttal to that assertion, especially not in posts like yours.<br>
<br>
With the exception of three people (all of whom have been complimentary, by the way), no one posting in this thread knows me in person. They know only what they hear, or what they *feel* as a result of reading my posts here. What they hear is the greater portion of the problem, I think. What they read (mis-read) here isn't as much an issue, since only a slight subset of people who play on Innoruuk read here regularly. <br>
<br>
Maybe if I move to 6.6 on the Flesch-Kincaid scale, things will improve? Doubtful. As so many as are delighted to tell me, they're quite happy with the conclusion they've reached and have no real interest in changing it. And, as I have said, I'm not looking for change so much as understanding where the disconnect is... this is helpful despite people like you who seemingly want to see it de-railed.<br>

<br>
You ask why people don't like you and compare them to a bunch of Monkeys.  When people give you their reasoning, you (at least in your posts) don't give weight or substance to their reasons, you just pick out what flaws exist according to you.  When people tell you how your words come across to them, you immediately turn it around and say it's the reader's fault for misinterpreting you.  You talk about how unfair it is for people to hang on to stereotypes and misconceptions of you, and then you reinforce those stereotypes and misconceptions.<br>
<br>
I will tell you in my opinion one of the things you suck at in your writing, and if you're a professional you can separate the criticism of your work from a personal attack on you, which this isn't (yet) meant to be.  You are extremely ineffective at communicating effectively with your target audience on these boards.  Maybe you are great for your typical target reader in your RL profession.  But with the mentality and personality of the majority of the readers on this board (judging this based on responses over what, a couple years?), you don't communicate effectively, if that was ever your goal.  Let me try to expound on my idea.<br>
<br>
If you tell a joke about Fallopian Tubes at a Gynecologists convention, some people there might say that you were a pretty funny person.  If you tell the same joke at a Carpenters convention, the people there would be wondering where the hell you came from, and a reminder to catch the name so you didn't appear next year.  Is it the Carpenters fault for not understanding your joke, or is it your fault for telling a joke that they didn't understand?  <br>
<br>
In the military in a Combat unit, a motivational speech might be something along the lines of &quot;We're gonna kick the @#%$ out of those little commie @#%$ bags, rip their throats out, and drink their blood&quot;.  Try doing that as the CEO of a large corporation talking about competition with a Chinese company to the board of Directors and see how long you get to keep your job.  Is it the rest of the board that just isn't motivated enough to compete the way you want to, or did you not express yourself appropriately?<br>
<br>
Being someone of Polish descent, I am used to receiving (and telling) lots of Polish jokes.  A friend and co-worker of mine once told me after I had made one of my jokes that if I wasn't Polish and a friend of his he would have kicked my butt for making fun of him (he's an immigrant from Poland and has ties that I don't).  Is it that he doesn't have a sense of humor, or is it my fault for telling a joke that offends him personally?<br>
<br>
If you are a professional writer and know how to effectively communicate, then I only see one answer to your question about whether or not your entire reason for this thread is to stir up hate.  Yes.  I would assume that someone with your skills would be able to post on a Topic without p.issing the majority of the readers off.  If I am to believe that you are capable of communicating effectively, then I would also have to believe that your choice of words and writing style were chosen specifically to elicit these types of responses.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usteffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 9:59:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=76>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Figure this will...</span><hr size=1> Gamiene, you ever make it to HoT?

<br>
And yup, I had the unmitigated gall to look at Tunare's loot. What with her being my diety and all, I wanted to see what was under that green dress. So I did. Just like I have many other times, on many other kills. <br>
<br>
Could I have waited to read about it? Sure. Did I want to? No. Did I take anything? No. Did I harm anyone by looking? No. Well, unless you count the people who fell into fits over it. <br>
<br>
I understand the perspective of the folks who killed her. I apologized for the roleplaying that obviously upset them. I'm not going to apologize for something that hurt no one. <br>
