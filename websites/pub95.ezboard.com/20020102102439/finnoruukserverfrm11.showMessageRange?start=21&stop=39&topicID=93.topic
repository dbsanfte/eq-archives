<br>
This was our winter &quot;fort&quot; So we would sleep in it, play D+D in it so fort and so on.<br>
<br>
Well my brother and 2 of his friends were in the airbag. So I thought it would be funny to squeeze a bottle of baby powder into the fan. So I did, Like 5 times... They all freaked out and started screaming bloody murder because the were blinded (temporarily) and coughing, unable to find the exit they were thrashing around in it for some time while I sat there laughing my little ass off. =)<br>
<br>
My mother ended up breaking a wooden spoon over my ass for that one :/<br>
<br>
<br>
Same scenario...<br>
<br>
I had a fake cut off rubber finger, add some fake blood...<br>
<br>
stick a pencil in the fan, scream REALLY loudy &quot;AHHHHH MY FINGER!!!!&quot; and toss the fake finger into the tent. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My brother is walking our 100+ pound doberman up our steep gravel driveway. This dog would bolt and chase anything that moved.<br>

This one time my older brother saved over my FF3 game (Like, 3 weeks of playing to get everyone's level maxed and find every item in the damn game) on purpose. He didn't even like the game, just did it to bug me. So yeah, about a day later he was laying on his stomach watching tv and I just ran at him from behind full tilt and gave him the hardest football/soccer/whatever kick right in the nads. I was about 14 at the time if I remember correctly, so there was some decent power behind the kick. And my brother, well, after he stopped throwing up and crying, he beat the pulp out of me. It was still worth it though, I'd do it again in a second. He hasn't even looked in the direction of my saved games since then.<br>
<br>
Granted I may have greatly reduced his ability to have kids, but if any of you knew my brother you'd know I was doing the world a favor.<br>
<br>
Send me a tell in game and I'll let you know about some of the really bad things I've done. This was nothing  =)<br>

17 years old and after drinking  with pals, we come home over the farmers fields late at night past the quarry.<br>
<br>
Quarry.. very deep.  5 drunk pals.  What to do?  Find stuff to throw in it of course.<br>
<br>
After clearing a fairly large radius of common rubble and branches we are at a loss at what to throw in the very deep quarry next.  after exploring a little more a pal found a sleeper (a meter long damn heavy wooden beam used as the cross pieces on railway tracks).  So we dragged this heavy sleeper and tossed it off the side of the quarry.. the very deep quarry I may add.<br>
It was then we discovered that attached to this sleeper was a very long chain, and to our great surprise (after an agonisinly long wait where we were kinda watching the chain clink away into the quarry), a shape  appeared out of the darkness attached to the chain.  Imagine our shock as a goat in a sitting down position with its fore hoofs dug deeply into the grass and mud whizzed by us with nothing more than a 'meop?' sound as it dissapeared over the edge of the very deep quarry.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, we all felt very guilty and sickened and I never went back there again. <p><p><TABLE STYLE=filter:GLOW(color="red",strength=#+9)><FONT COLOR="white">The Unfetered One, a lone crusader in a dangerous world...

Let's see..hmm..stuff I did from about age 5-8..I set fire to a bunch of trees in front of my neighborhood.  It spread into some peoples yards, caught the telephone poles on fire and some sheds.  Firemen stopped it before it reached the houses.  That took a few firetrucks and a few hours to put out heha!(mom figured out it was a me a few days later, i was kinda a fire bug)  <br>
<br>
hrmm, ran around tearing apart the insulation, cutting holes in the walls, and cutting supports in half in newly constructed houses.(didnt get caught yay!)  <br>
<br>
Rode my bike through and wrote stuff in fresh cemented sidewalks along that same street.(got caught, i thought you were supposed to write yer name in cement :P).  <br>
<br>
Ran around breaking bottles and all the lightbulbs in the new post office as it was being built in my town.  Also took some caution/danger yellow tape and ran it through the entire post office upstairs, downstairs, through the sewer drains and basically around everything.(didn't get caught yay! tho they did show up one time while I was doing it..I dove out a window and ran like hell tho!).  <br>
<br>
That was about the only stuff I did destruction wise (that wasn't in my own household anyways).  Also stole stuff from stores whenever I went too.  Got caught once when I was like 3 and another time when I was 12.  <br>
<br>
Hrmm, urinated on my twin sister when my mom was about to give us a bath lol.  Pooped in the tub while taking a bath with my sister, splashed it towards her haha.  Wow those two I'm actually ashamed of, but at the time they were soo funny.<br>
<br>
Think thats bout it!  Most of it was just a big misunderstanding on my part tho!  Except for the post office and the stealing, I knew those were wrong!  Good thing they weren't as strict against juveniles as they are now, or I'd be in locked up! hehe!  So, anyways, now I'm majoring in criminal justice and minoring (possibly also majoring) in sociology.  Funny isn't it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

My dad had an '84 camaro that he's owned since the day it rolled off the factory line (so it wasn't the beater camaro you see often).  Two weeks after buying the corvette, I took my dad's car out for homecoming my senior year and ended up crashing it... car was totalled, and I was grounded for a very very long time.  I didn't get to touch the covette again until I graduated from high school.  (Yes, my dad did get the camaro repaired for $7500 because my parents are too cheap to get collision insurance).  <br>

I used a friend's backyard to do most of my dirty work.  It was like a small business.  We sold candy and had all kinds of *initiation*!<br>
<br>
For males, we liked to test physical ability and make them do misc. sexual things.  Mainly stuff like humping trees, the house, dogs, a running garden hose (LOL), girls, bikes... Moon passing cars, pick up dog poop with bare hands...<br>
<br>
For females, we had them strip in private and let us feel, kiss other guys and have them feel others up.  Lots of questions.  Hehe, they hated us later for it, but it was still good teasing material.  Well, until they get really macho boyfriends.<br>
<br>
In high school, I used to doodle huge cocks on everything.  Desks, text books, lunchroom tables, notes (stick them in random locker vents)...<br>
<br>
I got into lots of fights and had given/taken a few shares of serious injuries/damage.  I once fought with and got into a &quot;holding&quot; match and was in reach of the guys glasses and took them off and stomped on them.  The guy had to tape them up and wear them for a while.  I once got hit in the face with a basketball and really decked a guy and gave him a black eye while I got a bloody nose.  During lunch period breaks to go outside, there was a slope that was pretty steep, which went down to the football field.  I pushed a few people down and never got in trouble, though lots got there clothes really dirty.  This wasn't a fight, but I once had a locker door shut on my pinky finger while I was leaning on it, changing in the gym locker room, and it REALLY wasn't a pretty sight.  Blood was really GUSHING out of it.<br>
<br>
Playing Laser Tag, The Ultimate Laser Adventure, at the nearby galleria mall, I always aimed for the eyes.  I got caught a few times and was escorted out of the center by dragging me by the arm.  I kept coming back and they kept on escorting me out.  It was amusing seeing people crying, shouting game master.  It didn't care about my score, even though I did score well when I wanted to.  There was a &quot;sentinel&quot; on the top floor in the middle which gave lots of points if shot down.  My friends would usually block the way and keep the sentinel up and everyone would be trapped in it's firing range and lose points and you would here the craziest insults and curses come out of the victims and they would get a warning from the game master.<br>
<br>
The only thing that I ever got really in trouble for is stealing TG-16 games from a department store named Lechmere.   Me and my brother each took one game, stuffed it in out pants and covered it with our shirts and tried to walk out.  Someone was walking right toward us and we had no idea they were the secuirity and he grabbed our hands and handcuffed them and took us to the surveillance room and called for our Dad to come.  They showed us the video and we were put on probation for a year and banned from the store. <p><font size=2 face="Verdana, Arial">___________________________________<br>

It was kinda hot so I found a big cardboard box and put it in front of the fireplace.  Well it eventually caught fire and luckily enough my Dad daw the fire consumed box and ejected it from the house. Must of been about 6 or 7.<br>

I peed on my younger brother a couple times, for various reasons I suppose.<br>
