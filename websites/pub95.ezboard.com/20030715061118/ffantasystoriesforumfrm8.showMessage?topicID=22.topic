It covered his arms, covered his mouth, covered his chest, covered his chin, covered his shoulders, splattered across his stomach... The darkest of black leathers he wore for trousers were stained, as well. This was his 5 millionth victim; well, 5 millionth eaten, at least. So many countless others that couldn't have their Crimson consumed... Sighing to himself about lost prey of the past, he nearly lost the ectacy of the present kills. Never had he spilled blood of an innocent. Well, there were 53 cases of that, but that's just because he was in a desert. Hell, camels were fair game in Egypt!<br>
<br>
The pale white skin of the sick vampire gleamed with the lifeblood of these three hooligans. They intended on raping a delectable little crack whore, one who showed no signs of the present drug abuse. While her blood would have tasted bad, she would have been a good romp... Either way, Crawff was more satisfied with disembowling another trio of gangbangers. Filthy fools, didn't even know how to *start* to touch a lady. The vampire chuckled to himself as he licked his slick skin clean of the blazing red liquid. Lookin up and into the mist from a steam vent in the concrete alley, Crawff nearly saw his reflection, and realized what he must look like; and mewed. Tossing his head back in uprorious laughter, the silvery streaming hair fanned out behind him. The wind settled down, and Crawff's gray locks sat back down upon his ripped shoulders. The chain around his neck hummed softly; &quot;Something celestial approacheth!!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He was dulled. Bored. Tired. Exhausted. Garrilon was always a great sparring partner, but his unending repitoire of tricks and skills and techniques left Serrafrah quite breathless... literally. The demon had a fetish of sorts of holding a victim from the neck a few feet off the ground, usually ending with a crushing skull-blow or being slammed through walls. Serrafrah rubbed his nearly bruised gray skin.<br>
<br>
With long, shining, silver hair streaming past his waist, Serrafrah's heavenly appearance was all but warm and inviting. Instead, he appeared more like the angel of death, though Loki himself had already been put down on several occaisions by the Serrafim warrior. Two longswords with slightly curving blades hung on his right side; one on the hip, another at the shoulder. The moon glinted upon his dull-colored body, and Serrafrah glowed again, enwrapping himself in the luminescent warmth of the Transcendent. He smiled, and tucked his wings a bit, making a dive for the populated city below. Time to enter the spirit body...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crawff flexed his hands; nothing good ever came from run-ins with angels or demons. Both were trouble, and both thought little more of vampires than that they were vermin. Vampiric vermin, eh? Crawff chuckled at the sound of it.<br>
<br>
He decided not to worry; after all, he'd not see the first blow, and it would most likely kill him. Angels were like that. Judge first, ask questions later. He leapt to the top of a building, awaiting the coming- &quot;OOF!!&quot;<br>
<br>
A kick to his back sent Crawff flying into the brick wall of a building adjacent to the one he sat upon. He pried his head loose, and was assaulted by a pair of fists, each burning into his flesh as if it were a cross touching a normal vampire. But, then again, Crawff just finished his 5 millionth...<br>
<br>
Serrafrah whipped his agile, feather-light body around and kicked for Crawff's head. The vampire ducked, though barely, and the red eyes blazed light trails through the night air before claws caught the angel in his gut. Serrafrah clouted him with a left, and sent the vampire sprawling into the center of the roof, angelic flesh in hand.<br>
<br>
Crawff bounced backwards, hitting shoulders first, and flipping up and over head. Using his hand to push off, Crawff gained a bit more air, hit the other building, and ricocheted off it. Serrafrah laughed at the catapult move, and quickly sidestepped left, thinking to draw his hip-blade with the left hand, spin, and end the battle. Crawff was a bit more crafty...<br>
<br>
Instead of ignoring the weapons, Crawff made it a point to grab on of these angelic swords as soon as possible, and did just that when Serrafrah stepped out of the way, giving Crawff a clear shot for the longsword. As he flew past, the vampire yanked it out of the sheath, and blocked the sword aimed to cleave him in two- mostly by luck. With five yards now separating the surrealistic beings, they began circling each other and taunting, waiting for a weak moment. &quot;So, vampire,&quot; started Serrafrah. &quot;Feed off the weak often?&quot;<br>
<br>
With cold, dead eyes, and a dry wit about him, Crawff replied, &quot;Been doing it for centuries.&quot; This truly seemed to knock the angel back a bit, for he stopped circling.<br>
<br>
&quot;W... what do you mean, centuries? Surely, you cannot be more than half a century old!&quot; Crawff pointed his chin up with a smug look on his face. &quot;I've kept the population down myself, foolish half-demon. Don't try to fool me in this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crawff's eyes finally went wide with recognition; &quot;Y-y-yyyou? You're... that Blinding Death one, ain'tcha?&quot; It was Serrafrah's turn to raise a chin. &quot;Sarahsbra, wasn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The angel's eye twitched. &quot;Serrafrah. Show due respect, filth. And who might you be, to boast to have escaped my purging wrath upon this world, the splinter in my thumb that will be removed to ensure the worlds' safety?&quot;<br>
<br>
With the flick of his left wrist, Crawff created a cloak of shadows about himself. He hadn't really known he could, or how to, but he did... &quot;Crawff Riddle, you self-righteous bigot. Protector of the Deserving, Sweeper of the Streets, Master of Disguise, and Profaner of your Churches.&quot; He bowed, nearly elegantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wasn't Master of Disguise a movie or something?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, it was pretty gay, too...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Serrafrah's nearly-jovial attitude turned black again. &quot;And don't get me started on &quot;my churches&quot;. Just who do you think was burning them down every time I saw a vampire entering one? God? PAH! They misinterpret My Light. It hates their bigomy almost as much as I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crawff produced a cummerbund from a pocket. &quot;Then you don't mind the blood stains on the priest outfits I bury you in, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bury me?&quot; he chuckled. &quot;O, hark, you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> too</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> kind.&quot; Serrafrah's wings opened and lent his spiritually attuned body speed, glistening with newly exposed beauty in the full moon's light. He brought the sword trailing behind him to the fore, and made a wide arc just as Crawff jumped over his outstretched wings. The vampire wasn't quick enough, however, to turn in time. Serrafrah hit the wall, flipped over, and charged belly-up, slicing deeply across the vamp's back. Thirty feet above the roof, Serrafrah flapped joyfully and laughed maniacally.<br>
<br>
&quot;A hideously insane angel?? You ARE Serrafrah! SERRAFRAH OF THE <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> BLOOD   LUST!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; The laughter stopped.<br>
<br>
The angel's pale eyes narrowed. &quot;What did you call me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU heard me, you slaughtering, dishonorable OUTCAST! TRAITOR! You know WHY the Serrafim won't take you back! YOU know it! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE BLOODLUST!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; Crawff's hands were now cupped around his mouth, attempting to drive the angel mad. He'd heard before that it previously worked on this particular protector of the Material Plane... though the repercussions were grave indeed when he recovered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up shut up shut up ShUT UP SHUT UPSHUTUP<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SHUTUUUUUPPPP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!!! QUIET, VERMIN!&quot; White light energy gathered at his feathertips and exploded in vibrancy, shaking the bricks loose of the buildings on every side, when he flapped once towards Crawff. &quot;CRAWFF Riddle! By the Power vested in me, I CLEANSE YOOOOUUUUU!&quot; With one mighty hand, he batted aside Crawff's stolen longsword, and plunged his right-hand blade deep into the vampire's chest. It came out the other side, along with a few pints of cold, black blood.<br>
<br>
Crawff's eyes grew wide and clouded with blood. Serrafrah removed his sword from the vamp's hands, and sheathed them both, grunting in satisfaction. White light crept out from the wound, pouring over Crawff's body. &quot;This is Purifying Light; a spell I have on my swords at all times.&quot; Crawff's back arched, his fingers curled, and he started choking again on the ground. &quot;It will force you to look back on all your wretched deeds and show you just how vile your life has been.&quot; Crawff screamed as his eyes began to clear. &quot;Those with the blackest of hearts, ones such as you, and ALL soulless vampires, will be brought the most 'purgatory' pain before your life force is expended.&quot; For another two minutes, Serrafrah watched as Crawff writhed in agony. Two minutes was longer than any vampire he'd brought to justice. &quot;You must have done some quite horrific things in your past... especially if you truly *are* centuries old-&quot;<br>
<br>
In a gutteral, blended voice of multiple entities, Crawff growled, &quot;7 centuries! 50 years! At least!&quot; He rose to his feet, and Serrafrah gasped, stepping back. &quot;Countless animals! IT WAS PURE NEED! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> GODS, I DIDN'T ENJOY IT! C'MONNN!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What... *are* you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crawff's maddened, raging rambling kept spilling from his slightly psychotic mouth. &quot;And Betsy, oh-ho-ho! She deserved it more than any! SHE WASN'T INNOCENNNNNT! Can't you SEE the way she smashed their hearts? Can't you SEEEE!?&quot; He clutched the back of his head and doubled over. &quot;The other.... 52... you've... ARGH! shown me... AAAaaAAAaaAAAaaAAAAAAAAAHHH! This isn't FAIR! I NEEDED TO LIVVVVVE! I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SPARED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> families</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!! I DEFENDED them, on three occasions each! I SACRIFICED! I REPENTED! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEEEEEEEEEVE MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->[/b]&quot;<br>
<br>
The light just sort of... puffed out. Poof! There was a jingling sound, and the blood pouring out of Crawff's body was glowing red again, not the black blood of cold undeath. The blood that had stained his mouth was warm again, as well- he licked it from his lips. &quot;Mmmm... minty!&quot;<br>
<br>
Serrafrah's eyes were as wide as dinner plates; &quot;You... how could you...! How-   y-  y-you... Deeeah er BRAAAAHHH! Df...! Gya! NNNNRRRRAACCKK!&quot; He was on the brink of pulling out his own hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, hippy angel freak.&quot; the vamp spoke cooly, and without any remnant of the previous pain. &quot;Wanna lesson in vampirism?&quot;<br>
<br>
Serrafrah whirled around, light streaming from his hands, and cascading around his body. His eyes shone with a luminescense of heavans above, and the hands transmuted into gauntlets of energy. His dull gray robes swirled about him in his rage, and he screamed, &quot;SURE! LET'S HAVE IT!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Crawff smirked. &quot;Ignoring the tone. Well, for starters, you got your newborn, an infant so to speak. Inadept. Sloppy. Blood being the only thing on their mind; to feed, and nothing more. Those are the self-absorbed ones you're used to killing. They don't choose carefully, and they leave so much to be wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go onnNNN!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Temper temper, o humble bringer of light. The second stage is the learned. We become more articulate, more aware, less subjectable to the myths &amp; fables our minds tell us might be true. We're stronger, smarter, more able. Then comes the third stage, the tutor. What better way to learn best about the world than to teach another infant? Doing this gains greater experience and unlocks more strengths, more abilities.<br>
<br>
&quot;But then, somewhere after the 5 millionth kill, which few ever reach, is the ultimate change. We become True Vampire, body and soul, and our own hands become cloven weapons of defense, our gaze a hypnotic allure, our bodies solid plates of steel and diamond. Guess what I've reached earlier today,  angel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your 5 millionth kill. You seem pretty low-key, normal grade vamp to me. Now let's get this party started!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Slow down, sparky. I've not had a chance to change. Is this how you treat the ladies? No wonder you're a loner...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SHUT UPPPP!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; Serrafrah started towards the vampire again, tendrils of light twining down his body &amp; swords.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait! Let me get to full strength. I'll show you the TRUE power of vermin!&quot; It seemed as if shadows began bending to Crawff's command... as if they materialized, became vaporous, amorphous shapes that pressed up against his body, flowing upward from the ground, and encompassing the vampire. He started seething, and laboring for breath. The normal crimson glow of rage to his eyes became a fervent, continuous light, shadowing his hunched body further. Shadows flowed upwards like gravity-impared liquid from his forearms and shoulders, and the rooftop shook for an instant. Then he exploded.<br>
<br>
Crawff threw his arms backwards, loosing the shadows behind him, contorting them into a black, tattered cape. Sores and gashes opened up all over his body, on his arms, legs, chest, back, neck. On his forehead, and on both shoulders, large eyes opened, their pupils staring out dully and aimlessly. His four fingers became two claws, and the thumb grew as well. Bruises discolored the pale skin, and blood gushed from the numerous wounds. Crawff's silvery, beautiful hair, then turned black and grew together into spikes. Alltogether more menacing, but had he a mirror, he'd have been displeased...<br>
<br>
Serrafrah kept a cold face of indifference. No way could this vampire have that kind of energy after warding off a Purifying Light stab- straight to the heart, no less. No matter, we'd see this to the end...<br>
<br>
&quot;C'mon, fly boy. Show me whatcha got.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 415<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/02 7:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random Character Misinterpretation; Fite Seeen.</span><hr size=1> Blood poured out from Crawff's body as he taunted the angel. Serrafrah glared in luminescent rage as he rematerialized the previously knocked away sword into his right hand. The angel grinned as he filled his body with spiritual energy; no way a vamp could operate on the spiritual plane.<br>
<br>
But there he was, there was Crawff, dripping with gravity-impaired voids of light streaming from his body, as well as blood and puss covering his skin. No matter; he fought Garrilon like this almost daily.<br>
<br>
The already tiring angel sped forth, bringing both points of his longswords in front, attempting a double-piercing maneuver to end this fight quickly. A loud crash was heard, and light rippled across some kind of non-visible shield in front of the vampire. Crawff smiled, pleased with himself. Three more swipes, the angel took, and not one of them penetrated. The red light in the newly revamped vamp's eyes glowed brighter red as he smiled. With one arm, he reached out and grabbed a hold of Serrafrah's gray robes, pulling the angel closer to him.<br>
<br>
In the spiritual plane, all vibrations and energies are visible; heat, light, sound, kinetics, movement, mental exertions. From Crawff's eyes radiated circles, almost as if someone had dropped pebbles into his sockets and his face was a pond. The vampire smiled as Serrafrah was held helpless in his grip. &quot;So this is how ol' Drac's did it, eh?&quot; he chuckled. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=22.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=22.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=1><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.threadControl?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8>Stories by:  Mindles Kali</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
