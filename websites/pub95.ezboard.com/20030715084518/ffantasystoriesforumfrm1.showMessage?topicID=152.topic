Perfect for blood to be spilt.<br>
<br>
The Year is unknown. but is ,is around the medieval type era.<br>
<br>
Tonight is part of a very special ceremony, dedicated to the dark god<br>
Nights like this his servents play in the guises of mortals, such as humans. One of the easiest targets for these creatures of darkness..Their negavtive emotions act as  a bright beacon. Hatred attractions warrior demons, Fear..the devourers, Lonelyness the Incubi and Succubi, each emotion to a demon group. One of the these..one of the strongest emotions is the death of all..The Destoryers..or Breaker’s there called.<br>
<br>
One Human..has Harnessed the power of an age old Destoryer known as Lokira<br>
<br>
<br>
Tonight, marks its frist real mission….<br>
<br>
Let the Nightmare…..<br>
<br>
Begin<br>
<br>
<br>
(Under the Demon’s moon, Friday night)<br>
<br>
hair like midnight blew  from the head of the possessed man. Eyes burning with unbridled power, his clothes were a mesh of black cloth and bandages. Two long blades hung at each hip, marked with Lokira’s runes, granting each superb strength over the Void element.<br>
<br>
He crouched low, the wind blew harshly as it commanding him to stop. He leaped forward twisting his body all around landing on a nearby building…breaking into a run his feet only touching the roof’s singles for seconds as he leaped up high into the air his arms up. Crashing down atleast 20 feet away. Spinning around , his blood colored eyes looked around….<br>
“Nothing” muttering lightly as he stood up from his crouch, surveying the area.<br>
<br>
A fairly large complex. A castle, it was late by anyone’s standards..Midnight.<br>
<br>
Alwas Midnight<br>
<br>
Forever Midnight<br>
 He cracked a small smile, drawing forth the daemonic blades crossing them at his chest.<br>
In his mind he saw his target. A Paladin, mounting forces on a nearby caveren filled with his brethren..<br>
<br>
He…..Will…..Die<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He felt the Dark force, Lokira call to him. A voice like black silk<br>
Go..There are 4 guards..Mundane weapons…rend them all<br>
<br>
He complied breaking into a run, his blades held behind him soon he  came in range of their arrows<br>
A sloider in shotty chainmail”HALT! YOU MAY NOT ENTER!” he held up his hand..or what was left of it as  the  man’s blade cleaved it in half. The guard staggered away as his throat was silt. The man whirled around behind him slashing deep into another guard’s chest that was trying to ambush him. He leaped up spinning his blades cacthing two arrows… he backflipped onto the bleeding guards shoulders and leaped up another arrow….  It hit him dead on  and out of his shoulder sending a splatter of blood<br>
Is this pain?….<br>
<br>
 Another thru his stomach as he hit the castle wall… he began to use the blades as climbing implements climbing up<br>
<br>
Pain…Pain..sweet….pain…yes..Perfect<br>
<br>
 He leaped up lashing out at the nearest archer slashing thru the flimsy bow he jabbed the blade deep within the man’s heart twisting it the other archer ran away. The crimson eyed man found him,  flipping around his blade cacthing it inbetween his index and  thumb, hurled it at him,  spinning thru the air it caught the man in the back of the head, he stopped…. Attempted to look back, and simply fell. The blood eyed man removed his blade backflipping away kicking the corpse away onto the earth.<br>
“…Weaklings..” he scoffed…as the arrow wounds began to heal already<br>
<br>
Pain gone, Too bad<br>
<br>
He walked down the halls, death followed with him, the once immaculate carpet was now a crimson hue.  His blades cleaved thru the knights like  Death’s scythe thru souls.<br>
<br>
<br>
He finally came upon the Paladin, His Target…<br>
<br>
He was rather tall, as expected pristine white chainmail covered his body. Stereotypical blonde hair cut short, no facial hair, bright blue eyes.<br>
<br>
“You’ve killed..everyone here haven’t you?” the paladin said, the sword at his side seemed to repel all darkness, the Red eyed man stepped inside<br>
“Chosen of Lokira…Why do you not answer me?” he kept calm, The Chosen could feel his hate…and fed on it….as his aura became visible a dark glimmer around him.<br>
<br>
“Youre damned soul shall join the ranks of Lokira” the Chosen said in an emotionless voice. The Paladin blinked….drawing the longsword from his side gripping it tight as blue white flames erupted forth. Classic….<br>
<br>
“….What is it with you holy types and your flaming weapons?…” The Chosen shook his head drawing his  bloodied blades.<br>
<br>
 He stood their arms low at his side their blood slowly running off<br>
“Come…Join your comrade’s ,there souls cry out for you…” The Paladin charged screaming the name of his god, making a huge downward slash, The chosen twisted to the side sticking his blade down ripping deep in his side thru the chainmail, the paladin gasped..and staggered to the side.<br>
<br>
 The Chosen moved the blade to his mouth as he licked it , smiling darkly<br>
 The paladin blinked and stepped back, using this  instant the chosen ran forward his blades twirled in air spinning around arcing toward’s the Paladin’s exposed neck, hitting blood splattered them both, as a final blade struck the paladin between the eyes impaling his brain. His body spasmed once..then dead as his lifeblood gushed forth, the chosen put his leg on the once paladin’s stomach and kicked him off, a sicking slurp and grinding like sound came from the gory blade in his skull.<br>
 He wiped the blades off on the paladin sheathing them as he walked leisurely away.<br>
<br>
( 2 weeks later)<br>
<br>
A friend of the paladin came to the damned place. He saw the blood and the ripped up bodies,  his eyes widened in horror as he ran inside, the stench nearly made him double over. He walked thru the decaying halls….bodies strewn around some halfways inebebbed into the walls…blood and gore everywhere…files and rats had started to nest here..he saw the sight of a man cut in half maggots  everywhere….nearly vomiting he ran past it.<br>
 He climbed the stairs on the way to the Paladin’s room..entering. he saw him perfectly fine his armor was a bit bloody and a grotsue scar was down his face, between his eyes the blue eyes looked rather..haunted<br>
“…Marius?” the man said as he embraced the paladin….”I thought you where” he said, best friends since they were children… a sharp pain thru his adobmen brought him back, a long skeletal claw whent thru. Belonging to the  Marius..The Paladin<br>
 blood came forth from his mouth as he gaped looking at him, as his eyes slowly began to glow red,  his skin decayed rapibly…a Undead<br>
“NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”<br>
<br>
his screams echoed on for seemingly a millennia<br>
No one goes there know, the stench alone is enough to keep tresspassers out<br>
<br>
The bard finished his tale at the shocked audience, he was rather attractive,  but starlting similar to  a certain character in this story, as the audience of the tavern blinked looking over him, simple traveling garments, his eyes where a bright blue, with long blonde hair, and a very small scar between his eyes”This was the tale of the damned Castle, I hope you enjoyed it” he smiled lightly, each of the audience members talked to him a tad, eyeing the scar warily, giving him a few gold coins…around midnight he retired<br>
<br>
“Hehehhe…” he smiled lightly<br>
<br>
“Its so easy to tell the same story again…and again..When do they learn?” closing the door of his room leaning against it<br>
<br>
Lokira spoke to him now<br>
&lt;Why do you delight in the day of your death so?…&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;..The way of a traveling bard is …what I wanted..before your chosen killed me&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;You still need blood to remain with your human visague&gt;<br>
&lt;I know&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Why do you do it?&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Immortality hasn’t become a living hell….&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Yet?&gt;<br>
&lt;Yet, When it does..You’ll have your Fallen Knight back&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Good…&gt; it hissed inside his mind as he crumpled into a heap asleep…<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This  just happened..Still I NEED a editor, Please anyone willing to help that knows my writing well enough to help?<br>
*gets puppy dog eyes* Plwwease?<br>
Hope you like it..It lost some of its charm at the end for me atleast..I wanted to do so much more..But  just didnt work out that way.. <p>- its so easy when your evil!<br>

I haven't read a blood bath story like this in awhile, and spelling/grammar aside, it was very good. You are very skilled with the gruesome details, almost made me run to the bathroom and empty my stomach out. (Not quite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
It was kind of confusing toward the end when it switched scenes to the bard, so you might want to use ***** or something like that when you change settings.<br>
<br>
Kind of reminds me of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, when the guy jumps across the roofs at the beginning.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just fix up all the grammar/spelling mistakes and you have yourself a good story here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 415<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/16/03 6:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Shot</span><hr size=1> Thanks man ^^<br>
