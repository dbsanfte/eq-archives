You never ever leave your friends in the last bar. The ego's are so inflated there, that if you even think about looking at another guys girl, you are in a fight. But then again, eye contact is eye contact. So get a little stretch in so you don't hurt something beating up the boyfriend, and you can hurt something later while with the girl. Take that last drink, and throw caution (and the boyfriend) out the window. That's exactly what I did, when the same thing happened to me. I said hi to the girl, punched out the boy, and bought her a drink while my friends took out the others. When it was all said and done and the credits were rolling.... uhh... credits.... oh yeah... I don't drink, don't go to bars, and I'm watching this on TV at home. Huh... go figure.<br>

I am a watcher...  I personally would always take the &quot;safe mark&quot;, for the same reason I don't duel, hate violence...<br>
<br>
There are some females out there who do it on purpose because they &quot;get off&quot; on watching the results...   it doesn't matter to them which one they go home with...<br>
<br>
I have seen it more than once...  the girl comes to the bar/club with one guy and after they get settled, she starts browsing the crowd...  to the guy she makes eye contact with, it seems there is no one else around, especially after a few drinks...  to me at the other end of the bar, it is a stage and the first act has just begun...<br>
<br>
it almost always ends the same way, though the guy she goes home with changes from time to time, the one she came in with or the one she made eye contact with...<br>
<br>
Now to be fair, before I get pummeled by the females, I have seen it done the other way around, guys and girls reversed, but not nearly as often and here is why...<br>
<br>
For the guy, the ultimate goal is the sex...  for the girl, the sex is important, but maybe not the ultimate goal...   When the girl plays out the scenario above, she wins either way...   if the guy plays it out, he has a chance of not going home with anyone, hence becoming &quot;the loser&quot; and not meeting his ultimate goal...  most guys would not be willing to make that sacrifice just to see a possible &quot;cat fight&quot;...<br>
<br>
hehe, I analyze more than just computer systems...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   It was early spring when instead of snow, ya get wet (and sometimes cold) rain falling. It was a Thursday night and my ship was due to head out to sea for three weeks the next day. Oh, and that little voice in the back of my head (the one that screams logical things like: STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. SHIP LEAVES TOMARROW. STAY ON THE BOAT. DON&quot;T STAY OUT LATE. SEE A MOVIE. DON'T DRINK TONIGHT; well, that voice had stepped out. So, I went drinking. Thursday, not clubnight week-end. Finally ended up at a bar down by the beachside that was a little bit more packed then the other clubs (but the night was young). I ran into a slightly younger buddy of mine whom was still old enough to drink. &quot;Whatcha drinkin'?! First round's on me!&quot; was how it started. So we were alternating rounds of beer for a bit. THEN a discount shot, then a beer, then &quot;Firewater&quot; (cininamon shot, like Goldschlager), then the dance music started. He, being thin as a pole and shy, had the women buying him handing him the free drinks they were getting (promotion to get the girls on the dance floor). By this point I recall I was plastered. Oh, before the Heinekin I last drank before the incident, I had purged my system of the offending &quot;Firewater&quot; (the whole night is the reason I now swear off the stuff). So I'm in the smoky club chillin with a heiniekin. I'm enjoyin the music, watchin the ladies and my friend. Deciding that I'm gonna switch to cokes next cause I certainly gotta drive back to my ship in the near future. (that's the time the logic voice came back from it's vacation. Oh, but before my next stupid move, the voice found the booze I was drinking and got plastered too). &quot;Way too smokey in this club. I gotta go outside for a minute.&quot; I thought. So apparently, it's against the law to walk out of an establishment (that serves alcohol) drunk. Wow. Love the logic of the Commenwealth Of Virginia. Let's put a cop outside of a place and tell him to pick up everyone that comes out. Isn't that like putting $10 on a bench in a park and then wait for someone to pick it up so you can accuse them of stealing your money? Well, here's where luck stepped in for me... sorta. Shore patrol was there (Naval police) and picked me up. My buddy was still inside and NO amount of talking was going to convince the cop OR shore patrol to help me get him out of there, or get a message to him. They take me to a holding cell for about 15 minutes (striped down of all items but shirt, socks, pants, and underwear). Then we go get into a van to take me back to my ship. They pass by my vehicle in it's parking spot (and I point it out to them), and the cheerfully say &quot;Well, hopefully it will be there when you get back.&quot; (3 week out to sea cruise + car parked in church owned lot rented out on week-ends= ?) We then enroute pick up another drunk sailor (more drunk than me oddly enough) and he instantly starts talkin smack like: &quot;Oh, I'm an MP and they're just going to let me off scot free for this back on my boat! You guys should be nicer to me cause I'm an MP and you guys are shore patrol. we're related.&quot; So, that little voice I was telling you about? the one that said it was ok to go outside (in the rain) for some fresh air, it spoke to me again. This time with an evil intent. So, as he's (other drunk) talkin smack, I'm in the back (handcuffed mostly since I was picked up BTW) of this van instagating: &quot;They said you shouldn't put your feet up on the bench like that. Shhhh... they said keep your voice low. You should be nicer. Get your feet off the seat.&quot; To which his replys were something like: &quot;Shut up. Why are you takin their side?&quot; *insert evil laughter here* They stop the van and hogtie him. That's right, hands and feet bound up behind his back like a calf at a rodeo. Heh heh. Physically lifted him back into the van, and he layed their chest on the cold steel. His taunts changed a little, but not pleasantly. You're just suckin up to them. I'm an MP. I ain't gettin in trouble for this. Quit suckin up.&quot; Which the comical reply from the fron of the van was: &quot;At least he's going to be walking back on  board his ship shipmate. we're going to be carrying you onboard.&quot;<br>
The Next Day: Turns out my buddy lost his sweater. Oh, and he was picked up by the real cops as he slept on the hood of his car. Public Drunkeness: $150 fine, $lots to get the car out of impound. My car after we got back from our 3 weeks out to sea? Still safly parked in the church lot where I had pulled in that Thursday night. Yup, that $5 parking pass went a long way that day. Heh heh. I received the &quot;You're a superior to him. You should set the example&quot; lecture from the officers on my ship. (^.^) I thought I was setting an example: follow me close or hang out in the club and pay for it later. Ok, it was very evil of me, but it was purly by accident that I was picked up. Moral lesson: Don't leave a club to get fresh air. The air inside is always going to be fresher than stail air in a holding cell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm15.showMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm15.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm13">Family News Archives<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
