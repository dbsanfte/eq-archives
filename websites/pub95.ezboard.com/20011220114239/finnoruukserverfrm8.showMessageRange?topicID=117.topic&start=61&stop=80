<br>
We are getting flamed for enforcing a no-fly zone?  I don't know, I would think preventing a government from using Chemical and Biological weapons against civilians isn't something to be blasted for.  And of course Iraq was just minding their own business until the evil US decided to take over their country.  Why don't you go ask the Women and children R4ped and T0rtured in Kuwait if they think the US should have stayed out?  You are mixing where we are meddling with where we are doing harm, I would argue the Kurds are better off with us enforcing this zone then without us.  And while the Kurds are insurgents, are they doing this just because of us, or is it maybe because they've been oppressed and killed by the government they are fighting against?  You are ignoring the fact that most countries in that region have a strong, armed resistance movement.  You're right I guess, any goverment should have the ability to treat their citizens any way they like, so Tianmen Square was an appropriate response in your eyes.<br>
<br>
Castro?  First of all, Cuba is not as bad off as many people think, it's heads and shoulders above the lifestyles in Afghanistan or large parts of many African countries as an example.  Second of all, Cuba is the way it is because of their government policies.  Blame the US all you want, we were never able to maintain a sufficient embargo between Cuba and the USSR for instance, so they have had their opportunities to better themselves, and have to a certain extent.  But this is just another example, don't blame the government that causes hardship, blame America.  Cuba's not bad off because of our embargo, Cuba suffers from it's governmental policies.  <br>
<br>
The Freedom fighters are a mixed bunch, in S. America or in the Middle East and Europe.  On the one hand, the people they are fighting are typically extremely brutal.  On the other hand, the fighters we back are not usually much better.  But I thought you said we shouldn't stand by and do nothing.  <br>
<br>
I definately challenge the assertion that America kills more people through our action then anyone else.  Pol Pot not only killed millions of people, he also killed their infrastructure by targetting lawyers, doctors, etc.  You know one of his criteria was to kill people with glasses because that meant they were smart and therefore a threat?  Adolf Schickelgruber killed 6 million Jews that we know about.  Not to mention a @#$@ load of other people.  Stalin killed how many million?  I'm sorry, the US is a complete N00bie when it comes to Genocide.  Go visit the Sudan and tell them you are a Christian.  In fact bring your Wife and Mother and then when they are done with them (if you live, they won't), come back and tell us how horrible we are.<br>
<br>
Wolfy, people die in the US from those things as well.  Cuba is not a good example if you want to show how horrible we are, what's the ratio of people dying in Mexico to those things vs. Cuba?  I really don't understand, you say it would be morally reprehensible to do nothing, but in the several paragraphs leading up to this statement you flame the US for doing something.  When it comes to governments, there are no innocents, no Snow Whites.  <br>
<br>
But I still see nothing in any of these responses that would let me tell a parent who lost a child in the terrorist attacks what their child did to deserve to die.  Wolfy, I will buy you and me a Plane ticket to NY if you can go tell each and every child that lost a parent why their parents deserved to die.  I'll go with you to the Firemans and Policemans Guild to hear your dissertation on why those Policemen and Firemen deserved to die.  I've got some vacation time coming, when shall we leave?<br>
<br>
Those people going to work on 9/11 had done nothing to those Terrorists that could ever be justified in the taking of their lives.  Who knows though, if some of these responses are from Americans maybe we can get Buchanan elected.  He promises to stay out of World affairs.  It would be horrible but interesting to see what would have happened if Pearl Harbor had not taken place.  I doubt America would have gotten involved unless MAYBE the UK got invaded.  It wouldn't really matter I guess, many in the countries who have the standards of living they do now BECAUSE of the US still hate us, maybe we shouldn't have lost our lives in the effort to protect yours.  I'd like to hear from some of you in other countries about the good that your goverment is doing around the world to contrast with all the bad stuff the US is doing.  At least we try to make the world a better place.  Or we could stick our heads in the sand I suppose right next to yours, then maybe we wouldn't be so horrible.<br>
<br>
As someone of Polish descent, I know what happens when America ignores the pleas of innocent blood being slaughtered by tyranny.  Regardless of any other reasons why the US gets involved, if their actions save a culture or a people I'm going to stand behind them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#778899>(11/6/01 4:40:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> Quote<br>

I dont think (reserve myself for missing this statement somewhere in this thread) that anyone stated that america kills more people thorugh its action then anyone else.<br>
<br>
regarding polpot etc. If you read my post again, polpot, hitler and stalin were not compared to the US in anyway, nor did i suggest that US was anything like that. One poster implied that he didnt care if 3 persons died, or 3 millions, or 3 billions, as long as he did not know them. I then took these three horrible examples from human history, and asked if he really didnt care about them, as he didnt know any of them that died. I never implied that US had commited genocide. <br>
Veeery big differance with what you are saying.<br>
<br>
===========================<br>
I'd like to hear from some of you in other countries about the good that your goverment is doing around the world to contrast with all the bad stuff the US is doing. At least we try to make the world a better place. <br>
===========================<br>
<br>
You are getting defensive with no reason. Noone has said that US is doing all the bad stuff and everyone else is angels. The thread was started with one person asking to get more info about what other people could consider crimes against the world made by US, and thats the matter that has been discussed. <br>
<br>
US is doing a great deal of good things to the world. But not to be a saint, but for the US to benefit from it. Thats prio 1, if its a good thing for other people its a bonus of course. US also choose to ignore some things that would not be popular, as its not in US interests to lose standing with the goverment. (Saudi arabia for example). As are all countries. Its just that the US got a a huge economy and has big intersts and means to affect what happens in the world. Some of these things are quite nasty, like it or not. <br>
<br>
Read the posts again, and dont exagerate / change the things being said in them.<br>
<br>
I think we all can agree that the no 1 reason US / UN walked into kuweit was because of the oil, not to save women and children from r4ape. If the later was true, the US and the world would have reacted much faster and with much firmness in, for example, ex jugoslavia. Because the western world had a lot to loose if kuweit would fall, we acted swiftly. This was not the case in ex jugoslavia, as there werent that much to be gained. (unfortunately, human lifes and suffering doesnt count that much when doing that kind of assessments it seems). They acted fast in kuweit, as they had alot of interests in that region, not to be nice guys. One strong reason with finally acting in that region, is that the conflict eventually could spread to surrounding countries, which would not be a good thing.<br>
<br>
Why didnt anyone go into Afghanistan 10 years ago and try to stop the war amongst those people? We and our goverments new about it, knew about their being alot of extremists, and that people were suffering a great deal. Why didnt we do anything? Simple. We didnt have enough to gain from it. Sad but true. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thinn</A> at: 11/6/01 5:00:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udeninawolfrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Denina Wolfrider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#778899>(11/6/01 5:53:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> I was actually hoping that Kutee and Gumaruk (former and current guildmates who hate me badly) would respond to this thread, for it was their generalized claims which got me to thinking that maybe we are Evil Incarnate. But they didn't respond to this thread, which leads me to believe that maybe they can't offer any actual evidence to support their claims.<br>
<br>
That's okay, because I did learn a lot in this thread, and even sympathize a great deal with Ugle's views on it. (Even though he hates me too, so much so that he ranks me with DoW, which we all know he gets along with SOOOO well.)<br>
<br>
But, I am only an egg. I think about the fact that we tried to stay out of WWI and WWII and it didn't work because other nations asked us to get involved. (And the ambitions of our own politicians.) I think for a lot of our involvements, someone was asking us to come to their aid. A lot, not all. We tried the hands off thing, and it didn't work.<br>
<br>
I am one of those Americans that thinks we spend too much time meddled in the affairs of others. <br>
<br>
One last note, my husband was reading the other day that there are more Jews living in New York than there are in Israel. Helps to shed some light on our policies over there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#778899>(11/6/01 7:01:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> Heh who's getting defensive.  I'll tell you what Thinn, how many Africans died from that Hospital being bombed?  How many Africans are dying and have died at the hands of other Africans?  It reminds me of our Inner-Cities, where people look at black on white crime, or white on black crime, while ignoring the black on black and white on white crime statistics, which are typically much higher then crimes commited across racial lines.  They then talk about racial crime without addressing the real problem, which is crime.<br>
<br>
You accuse me of being defensive for asking what other governments are doing that makes them better then us.  I think it's a valid question.  If you want to criticize the American gov't, my challenge to you is to point out what we could do that we aren't that other governments are doing.  You remind me of Aldrin, always willing to blast someone's actions with no solutions of your own that would be feasible.  I still assert that while we aren't perfect, the US government is better then any other one that comes to mind.<br>
<br>
As far as the nerve agents go, what is your solution then?  If we do nothing, then we are turning our backs on those people.  If we create a no-fly zone, we are &quot;meddling&quot; and as you point out, it could be gotten around (just not as safely for the government troops).  If we occupied the territory, then we are meddling even more.  I don't get offended by dialogue, but I don't hear anything productive from any of your arguments.  Besides, since this is all about oil, why are we defending the Kurds?  We aren't getting any oil from them, so what is the explanation?<br>
<br>
And while the results might be the same in your scenario about us bombing the Hospital, you are IMO trying to make everything morally equivalent.  People commit atrocities killing others, and the Americans blew up a hospital which led to people dying so we are no better then they are from what I am reading.  Do you know how Christian Women are killed in the Sudan?  I'm not even going to get into it on a public forum, but it's really really sickening.  Perhaps you then Thinn could write a letter to the NY Times explaining how everyone in the Trade Center deserved to die?  How come I rarely see anyone condemning this latest Terrorist attack except for those of us &quot;Nationalist B ullshit&quot; people?  I wish nobody was dying for anyones policies.  But to take the loss of 5K+ innocent people in the matter of several minutes and then say that American policy over the last several decades is why those people deserved to die is the sign of someone with no moral values at all.<br>
<br>
America's foreign policies have had their successes as well as their failures.  To ignore it's successes while lambasting it for it's questionable or failed policies is the sign of a little mind.  About that African Medical Center that was bombed.  I wonder how many of those supplies were there from American government and American Charities in the first place.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#778899>(11/6/01 8:18:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> quote<br>

===========<br>
<br>
If you read my previous post, it was estimated that 10 to 20k people died from the bombing of the medical supply store. Not hospital. UN started an investigation but it got Vetoed by the US.<br>
<br>
===================<br>
How many Africans are dying and have died at the hands of other Africans?<br>
===================<br>
I dont know. And thats not what we are discussing is it?<br>
<br>
===============<br>
You accuse me of being defensive for asking what other governments are doing that makes them better then us<br>
===============<br>
<br>
Thats a perfectly valid question. However, that is not how it was written in the previous post where it was ... (quote again heh)<br>
================<br>
I'd like to hear from some of you in other countries about the good that your goverment is doing around the world to contrast with all the bad stuff the US is doing. <br>
================<br>
To me it sounds like US is only doing bad things and other countries are doing good deeds. Its not. All nation are equally rotten ;=) well you get the idea<br>
<br>
===============<br>
You remind me of Aldrin, always willing to blast someone's actions with no solutions of your own that would be feasible<br>
===============<br>
<br>
Im not blasting US actions. Im merely stating that US, as other countries, are doing stuff for their own good formost, not to be the good guys. If they can be good guys as well, then thats a bonus.<br>
<br>
================<br>
Besides, since this is all about oil, why are we defending the Kurds?<br>
================<br>
<br>
It was an agreement between the US and the kurds in Irak, as the US actively supported the kurds to overthrow Sadam Husein, and US promised prolonged support for this. However, after the war they did not get the monetary etc support that they were promised. But i agree, keeping the no flight zone cleared is better then nothing.<br>
<br>
Here i got another example for you, conserning the Kurd issue. IF US would support kurds in general, why arent US condemning and taking say economic actions against Turkey, where hundreds of kurds get killed each year in inwar fighting? Easy. The interest of having turkey in good standing with the US outweights the kurd issue. The countries interest is no1, being morally right is no 2. This goes for all countries.<br>
<br>
=====================<br>
People commit atrocities killing others, and the Americans blew up a hospital which led to people dying so we are no better then they are from what I am reading.<br>
=====================<br>
<br>
Hmm, implicitly this sounds as you think you you are worth more then people from other countries with other cultures just because you are an American? If i misunderstood i appologize. If i didnt then.. you are wrong.<br>
<br>
==================<br>
Do you know how Christian Women are killed in the Sudan?<br>
==================<br>
<br>
No but i can take some wild guesses, and it aint pretty. Its not so pretty either killing people with the electric chair. There have been numerous reports of people not dying til the third and fourth attempt, eyes poping out while they are still alive etc etc etc. Saudi Arabia also kills people in a nasty way as well. US very actively support the regime in Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
=================<br>
Perhaps you then Thinn could write a letter to the NY Times explaining how everyone in the Trade Center deserved to die?<br>
=================<br>
No i can not, and it was a disgusting deed indeed. We therfore both know the answer to the question, so why bother to answer it? <br>
<br>
==================<br>
But to take the loss of 5K+ innocent people in the matter of several minutes and then say that American policy over the last several decades is why those people deserved to die is the sign of someone with no moral values at all.<br>
==================<br>
Absolutely. I couldnt agree more. <br>
<br>
What i am saying is (again): All countries strive for their own good formost, and think that a few broken eggs are ok. If its good for people in general its a bonus. Some stuff are downright ugly, and is therefore handled covert and becomes top secret.<br>
<br>
As US is a very big country, and have means and resources, as well as interests in alot of thing happening in the world (its a global economy and all) US plays a very active role, and play its cards in many games so to speak. Now, if you are involved in many actions, and are working to make things go your way, sometimes you step on peoples feet. As US is involved in a lot of stuff it has stepped on quite a few peoples feet through the years. This has pissed some people off, and one of them (Bin ladin) has taken action against it. The person starting this thread asked for examples of this, and has gotten quite a few.<br>
<br>
<br>
OOOh btw, a funny detail (To be separated from info above): Freedom of speach etc is highly regarded in all western countries. Reporters are doing investigations of what really happens on events etc. Censorship is what is considered bad, and US Army (airforce, navy etc) wouldnt dare do such a thing. However, the armed forces in the US are buying every single satelite picture from Afghanistan area all around the world. Noone is allowed to see them. This isnt sensorchip of course, as technically anyone could have gotten an exclusive deal with the companies that handles those. But in reallity it becomes...Censorship? Interesting isnt it? =) Im sure there are some nice explanation but none the less... interesting =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thinn</A> at: 11/6/01 8:36:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#778899>(11/6/01 11:12:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> Thinn, I can give a few answers I believe to the many things you asked/talked about. <br>
<br>
With the Kurds, one reason may be that there are more than one type of Kurds.  They don't all have the same goals, just like there are many factions off Muslims in Afghanistan.  <br>
<br>
With your UN thing and the US casting a veto.  One single veto by itself does not stop something in the UN.  <br>
<br>
For you're &quot;And thats not what we are discussing is it?&quot; statement, I think he has some valid questions.  You brought things into this discussion and he's trying to bring more in.  What's wrong with that?  Are only select people allowed to expand this thread?<br>
<br>
I also think you did misunderstand his statement about the hospital.  The hospital was &quot;collateral&quot; damage.  It wasn't meant to happen, but it did.  Stuff like that happens in any type of battle.  Always has and always will even with the most tech weapons we have today.  Until someone can invent the perfect mechanicl devise that never ever goes breaks down then it will happen.  Meanwhile there are people killing each other and meaning to do it.  There is a difference.  <br>
<br>
For your last piece, I'll just say SECURITY.  Why let the info fall into the wrong hands without at least trying to stop it?  Would you rather some fanatic see the images and use it against us and our allies?  It's also information we can use against our foe.  Why not use every piece of info we can get our hands on.  Yes, censorship is needed in some cases.  Otherwise the press or someone else would announce our plans before they happened.  Or would you rather have the info given out so more people die than would need to do so?  Also censorship happens in many forms that most people don't think about.  An example is, have you ever tried to talk someone out of saying something?  I'm sure you have.  Everyone has at one time or another.  You tell a friend not to tell about something minor you may have done like break a window.  That is a form of censorship.  Using peer pressure like that is censorship.<br>
<br>
BTW, for those who didn't pay attention to SBLs last little speech, he said you Ausies are his next target after the US.  He's upset over East Timor and how you &quot;forced&quot; a Muslim government out of there and helped liberate that half of the island.  His overall goal isn't just the US, it's the whole world.  He says everyone must be Muslim.  So far his priorities are the US, Australia, and then all the other infidel countries who are not led by an extremist Muslim governement.  <br>
<br>
I'm wondering if Indonesia or the Philippines will be the next to blast open.  Myself, I'd place my money on Indonesia with their huge Muslim population.  They've been pulling out Christians from their cars and beating the heck out of them already and actually they've been fighting for years on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.  What a country, where your religion is put on your ID card so you can be singled out.  But then you have the Philippine islands of Basilan and Jolo where the Muslim based terrorists have been kidnapping and beheading people for years.<br>

Ugle, your statement about crime got me thinking about something I once read in a letter to the editor of a newpaper.  The person who wrote in claimed there wouldn't be so much black on black crime if the imperialistic white government wouldn't make it so easy for blacks to buy guns.  I'm still trying to figure out what he meant. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

With the Kurds, one reason may be that there are more than one type of Kurds. They don't all have the same goals, just like there are many factions off Muslims in Afghanistan. <br>
============================<br>
<br>
I agree, there are many different factions of kurds and they dont all have the same goals. What i meant was that if US wanted to help kurds in general they would have acted in Turkey as well. I should have been clearer on this.<br>
<br>
============================<br>
With your UN thing and the US casting a veto. One single veto by itself does not stop something in the UN.<br>
============================<br>
<br>
If you are one of the 5 permanent members in the security counsil, it does. Otherwise its not enough with one veto.<br>
<br>
<br>
===========================<br>
For you're &quot;And thats not what we are discussing is it?&quot; statement, I think he has some valid questions. You brought things into this discussion and he's trying to bring more in. What's wrong with that? Are only select people allowed to expand this thread?<br>
===========================<br>
I dont know how many Africans that are killed by africans. Do you? I do know though, which i bet was the point, that there are more africans getting killed by africans, then US bombings etc. If it werent i would be really scared =) Africa got a lot of internal conflicts. much of those are because the western worlds colonisations in that area earlier in history. But thats a whole other story, so i felt like we should leave that out of this thread, as we are discussing Why America has managed to piss some people of (basically).<br>
<br>
===========================<br>
hospital was &quot;collateral&quot; damage. It wasn't meant to happen, but it did.<br>
===========================<br>
Thats a good point. In war, @#%$ happens, its just simple as that. Some things that happens you dont like. Accidents do happen. Its a side effect of acting at all. And as ive stated a few times by now, as US is acting on alot of places, its bound to happen more accidents. Im not saying that US should not act, but the accidents ( and also things that are not think through properly, or simply that US could at times ignore pissing people off, as its for the greater good of US) still makes people pissed. A mother that lost her son due to a mistake is still pissed and sad. I Still think its a shitty thing that US vetoed the UN investigation.<br>
<br>
and finally about that censorship thingy. I understand your viewpoints, but why not simply state we are sensoring this as it might be useful for the enemy? =) Imagewise i think that military spy sattelites has much higer resolution in pictures than the civilian ones. But i get your point and i agree. i just wish it could be stated clearly, instead of going the more indirect way. o well. I will rest my case if any further arguments for/against this is posted btw, as the thread is'nt about censorship. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubrogunesforoad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brogun ESFOROAD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#778899>(11/7/01 7:40:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1>  Okey there seems to be a little information on the situation with Turkey and the Kurds their, and the difference in policy decisions. The problem we have with Turkey is that it is a NATO ally, it became one before their concerted effort to rid themselves of the Kurds. As a NATO member we cannot use any real force to change their policy decisions and any overt acts would and have been actively discouraged by other members of NATO, that being France, England, Belgium, and several others who have interests in Turkey. The one exception is Greece who um &quot;dislike&quot; the Turks for good reason.  Mind you I don't condone what is going on in Turkey any more than anyone else who has ever been their and seen how they (the government) treat those who do not follow their religious and social view points. If we could we would do a no fly zone over Turkey but unfortunatly we cannot.<br>
 There is one other thing that has been overlooked about the events of 9/11 that is the number of people who lost their lives who were not of this country. China, England, France, and many more nations lost people as the World Trade Center was just that, a place which served to centralize the financial interests of most of the nations of the world either directly or indirectly and that is why it was a primary target. Usama Bin Laden wasn't just striking at the U.S. he was striking at all non-muslim countries. If we want to talk about U.S. crimes we must first relate these supposed crimes with the conditions that arose to create them, and then determine if they were in fact crimes at all. I am sure that my Government has done alot of things that they considered to be in their own best interest but all governments do that, if not they are replaced by those who do look out for their own people first, this does not mean however that we only do things that deal with national interests and not just because it is the right thing (morally) to do. If we did then we wouldn't be accused of meddling so much.<br>

 That said, yes we primarily use our influence abroad to further American interests, this is no different than any other country using their own influence, be it economic, military, social et al., yes we do occasionally do things that are not in our best national interest, but no more so than any one else within their means to do so. Sometimes we do things for moral reasons, sometimes for political/economical reasons.<br>
 Occasionally we are percieved as the main instigators in a conflict simply because we got involved and alot of times our<br>
&quot;meddling&quot; was due to being called in to the situation by one of the two opposing sides and we enter into it knowing full well that no matter the outcome we will be looked upon by some as interfering in something we should'nt. Should we stop this?, I personally don't think we can or will. Should we curtail the amount of influence we use? perhaps, but then we run the risk of being isolationists, and missing the opportunities to avert major conflicts later down the road. What is my personal view of what we should be involved in?. <br>
 I think our involvement should be only in those areas which can create a greater conflict that would directly involve the U.S. within a period of approx 20 years, or that as a supposedly moral, and ethical society would be an anathma to the greatest amount of our citizens. This includes Genocide, mass starvation and mass murder of U.S. citizens or those under the protection of the U.S. directly. This will lead to some people suffering within the boundries of their own nations but this is something that must be solved internally if there is to be any lasting resolution. Should we aid those nations with internal conflicts when called upon? only when their predominate moral and ethical standards match those of our stated ideals, this also means we must grow up a bit more as a nation to reach our own goals but we are getting there.<br>
  There are no hard and fast solutions out there kiddies, unfortunatly. we as a world are all growing, and our little back yard is getting smaller every day, this means that the nice kids and the bullies are being forced to play with each other more. We have taken it upon ourselves to be the playground monitors and I am not sure that is a good thing as we are just kids ourselves. only time will tell if what we are doing is overall a good or bad thing<br>

Yes, we have called for imposing sanctions upon countries that trade with Cuba, but that's not a reality.  Cuba went primarily mono-culture in respect to their agriculture when linked to the former Soviet Block. Sugar was king.  Sugar the vile, one of the primary reasons for colonizing the Americas.  When the Caribs died off, bring in the black slaves to replace them.<br>
<br>
Basing one's economy on a single crop, as in Cuba, is not an economically prudent measure.  When the Iron Curtain fell, Cuba was in a terrible position economically.  The Soviet Union was a consistent buyer of their product (sugar), and they were not dependent on the world commodity market.  Exit the USSR and enter the global economy.  For the previous 5 years there was a glut on sugar on the world market.  The price of sugar fell and fell, they can't get the needed hard currency so who does Cuba blames, the USA.  Hmm, why not Indonesia, Brazil, Australia, the  Philippines and the other sugar producers?  In the USA, cane sugar was steadily falling out of favor, sugar production falls, fields are turned in condominiums, golf courses and also to green vegetables. Sugar refineries start closing and work a less than full capacity in the US because of the world sugar glut.  But the USA is blamed for Cuba's inability to get a decent price on the world market when that self same industry in the USA is in a bad state of decline and was not being propped up by the government (Reagan, not Clinton).<br>
<br>
I have friends of some repute in the organic agriculture area.  Cuban farmers have made great strides in the use of composts and other organic growing methods.  These processes are being studied and used in many third world countries.  But the centralized economy is still riding that dieing horse, old Sugar Cube.  Besides tourism, I can't see where Cuba can go for hard currency while still hitched to the sugar train.<br>

That is where I was wondering if you were saying we do things at times for the heck of it.  If I misunderstood then I'm sorry.  Also, even if we only did things for those two reasons, people would still complain about the US meddling so much.  Some people are just never happy.  You also have to look farther than 20 years down the road when doing something as a nation.  To a nation, or at least most of them, 20 years is just a drop in the bucket of time.  The US is still a new country compared to many others out there.  England is much older and over the years did what I would consider worse things.  Many of the things England did many generations ago are still affecting the world today.  Sri Lanka is a good example and just one of many examples I could give.  They've learned from those experiences and so will the US from it's experiences. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

Someone asked why people dislike the US.  I'm trying to see things from their side.  You know, show a little empathy.  Trying to understand is a good thing.<br>
<br>
When we provide support to &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in South America, how do you think the elected officials of that country feel about us?  How about the innocent people who are hurt in the conflict?<br>
<br>
Whether it was right or wrong is a completely separate issue.  What IS clear is that you can't support revolution (which is what we're doing) without making some people very angry with you.<br>
<br>
Take the other side -- support dictatorial regimes as I've mentioned before.  Now, how do you think people who oppose that regime are going to feel?  They are also not going to like us.<br>
<br>
The no-fly zone in Iraq to protect the Kurds -- how do you think we would have reacted in WW II if England had try to enact a no-fly zone over California to protect the Japanese that were being huddled into camps?<br>
<br>
(And don't start on me about how they aren't the same thing.  That's irrelevant.  What's relevant is how you would feel if a foreign government told the U.S. where we could fly our planes within our own borders.)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
It's all well and good to stand up and wave the flag.  You just have to close your eyes and your minds and deny mistakes.<br>
<br>
Well I'm sorry, but everyone makes mistakes.<br>
<br>
And sometimes you're left with decisions that you just don't like.<br>
<br>
Imagine terrorists are holding a bunch of prisoners.  You can send in the SEALs with a high degree of success, but you suspect a couple of hostages will die.  You're sure that MORE hostages will die if you do nothing.<br>
<br>
SOMEONE will think you're wrong whatever you do.<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
I'd like to add a little something I thought about this morning about all this -- why the U.S. went into Kuwait.  Think about a few things.<br>
<br>
1. The U.S. knew about Iraq's weapons programs, including efforts to produce atomic weapons (and other nasty things).<br>
<br>
2. No sane individual (translation: anyone who agrees with me) would imagine Iraq having these capabilities is a good thing.  Especially if you live in Israel.<br>
<br>
3. As I recall events from 10 years ago, shortly before Iraq invade Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was given the impression the U.S. would turn a blind eye to agression in the area.  I don't remember where I heard this, but it was was of the reputable news sources.<br>
<br>
Now, link those three facts.<br>
<br>
Makes you think real hard, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Makes you wonder if Saddam Hussein wasn't suckered into giving us an excuse to invade and destroy their weapons capabilities.<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
Now, let's say that that's exactly what happened.  For the sake of argument.  Was it wrong?<br>
<br>
Consider the alternative -- Iraq with nuclear and biological weapons, perhaps with advance delivery capability.<br>
<br>
Would the U.S. be snow white in this case?  Hmm.  Maybe, if it's snow a couple of days after the city spread salt and sand around.<br>
