         Home, for Mia, was a small studio apartment on the top floor of a building on the corner of Rue de Rivoli and Rue de Mouvais Garcon. Although Mia hated the long trek up the winding staircase she loved the room and loved the neighborhood. This was the unofficial gay district of Paris, and for whatever reason, it was the perfect place for Mia. It was filled with small cafes, street vendors, markets, street performers, anything and everything that one could want, the large corporations found little business in this neighborhood and therefore kept out.<br>
        When the cab pulled up in front of her building Mia was so excited that she threw a 100 franc note at the driver and ran all the way up the stairs. After unlocking her door she kicked it open and went flying into her room. <br>
        Her face went from pure joy and excitement to anger and fear in a matter of milliseconds. Someone had ransacked her room. All the drawers of her dresser lay on the floor, her cloths lay scattered everywhere; on the floor, under the bed, some on the balcony, and some even hanging from the blades of the ceiling fan.<br>
        The only thing of real importance that Mia owned was her computer, and that she had taken with her. So without further thought she put her briefcase down and started cleaning up, folding cloths and putting them back in their rightful places. When her room was cleaned up she headed out to the balcony to pick up any cloths that had found their way out there. Bending over to pick up a skirt she noticed something peculiar. A few yards away on the far end of the balcony lay a dead pigeon. Now, a dead pigeon by itself would be odd enough, but as she stood up and scanned the length of the balcony she began to count them. In all there were 13 dead pigeons laying about on her balcony, each with it’s mouth frozen wide open as if they were all trying to scream.<br>
        “This has got to be some kind of sick joke.” She said to herself in what she thought was a reassuring tone.<br>
        A flurry of feathers and beak came flying at her from the room, startling her and sending her sprawling out in the corner of the balcony. The pigeon who had caused all the commotion now sat on the railing, cooing softly as if unaware of the pigeon carnage that lay out below its feet.<br>
        “Jesus!” Mia exclaimed as she pulled herself into a sitting position, leaning her back against the glass door to her apartment. Just then, as if attracted by her voice, the pigeon leaped down off the railing and began to waddle its way toward Mia. “Hello little one . . . do you miss your friends?” Mia said as the pigeon jumped into her outstretched hands. Settling down in her cupped hands the pigeon began to coo in the manner that pigeons do, reminding Mia more of a cat than of a bird. Mia stared at the bird, at its sleek feathers and bead black eyes. She found the experience to be somewhat meditative, that is until the pigeon opened it beak and let out what had to be the most horrible screech Mia had ever heard. Mia flinched but was careful not to drop the bird. The noise was over quickly, but the birds beak remained open and the wonderful cooing had stopped. After a few moments of contemplation Mia realized that the bird was indeed, dead. She quickly dropped it and ran into her apartment, locking the balcony doors behind her. She rushed into the bathroom and began to thoroughly scrub her hands, as if she were trying to wash the memory from her mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Mia lay on her bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. She was finally beginning to accept what was happening to her. Of coarse she did not come close to realizing what the ramifications of her transformation were, but she was now willing to accept the change. It was obvious there was nothing she could do about it; except pray that it didn’t hurt.<br>
