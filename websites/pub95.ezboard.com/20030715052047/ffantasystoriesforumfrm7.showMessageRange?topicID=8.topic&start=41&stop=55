CAE!  CAAAAAEEEEEEEE!!!!  The whore's screams echoed throughout the house.  She panted as if she had ran just ran a thousand miles, yet all she had done was stradle his @#%$ brother.  Saeran quickened his boot tying as he heard his brothers name being repeated over and over and over and over and over and over.  His boot lace broke.  &quot;Crap.&quot;  He kicked off his boot and walked out the door, one boot on, the other clad in a worn sock.  Even outside he couldn't escape his brother's name, cae...cae...cae.  @#%$ Him, @#%$ the whore, @#%$ all the whores!

The whores who usualy think they can get a copper from him turn away.  There were fatter fish to spear.  In the distance he saw her, miriam, one of the few INTELLEGENT kind people in this hole of a city.  He waved, &quot;Hey Miriam!&quot;  With the sight of her, his cloak of anger faded away like an image in water, dashed by pebbles.  He didn't like her THAT way, he liked her as a person.  She was cool.<br>

Great. I think I got enough time to find a weapon... he thought. Then Delshad was running again.<br>
<br>
Before he took two great strides, he saw a beautiful red flower on the ground. Perfect!! He crept back to Miriam's house, keeping out of the ever-air-headed line of sight of Aino and Caelistis. Heh. Morons.<br>
<br>
Delshad deposited the flower inside the window, hoping she'd not notice until he was out of sight, and he dashed inside the city gates. Long dash...<br>
<br>
Winded, as he had all his armor on, he stopped for a bite of pickled frogloc with Boomba just inside the gates. Only ogre he'd ever seen with manners, no matter how atrocious they were. It didn't matter; the big lug liked Delshad, and offered to loan him a legsplitter. Only problem was that Delshad couldn't lift the damn thing...<br>
<br>
He turned down the offer, and ran to the barracks inside the guild house. By the time he saw the big cat striding into the dirt field, Delshad had a pair of wicked, curved scimitars twirling in his ready hands. &quot;Let's do this,&quot; he called. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 395<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 8:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la~la`la!!</span><hr size=1> Miriam looks behind her as she hears her name called.

&quot;Hay, sweet pea. How've you been?&quot; <br>

Miriam always felt close to Saeran. Like he was the little sibling she wanted, instead of the one she got. Miriam pulls him in for a tight hug. Kissing his cheek as she pulls away, her smile brightens.<br>

&quot;Things are rough no matter where ya go, hun. But you always know where I live,    if you wanna get away, just come over. No questions asked.&quot; Her eyes were sincere as they stared into the boys. Miriam chuckles to lighten the mood. &quot;I'm the same as the next broad around here. But that's a different story.&quot; Winking, she looks across the street at one of the towns many taverns. Taverns... Delshad... Caelestis... With a shake of her head, any memories that may have been creeping back to haunt her are gone. &quot;Delshad? He... well... uhh, umm... He's ok... I think.&quot; Her voice drops to barely a whisper, &quot;I hope...&quot;  Was he regreting anything? He he have stronger feelings for her than &quot;friend&quot; ? But what if he just wanted to get some... what if he was just looking for a one night stand, what if he lied? Like everyone else... Like Caelestis? For the second time, she shakes her head to clear her thoughts. <br>
<br>
&quot;A drink? You have no idea how good that sounds right now... Lets go!&quot; Giggling, she threads her arm through his and pulls him towards the tavern. Nothing like a stiff drink to start off the morning!<br>

By the time her eyes opened again, she found herself sprawled out on her couch. Light spills in from her window and breaks her waves of sleep. Damn. That dream was just getting interesting too.

Slowly, he hobbled over the sink were he promptly managed to half fall-half dunk, his head into the icy water.  Now, half-awake, Saeran lifted his water drenched face to stare at one of the few people whom he respected.  Even with the effects of sleep and alcohol, she still managed to be beautiful.  His hair was everywhere, his eyes puffy.  As he smiled, she couldn't help but laugh.  Out of the blue he spoke, &quot;Let's go on a picnic.&quot; <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://auction.2y.net/user/Bellona/gir2.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 443<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/12/02 11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/Bellona/GIR.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la~la`la!!</span><hr size=1> Miriam grins as she looks over at her hungover friend. <br>

&quot;We should get more sleep first, hun. My head is still throbbing, and I'm sure yours is too. So lets get our stanky butts back into bed before we fall and hurt ourselves&quot; <br>
<br>
With a giggle and a tug she was pulling him back to her bedroom. Bursting through the door she hops onto her bed and lays on her back smilling. Yesturday was fun. Nothing could make her frown quite like Caelestis, but nothing could make her smile quite like Saeran. Turning on her side she snuggles into a pillow. Sighing happily, Miriam drifts off to sleep.<br>

Playfully, he yanked the sheets free covering her clothed body and pulled them up to his chin.  As he began to drift asleep seconds later, her smiling face was glaring down at him.  She pulled, and he relented.  As the sheets were quickly taken back, the headache that still plagued his mind seemed all the more acute, and sleep seemed better and better.  In a minutes time, he had managed to slip into a light sleep, a rare occasion considering it usually took him hours to sucomb to the warm embrace of sleep.  For the first time in years, he slept without a nighmare, no, he slept with a smile on his face knowing that he was with a friend.   <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/15/02 8:09:09 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=55><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7>Role Playing Forum</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
