Interesting that you put &quot;that would be feasable&quot; at the end of that, half-wit. Obviously, feasability would be a matter of opinion, until my proposed solution was attempted. Almost all of my proposed solutions regarding societies and politics are consistent with history and human nature. And the number one cause of every society's troubles is that they invariably think they're smarter than their forebears.<br>
<br>
Look Ugle, if you're busy humping Wolfypaw's leg, and therefore feel a need to vent hostility toward me at every opportunity because I dared to flame him over his pet summit project, deal with it. But you weaken your own arguments by wasting bandwidth on pointless, inaccurate and foolish referents to *your opinion* of me and my views. But it is flattering in a sickening sort of way.<br>

In a society with a government that spends the majority of its tax money to stockpile an unusable arsenal of weapons with a potential for destruction on a apocolyptic scale.In a culture where we   are taught that more important than any individual is the non tanngible battle to be number one against ever elusive invisable enemies and to put on the facade that our collective Quality of life is much greater than any other country, while we sweep our own third world problems under the patchwork flag of the american dream<br>
      In this melting pot of human greed. predjudice. ignorance and so called family values, the children will shoot their classmates the people will scapegoat the poor and foreigners and whom ever else is an easy target with no one to speak for them, men will get dragged on a chain from the back of a pickup truck untill they are decapitaded and the police will be corrup and out of controll as they murder the innocent and get a pat on the back and a slap  on the wrist<br>

You seem to think that we are the only ones with corrupt cops, Hah, try going to any of those third world, and second and heck first world country that doesn't have them, the difference is that in America that kind of corruption when found is usually punished within the framework of our legal system. As for children shooting up schools why dont you go to India, Iran, Iraq, Palistine, any african nation, hell just about any nation, the only difference is that in some it is harder to obtain firearms so they use machete's, knives, bombs etc, and last I checked the individuals involved in the Rodney King (now there is a wonderful individual) incident and others ended up serving time for their crimes. Is our system perfect? not a chance but having been to over 128 different nations throughout my life as a military brat, in service and as a tourist I have yet to find any other nation that I would rather live in. Some have less crime true but less people to commit those crimes, some have less corruption in their law enforcement agencies, but not as a percentage of the total number of individuals involved. I have alot of friends in foreign nations that I have personally visited last count was 14 in diverse countries how many do you have that you have visited bolthog and got to understand their culture? very few probably.

How did you draw this conclusion ? Have you witnessed every culture / country in the world first hand ? Or are you making this presumption because on the way to work you count how many Taco bells you pass?<br>
<br>
Your a war monger Kilamdar and an ignorant fool, not fit for civilian life if you ask me - all you military people are the same - obsessed with power. <br>
<br>
American morals and values, sick of hearing about it!!<br>
<br>
It's is all too easy to forget that you took your country by force away from people that were already settled there. Yeah, you like to keep that under the carpet don't ya. How you enslaved people to carry out your chores. To this day your country has deep rooted racism. <br>
<br>
Go on Aldrin, admit it you hate blacks.<br>
<br>
On the subject of Aldrin, you complete cok, why don't you answer Thinn's post?  <br>
<br>
Yeah, good American morals right there.<br>
<br>
What about when you dropped the atomic bomb on two cities. Sheesh, that's what I call collateral damage eh Kilamdar. 250,000 men, woman and children snuffed out in the blink of an eye - courtesy of the good old US of A. But your a military man, so your gonna give me some grade a bshit on why it needed to be done.<br>
<br>
- your brainwashed point of view.<br>
<br>
You take what isn't yours to take - it's the American way. But when you do it you sanitise it. <br>
<br>
How about your brave performace in the Vietnam war. yeah, you don't like talking about that one. Well I do. I like to read about the war crimes you commited. <br>
<br>
The woman that were beaten and @#%$ by your good old boys. That pilot you posted with his speech made me laugh - this man is not a hero but a murderer. <br>
<br>
Where was his morals when him and his colleagues were told to carpet bomb villages ?<br>
<br>
How he talks about how your country was founded on freedom. No wonder Thinn vomited, it's this kind of nonsense that makes you look like pricks to the rest of the world. <br>
<br>
Your country's freedom cost a civilisation theirs, don't forget that.<br>
<br>
Morals, these people have no sense of morals - they worship a flag for goodness sake, like Iraq has pictures of Saddam Hussein in every house so you people have the American Flag - same idealogy - no difference.<br>
<br>
You Americans who preach how moral and good your country is make me sick - spouting your nationalistic nonsense. Flying the american flag like you are some elite race of the world. you live in a twisted society saturated with drugs and violence. Your false too, you stab each other in the back. <br>
<br>
You live in a country with a big rat race, everyone treading on everyone else to get to the top.<br>
<br>
Did you know that your glorious country is one of the most violents places in the world ?! You do the most horrible things to each other. You can thank your fascination with the gun for that. You are obssesed with power, and because of it the world we live on is in danger every single day - all because you guys are military nuts. <br>
<br>
I hate pricks like Aldrin who have this twisted obsession with  military might and nuclear capabilities. (cocks ear) - Aldrin your a cok through and through.<br>
<br>
I know not all Americans are like Kilamdar and Aldrin, so sorry to those Americans who read this and might get offended by my anger. <br>
<br>
I agree with Syd (who has a very good comprehension of both sides of the story) with regarding other cultures being just as brutal and corrupt but this is not my point. My argument is when someone like me (nonUSA) reads some of the bshit these kind of people post it REALLY REALLY gets me angry how they think they are better than everyone else just because they are AMERICAN. <br>
<br>
They dont understand the important things in life, only the destructive things like the bomb and the bullet and the size of their army and who they can kill if they wanted to. <br>
<br>
They say they are free but they are not, they are bound by their own ignorance. They have no understanding whatsoever of other cultures, only their own. <br>
<br>
There are a lot of nice people in the USA, and I think it is a nice country to visit but pls do not tell me that your way of life is better than mine or someone elses just because I am not American. What might be good for you is bad for me and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, there are people in the world who are perfectly happy where they live - can you imagine that ?! Yes and these people are actually very clever with good educations, and some of these people have in fact visited the USA and still do not wish to live in America.<br>

Yes we did some horrible things in that country with which we are ashamed of but not all of us. <br>
<br>
 Maybe you want to call me a racist ex-military jerk as well, after all I am a white southern born, southern baptist reared individual,  although I do have some native american blood in me, was engaged at one time to a black woman, married a buddist and had a beautiful daughter by her.<br>
<br>
 Maybe we should be ashamed of dropping the A bomb twice, after all we did wait untill we were at war and attacking a war target , before you say they were just innocent individuals lets not forget that those two cities were at the time highly industrial ones providing war materiel, and BTW lets all forget that the nation we bombed at the time was r@ping women systematically in china, and korea. <br>
<br>
 If you read my above post you will know that I have visited a heck of alot of foreign countries, almost all of Europe, the former Soviet Union, India, New Zealand, Japan, The Phillipines just to name a few so I have a fairly good Idea of what life is like in the rest of the world. I know that most countries try to do what is best for their citizens and we are no different in that respect, where we differ however is in the fact that we are at present the worlds superpower, this is not to say this is good or bad just a statement of fact.<br>
 As a superpower we are expected simultaneously to aid and not aid foreign powers, and no matter what we do we get bashed for it, and that is what @#$% me off, rarely do I use explicatives but I am tired of being bashed for being american.<br>
 Where were you when I took 3 bullets keeping a Somalian from wasting 4 women and 2 kids just because they didnt share the same blood as him, oh yea I guess the 3 weeks I spent in the hospital was just some more U.S. soldier kicking it and having a great time. I wasn't the only one who did what they did not just because we were ordered to but because it was right. Yes there are bloodthirsty REMFs in the U.S. service but guess what? They are in every military. How can I say this? Spent 11 months on the green line in Beirut and got to see what some of the military of other nations attached to the U.N. forces were like and compared to them we were saints. Before you bash another U.S. citizen or current or ex military member get some more objective information first, then formulate you opinion please. If you can do that and come back and bash fine, I will probably just write you off as another individual from another country that will denegrate me and my nation/ people untill their sorry ass needs some help and then guess what....... I will help, thats right, I wont turn my back on you because I am an American<br>

<br>
There are people with an isolated viewpoint in every culture -- people whose perspective is based strictly on their own experiences and how they were indoctrinated by those experiences and the people around them.<br>
<br>
Do you think it's wrong for those in the U.S. to label all muslims as terrorists?<br>
<br>
All blacks as gang-bangers?<br>
<br>
Put some perspective on your attitude.  You're letting a few voices decide how you feel about an entire country.<br>
<br>
The fact is -- the vast majority of people in ANY culture are good, decent people.  If they weren't, they'd all kill each other, end of problem.<br>
<br>
Yes, Americans DO feel that our system is the best in the world.  But we do so with sorta a blind eye to the fact that things in Canada, Britain, Germany, and a bunch of other places are equally good.  THOSE people feel their system is best, btw.  If they didn't, they'd copy ours.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of your country, after all.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's somewhat naive and ignorant to assume there's such a thing as &quot;best&quot;.  But I don't understand why you would hate and condemn an entire culture for that.<br>
<br>
As for the violence in our society....  I've never had a gun waved at me -- by anyone.  Or a knife.  In fact, I've never personally experienced any sort of personal crimes.  I have been robbed, and my ex- had a person stolen once and also had a boyfriend who beat her up.<br>

Violence happens everywhere, frequently in direct proportion to how closely people are rubbing elbows.  I don't believe we're all that worse than anywhere else, and we're a HECK of a lot better than a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Is America perfect?  No.  There's no such thing as perfect when talking about human beings.<br>
<br>
But I don't know where your hatred is coming from.  It's certainly quite unfair.<br>

<br>
I guess it must be cool in other places to talk about how evil America is while spouting hatred and thinking that the world is black and white. <br>
<br>
It's ironic that an American like me can see the hypocrisy. But it's not surprising. Even other people can suffer from the &quot;American weakness&quot; of thinking they are better than everyone else. (Or maybe just better than Americans.)<br>
<br>
Repsecting differences doesn't mean bashing them, even when you disagree with them. When you finally understand this, you will have come a long way towards really understanding what different means. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umalilkiashadowwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malilkia Shadowwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#778899>(11/15/01 9:43:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://roleplayersinteraction.com/test_pictures/Cat2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> I know this is off topic, but I read wolfy's post mentioning gangs. Just brought up a horrible moment I experienced.<br>
<br>
I have been stabed before. Not a very good feeling. In high school the mexican gangs wanted me to join them. I told the no and leave me alone. I am 6'1&quot; 260lbs, and I guess they wanted me for my size. <br>
<br>
Well in woodshop while I was going to get my stuff to work. I was stabbed. Luckly I move and it cought me in the arm. This was done by a mexican gangmember.<br>
<br>
No not all blacks are gang bangers. The ones you see or hear about give those who are not in gangs a bad name. <br>
<br>
Where I live there are phillipino, mexican, black, and white gangs. The worst gang here are the mexicans. <p><img src="http://www.roleplayersinteraction.com/images/corimages/images/logo.png">

I've seen America bashing posts and I've seen Americans post bashing the rest of the world.  I haven't seen many solutions offered.<br>
<br>
Can any human government solve the problems that we deal with in any country?  What government has been able to eradicate poverty, prejudice, crime, disease, and economical ruin?<br>
<br>
&quot;Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed.  History is a tale of efforts that failed, or aspirations that weren’t realized...So, as a historian, one has to live with a sense of the inevitability of tragedy.&quot;—Henry Kissinger, political scientist and professor of government, as quoted in The New York Times, October 13, 1974, p. 30B.  I tend to agree.<br>
<br>
Well, nation worship was brought up in an earlier post or two.  I worshipped the USA for most of my lifetime.  Pledged my allegiance to it's flag, sang praises to it, served in the Army, and such.  People do the same thing in other countries, as has been brought out.<br>
<br>
People also perform these acts of worship to their gods.  Solutions I would offer come from a religious background.  Does anyone have any answers that aren't?<br>

<br>
How did I draw my conclusion.  Maybe from the many countries I've visited.  How many have you personally been to and been able to see at their best/worst?  Have you seen mass graves?  Have you seen where they cut off peoples heads and nailed them to the walls for the rest of the family to see?  Have you seen 7 or 8 year old children with missing limbs thanks to the fighting in that country?  Have you seen open fields where once stood a thriving town?  I've seen that and more.  Your posts are no more than remarks made for trolling, or someone who is actually that ignorant of the world.  I seriously hope it's the first option.  If it's the second then you're in for a shock one day.<br>
<br>
I'm a war monger and all military people are the same?  I suggest all people like you are the same.  Brainwashed into thinking that anything at all associated with the military is bad.  Brainwashed into thinking that you're pure.  Take a look at yourself.  You've done many things bad yourself.  It's just easier to point the finger at someone else.  Especially someone else who is a much larger organization and therefore going to be easier to see doing things.  <br>
<br>
Also, we only expanded on what was started when we made America.  Who origionally took land away from the natives?  We weren't even a country then.  Heck, we followed the only example we knew at the time.  We did as Britian, France, Spain and other big countries were doing.  I guess you better start bashing them as well.  No lie, we, like EVERY country out there, has some bad things in it's history.  Show me a pure country and I'll show you a country you made up in your feeble mind.  Also, every country I know of has some kind of deep rooted racism.  Look at Bosnia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines to name just a few.  It's part of life.  A part that most people are trying to overcome.  By the looks of it, you're not doing your part.<br>
<br>
Want to talk about &quot;the bombs&quot; do you.  Can we also talk about how those countries were killing thousands of innocents also?  Can we talk about how things were different back then?<br>
<br>
I'd really like to know where you get your brainwashed ideas of villages being carpet bombed just for the heck of it in Vietnam.  Is that info from your brainwashing pamplets?<br>
<br>
I also know that all foreigners are not like you.  They are not afraid to state where they are from for one thing.  You attempt to insult America and then hide your own country.  Such a fool you are.  Are you afraid we'll be able to show where your own country has done bad things in it's history?  <br>
<br>
<br>
Wolfypaw, darn right I think we have the &quot;best&quot; thing going.  If I didn't then I wouldn't be willing to protect it with my life.  I never said it was perfect, but I do think it's a good start.  Some of your statements also make me wonder.  Sounds like you're labeling me with an isolated viewpoint and that you dislike me.  So be it if it's true.  But the same could be turned around easily.  It's too easy to label someone who doesn't agree with you as someone who has an isolated viewpoint.  Also some of your statements sound to me like you think all Americans are labeling people certain ways.  Not true and I think you know it.  If I'm not reading those statement correctly then sorry. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

Wolfypaw, I agree with a lot of what you said in your last post. I am sorry if I seemed unfair toward you and other American citizens, but I am sick of hearing how moral Americans are as much as you are sick of being bashed for being American.<br>
<br>
My argument is with the Aldrins and Kilamdars and any other closed minded person, not America in general - in fact, if someone says something about America in my country I defend your nation because I hate hypocrisy. I hate people giving their opinion when they do not know the facts.<br>
<br>
Natallia, I have to disagree with you. When I was in America I swtiched on the cable and was astonished by the amount of money grabbing TV Evangelists that were on - I mean come on, it was obvious they were only after money. Ripping off poor people who were turning to them with their last bit of money hoping it would do something for them.<br>
<br>
 I had never seen anything like that EVER, I mean these people were scary! And there were dozens of channels doing it.<br>
<br>
As far as my nationality goes Kilamdar, for a military man your not very bright are you?! I have told you my nationality, I thought it was very clear, you just need to look a little closer.<br>
