We met 4,000 elven composite longbowmen and about 2,000 of their warriors and 20 wizards. The trip was hard , many got sick but everyone survived. Since we couldn't push stones to stay fit we helped the crews of the ships with our armor still on. Some people fell and got broken bones that were healed but mostly nothing happened until we landed.<br>
<br>
When we landed we set up camp I sent out hundred man patrols to look for anything suspicious. They found Gypsies which we could replenish some stores from and we found a oasis which we camped by. Camping by that oasis cost us Twenty good lads that probably saved at least 200 other boys. When night fell many spectres came out , about 20-25 , well those boys killed every last one , it happened in seconds and none could really help them. I had clerics seal up a Island tower fortress in the middle of the oasis with clerical wards and traps.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next day we heard deep rumblings that scared us pretty good because we feared that we had been spotted by human bandits. We had no such luck , Giants waylaid us just as the desert started to give way to a more tropical climate. This time they Attacked the Front of the column were me and most of the company commanders were for our briefing from Spear General Mavok.<br>
<br>
When this happened me and my old pals that were left ( Vash , Somli , Bero , Sagnus ) were first to give the call to attack , the general ordered us to wait for the elves but who gave a fryin @#%$. <br>
<br>
I guess we had Individual names for our companies that sounded pretty cool I guess.<br>
<br>
&quot; Come to me My warriors &quot; I shouted and they obeyed<br>
&quot; Attack bears , you wanna live forever?&quot; called somli.<br>
&quot; Get of Your asses Lionrunners &quot; Screamed Bero.<br>
&quot; Hey guardians theirs a fight lets go&quot; Shouted vash grimly<br>
<br>
Somli's group got their first and attacked the lead giant , Most had their crossbows out and peppered that poor giant good. The giant didn't like that and stopped the charge pretty well when he started kicked dwarves around. Everone else was their but the giants weren't being hurt fast enough , the wizards and elves were nowhere to be seen. I got an Idea and i got ten good men and told them to chop a average size tree down that wasn't a palm tree. I whipped them into a frenzy of hacking axes pretty quick.<br>
<br>
&quot; People are dieing godamnit I can see the fuc**** poor bastards flying , you better speed up or your gonna end up as fuc**** toe jam.&quot; I shouted <br>
<br>
We knocked down 3 trees and carried them back to the scene of the battle. We got another ten guys to help and I told them to injure the giant good. WE charged after that with six or seven dwarve to a tree and we hit those giants so hard , that didn't have time to think. When we hit our Giant  we hit him in an artery for sure because me and two others got knocked back about ten feet from the blood spurt.<br>
<br>
The Idea worked pretty damn good I guess because the those giant were down and now our boys could get at their necks and eyes. It was pretty gruesome to see , thousands of damn vultures came to eat the things and come morning their was a lake of congealed blood , organs and flesh.<br>
<br>
Then again our side was bloodied up real good but our clerics got to them all fast enough.I seen one guys with everything from his hips down shattered. I seen another guy literally broken in half.<br>
<br>
We got our asses chewed by that windbag general , he never even commanded a single squad or got swung at. He was a politician and damn was he dumb.<br>
<br>
I myself cracked a few ribs after that fall and had not had a chance to clean of yet and got everything profusely soaked with giant blood. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=104.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=104.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.threadControl?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2>EverQuest Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
