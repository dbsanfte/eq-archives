They will usually be named chat, ooc, and shout combined with the goal of the raid (i.e. if we are attacking Vox, then the raid channels will be voxooc, voxchat, and voxshout). The shout channel is for raid leaders and Main Assist (MA) ONLY. No one else may use this shout channel for any reason. Do not yell for help in the shout channel, as that text will be mixed with the Raid leaders commands to help you, and usually result in your death. If the raid leader says something and you have a question, then ask your group leader, and he/she will relay to the raid leader through tells. Do not talk directly to the raid leader (unless he/she asks for tells for rolls on No Drop items (see looting rules)) as they will usually be very busy trying to keep things organized, and too busy to be in tell hell. Chat will be for general talking, though try to keep it about the raid and not what you ate for dinner last night, or did anyone watch a certain TV show the other day. For the most part leave the chit-chat in group speak. Finally ooc will pretty much be used for hot key's (i.e. Complete Heal incoming for Belwolf in 10 seconds, Mob Such and Such is debuffed, and other messages of the like (see post on Hot Keys)).<br><br>Now I know that this seems like a lot of channels to have to read through, but once you have gone on a raid in this format, you will see how nice it really is. To help separate the channels out I recommend you change the colors of the text to fit your needs. For example, maybe the shout channel should be red so it stands out, the chat green, and ooc a blue of some sort. Play with the colors as you see fit, and find what is best for you. The command to change these colors works like this:<br><br>/usercolor 36 50 100 50<br><br>The first number represents the chat channel who's color you want to change. 36 is chat channel 1 (whatever channel you joined first), 37 is channel 2, 38 channel 3, and so on. The next 3 numbers are the values for the overall color that you choose. The one listed above (50 100 50) is a medium dark green. The 3 values that make up this final color are listed in this order - Red Green Blue - each with a range of values from 0-255. What is meant by this is if you were to put:<br><br>/usercolor 36 255 0 0<br><br>You would then have chat channel 1 the brightest Red you could possible have. To get the brightest Green you would do this:<br><br>/usercolor 36 0 255 0<br><br>And for the brightest blue:<br><br>/usercolor 36 0 0 255<br><br>The closer the number is to 255 the lighter the color (i.e. if you used 0 0 0 then the text would be black, if you used 255 255 255 then the text would be white). Using combinations of these values you can get mixes of different colors, and depending on the background you are viewing the text on you can vary it lighter or darker (i.e. if you use full screen and are on snow, light text will be hard to read, or on a dark black stone floor then dark text will be hard to read.)<br><br>Let me give you an example by joining the chat channels and changing all the colors. Let's say we are raiding Paw, and I am using a password for each chat channel. The password in this example will be: shadowraiders.<br><br>/join pawooc:shadowraiders<br>/join pawchat:shadowraiders<br>/join pawshout:shadowraiders<br>/usercolor 36 50 50 125<br>/usercolor 37 50 100 50<br>/usercolor 38 150 50 50<br><br>You now have joined 3 chat channels (/1 used for pawooc; /2 used for pawchat; and /3 used for pawshout) and they will be medium blue, medium dark green, and a brick red respectively. Play with this while you are waiting for the raid to start, and find what color combo's work best for you.<br><br>Also while raiding, I recommend turning off all standard chat (i.e. auction, ooc, shout, and even guild as it will not be used during raids for raid info). By doing this you will only have raid related text going across your screen and find it much easier to just concentrate on the task as hand.<br><br>Something else that you may find handy is the ability to set one of the channels as your default (like when you right click on the text box in windowed mode and select group or guild for example). This is really helpful to people that use full screen to play as it will work for any of the channels (even guild, say, ooc, auction, group, etc.) To do this you simply type:<br><br>/channel chat &lt;channel name&gt;<br><br>So to use our example above you would type:<br><br>/channel chat pawchat<br><br>Now anything you type will automatically go to the pawchat channel (instead of having to type /2 every time). One word to the wise, this will also set this channel as the default for when you log on each time, so before you log off after the raid you might want to reset it back to:<br><br>/channel say<br><br>Play with this if you can BEFORE your next raid, and feel free to ask an Elder if you have any questions. And as usual, if I have left any information you think should be added then let me know.<br><br><!--EZCODE HTML START--> <font color=red><b>PEOPLE USING THE NEW UI:</b></font> There is a nice new way to change the color of your chat text, but it is only available to people using the new interface. In the <b>Options Window</b> the last tab on the right says <b>Chat</b>. If you click on that tab and then scroll down (yes that window actually has a scroll bar) you will see almost every type of text possible and what color it is currently. All you have to do is single left click on the text you want to adjust the color to and a color pallet will come up. You can play with the color to your hearts content until you get it just right. Also notice that because the background of the buttons are black, it may look like some of the buttons are blank. They actually are using black text, so the text just isn't visible on the buttons. Move your mouse over them to read what they are for. Also, note that for most channels that you can actually speak in (i.e. ooc, guild, shout, chat channels, etc.) there is a color for the channel and there is also a color for that channels ECHO. The ECHO is actually the color of the text that you type. So let's take guild chat for example. By default the color is green, and everyone that talks in guild chat will show up in your text window as green text. However, when you type it may show up white. That is because your Guild color is green but your Guild ECHO is white. You can change the ECHO to be another color if you like, that way when you are talking in guild it will stand out from talking in group or say. Just something else to play with before the next raid.<!--EZCODE HTML END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><br><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=127031" target="_blank"><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bhoward3/images/dadalan.jpg" height=85 width=468 alt="Dadalan Lyfrender" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udadalanlyfrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dadalan Lyfrender</A> at: 8/1/02 2:34:13 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>294</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend" align=absmiddle></a> Email This To a Friend </td><td align=right valign="top"></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#006400><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 width=20%><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newtopic.gif border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.showAddPollScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newpoll.gif border=0 alt="New Poll"></a> </td><td bgcolor=#000000><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a> Topic Commands (Moderator Only)  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to receive email notification of replies  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies </td><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 align=right></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=95% border=0 cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"></td><td align="right" valign="top"><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm20">The Foyer<option value="ebonmoonfrm12">Recruitment - New Members<option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
