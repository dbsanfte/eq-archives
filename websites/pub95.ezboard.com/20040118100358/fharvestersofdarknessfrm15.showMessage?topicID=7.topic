<br>
“Nau, just deep meditation.”<br>
<br>
“I ask, because I long to kiss you goodnight” He said<br>
<br>
“You may naut do such, not now or ever. My body &amp; my soul are not mine to give. I gave them a long time ago to my Lord to be what I am today….”<br>
<br>
<br>
Trumpets sounded &amp; the bells of the temple ring loudly through the night. The citizens of Free Port know a child was born in the Temple of Marr this night.<br>
<br>
Emelath &amp; Sythanas sit in their room talking in hushed whispers, the babe lay in her cradle sleeping soundly. This is the newest child of Marr. This child was born to dedicate her life to that of the Holy Knight. In this tiny baby lay all the goodness and power that her God has to give…<br>
<br>
Years pass and our baby grows to a young child. The time comes that all Holy Knights must face, the time to leave home &amp; go forth and train. With a friend in the Temple at Felwithe, Emelath &amp; Sythanas travel to the Mountains of Butcherblock, to take their only child to face her destiny.<br>
<br>
The journey through the mountain was slow, but uneventful. In the spring, the mountains were painted with bright new flowers and were utterly breathtaking. Finally, after many days travel the passage to Greater Feydark looms before them. The child runs ahead, eager to see this new land that will be her home. Emelath &amp; Sythanas follow the child slowly, allowing her the freedom she needs to see her new world.<br>
<br>
They never saw the band of elves that hit them. As they emerged from the passage to Butcherblock, fair Emelath’s body slumped to the ground as magic forces she never knew existed sang through her body. Sythanas had enough breath to call the childs name before an arrow pierced his heart &amp; he fell to his knees. The child turned at the sound of her fathers voice, and ran back to where her parents should have been… a band of elves..Koada’Dal and Fier’Dal, were circling her mother &amp; father. Her mother laying on the ground and her father on his knees so covered in blood that she did not see the arrow in his chest. She screamed and ran to her parents side.<br>
<br>
“Please, please help us! My parents have been attacked!”<br>
<br>
As her fathers body fell, she knew she was wrong. These men were not here to help, but to kill. As the hammer fell on her back, she recognized the crest of the Holy Knights on one of men, then all was dark.<br>
<br>
I know naut how long I lay there…in the pools of blood of my parents. <br>
<br>
T’was dark when I became aware. I became aware of the cold. A chill like none I have ever known crept through my body. Just as I felt I could take no more &amp; my body would surely freeze, my mind was washed with a searing heat that made ever fiber of my being scream..and yet my body lay there quietly. Pictures flodded my brain..my parents blood, the holy crest, the smiling faces of those men, their blades covered in blood…my mind began to weep. I have never in my life felt such rage. Such pure blinding hate. A voice echoed in my brain…<br>
<br>
“Childe, do you remember? Do you see? Do you feel the purity of hate?”<br>
<br>
Suddenly I knew I had a choice. I knew it as certain as I knew my name…to live or die? To live in Hate, and avenge my parents or to die and walk with them. I was so young, and the idea of being so alone was frightening, then the fire of Hate filled my blood and I knew I had but one choice. To live, and to walk in Hate. I could naut quietly die, and leave this unavenged.<br>
<br>
I could hear quiet praying and the distinctive sounds of a spell being cast nearby…but still I could naut open my eyes.<br>
<br>
“Child, you must say it. I must hear your choice. I have your blood, now I need your word.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, yes, I vow it. My body and my life to Hate. Let me live and let me learn to avenge those who fell”<br>
<br>
A great peace filled my broken body, suddenly I felt no pain and my body felt whole once more.<br>
<br>
I opened my eyes to see the most beautiful purple eyes surrounded by white hair starting back at me. Never in my life had I seen one so beautiful. Of course, I knew what she was….every human child in Free Port knows about the Teir’Dal…the evil, twisted, misshapen Teir’Dal. Their hearts to evil and dark that it twists their bodies to gross disfigurements. This woman was naut disfigured or twisted, and defiantly not gross in any matter..and then she smiled at me. Softly she spoke my name &amp; I never thought to question how she knew it. She wrapped her cloak about my body &amp; bore me to my knees. <br>
<br>
“Say good bye to your parents child. We must leave quickly, but you must say your goodbyes first”<br>
<br>
I saw where the pyre was then. Rather than leave my parents bodies to the animals, she built a pyre and set them to the wind. <br>
<br>
I softly whispered goodbye. No other words, just goodbye.<br>
<br>
We quickly left the Feydark and she told me all about herself. She told me about Neriak and about growing up in Nektulos Forest. For many days we sat in the Planes just talking and waiting. She told me much of herself, and at night I dreamed. I was shown the true nature of the Teir’Dal, I was shown the beauty and the strength of the women and the pride and aggression of the men. I was shown the proper ways to talk and to act. I was shown the proper ways to attire myself, and lastly, I was shown the path I was to follow. <br>
<br>
“Naeneori, I had another dream”<br>
<br>
“Tell me of it, Ussta Dalninil”<br>
<br>
“It told me which direction I am to go. I must cover my self in robes as red as blood and go back to Free Port. I must journey through the tunnels and sewers to find the Dismal Rage. They will know to guide me further”<br>
<br>
“Then we must be off, gather your things, we will leave as soon as you are ready.”<br>
<br>
Within the hour, we found ourselves making our way to the mystical places in the Plane of Knowledge that would take us to Free Port. Shrouded in black robes, Naeneori guided me through the sewers to the Dismal Rage, then with a few muttered words, she was gone.<br>
<br>
I spent a long time down there training in the sewers. Much more than I care to say, but I learned so much. By day, my new an’kin taught me the arts of the Magi, by night, Innoruuk was my an’kin and he came to my dreams &amp; taught me the ways of the dark races and the purity of Hate. Finally one night, in my dreams I was informed I was ready. Ready to venture out into the world &amp; introduce myself.<br>
<br>
Please allow me to introduce myself. I am the Pale Prophet. I am the sister of Naeneori and the Childe of Innoruuk. I am the bringer of Blood and Hate. I am Sadai.<br>
