The tables were empty, the chairs neatly arranged.  The fire burned in the great fireplace, filling the cavernous room with flickering shadows.  The space showed no sign of the disasterous chaos that had rampaged through it just a scant hour before.  The chaos of words best left unspoken, of anger out of control, fanning the flames that would consume all in their path.<br>
<br>
She took a deep breath and turned away from the serene sight, stepping into her office.  She studiously avoided looking at the door across the room, the door that would take her into the bedroom she shared with her husband.<br>
<br>
The bedroom she -had- shared with her husband.<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn sat down at her desk, her head in her hands.  Her eyes closed, the only movement her fingers flexing against her scalp, pulling at her hair.  Her breathing became ragged, the sound of it crawling through the room.  A sigh from half-parted lips, ending in a whine.  The tears came in a flood, falling from her cheeks and the tip of her nose to lie upon the polished surface of her desk, winking in the firelight like faceted gems.  The riches of loss and sorrow.<br>
<br>
Her chest ached with a pain she'd not experienced in all her very long years.  Her heart pounded painfully against her ribs, the sound of it in her ears thunderous.  Her breath rasped in her throat, and still the tears fell.<br>
<br>
Slowly she sat back in her chair, her hands falling into her lap.  Her amethyst eyes were dull as she stared sightlessly across the room, their captivating glow all but gone now.  Her gaze turned inward, probing the depths of her soul and finding very little amongst the ashes that resided there.  Words rang through her mind.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you push him away?  He runs and runs after you, and you run further away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I want my wife back!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn stirred and looked down at her hands.  The fingers flexed, curling in upon her palms, her nails scraping against the gloves she wore.  She slowly stripped them off, revealing the scars that had never healed.  Scars she had gained in a moment of heart-rending pain and sorrow.  A moment like this.<br>
<br>
She swallowed hard, gulping air.  Tears flowed anew, covering her face and throat with wet trails.  She moaned, her faulty gaze falling upon the mantle across the room.  Trinkets spread across it: a skull, a large crystal of amethyst,  another skull in the shape of an iksar and brittle to the touch, a white arrow.  She gazed upon this last for a long time.  It had bled once, weeping tears of blood for her cousin.  Now it was whole and perfect once more.<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn came to her feet, pacing around the room like a caged animal.  Her head ached, but it did nothing to match the pain that raged through her very being.  <br>
<br>
She'd pushed and pushed, her stubborn nature never allowing her to see the harm she was causing.  Finally, anger had taken over and misted her thoughts in a haze of denial and retribution.  She'd struck, and struck true.  Words spoken, and like that perfect arrow they had come home to rest in the breast of her husband.<br>
<br>
He was gone in moments, disappearing into the night without a word uttered in return.<br>
<br>
She stopped pacing as she reached the mantle, her hand resting upon the white arrow.  Her fingers caressed the shaft for several moments before she grasped it, and without a word she brought the wickedly pointed tip to her face.  Placing it just below her eye, she drew downwards swiftly, laying open the flesh of her cheek in a long line.  She repeated the action immediately upon her other cheek, masking her face in flowing blood.<br>
<br>
She gazed into the obsidian mirror that hung above the fireplace, watching the blood course down her face.  She could see the cheekbone laid clean beneath in both gashes.  The openly bleeding muscle pulsed with each beat of her heart.  And slowly she became aware of a new emotion in her eyes.  She staggered back from the fireplace, placing her hand on her desk to steady her.  She closed her eyes, falling to her knees.  Horror at what she had done rose within her, matching the horror she had seen gazing back at her in her own reflection.  She moaned, lowering herself down to lie upon the floor in a tightly curled ball.<br>
<br>
She'd ruined it all, and lost the love of her life, all due to her stubborn pride and furious anger.  She moaned continuously, clasping her arms around her.<br>
<br>
Dawn found Kerridwynn in her workroom, cleaning the wounds crossing her face.  When each had been thoroughly reopened and bled anew she poured molten silver into them, uttering a harsh cry as the open blood vessels were cauterized by the heat from the metal.  The flesh around the edges sizzled briefly, and she gasped out a word of healing, touching the wounds with deft fingers.  Her face healed, the skin adherring to the silver as it cooled, leaving two shining bands crossing her cheeks.  She gazed into her reflection in the standing pool dominating the altar in the back of her workroom.  Her appearance was immaculate once more, although greatly altered.  She nodded, once.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;A mark for each soul lost to the blind pride and arrogance of my actions.  It is fitting.&quot;<br>
