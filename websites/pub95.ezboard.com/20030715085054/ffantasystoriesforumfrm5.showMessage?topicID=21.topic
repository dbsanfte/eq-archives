That was her first mistake. Her second mistake was not calling beforehand. She knew Michael hated talking on the phone and that even if it rang he probably wouldn’t answer it. She also knew that Michael did not get out much, so she was fairly sure that he’d be home. She hated Michael; hated what he had done to her. But she also had come to depend heavily on Michael as she always had. He was the experienced one who took her under his wing and taught her all she needed to know. The sexual favors he took from her in return for his knowledge had scarred her more deeply than she was willing to admit. But whether she liked it or not (consciously or unconsciously) Michael was part of her life and she needed him for many things. Tonight she needed him to find her a client, someone who would pay for her expertise as a hacker.<br>
        Mia did not think about the strange things that had been happening to her as she made her way across town to Michael’s flat. She had written most of it off as the results of a blood overdose, and anything she didn’t that explained she rationalized was probably a dream. So as she walked through the lonely streets she thought of nothing at all. She watched her cigarette smoke dancing in the dim light of the street lamps, she watched the rain water rush along the roadside and disappear into a multitude of steel grates with the letters ‘SPQR’ engraved on them. Nothing could have prepared her for what fate had in store for her that night. Well, maybe a glass of water, for her throat was far too dry to scream at the moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Michael opened the door quickly and shoved Mia inside recklessly. He stuck his head out the open door and looked both ways down the dim hallway before slamming the door shut as quick as he had opened it. Spinning around he grabbed Mia by the shoulders and threw her down onto the davenport, yelling at the top of his lungs, “Who the hell are you?!” He shook her by the shoulders until a small voice blurted out, <br>
        “Stop Michael! You’re hurting me!”<br>
        Michael stopped shaking her and backed away. “Who the @#%$ are you and what the @#%$ do you want with me?” He asked in what Mia thought to be the most paranoid voice she had ever heard.<br>
        Pulling her hood off and revealing her face Mia replied simply, “it’s Mia.” Michael just stared blankly at her. “Jesus! What the @#%$ is the matter with you ass hole?” A deadly grin spread its way across Michael’s lips.<br>
        “Nothing sweetheart, I’m sorry, I thought you were someone else.”<br>
        “Well I’m not someone else you @#%$!” Michael began to circle slowly around the davenport, never taking his eyes of Mia as she stood and pulled off her wet cloak.<br>
        “Interesting you should mention that.” Michael said in a peculiar voice. <br>
        “Mention what?” asked Mia, getting a bit more comfortable.<br>
        “@#%$.” Replied Michael, a little laugh behind his voice.<br>
        “What are you talking about?”<br>
        “I’m talking about the thing I’m going to do to you.” With that Michael threw himself at Mia. It was then that Mia realized the seriousness of her situation. She knew Michael and knew that they did not kid around like this. She also knew he was tripping, but on what drug or combination of drugs she did not know. Had she shot up on blood before coming over here, she could have easily defended herself. But as it was Michael was much stronger and faster than she was. For a brief instance she was truly afraid for her life.<br>
        Instinctively as Michael came flying at her, she curled up into a fetal position, trying to shelter herself from him. As she did this Michael got a hand on her. The moment his skin touched hers, time paused. When it started again, Michael was flying the opposite direction, straight into a wall, which he hit with a smash. Mia, not knowing what had happened, slowly peaked one eye up above her arm. She saw Michael get up slowly, shaking dirt and blood out of his cloths and hair. Without thinking, Mia raised one hand up towards the ceiling, and pointed the other directly at Michael’s chest. A wave of black energy shot out of her hand and struck Michael. At first it did not seem to have any effect, for Michael stood, motionless, for quite some time. Then, suddenly, his whole body began to tremble and shake. Blood poured from his open mouth as he gagged and coughed. He reached out one hand toward Mia as if to say ‘i’m sorry’ and ‘please help me’. Mia was too afraid to do anything for him. His eyes turned black and blood poured out of them like tears, forming two parallel streams that ran down his face and dripped to the floor. As his last desperate breath escaped him, his bloody and decayed corpse fell with a thud to the dusty floor.<br>
        Mia sat on the couch for quite some time, staring off into space, contemplating what had just happened. Tears ran down her beautiful cheeks and she shook uncontrollably with fear. What was happening to her? She tried as best as she could to rationalize in some way how she had managed to kill Michael but she couldn’t. In the end, she had only one option; to run.<br>
        Mia left the dismal apartment and ran, crying, through the streets of Rome. The rain poured down on her, and, combined with the tears, made her vision blurry and surreal. Every shadow she peered into contained the face of Michael, every noise that drifted through the early morning air sounded like Michael’s voice. She never stopped running.<br>
        When she finally arrived back at her apartment, she threw herself down on the bed and cried into her pillow. Somewhere in the back of her mind a voice, not too dissimilar to her own, echoed: ‘The other side is overcrowded. The dead will have no where to go.’<br>
        When the tears finally dried up she somberly searched for her briefcase. Opening it, she saw one of her tools. A long, twisted piece of black metal with a large razor on the end. Her mind flashed back to her dream in which she had begun to peel off her skin. “tear it off” she said in a low whisper. Shaking her head to clear the daemons, she reached for her syringe and quickly filled it with blood, from a small canister in a secret part of her case. She closed her eyes for a brief moment, took a breath, and then rammed the sharp needle into her eye. She emptied the syringe and then repeated the process for the other eye.<br>
<br>
        In the next few hours she had completely emptied the canister. <br>
She had injected herself with 80 times her regular dose. That was enough to kill anyone – even a god.<br>
