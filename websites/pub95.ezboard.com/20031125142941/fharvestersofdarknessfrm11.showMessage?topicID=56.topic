By orders of my Mistress Ankhami, I seek entrance into the Harvesters of Darkness. As some of you know, my great grandfather is responsible for a debt of blood owed to the lady, seeing as though my father and grandfather are both dead, that debt falls to me. I have given my word that I will serve her until she deems fit that the debt is paid.<br>

Part of me.... penance... is to join with you and offer my blades to you all. For this action I have been thrown out of my home, stripped of my rankings within the steel warriors and forced to join the dismal rage in the serwers of freeport.<br>

((ooc: Hello =) Just a little ooc back history here. Servantious is a shadow knight in the service of innoruuk, but as you can tell, he is a reluctant one at best. He's bound by the old chivalry ways of honor, he gives his word, he wont break it. He offers his sword, even if he doesnt want to, he will stand by that offer until he is dead or is no longer wanted.<br>

Ankhami and I have been working this story out for a good two or three weeks now and so far it's been alot of fun.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ankhami>Ankhami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Yath'tallar of Vengance<br>

Her one worry was Silenae. She knew exactly how she would look at this, all family were equal. They had gone through this with the male enchanter, Jeronic years past. Of course Vanti would not be punished by any but her. <br>
<br>
Stiffling a sigh, she made eye contact with Vanti and gave him a small smile. She knew how hard it was for him. But knew too he would be happy with the family. Furrowing her brow, do knights of Innoruuk feel happiness? <br>

<br>
Those words are on the tip of her tongue, but she does not speak them. After all, the Ilharess seems not to share her sentiments about this. <br>
<br>
Time would have to tell, if he was as reluctant as he seemed, or if he became an asset to the scythe. In the end, even the Enchanter had become an asset after all. Still, she was doubtful. There were differences, yes. The Harvesters were more organized, with more diversity than she had known before. But it still felt like a family. And that is how it should be. And in a family, there were no servants - no unwilling members. <br>
<br>
All these doubts flowed through her mind as she watched them. And despite her fears that this would lead to strife as she had witnessed before, she decides not to intervene. So, instead of speaking them, she turns and steps from the halls without dropping the shadows that cloak her.<br>
<br>
After a moment, all that remains from her presence is a slight chill in the air, and the echo of a whisper: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">All that is left to do is hope.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
