Michael's long dread locked hair framed his thin face perfectly, interwoven with strands of died blue and red. He was dressed in a tattered shirt that looked like it had seen better days, one could only barely make out the faint band logo that spread across his chest. He had plaid boxer shorts on, which Mia found somewhat disturbing. She didn’t really know what she expected him to be wearing, but this was hardly it. Michael had apparently just woken up.<br>
        “You woke me up.” Michael said bitterly as he threw himself down on the large overstuffed brown davenport. <br>
        “I’m sorry.” Replied Mia, standing in the open doorway, eyes downcast.<br>
        “Yeah. Well. Come on in . . . close the door.” Mia took a step farther into the dark apartment and closed the door behind her. <br>
        To anyone else Mia was strong and confident, but with Michael she was a little kid again, shy and nervous. When she was first starting out Michael had helped her. He had taught her and paid for her apartment until she could afford it herself. All he had asked in return were a few ‘personal’ favors. <br>
        “I haven’t heard from you recently . . . I was beginning to think they had gotten you.” Michael said non-chalantly as Mia began to relax and move over to the empty chair. Throwing the empty pizza box off of it, she brushed the crumbs off and took a seat, resting her briefcase on her lap, holding it tightly. “So what can I do for ya?”<br>
        “I need an apartment.”<br>
        “That’s gonna cost ya.”<br>
        “I’ve got money.”<br>
        “It’s not money I want.”<br>
        “That’s all you’re gonna get!”<br>
        “Easy sweetheart, no need to shout. I can get you an apartment, but on such short notice it will be quite expensive.”<br>
        Mia opened her briefcase and took out a large wad of cash. She threw it down onto the cluttered coffee table saying, “There’s 600,000 lira. See what you can do.”<br>
        “Sure,” Michael began, trying to hide his astonishment at the rather large amount of money just offered him, “I can get you a real nice place.” Ripping off a piece of the empty pizza box he scribbled a name and address on it. “Tell this man that I sent ya, he’ll hook ya up.” Mia took the offered scrap of cardboard and began to get up. “Ahhh . . . stay for a while sweetheart, catch up on old times.”<br>
        Mia turned her head and gave Michael a look that would make Satan himself cower in fear. “There are no old times that I would care to remember.” Mia walked to the door and left, leaving nothing behind but the large wad of lira and the faint scent of lilacs and eucalyptus. <br>
        As Mia walked out of the building, she stopped on the stoop and lit a cigarette from the pack she had stolen off of Michael’s coffee table. The address he had given her was on the other side of town, it was the address of a small pub in an out of the way neighborhood that no tourists ever went to. It was two blocks south of Via Del Coronari, on Via Del Vetrina, on the east side of the river. Mia shivered in the cold morning air and wrapped her coat about her tightly. It was going to be a long walk, but Mia didn’t particularly mind.<br>
        Mia kept off of the large streets as she weaved her way through the maze that is Rome. She enjoyed the calm serenity of the back alleys, places were very few people bothered to go, places that seemed to be haunted with magic. She loved the feeling of discovery she would get whenever she found something that she had never seen before. Such was the feeling when, wandering through one of the said back alleys she came across a small fountain attached to the wall of what appeared to be a very old building. The small semicircular bowl caught the water that poured forth from the gaping mouth of a stone gargoyle with huge eyes and a little nose. The little monster seemed to be seemed to be trying to scare people away from its sacred water. It being a thing of stone however, it would never know that its best attempts at fright only made people laugh. And so it was that Mia found herself standing in front of the crystal clear water, giggling to herself like a little schoolgirl at the twisted yet comical gargoyle guardian. Before leaving she cupped her hands and held them under the little waterfall until they were full of the crystal water. Bringing her hands to her lips she sipped on the cool water, and to her surprise it tasted not at all like water, but rather like the cool breeze on a hot summer day, like a meadow of lilacs and butterflies. Patting the little monster on the head she smiled and continued on her way.<br>
<br>
        The sun was cresting the rooftops of the city as she knocked on the solid oak door of the pub. She was beginning to think no one was there until she saw the chubby and unwashed face of a middle-aged man peering at her through the shut blinds of the window. When he saw her look in his direction, the man quickly disappeared from sight, and then reappeared as he opened the door only a crack.<br>
        “Who are you? What do you want?”<br>
        “I . . .” Mia began, only somewhat flustered by his crabby tone, “Michael sent me, he said you would have an apartment for me.” At the mention of Michael’s name, the grizzled face lost its rough edges and softened to a deep smile.<br>
        “Well, bless me! Where are my manners, please please do come in!”<br>
<br>
<br>
        The old man seemed to think of Michael like a son. Mia didn’t know how or where he had got such a great impression of Michael, but she decided it wasn’t her place to correct him, it would be inappropriate to inform him that Michael was in actuality nothing like what the old man thought he was. In the end the old man might have known, it depended entirely on how much Michael was paying him. Besides, it was kind of cute. <br>
        Johnny, which is how the man had introduced himself, had lead Mia through the clustered and dusty old bar and up a set of back stairs to the top floor of the small building. This would be her flat. The old man excitedly showed her around, chattering about this and that, and everything else (at one point she thought for sure she heard him mention something about ‘rats’). Apparently it had been quite some time since he had had visitors, or as he put it, “or at least one as pretty as you”. <br>
        Mia had spent most of her life trying very hard to be as far from ‘pretty’ as one could get. Mia was not, as some might say, the feminine type. But somehow when the old man said it, it just made her smile. Perhaps it was his old innocence, or perhaps it was his wide experience. Mia didn’t know what it was; all she knew was that when he said it, it seemed more like a compliment. <br>
        When Mia had finally convinced Johnny that she would be alright and that if she needed anything, anything at all, she wouldn’t be afraid to pop downstairs and ask, the old man went downstairs to open the pub for the day. When she was alone the first thing she did was walk over to the one small window and pull the curtains. With only the tiniest bit of sunlight sneaking in through the curtains, she surveyed her new home. All in all it was a nice flat, a bit on the old side, and a bit on the dusty side, but nonetheless she felt safe there. <br>
        Unlocking the briefcase from her wrist, she set it down and rubbed her wrist where the handcuff had been digging into and pinching the skin. She opened the case and took out her laptop, in addition to her syringe, which she promptly filled with more of the luminescent red liquid called ‘blood’. <br>
        After pushing off, she felt her muscles relax and the ‘blood’ made its way to her brain. Her eyes jolted open, and everything seemed to move in slow motion. Leaning back on her bead she opened her laptop and adjusted the settings on her wireless modem for an Italian call. She immediately searched the Paris Police files for any mention of her name. After satisfying herself that they had no idea where she had gone, she turned her computer off and set it on the bedside table. She climbed under the covers, too lazy to take off her clothes, and tried to fall asleep. It had been a few hours since she had began her trip and the relatively small dose she had taken was already beginning to wear off. Sleep would come in no time.<br>
        Just as her eyelids began to feel too heavy to keep open, and her mind started drifting off into oblivion, words once again began to form on her screen: &lt;&lt;Skin is just a physical manifestation of your mental self.&gt;&gt;.<br>
<br>
Mia tried to pull herself out of the dream world, but the battle was ultimately futile. She fell asleep looking at the rapidly multiplying, scrolling text that read: <br>
