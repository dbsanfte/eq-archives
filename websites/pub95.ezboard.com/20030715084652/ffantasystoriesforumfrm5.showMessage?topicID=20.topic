Mia woke slowly, painfully, her whole body aching with the horrors of the past week. Once again she could smell the faint odor of peppermint and scotch floating in the stale air of the small flat. Everything was the same save for a small piece of stained brown paper that was pinned down underneath the large ceramic mug.<br>
        Mia unfolded the scrap of paper and read the surprisingly smooth and elegant handwriting. “Drink the scotch, it will make you feel better. – Johnny” Mia smiled to herself as she thought of Johnny. Breaking off a chunk of bread she stood up and took the mug and bread to the window. She pulled open the blinds and let the warm sunshine rain down on her, rejuvenate her soul from the trials of the previous night. She assumed that all the events prior to her waking up just now had been a nightmare, and the memory of them quickly faded into obscurity. <br>
        As she stood in the sunlight and sipped the scotch she began to feel better. Her pounding headache began to fade, and she felt at peace. She realized that the only part of her that wasn’t happy was her stomach as it groaned at her noisily. The two hunks of bread she had had to eat in the past week were not good enough she supposed. She would have to go to the market and get some real food. She smiled at the thought of going out as she finished off her drink and skipped happily to the shower, shedding her cloths on the floor as she went. <br>
        She stood in the shower for a long time, enjoying the feeling of the warm water running over her naked flesh. She wrinkled her nose as the water began to run cool, and then cold, as the last of the hot water went down the drain. She turned the water off and stepped out, grabbing a towel from the rack and drying herself off. As she bent over to dry her legs, she noticed something strange about her waist. Fresh cuts had scabbed over and stood out freakishly against her pale skin. The cuts appeared to be in no organized design, but rather scattered randomly about her middle. It looked as if they had been made with a razor. She stood staring at them for the longest time, trying to remember what had happened. After several minutes and still no explanation, she gave up and continued to dry herself off and get dressed for the day.<br>
        She slipped into her short black lace skirt and her silk black corset. As she sat down to buckle on her heavy black boots, she noticed a small drop of blood soak into the material of her skirt. One of the scabs had started bleeding. She reached for a thin black scarf she had and wrapped it around her waist, hoping it would absorb any blood that might leak out. Grabbing her thin red tinted sunglasses she bounded out the door.<br>
<br>
        Normally Mia did not go outdoors, not until the sun had gone down. But today she was happy to be walking down the streets of Rome in the bright sun light. She tried to remember the last time she had been outdoors this time of day and not been high on something. She couldn’t.<br>
        She followed the ancient streets until she came to the street market. Tents were set up to protect the people from the sun, and inside were so many foods that her nostrils were overwhelmed with the smells. She wrinkled her nose and walked quickly as she passed through the small fish market. She walked through the crowded market until she found what she was looking for. Picking up a bag, she soon filled it with as many blood oranges as would fit. She also filled a bag with the spiky brown litchi fruit and one with fresh tomatoes. She waited until a crowd of people had gathered around the fruit stand, and then slipped away without paying. She munched on a blood orange as she walked, enjoying the open air and the cool breeze. <br>
        Stopping at a fountain to wash her hands of the sticky juice, she noticed a small curry stand set up in the far corner of the market. Not being such a fan of Italian food, she made her way quickly in that direction. When she got to the stand the old woman eyed her up and down suspiciously. “One vegetable curry please.” Said Mia as softly as she could while still being heard. The old woman slopped some of the curry into a small box, shut the box, and put it in a bag. She pointed to a sign behind her that read, in messy handwriting, “Vegetable curry – 1200 Lira”. Mia dug deep into the small bag that was tied around her waste, and threw a few coins onto the small counter. Smiling at the old woman, she grabbed her bag of curry and walked off.<br>
        She stopped at the Spanish steps to eat her curry. Normally she avoided places like this like the plague, for they were infested with tourists, but today she decided to do some people watching while she ate. <br>
        She watched a group of obnoxious American school children march by as they did there best to ignore their teacher who kept having to stop their lecture about the history of the steps to say things like “Mark! Stop pulling Stacy’s hair!” and “Jason! Don’t eat that.” Mia hated and respected the Americans at the same time. She hated what their culture had become, but respected their boldness in maintaining that culture.<br>
        As she sat there on the steps, she thought about starting to work again. By this time the heat would have surely backed off a bit, and it was probably safe for her to take on another client. Not knowing may people in Italy, she would have to see if Michael had any jobs for her. She made up her mind to go and see Michael that night. She finished her curry and threw the empty box into a nearby garbage can. Picking up her bags of fruit, she began to walk back towards her flat, smiling the whole way.<br>
<br>
        Wearing all black in the bright sun had taken it’s toll, and Mia found that she had began to sweat. When she got home she through off her clothes, and began to fill the old bathtub with water. She had stopped on her way home at the local pharmacy and had bought some soap and a razor. When the bathtub was full she got in and began to shave her legs. As she began a long stroke up the length of her leg, a knock came to the door, surprising her and making her jump a little. When she did so, the razor dug into her calve, bringing red wet blood to the surface of her skin. “@#%$.” She said to herself as she grabbed the towel to soak up the blood. The knock came again, this time louder. “Who is it?” Mia called out irritated. <br>
        “It’s Johnny Miss. Just wanted to see if you were feeling better, I hadn’t seen you for a few days.” Mia sighed in relief.<br>
        “Yes Johnny, I’m fine. Thanks for your concern, was just a little under the weather.”<br>
        “Alright Miss. Why don’t you come down this evening and have a few drinks?”<br>
        “Sure Johnny, I’d love to.” Mia lied.<br>
        “Great! Bye bye then miss.”<br>
        “Bye Johnny!” Mia yelled. She waited till she heard Johnny’s footsteps going back down the stairs before getting out of the tub to see to her leg. It was then that she noticed that the scars on her waist were gone. Not even the faintest mark remained of what earlier today had looked rather serious. ‘That’s odd,’ she thought, ‘I must have just imagined them.’ This explanation was not at all satisfactory, but under the circumstances she did not know of any other way to explain it.<br>
        She held the towel to her injured leg hoping to stop the bleeding. After a few minutes she removed the towel and looked at the wound. The slice in her skin that she expected to find was nowhere to be found, and in its place was a pale scar where the cut should be. It looked as if the scar had been there for years. She stared at it in astonishment for a long while, and then gasped as she watched the scar itself slowly disappear, leaving her skin untainted.<br>
