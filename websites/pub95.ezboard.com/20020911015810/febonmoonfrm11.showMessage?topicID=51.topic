<br>
The appearance is very similar to Wakening Lands and the exp and loot are damn good...<br>
<br>
I got 3 blues in about 2 ana half hours (in hell level) and I master looted 136pp and 4 gems for a group of 4 in the same amount of time...  The night before that, I was there with Vear and Zathan and we were doing fine, I got to loot a Green Jade Broadsword (1hs (pri/sec), 11 25, wt. 1.2, +8str, +8sta, +10svP, +10svD) and there are other very nice drops similar to this one...<br>
<br>
Now, it is supposedly a 40+ zone and the majority of the stuff there is blue to me at 40 with a bunch of reds thrown in too...   but, Zab joined us a couple times and did fine...   I think we could prolly squeeze in a 35 or two in a good group...  It is also considered and &quot;outdoor dungeon,&quot; so, SoW and Harmony, etc. work there, but because it is a Kunark Dungeon, there is a 15% exp bonus in there...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would sincerely like to get a group down there for a few hours sometime... It is rare that every area is camped, so it is likely that we could get an area any time of day...<br>
<br>
Is this something we could think about?  I don't want to be too &quot;high-level&quot; greedy...  should I be thinkin about lower level stuff and places?  Lemme know yer thoughts...<br>

I looked at the sites on this place and can't wait to see it in person. You guys just seem to already be there before I can get on, and to have you run out to get me is something that I hate to ask of anyone... family or not. We could head there after the meeting this Friday if you like.<br>
<br>
As for lower levels, most of them seem to prefer to fight solo. We've given them more then enough opportunities to tell us some place they would like to see, or to set up groups to help them, etc. I say let's just think about those that are active in the guild for a bit and have some fun. Fighting in these higher level zones, we may find more people that are like us that would be good for the guild. I have about 3 friends that I fight with that I would like to join our guild, but they still remain guildless... oh well I will win them over one of these days. Maybe I can get them to group with us sometime and then they would see we are different from the &quot;Uber Guilds&quot; out there.<br>
<br>
In any event, if you want lower level raids, then I'll lead some into RE, Paw, etc. Not a big deal and easy to set up on the fly.<br>

Would love to get in there and get a feel for the place. We as a group seem to need an area to hunt and get loot once and a while.

I thought you were there, Kel. CoM is a great place to go. Evac South and a run and we're there. It was heavily camped the night Norri/Solkin took us there, but the xp was phenomenal for all of us. The best drops on that night were off of Iksar skellies.<br>
Derilone has been fighting there. He recently won a roll on a Jade Broadsword. Grats to him. Yeah...let's raid, or at least group in xp zones like that. Dred can do his thing on weeknights. Let's go. That place is nasty. With Da interested, I find myself in a whole new let's go mode. What if it creates interest in, &quot;I wish I was high enough to go there&quot; rather than, hmmm...what would happen if myself and the rest of the xp-getting Shadows went here without an everything-is-green type of escort. For example, when Vear pulled the second floor of ToFS for us. Would we have all died there without him? I don't think so, but we'll never know. Anyway, I'm always good to plan a trip. Not a whole lot of 'em I wanna actually go on unless they're gonna be a challenge. Heh! My experience in CoM taught me little to nothing about getting through it unless it's all camped, but with a xp-rezzing or non-xp rezzing cleric, I wanna go learn how to with a whole bunch of different groups. I spend enough time on this forum without looking at others to find out how to do something. I wanna play!<br>
45, with a C2 sittin' in my buff window, and kinda bored,<br>
&lt;edited&gt; Everything in EJ is KOS to everyone. It's an easy run to CoM, though. I'm terribly curious to see how Derilone got grouped there. Did he go lfg? Was he with some people headed there? The only time I went there was with Norri, who had been there as Solkin, and seemed disappointed at the camps we couldn't get. The camp we did get got hairy at times, and Kel died at one point, but I'm pretty sure his death came from a train from an Iksar SK who was pretty pissed cause Norri's pull was takin' his spawn and training him, so he decided to bring his train to us. The ranger ate dirt. I'm curious as to why the other ranger didn't, but they don't call 'em dirt-eating rangers for nothing, right? Hehe, Kel died, and saved the whole group.<br>
Lemme take a moment to thank you, Kel, for all the times you've done that [died to save the group] when I've seen it.<br>

I was there that night, but i was so intent on the group because it was my first visit, that I did not really have time to pay attention to what was around me...   and, for me at least, on a first visit, I do not absorb all the info being fed to me by the person with knowledge...<br>
<br>
I have been there most of this week though...  just me a couple times...   I sat at the zone and waited til I could get into a group...  no lfg, I just paid attention to who was in the zone and asked...  I asked for family to join me when they came online, but I went down there alone...  I ran from DL and only problem I had was falling off the cliff in EJ that I did not know was there til I fell, almost died...  ;p<br>
<br>
I have not ventured too deeply, but I know the front of the zone fairly well now...   there are 4 or 5 camps before you get to the castle...   the bridge (easiest) (cept that right now there is a really bad mob in place for &quot;scarry weekend event&quot; thing), the courtyard (next easiest), then to the left there is the stables and another area which can be 1 camp or 2 (difficult to pull here...  prolly need monk to break spawns) and to the right there is the temple (harder than courtyard, easier than stables, imho)...<br>
<br>
I am familiar with where the &quot;safe&quot; spots are for these areas and somwhat familiar with spawn rates...<br>
<br>
So, after the meeting, I will go back down there for a few days...  any who would like to join me are welcome...  I really want the exp to get out of hell...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
--- As for me dieing to save the group, bah...   tis part of the way I play the character.  He is valiant (and dumb) to the point that nothing matters when it gets close to the &quot;end&quot;...  I did it again in CoM the other night for a group I had just met and knew none of...   there was a severe overpull (like 10 mobs showed up) and 2 members of the group were getting pummeled...  I memmed my AoE real fast (the goofy little 9 point damage one) and cast it...   they were all on me like white on rice in about 2 seconds...   the other two took off and when I started to run I fell in the water, kept getting stunned and actually only made about 10 steps before I died...   but that is another great thing about the zone...  it is considered a &quot;city&quot; as well and you can be bound there... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
