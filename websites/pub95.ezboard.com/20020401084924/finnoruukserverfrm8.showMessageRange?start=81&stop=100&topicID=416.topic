Guess what? I'm part of the community. Like me or not, like what I say or not, there's no way to avoid this reality.<br>
<br>
Now either this truly *is* a community forum and people make their own choices and live with whatever come from the remainder of the community, or this is *not* a community forum and those who moderate/own/whatever hold the inherent right to decide who can *be* a member of the community or not.<br>
<br>
But you can't hold this to be a community forum if the member of the community itself (in this case, the players on Innoruuk server) are arbitrarily held from participating. I say arbitrarily because much of the 'decision making' that happens here is based not on behavior, but on personalities. You can't tell me if I were smacking say.... Taurus.... around that the reaction would be the same. Ok, you *could* say that, but we all know that would be a lie.<br>
<br>
Being a moderator is supposed to be a position of impartially... ESPECIALLY when dealing with someone with whom you have no parity whatsoever. Impartiality isn't using your position (whatever that is) to influence others, nor is it using your access to deliberately inflame a situation you *claim* to want to see come to an end.<br>
<br>
Someone doesn't like what I say? Don't fooking read my posts. This isn't rocket science, people... and it isn't like my posts sneak up on you. This is a passive medium -- you have to request the data. And for the sake of whatever honor you think you have, do us all a favor and don't try to hide behind 'the rules' when you've stepped in it. <br>

If they are going to ban me, ban me and be done with it. But all this lolly-gagging about over justifications is silly. If indeed this is a community forum, then the matter is moot, people need to learn to exercise their willpower, and banning is just wrong. If it isn't, justification doesn't matter and one wonders why they would bother with it. -shrug- <br>
<br>
I don't mind making the point, even now. It needed to be made and more than a few have noted the tendency to ban those who aren't part of 'the in crowd' (whatever the hell that is being defined as these days).<br>
<br>
Is it martyrdom to point this out? I suppose that depends. Frankly, the idea of forcing people to deal with their own dual-standard is something I don't feel particularly bad about doing... even if it does result in having to find another playground.<br>

<br>
Nzaz is a moderator, it is his job to be impartial and if he has an opinion to keep it to himself and not let it interfere with the moderation of these boards. Nzaz not only blew off that responsiblity, he publically sanctioned every person who trolls the boards looking to flame Gamiene.<br>
<br>
Mythal is also a moderator, by his admission he tacked the post at the top so it would remain up, which further reinforced this opinion as a sanction of anti-Gamiene flaming on this board.<br>
<br>
Denross, then took it upon himself to climb out from under his rock to state that anyone who disagreed with his moderators should go to he||. And stated that his moderators are perfectly within their rights to state whatever they wish.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, all three of you are in the wrong.<br>
<br>
As far as Gamiene's problems with Ally, if they don't like each other, oh well. (And I have read the post.) It seems however that the staff has highly different opinion when it is one of their own getting flamed.<br>
<br>
Some of you may wonder why I seem to defend Gamiene. It is because I have had to deal with the same kind of crap that she puts up with on a daily basis. Posters like Dalynia and Ugle who troll the boards looking for trouble and get particularly excited when they see Gamiene's name cause they know they get to have the flame war they so desire. The sad part is Inno.com has just given them full support.<br>
<br>
I won't say I agree with everything Gam says. But I certainly don't agree with the &quot;Fook you, Gam!&quot; flames that follow every one of her posts.<br>
<br>
What I'm basically saying is that the moderators have blown off any consideration that they might be impartial for all time. And they have proven that this board is not about the community, it is about them. And if they don't like you, you will be publically denounced, or banned.<br>
<br>
This board was already going downhill, but I think this post as just lit the bullet train to hell.<br>

 I think you three are forgetting one thing. This IS thier board. They can run it however they want. If they want to all be hypocrites and flamers, they can. If they want to ban someone they feel is bad for thier boards, they can. Whether Nzaz was right or wrong, is totally immaterial, they set all of the rules. And it comes back to the old saying, &quot;If you don't like what they say/do, don't come here anymore, your not forced to &quot;put up&quot; with ANY of this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if it Hypocritcal<br>
<br>
Even if you don't like it<br>
<br>
Even if you don't feel it's fair<br>
<br>
It's still not your board and not one person forced you to read/post here.<br>

How did you manage to read my last two posts and miss their point so completely?<br>
<br>
To reiterate -- these forums were and are being presented as 'the place' for 'the community' to gather. <br>
<br>
The nature of a community gathering place is not some gated park where a small party of self-appointed 'rulers' decide if you're part of the community. The community has been clearly defined as those who play on Innoruuk server. Not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and I like', not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and will kiss my arse', and not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and have enough people liking them that banning them or speaking against them would make us look bad'.<br>
<br>
Investment of money is irrelevent. To attempt to use such as an excuse for engaging in elitist behavior is not only shameful, but dishonorable. No one forced them to do it, they claim to have done it for 'the greater good of the community'... and to attempt to hold that out as a tool of discipline over 'the masses' is as unethical as it gets.<br>
<br>
This place is supposedly a community forum being provided by servants of the common interest. If they wanted a dictatorship, or a mutual admiration society, they should not have bothered with the pretense to serving the community... as neither are in any manner amenable to that end.<br>

   &quot;My ball, my rules! If you talk the talk but don't walk the walk people are going to notice. I guess we should all be lil subversive brown noses like you and then we'd all get along just fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
   What a poor, poor attempt at a flame, but we don't need to get into that... I better analogy would be... You walk into a a widget making group. People are talking.. You are abusive or self-flagulating in this group of people. They begin not to like you, they ask you to leave and express they way they feel about you. The leaders of the group express to the other members, that you are trouble and might want to avoid them. THEN you accuse them of &quot;abusing thier power&quot;, and anyone that happens to agree with them is &quot;subversive brown noses&quot;? Sounds like a case of sour grapes to me. YOU chose to be here, they didn't ask you to come over with a personal invitation. YOU chose the tone of your posts.<br>
<br>
Gameine:<br>
<br>
  &quot;To reiterate -- these forums were and are being presented as 'the place' for 'the community' to gather&quot;<br>
<br>
    You still chose to come here, again, your missing my point, they run the place, and if you don't like it, don't come here. You can perceive that this should be anyplace you like, but the reality of the situation is, it's still &quot;thier&quot; place.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The nature of a community gathering place is not some gated park where a small party of self-appointed 'rulers' decide if you're part of the community. The community has been clearly defined as those who play on Innoruuk server. Not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and I like', not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and will kiss my arse', and not 'those who play on Innoruuk Server and have enough people liking them that banning them or speaking against them would make us look bad'.&quot;<br>
<br>
    You seem to want to equate your ideals to a place. They set it up, run it, and moderate it. Again, if you don't like how something is run on THIS board. There are others. Check out eqvault or everlore or castersrealm. But because &quot;you&quot; think this has more to do with a democracy then say a club, then I guess we will just continue to disagree on those points.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Investment of money is irrelevent. To attempt to use such as an excuse for engaging in elitist behavior is not only shameful, but dishonorable&quot;<br>
<br>
    Money has everything to do with it. They put out the time, and effort to run this place. Therefore that implies, it's &quot;thier&quot; place. On top of that, this is neither the Government nor some sort of job employment. They can be as &quot;elitist&quot; as they want. <br>

What does the term &quot;subversive brown noses&quot; mean to you? <br>
<br>
Subversive being one who works in secret against the established order... don't see any of those here, although of course that could just mean that they're very good. <br>
<br>
Brown nosers being an inelegant term for those who curry favor with authority.<br>
<br>
Are you SURE you didn't mean submissive?<br>
