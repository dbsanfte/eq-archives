So many people here seem to be Robin Williams in &quot;Hook&quot; before he remembered how to fly.  Too many of you seem to have forgotten how to skip.<br>
<br>
I think it's virtually impossible to have anger or fear in your heart, when you are skipping down the road, one of your children holding on to each hand, belting out the Power Rangers theme.  A real shame is the fact that in order to get bubble-gum flavored toothpaste, I have to get a tube with Barney on it, who promotes Pagan practices by singing and doing chants to make Magick happen.  Gee, you're pissed at me for ranting in a Forum created for a game in which we kill Bixies with Maces and Swords.  Go ahead, keep your heart filled with hatred and anger.  I choose not to.<br>
<br>
Lal, where was your post about all the other people who used to play EQ that have died in the past?  Why does this person deserve more compassion then any of the others?  There may have been others who had similar things happen.  I'm NOT calling people out for showing compassion to this person.  I'm calling them out for NOT showing compassion to any of the others, if you can call posting on a message board a sign of true compassion.<br>
<br>
If someone comes up to me and says &quot;Your mother is so fat then when she comes over the hill in her yellow raincoat, it looks like the Sun coming up&quot;, should I rip their throat out with my teeth (dam, now I'm hungry)?  Naw, I'll just chuckle and move on.  I love my mother and would give my life for hers without hesitation.  But I'm not so small-minded that I'm going to get all bent over it.  Somehow I have this really bizarre, wicked, twisted idea that life is about living.  So I try to enjoy myself, and go to sleep at night with a smile on my face.  It must suck to go to bed with such heavy hearts and stresses as I see from people's attitudes here.  <br>
<br>
Think of this poor girl this way.  Do we cry when someone we don't know wins the Lottery?  Do we cry when someone we don't know gets a huge raise?  Why would we feel sorrow for someone who is far, far happier now then she was a few weeks ago?  I am not condoning killing people who have problems, and think those who commit these crimes should be punished far more severely then they are.  But I can't grieve over someone who I never knew so I won't miss, and someone who's better off now then they were.  It must be awful to have that weight on your heart and mind.  Guess life sucks for you heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uizlaaru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izlaaru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 11:43:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/candon/izlaarusmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil?</span><hr size=1> Ugle:<br>

Your opinion is your own, and may be shared by others.. BUT<br>
<br>
Most people tend to like to show respect to people that have past on.  Me personally, weather I reply to the post or not (on the net) I will still bow my head in respect when a death is brought to my attention.. weather I know the person, love the person, hate the person or whatever.  I personally know very few people in person that play this game, but when I hear that one of them has died, it touches me.<br>
<br>
Everyone deals with Death differently, please don't criticize people for the way they try to show their respect to their fellow human beings.<br>

Yeah right, thats why you posted your diatribe in a thread meant to convey sympathy.  Cast no stones Ugle and I won't pick them up and throw them back.  Truth is I am not filled with hate and anger I have two living children and I know exactly what you mean about the joy of being with your children.  My issue isn't with what was said but rather with your choice of forum.  It's called respect and I just believe you should respect the deceased regardless of your personal opinions.<br>
I don't get holding people accountable for what they DON'T do either.  By your standard if I want to express sympathy I have to do it for everyone?  Thats alot of sympathy.  So I guess that explains why you can't show any because no one can live up to your standard including yourself.<br>
I'm glad you have such a prosaic view on life that you go to bed happy every night too.  So if you truly live by that philosophy why dump on other people does it make you happy?  I don't go to bed happy every night but I don't go to bed pissed every night either and you know what that makes me?  Normal.  Get a grip Ugle people need to express a wide range of emotions in order to function, deal with it.<br>

<br>
<br>
I have 4 children been in the battered womens shelter and been other places I dont care to talk about anymore....<br>
I have since then DONE my part for society in that manner and raising 4 children to be productive memebers of society is a tough job in itself.... <br>
<br>
The only thing that was offensive to me with ugle's posts was saying that we are all basicly lazy cause we play EQ all the time and hide from what society is doin around us.... I play EQ to talk with my friends that I have made here and get lost in a fantasy world from a world I have been in all day dealing with low life scum like this man that did this Camelia.... So I do my part all I was saying is that Ugle needs to not turn this into a post of ranting on why we are wasting our time in EQ and not on the streets ridding the world of low life scum... I for one am Not SUPERMAN but with all of us looking a bit closer at what is goin around us yes we can all make a difference... I just dont want to be told im wasting my time playing EQ cause I deserve my time I play...... as do alot of others... <br>
<br>
Ugle you would be surprised at what RL Classes we have playing this game... Did u know there are @#%$ Detectives playing this game that deal with it on a Daily basis... did u know we have school teachers that play this game that are raising our children with us on a daily basis did u know that there are Attorneys that play this game that are locking up the low life scum? ETC ETC....<br>
<br>
All Im saying is that your generalization really makes alot of mad that DO a part and yes your right if ONE person wakes up that isnt doin there part with keeping there eyes open then your post was worth it but please dont make me lock this thread start a new one for this discussion and leave this thread alone for the Condolences That is all Im asking....<br>
<br>
<br>
And also to if you care to discuss this in a further manner lets meet in chat or talk to me in game im always there for others... <p>Palidinaya</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubrogunesforoad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brogun ESFOROAD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 2:14:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Have to point out what I consider to be a couple of fallacies in your post Ugle the first and most glaring is that the people who posted their sorrow didn't know the deceased.  First what exactly does it take to know someone at least enough to call them a friend? <br>
 If it is solely by personal contact then maybe you would have a point, but then that would exclude anyone who has had a pen-pal, been stuck in BFE alaska and whos only contact was using a ham radio, or anyone else who was unable due to circumstances to contact that other person in person, but would any one you passed on the street and said hello, or a neighbor you see once maybe twice a week but only when they are mowing the lawn or picking up the newspaper.<br>
 Relationships do not have to be in person in order to have meaning and their are various levels in relationships, any and all relationships. Personally I mourn for those who I knew either casually or intimatly because they have affected my life to a certain degree and that seems to have been the case with some of the people here. Their relationship with the young lady may have been quite extensive, you really don't know yet you seem to believe that somehow you are morally superior to them at least by the tone of your posts, your not.<br>
 As for the existance of evil in individuals, yea there is. How can I make this outrageous (to you) statement, well having had an extremely abusive step-father might be a start but thats not quite enough, I have seen the horrors that man has done to his fellow man up close and personal and much to the blight on my own soul have been a part of that evil. Ever killed someone and felt sheer joy at the act? I did while in the service of my country on more occasions than I wish to remember, the only thing that might help to have atoned for some of that was nailing an allied officer in the shoulder as he was trying to lay waste to about 8 kids under 7 years old solely because of their race. He certainly had no regrets for the attempt and only regretted that he was stopped. If you really want to know evil and at the same time try to aid the rest of the world then I would suggest you join the armed forces, my rec is that you try for marines (force recon/sniper) or army (rangers/sniper/black beret... oops they dont really exist anymore.... right). <br>
 I agree with you that more people should do what they can to make the world a better place but disagree that because they care about someone that they know only from cyberspace they are somehow hippocritical emotionally.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/17/02 5:27:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   actually RE: to another thread but Pali said to move it here</span><hr size=1> Apollohades, you are the rude one for not reading the whole thing.

As I said, when I found out someone that I only knew from EQ passed away, I felt sorrow and loss.  I felt Sowl's post about his friend that he would miss in this game was very touching.  But Sowl had interacted with this person, and I agree with you Brogun, that you don't have to have personal, physical contact with someone to become attached to them.  I didn't see any posts from someone who knew her casually OR intimately.  If one of those conditions applied then for me to comment on that persons feelings was at a minimum in extremely poor taste, and I apologize.  But from what I saw, it was people who read the news clipping, found out that she played EQ, and somehow felt that now thier lives were changed.  My post was about those who would not have known she had died, or the circumstances of her life without seeing that newspaper clipping.  Perhaps their lives did change, but it boggles my mind that a news clipping of one person could do that, especially when you can find a similar story in any major newspaper pretty much any day of the week.  It might not always be above the fold as they say, but it's in there.  Brogun, which post in that original thread should I look at to see someone who knew this person, I'd be just fine with you showing me so that you can prove your point?<br>
<br>
As far as the military, I'm too complacent now to take the cut in pay and the workload.  Kinda struck me as odd though, those fellow Infantry soldiers I knew who had gone to combat didn't feel any joy in killing someone else, I can't say any of them described enjoying it as you had.  I'm not sure what your point was about learning about evil by joining the armed forces.  As an NCO on active duty and in positions up to PSG in my Guard Unit, I always found that the military did not allow the kind of evil that I am talking about.  Yes, up to a certain extent I guess I can understand, you are in an area with automatic weapons and the ability to leave a place with no witnesses.  But then again, you have a more likely chance of someone finding out what you had done there then you would have if you waxed a few Wino's in a major city.  If I were to go back I'd probably get my stripes back and go SF personally.  Most of the people I saw who had a few years in one of the Batts end up barely able to walk from all of the abuse they put on their bodies.<br>
<br>
And for all of you bleeding hearts asking me what I have done for me to criticize you.  I'm not coming in here talking about how much I care for my fellow man.  As I've said before, I really don't care about those who are not part of my life.  So my inactions would back up my words more then most people's actions in this matter would back them up.  That doesn't mean as I'm sure most of you assume that I am a rude person to those I meet.  But it means I won't lose any sleep because someone I've never met will die in a car crash tonight.  Show me someone who has been damaged physically or emotionally, and I become a basket case.  Show me a newspaper clipping and I'll use it to start a fire with.  I don't *think* I don't have any compassion, I just don't have enough energy to show compassion for every single person that I can read about in print.  Frankly, you could spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week reading obituaries and newspaper articles about the cruelty inflicted by man.  I'd prefer to do something more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Now back to my favorite punching bag.  I agree, I have no problem throwing stones, and I have no problem picking up the ones thrown at me and throwing them back.  My feelings aren't hurt by your words, yet you act like mine hurt yours.  Respect the deceased.  May I ask why?  None of the other posters in here showed any respect for her Father.  Does he deserve any?  Not that I can see.  But yet I need to show him respect?  For all we know (and I'm only using this as an example), this girl for her part molested other children, set fires, stole cars, committed assaults, etc.  That's the problem with a news story, people jump on certain aspects without knowing the whole truth.  That's a big part of why I can't respect the deceased without knowing them in some way.  And why I can say I don't feel loss when they are gone.  How many people are going to see the men in Black Hawk down as heroes, and get attached to one of the main characters, whose real life model is in jail still I believe for crimes involving children?  Yet how many people who will see that movie will know that?<br>

Holding people accountable for what they don't do?  Someone posted about stopping some scumbag from @#%$ a girl.  So if I stood by and watched, maybe took some pictures and a few notes that would be ok by you?  Brogun talked about protecting some innocents from someone in a blood lust.  If he had stood by that would be ok by you?  Do you get it now or do I need to draw a picture?  Inaction in some cases is the same as condoning or participating in someone else's actions.  If you hear your neighbor beating his wife or child, and you do nothing, then you are allowing him to do that, and yes, in my book that only makes you marginally better then him.  If you see a person at work who is obviously depressed, do you at least say &quot;Hey, how's it going&quot;?  For every Shintou who cries out for attention, there's probably at least another hundred people who could have a great day if someone just sat and talked with them for five minutes.  It's those people who will just sit and pass by that person day in and day out, until one day that person isn't there anymore that I blast for what they don't do.  At least I'll call them on their inactions when they try to tell me how compassionate and what a great person they are.<br>

Somehow life sucks for me because I don't feel personal pain for every wrong done by one human to another.  As I've pointed out many times Lal, you don't either.  You claim to feel pain when you read about someone you don't know.  Yet you feel no pain for that person until it's brought to your attention.  So then is it a fair comparison for a Christian to say that Jesus didn't love someone until he met them?  Tell me how you feel about the two children that died in my city last night because of some jerk-off drunk driver.<br>

Pal, I have to laugh about one of your comments.  You talk about school teacher playing this game.  I remember one of my good jousts with DoW members in the past.  It was a post from someone talking about how I shouldn't make fun of their guild because it had good people in it like himself, as a school teacher.  Of course, his post was absolutely filled with typos, poor grammer, in all honesty my 11 year old would have gotten an &quot;F&quot; on any report she turned in looking that bad.  Detectives playing this game eh?  Sorry, known too many cops for that to make me think that just being a Police Officer makes them a good person.  That's like saying I need to respect Jack Kevorkian since he's a doctor, or saying that I need to respect Charles Manson because he's a religious leader. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 9:07:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Brogun, a Ranger is what they used to call a black beret.

So to call someone a Black Beret now would only mean that they were in the military (I don't know though if that's just an Army thing now or if all the services are doing it).  So I could call a Ranger a Black Beret.  I could call a cook in a Field Support unit a Black Beret, or a PAC clerk in a Transportation Battallion.  It really means nothing now, the honor of that Beret is lost, thanks Monica and Bill.  If they were going to pick on a Beret it would have been less controversial if they had used the Crimson Airborne Berets, but I guess she didn't look good in that color.....<br>

They also give out a beret to many of their people depending on their job, such as their form of the military police.  They think that means they &quot;earned&quot; them.

Who is making those Black Berets?  Hmm, a company in Arkansas according to more then one site.  What is Bush doing about the Beret issue? <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/3/8/163625.shtml">www.newsmax.com/archives/...3625.shtml</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Could the former CINC have done something to look into this issue since it's obviously a serious matter for the Rangers?  Well, this CINC is......<br>
<br>
You also should have pointed out that from the mid to late 70's, there were some other units who wore Berets in the Army other then the current Ranger/SF/Airborne units.  I don't see why anyone would have a problem with MP's or whoever wearing Berets.  But they can pick their own dang color, to steal one that has the blood, sweat, and tears of so many Rangers was a slap in the face.  Monica wore a Black Beret in one of the more famous pictures of her and Clinton together.  And yet somehow I'm not allowed to criticize him.  So you don't think at all that the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; army where recruits get time-out cards in basic training has anything at all to do with this decision if I understand you right. <br>
<br>
I went on Active Duty right as Clinton was taking office.  I saw the difference in the Privates coming out of basic training within a couple of years.  People were getting out in droves, good, senior people.  And many of them told me it was because of the direction we were heading in.  We still have the finest fighting force in the world, with the finest soldiers.  But the Military now is not what it was in the 80's and early 90's.  Sure we have better equipment because of technology, but as far as our training?  We are now &quot;An Army of One&quot; if you read the recruitment posters.  Pretty sickening thought to me since Esprit de Corp, teamwork and discipline is what units used to be about.  I'm sure for the most part it still is, but the degradation of these core values didn't start under a Republican President. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 2:32:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Ugle, someone has to be the REMF.  I've been in the reg Army for 14 years now and served in the National Guard before that.  When I was in the Guard I was in turbine engine repair (helicopter engines).  After joining the Army I became a 67H with a B7 identifier (OV-1D Mohawk Crewchief with the ejection seat repair ASI).  Now I'm a 96D (imagery analyst) and stationed in Hawaii with Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC).  I'm a Grave Lord from 2 years of work at it.  I'm single so I have all my spare time to use on games.  BTW, I also don't play any longer.  Read the papers and watch the news and you'll know one reason why.  Thanks to the Army I've been to Saudi Arabia (8 months for Desert Shield/Storm), Korea for over 2 years, Bosnia, Germany, Cuba, Thailand, and many other places.<br>
<br>
I joined before Clinton took office.  I went through basic back in the mid 80s.  You want to talk about differences in the way things were in the Army when I joined compared to when you joined?  You had it easier.  Regulations changed to make certain punishments or exercises illegal for example.  <br>
<br>
For being anything other than a REMF, I can't since they had to cut out over a half inch of bone from my foot since the bones were fusing together.  Without people providing the information needed or other support then the front line wouldn't get far either though.  It's the teamwork thing you know.  As for the berets, the black beret belonged to tankers before the Rangers got them.  How did the tankers feel when it was taken away?  I hate berets.  I wore one for 4 years and it didn't keep the sun out of my eyes.  It didn't keep the rain off my glasses.  It's hot as hell when you're out in the sun with it on.  You need two hands to put it on properly.  <br>
<br>
If you want a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; Army then stay away from people like me.  In Bosnia I had a soldier taken away from me because &quot;SGT, you yell at her too much&quot;.  I caused her to cry a few times I guess.  You know what though, after a couple of weeks they put her back under my control because they figured out that she needed yelling at.  <br>
<br>
As for your statements about Republican presidents.  Of course any military person in their right mind would vote Republican.  The Democrats have a history of destroying our military and then bitching when the military doesn't have the stuff needed to do something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 3:29:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> I understand the issues of support.  Many of the behind the lines people work just as hard and put themselves in a still considerable amount of danger just like the Combat Arms people.  We had some kick-tail Wrenches who loved heading out in their M88 with their Grease Guns (And I mean the ones that shoot live rounds heh).  I had a lot of respect for most of those guys.  Every soldier has their place and role.  It seemed odd to me that someone in a non-combat arms unit would be so vocal in their arguments supporting the Rangers is all.  I can't comment on how things were before I joined obviously, so all I could comment on was the rapid changes I saw after I joined, I guess I deserve your flames for not knowing everything that ever happened before I went in.<br>
<br>
I also am trying to look for where you got the idea that I was for a kinder, gentler Army.  All I can find is where I spoke against it.  The idea of NCO's beating the hell out of soldiers to instill discipline to me does seem unnecessary.  In the grand scheme of things that kind of stuff did not quit happening all that long ago.  As far as making your soldier cry, not sure that's something to be admired.  I will say though that IMO, if a Soldier needs a time-out card, or cries under pressure, they need to be discharged because a person who can't handle stress should not be in an occupation where extreme stress will always be a possibility.  It's too bad in a lot of ways the way the Guard is structured though, it's detrimental to discipline.  On AD if you screwed up, your nights, your weekends, YOU belonged to me.  And we corrected the problems, and things were good.  In a Guard unit, they are going home Sunday night.  Even the loss of a <br>

I don't know that I would say it is completely fair to say that all Democrats ruin the military and all Republicans make it stronger.  The military took large cuts under Bush Sr. as well.  In general terms what you are saying is true.  But in our next presidential election, who knows?  There are some Dove Republicans that would be more harmful then some of the most Hawkish Democrats.  It's likely that there would be other issues that would sway the balance, but I don't believe you can necessarily say that because someone is a Democrat they hate the Armed Forces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoderrybadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oderry Badgerclaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 3:50:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clanbadgerclaw.homestead.com/files/face.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> USARangers now wear Tan Berets btw... awesome in BDU's, horrid in Class A's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/18/02 6:10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> The kinder Army thing was a generalization that I guess was too broad.  Should a NCO beat the heck out of someone?  Not normally, but there are times that wall-to-wall counselling is useful and gets the point across the best.  As for making her cry, it wasn't bragging, it was to show how some people try and use things like tears, or those darn cards that thankfully I've never seen, and try to use it to get out of what they consider &quot;stress&quot; when they just want to be weak.  To be honest, one of the times she cried was when she said she wanted to go airborne so I told her to drop and give me 10 to show she could handle the PT needed to get through the school (she had failed a PT test the week before BTW).  If she couldn't handle what little I did to cause stress then there was no way she could handle a school like that where the stress is way worse.  I guess it didn't help when she got on my bad side before we even went to Bosnia.  I was in charge of getting her and a second person to Bosnia to run our little commo van (only a total of 5 were deployed to Bosnia at one time from my unit and while there we didn't fall under Army command technically, was kind of cool) and at the 9mm firing range she almost shot me because she couldn't control the weapon.  That was the first time I had seen someone actually jump across the barrier and actually tackle someone on the range.  Three safeties quickly tackled her.  Then while in Germany for 2 weeks of specialized training on the way to Bosnia she would vanish for hours and show up late in the mornings so I couldn't account for her and her safety.  Did she earn some good tongue lashings, I thought so.<br>
<br>
It's not that I support the Rangers, but the fact that I hate the berets.  I also work with Rangers every day, and SEALS and Special Forces.  I named my unit earlier, it should tell you why I work with them.  <br>

The Guard, it's ok, but it wasn't for me.  I went AD right after my 6 month requirement was completed (must stay Guard 6 months after AIT before going AD).  <br>

Yes Oderry, the new tan berets do look nice in BDUs, and I'm sure they are a little cooler in the sun since they don't suck up the heat like black does.  But in a way, I'd have to agree with them on the pain of switching to begin with even though they stole it from someone else origionally.  I know the South Korean SF general was pleased when he was presented with his tan beret during my last exercise there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 6:27:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Look.

And then someone that doesn't even play on this server gets several threads with a bunch of people talking about how much they will miss her, or how their lives are worse now.  <br>

Im still wiating for you to tell me what it is you do to help stop it and why you are playing EQ instead of goin to spend time at that shelter for abused children animals or whatever..... <p>Palidinaya</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/upalibadgerclaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pali Badgerclaw</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/19/02 9:39:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/19/02 10:01:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> First of all, I don't play EQ anymore.<br>

Second of all, do I want to know how you feel when you walk past a child with a bruise on his or her face?  I thought you had kids?  My kids have done stuff to where if I didn't know better I would think someone beat the tar out of them.  Kids get bruises playing.  Good grief, if you grieve everytime a kid bruises himself and you imagine someone mistreated them, you have far more severe problems then I'll ever have.<br>

I don't volunteer on a regular basis, but I done some work along that vein.  I also feel no need to come on here to try to talk about how great I am, about how much I do for the world.  And I'm not the one on here trying to talk about how great I am, I'm not as much of a blatant hypocrite as those most of my ire was vented at.  But I obviously underestimated you, you must be a cross between Jesus and Mary.  So, are you Mary with male Organs or are you Jesus as a Hermaphrodite?  Enquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
Can't homeschool them because of the cost?  Excuse me?  I know quite a few people who homeschool.  Some of them are using their own curriculum so they aren't buying any of those courses.  Their cost to homeschool their children is -0-.  I also understand that in some states you can ask for the money in taxes that the schools would normally spend on that child and use it to cover your costs.<br>

* trying to be serious here*<br>
I may be jaded, but if you imagine any child that hurts himself was abused, truly believe that all of the schools in your town are no better then halfway houses, and truly believe that you are so superior to everyone because of your volunteer activities, you really shouldn't be working with emotionally fragile people, because you have some real issues to deal with.<br>

You don't have to be a professional race-car driver to give someone driving tips do you?  You don't have to be a policeman to stop someone from committing a crime, do you?  You don't have to be a licensed psychologist to give someone advice, do you?  Yet my impression of your arguments is that if I don't give you proof that I do more then you do that I can't say that we should all be doing more?  You're mad as hell at me for insulting your ego.  You talk about all the problems you see in the world, and treat me like your worst enemy?  You have a problem with priorities Pali. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/20/02 2:26:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, why do we care, and what is evil</span><hr size=1> Okay Ugle.
