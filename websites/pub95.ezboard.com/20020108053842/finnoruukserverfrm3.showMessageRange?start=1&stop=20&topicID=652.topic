I think it's time for goodbye</span><hr size=1> Have any of you ever stopped and thought about what time really is and what it means to you?<br>
<br>
Time... it's an equal opportunity resource.  All people, regardless of gender, race, creed, or nationality have exactly the same number of hours in a week.  No matter how important you are, or how rich or poor you may be, you still get 168 hours to spend each week.  No more, no less.<br>
<br>
Time is also an unusual commodity.  It can't be saved.  You can't store time in a bottle and stash it away for a rainy day.  Time can't be seen, felt, touched, tasted, or smelled.  You can't even sense time directly.<br>
<br>
Because this commodity is so elusive, it's easy to ignore.  But this doesn't matter to time, because time is perfectly content to remain hidden until you are nearly out of it.  And when you're out of it, there is no more restocking it.  When you're out of wood, you can chop some more.  When you're out of money, you can earn some extra.  If you're out of love, there is still hope for another.  If you're out of health, it can often be restored.  But when this minute is gone, it's gone... FOREVER.<br>
<br>
Jeisenne the enchanter was created on December 24, 2000 and is now roughly 99 days old.  Looking back on the days that I spent playing her, whether it was in a regular exp group, on a big dragon raid, or just slumming around zones being a high level bum with friends, it's still a lot of time spent building her.  Time that I can never get back.  Time that I wish I could take back and spend differently, because had I known that my playing days would end the way they did today, I would know that investing all my time on her would be for nothing.<br>
<br>
Ironically, time is something that is not trivial to me.  So letting go of Jeisenne like this does hurt since I have invested so much into her, but the past few days in game have seroiusly soured me.  Betrayal and being lied to hurt, and so I'll remove myself from the environment that feeds the animosity before I can grow more bitter.<br>
<br>
Of those 99 days I spent playing her, I look back and think of what I could have done instead.  I could have put together a book of poetry, or painted another sunset over the ocean.  I could have maybe started school earlier and be working in the field I so desire to be right after the holidays.  I could have made a few more mud pies with my 5 year old son and maybe worked harder on teaching him how to swim.  Maybe I could have put some more effort into saving my broken marriage, instead of just letting him walk out the door all those times, after which I would sign on and avoid the ugliness of reality.  There's SO much more I could have done and probably should have been doing, but I chose to invest 99 days of my life this last year differently.  I wish I could have some of those days back.<br>
<br>
So moving forward to now, I'm being proactive and choosing to spend time pushing my new life into its future.  I'm about to be a single mother... I'm doing very well in school so far and things are looking up.  I have the moral support of my family and some very good friends, both online and offline, to help carry my spirit through when it starts flagging.  At this moment, I no longer have a current love interest, but I'll be all right.  I can't be with somebody who can't be upfront and honest with me, and who won't allow himself to lean on me in his time of need.  But finding love isn't a priority for me right now anymore.  I've seen the light.<br>
<br>
Nine years ago tomorrow, I met my estranged husband by pure chance... I dialed up his pager thinking I was calling a friend, and I got him instead.  He called me back and we agreed to meet that night.  Six months later, we were engaged.  I was 19.  They say that falling in love with somebody again is not a difficult thing to do... we'll see if that's true.  Here's to hoping I can keep my cynicism at bay, cause I don't know if I can fall again for him or not.  Too much hurt stands in the way.<br>
<br>
Anyways friends, this whole deal on time is something to think about.  Whether I decide to keep playing or not after tonight remains to be seen.  But I know that I have only so much time left to use, and I better start using it wisely.  There's a whole world out there for me to conquer, and I'm not going to do it by playing games all day.<br>
<br>
So maybe Jeisenne will never get to SoL.  Maybe Jeisenne will never get the title of Phantasmist.  Maybe Jeisenne will never find another companion to keep her enchanter self mezmerized now that the one who promised to cherish her and share her Norrathian life with her has shamelessly gone back on his promise.  Maybe Jeisenne will never again see a sunset slowly sink into the horizon over the Ocean of Tears.  Maybe Jeisenne will never see past a 3 on the 1-10 scale of Uberness, 10 being UAF (Uber as @#%$).  Even if she does or doesn't do any of these things again, Jeisenne has accomplished plenty in the game.<br>
<br>
My number one accomplishment lies with each and every person in game that I call my friend.  And there were more of you than I ever gave myself credit for.  I can't even begin to mention every single one of you since that will make this post longer.  I will mention one name however:<br>
<br>
Dystopya, during my winter break from school I am going out there on a Friday and hanging out with you for a day or two.  You owe me that time buddy!<br>
<br>
Wind to thy wings brothers and sisters.  Til we next meet again, may life treat you all well.<br>
<br>
Yours in friendship,<br>
Jeis<br>
<br>
Edit:  Mirswith, I have the rings, robe, and gloves to give back to you.  All my other belongings should I choose not to return will be divided among my guild and friends when the time arrives. <p><img src="http://notoriouskillers.com/jeisenne.gif">

I think it's time for goodbye</span><hr size=1> I can honestly say the same thoughts crossed my mind today.  What else could I have done in the (in my case) 130ish days I've played EQ, what else could I have accomplished.  It got to the point earlier that I was going to cancel my account, but well, I couldn't start EQ, so I couldn't cancel my account (which I guess worked out best in the end).  I realized that it's not 'being uber' or getting the next best thing that keeps me coming back, but the great friends that I made that are there when I log on.  I don't consider one minute out of the 10's of thousands I've played to be a waste, because the people I've met while playing are truly special to me.  Anyway, this probably doesn't help you, but if it does I'm glad it could.  Go where your heart leads you, it's always the only way to know the right direction.  Good luck in whatever you decide. <p><a href=http://www.fnurt.net/amici><b><i>Astralblade Fyresinger</i></b></a><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1810>   (me!)</a><br>

<br>
I dont see how those 99 days could possibly have been wasted, you said yourself you met a ton of people, and have a ton of friends, that doesnt sound like it was time that could have been spent much more wisely. Remember when we met, in Rathe Mountains, when i was looking for Brother Zephyl, but i didnt know anything about him? And you told me i had to kill hasten? And you helped me kill him? That is one of my fondest eq memories, meeting you, that was time wasted? All the time you spent, all the friends you made, wouldnt quitting now MAKE it time wasted? <br>
<br>
I have a million things to say right now but i cant seem to say them, ill post again when i figure it out...<br>
<br>
But whatever the case, take care, have fun in whatever you do, dont waste precious time regretting things youve done in the past, and dont forget, there are people here who care about you a lot.  <br>

Many times I have questioned why I spent so much time in front of my monitor when I could be out doing something else but then my wonderful guildmates whom I have meet in RL (and what a blast it was) always manage to get me back in the fold, even after being poached or trained. There is a nice balance in life that we all must strive to find. It is not always easy but there is a balance there. Remeber that behind all these pixels (or poloygons) there are humans who have enjoyed the time you spent with them. You will be missed and if you ever need to BS or just see what is going on send me an email to darknoble@hotmail.com<br>

I don't know what to say. I logged on and you hit me with this.  I know things have been difficult for you, we have talked at length about it.  If you choose to leave EQ for good, you know I will support you to the end.  If you choose to keep playing, then hopefully to can touch others like you have myself and many more like me.  At any rate, I still need to do something about my phone as it STILL seems broken :P Talk to you soon hon.<br>

For two months of my playing time he was the best thing to happen to my enchanter in game, and there is SO much that I would give to have that all back.<br>

To quote my long lost Jason the last time I saw him 9 years ago:<br>

Mirswith is going through his own tough times, and I only hope that someday he &quot;can take the time to brush the leaves aside so he can reach us...&quot; (source: Far Behind by Candlebox)<br>
<br>
And yes Kuri and Astralblade, the friends that I've made here in game are really what keep me coming back. But everything has its place, and right now my place does not belong in game. My place belongs with him:<br>

P.P.S. Candlebox is very theraputic music right now for me.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ujeisenne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeisenne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/6/01 1:08:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoldliontamer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Liontamer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#778899>(12/6/01 1:53:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> Liontamer has about 109 days play time and i played since sept 99 and i just thought what i couldve done with 109 days and well i coulda done ABSOLUTELY nothing i woulda been bored outta my mind or sleeping<br>

Hell, even if you cant make it out to Phoenix to meet me, I dont blame you. You got more important @#%$ to worry bout right now.<br>

Not sure what to say other than take care of yourself and that precious child.  You're an amazing person and I loved having you in EQ, but you're right, life has its priorities.. Make sure and take care of them.<br>

But yeah, id either be sleeping, or contemplating how much beer I was going to drink if I ever had any money, which was rare. Of course, now I just drink beer when not on EQ, and work. <br>

SO yeah, time is time but most of it is garbage anyway.<br>

Since I left EQ, my life has been 100% up hill, and I do not know what on earth I'd be doing right now if I hadn't left. To those still playing.. I agree its fun and I won't be the one to tell you to quit, but please don't let it don't let it drag you down. The most hurt I ever felt was losing my best friend over EQ.
