As for the Shm Botb, Bogbar wasn't in our guild when it happened, however he was in it shortly after and I know that he always considered his title our guilds. =D  But, I degress.<br>
<br>
And yes, I understand the reference to the BotBDE and the semi-unfair advantage it presented in the rogue and warrior BotBs.

Where'd you get that idea from?<br>
<br>
I did a bit of beta testing for it, but I played the released product for all of 5 minutes, before cancelling my account. Sorry, I was never into AO.<br>
<br>
I still play EQ - not a huge amount, but I'm on several times a week for a bit. You can tell me the 301 story, but I don't doubt that you might know it - it was played out on LoD's public guildboard, so anyone that was stalking them at that time would know it. <br>
<br>
I'd say any attempt at arguing about superior gear winning a given BotB is really barking up the wrong tree. Especially in reference to the rogue BotB - a person with an ounce of common sense would realize that the 301 hardly made up for a difference of 3 levels. (And she faced rogues with amazing (at the time) gear on Test. Her only loss was to Wendolyn, who went on to win in the Finals, but I'm digressing now, myself.)<br>
<br>
But hey, you can bet I had that 301 in my backpack during the necro BotB....<br>
<br>
Bogbar was a recruit with TP in between the time he won the title, and he joined LoD - I'd hardly say you folks could lay claim to the title - but arguing that is pure semantics. How do you degress, anyway?<br>
<br>
In the context of this argument, BotB's were brought up to mention individual titles, for individual events - I'm not sure I'd apply ToT's to that, but you're more then welcome to do so, if you'd like.<br>
<br>

LoD happened to help each other out in the caster competition recently, so ToT's would fall into the category moreso then BotB's....but it's a stupid arguement and I'm not gonna bother.<br>
<br>
As for more BotB victories.  Hooray for you.  Go solo a dragon being you guys can win more solo competitions.  If this were a PvP server, then more power to ya.  But as far as I remember, this server isn't and damn near everything you have to kill does NOT involve soloing one bit, it involves grouping or even multigroups to drop.<br>
<br>
As for gear as an arguement.  That's stupid.  It can help a little, but in this case, Doorf has been only guilded for approx 1-2 months now, and his gear is nothing like most of the other clerics in the guild.  His stuff is/was no different then anyone else at the competition really.<br>

Waitasec... This isn't a solo game? Damn.<br>

I'm not sure why you felt the need to throw the &quot;Thank You, Captain Obvious!&quot;-worthy line in there. We weren't the ones to throw BotB's into it.<br>
<br>
As far as soloing - you're making this strange attempt at trying to draw some parallel between PvE and PvP - there isn't one. The one thing that PvP encounters prove though, is how well you know your class, and how to use it's tools. Your arguments almost seem like some abstract thought process that Benaman (Banannaman? Hell if I remember his exact name - the guy on VZ or TZ or FU or whatever...)  would use.<br>
<br>
I'm rather sure that myself and my guild can hold their own in multigroup encounters - I'd even venture the guess that we're considerably more effective, per person then many other people on the server. Feel free to underestimate us though, I think we're happier that way.<br>

There was a 43 to 51 level one a few weeks ago on a sunday I think.  Cost 2pp per level to get in and I don't think the winner got a title.  <br>
<br>
Same thing happened there but wasn't really that big of a deal.  There was a group, everyone called the alliance, 2 or 3 warriors, a monk and a shammy.  They moved together taking out people.  <br>
There were other people grouped together too just not as powerful I guess.<br>
<br>
Event lasted maybe an hour, lotta running around, rogues couldn't use hide bah!  <br>
But eventually there were 2 members from one group against 3 members from another group, right after I got knocked out.  <br>
<br>
The 3member group beat the other two then started killing each other, winner split the money between the alliance.<br>
<br>
Winner was announced, received his prize and a good chunk of people stayed after to have some more pvp fun.<br>
<br>
Still was fun stabbing the casters when meditating behind a pillar, taking out the alliance shaman who got rooted, poking the chanter who dropped a piece of food and cast the spell that turns you into an object nearby, and instilling the doubts of those around you! <p><CENTER>

My opinion of you used to be that you were great players but my only view now is your in it for yourselves(obvious you dont care).

Please don't point names though thats how rumors get started.. However if you think you know who I am send me a tell in the game sometime. I will tell you one thing.. Ive been playing alot less, so if you dont see your suspect on it just might be me. I do admit, I remember a feeling i had from SJ. In SJ i had more fun than i had anywhere else... We did big things etc, and I do remember the best thing about them.. Even when i wasnt with them i never felt like i wqs being looked down upon for being lower lvl or less uber. And when i joined them all i saw was kind people. Down to earth people with respect for players in the game not just for lvl and uberness but for being a player... Another thing to rant about.. I know LoD will find this funny.. But i think it's kind of rude to make a picture on your webpage &quot;all LoD must wash genitals before entering&quot; or some crap like that... All you do is think about yourself.. What about the children that play this game huh? Ever think they might check out you website?<br>
<br>
Again LoD *smooches*<br>
