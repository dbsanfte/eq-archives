Mia stared down into one of these very mirrors, looking at the person she had become.  While at the hospital she had lost a lot of weight, which for Mia, meant that she was now deathly thin.  Her hair was grown out and disheveled, no makeup on her face, dressed in the dreary garb of the asylum’s nurse uniform.  After all that had happened to her, she had lost the ability to cry.  She stood there, cold, alone, and confused, contemplating suicide.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The faint odor of death floated on the cool air and tickled Mia’s nose.  She turned in the direction of the odor and followed it to an open window of the ground floor of her apartment building.  With a quick check for broken glass, she hoisted herself up, and clumsily slipped into the window, landing on the floor on her back.  Standing and brushing herself off, she looked around her.  The room was covered in bloodstains and police tape.  She shuttered, as the scene-looked way too familiar.  She left the apartment and headed up the stairs to her own apartment.  Death and decay filled the entire building.  Every open door she passed she saw the same signs of murder: blood, chalk outlines, ghosts.  She kicked the door to her apartment open and proceeded to throw up.  As the door swung open, dead pigeons spilled out into the hallway.  The room was filled with them, but it wasn’t just pigeons.  Crows, ravens, finches, starlings, squirrels, mice, and rats, all filled the apartment.  All dead, and in various states of rigor mortis and decay.  Mia immediately gave up all hope of salvaging anything from that hellhole, and ran as quickly as she could down the stairs, through the mirage of police tape, and out of the building.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mia flew through the streets, kicking off her shoes to run faster.  The rain soaked her hair, her cloths, and every fiber of her being.  Then she saw it.  She saw her answer.  The bright lights coming closer, consuming her world.  She ran toward the light with a faint smile on her face.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The truck honked its horn and swerved out of the way, narrowly missing the suicidal Mia.  She fell to her knees in the middle of the street, feeling like nothing else but a failure.  She had @#%$ up her life, and now she couldn’t even succeed in taking her own life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was there, in the street, in the rain, in the utter darkness of night that the voices came to her again.  Like thunder rolling across the clouds they came.  Like nails piercing her brain they came.  “Why do you resist?  You are part of me, and you will live as I lived.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No,”  Mia whispered, “I will never be like you.”  For the first time in a long time, confidence came to Mia.  It was robust, invulnerable confidence, the kind of confidence that comes only from someone who doesn’t fear death.  “I know who you are, and you will never take me, I will thwart you, with every part of my being I will hinder and harm you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How can you harm me when I do not exist?  I have been around since the beginning of all things, and have chosen you to be my agent on earth.  What an honor for you, to be used as my tool.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The only honor I have, is that I will be the one who will destroy you.”  Laughter, hysterical and insane, filled Mia’s ears.  As the laughter faded, she realized it was herself who was laughing.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There were few people on the streets that night, but the few who did happen to pass Mia gave her looks.  They peered at her through the rain and the dim streetlights.  Thin, soaking wet, kneeling in the street, talking to herself.  Some laughed at her, some felt pity, but all kept on their way being thankful that they were not like that.  Crazy.  Insane.  Out of her mind . . .<br>
<br>
