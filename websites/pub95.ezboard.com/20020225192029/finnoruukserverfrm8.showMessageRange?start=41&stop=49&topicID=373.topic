He wrote &quot;The Prince&quot; has a handbook for rulers, so that there would be less incompetent tyrants.  His writings are based upon a research of former rulers.  He does a version of the American politcal axiom, &quot;He is a bum, but he's our Bum.&quot; in reference to tyrants who were able to regain their thrones.<br>
<br>
Aldrin, I don't like Reagan as much as you like Carter. Being a Federal Civil Servant during all 8 years of his administration you would too.  Also, he was as sleezy as Clinton in a different way.  Carter was too nice a man to be President.  Sleeziness is a plus for a good politician.<br>
<br>
I have also read Adam Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; and laugh when an economic pundit misquotes from it all the time. My favorite hidden quote from &quot;WoN&quot; is:<br>
<br>
&quot;It is said the the wear and tear of the slave or bond servant is the responsibility of the owner, and that the wear and tear of the free laborer is born upon himself.  I say no, the wear and tear of the free laborer is also the responsibility of the business owner as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smith was a humanist.<br>

That's BS. The free laborer is just that, free. If he doesn't like the working conditions he can get work elsewhere, or he can start his own business. A slave or bond servant doesn't have that option, even in good economic times. I've always been fond of the concept of &quot;contract labor&quot;. It implies more independence.<br>
<br>
Yes, I imagine a civil servant would hate Reagan. He didn't do a lot to endear them to him, bless his heart.<br>
<br>
I don't know what drugs your on, but I don't know how you can compare any President to President Sextus, except maybe Kennedy. Sextus was a perpetual adolescent playing at being a celebrity/President.<br>
As Sextus was sleezy in every way, I don't see how that statement could even parse.<br>
<br>
I don't prefer Jefferson to Machiavelli, however; as you said, Machiavelli was trying to write a treatise on how to rule (hoping to get a job...) when he wrote &quot;The Prince&quot;. But I have difficulty respecting anyone foolish enough to write &quot;We are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;  What tripe. Rights don't exist. <br>

I do not agree with &quot;egg-shell stepping&quot; groups like ACLU all the time; however those groups serve to balance out the goofballs like some here who say &quot;kill all the ragheads&quot;, lovely sentiment there, and who want them summarily judged and dealt with.<br>
<br>
God save us from the unholy bitch session that would arise should the tables be turned; should the Taliban ever imprison a group of US soldiers and treat them inhumanely.  The ACLU (or whatever its international equivalent is) couldnt intervene fast enough in that situation methinks.  And thats the way it should be, there ought to be watchdog groups that keep tabs on prisoner conditions and such--whether it is in America or in some 2-bit 3rd world backwards country.  It doesnt represent the US getting walked on, it represents HUMAN BEINGS being treated as HUMAN BEINGS should, which is the bottom line here.  Another way of looking at it?  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  al-Qaida should have thought about that beforehand, but 2 wrongs dont make a right.  Try them, sentence them, carry out the sentence and be done with it, dont torture or humiliate them in captivity, and likewise dont afford them the excesses they would have outside that prison.<br>
<br>
I personally think its a good thing to rebuild Afghanistan, or maybe a better way to put it is &quot;re-colonize&quot; Afghanistan with people that think the way America does in terms of social structure and programmes, hell give them aid and send people over there to teach them how we do things--set up their government, help them build a legitimate police force and military, bring airports and a road/rail system, teach them to play baseball even...30 years of that should be good.  Then there will be a whole generation of Afghans who are used to living in a free, capitalistic society similar to the US, without religious persecution, thinking like America does.  Give them the best we have to offer, you think they would choose to go back to the Taliban way of life?  Keldinfindel said it first...propaganda.<br>
<br>
You wanna call me naive, or a socialist, or any other name you want, fine I dont care.  I just find it hypocritical to hear people being so hard-line when we'd be screaming bloody murder if if the tables were turned.  And remember--the Taliban considers <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> US</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be the terrorists.<br>
<br>

<br>
Every other one of the first ten have been disregarded or circumvented.  By things like the bogus &quot;compelling interest&quot; argument, which states basically that the government can completely disregard the constitution if it can show a &quot;compelling interest&quot; why it should do so.  Or that really sad case where a farmer was growing food for his family (maybe somebody knows the case, it's famous) and the US Supreme Court decided that because the food he was growing for himself MIGHT otherwise be purchased through interstate commerce (if he were not growing it himself this is) then the federal government was allowed to regulate his subsistence farming under the interstate commerce clause.  That particular ruling has led to the federal government regulating EVERYTHING, because if growing your own food in your own property can be considered interstate commerce so can anything.<br>

There are many other cases also.<br>
<br>
Organizations such as the Red Cross need to be overhauled.  If the news program 20/20 can be trusted, the Red Cross has a hard time handing out money.  They reported on a few cases and named many more where large amounts of money was collected for a disaster and where only up to 1/3 of the money collected was actually handed out.  In the mean time they suddenly had money to remodel their offices or to pay some of their people salaries of 300+k a year.  Yes the Red Cross does help many people, but obviously they aren't what exactly what they claim to be and has changed over the years.  <br>
<br>
The Taliban considered us terrorists for striking back at those who hit us first.  I look at that as the kid who takes little jabs at another kid and when he is struck back he cries about how the second kid started the fight.<br>
<br>
Where are we torturing or humiliating them?  They are being fed well with cultural meals.  US POWs lost up to 50% of their weight in many POW camps.  Are these guys starving?  US chaplains were killed in many POW camps to show how their god couldn't protect them.  Are we restricting anyone from practicing their religion or killing them because of their religion?  These detainees have it good compared to what many other countries use as camps.  They are being fed and  sheltered.  They are allowed to practice religion and get exercise and showers.  The Red Cross and countries such as the British have visited the camp and haven't said we've been abusing the detainees. <p>Kilamdar<BR>
