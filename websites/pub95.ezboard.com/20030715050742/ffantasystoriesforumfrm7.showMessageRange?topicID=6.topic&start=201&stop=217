The others were gone.  It was only Nefi.  The hatred, the fighting, the blood, had worked its way into her body and was not eating at her soul, turning her into a heartless cold thing.  Death was all she saw now.  Nefi put her hand to Mika's forehead, concerned about her health.  Mika watched the long, slender hand coming toward her and right when it was about to touch her, she pounced.  In a heartbeat Mika had Nefi pinned down on the floor.  Mika did not see Nefi right now, all she saw was an oportunity to feed.<br>
<br>
With the madness controlling her, Mika leaned down and began to kiss Nefi.  She was trying to suck her warmth, turn nefi into a cold thing like her; but Nefi was too strong for that.  <br>
<br>
Color returned to Mika's face, the frost disapeared.  Mika's eyes returned to their normal color and the madness temporarily left her.  Nefi had not been affected.  <br>
<br>
Mika pulled away and crumpled on the floor next to her friend.  She was exahusted.  Nefi rolled over and looked at her.  <br>
&quot;are you ok?&quot; she asked.  &quot;yes.  I feel fine.  i don't know how long i can keep my sanity intact.  we must find and destroy the cause of my transformations, before i'm lost forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mika stared into Nefi's eyes and then realized what had happened.  Nefi had used her own energy to help bring Mika back.  Mika stared, a tear forming in her eye.  Their lips met and Mika knew she was in love. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umegrua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Megrua</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 7:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=205>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Me n' Devin goin a huntin'</span><hr size=1> Carmen just sat in the kitchen, thi swas all so weird.

Find the cause, she said. Find it...<br>
<br>
There were two banzai trees on either side of the room in Derek's apartment. There was also a hanging tropical plant or something that engulfed the whole ceiling. The growing lights came on to give them their daily doseage of sunlight, and the blacklight-lit room brightened immensely. It was mostly blue light in the spectrum, enhancing the growth of leaves. All of a sudden, Derek could see blue. Everything was blue. The image shifted to green, and the room blotted out. There was no Mika. There was no Nefer. There was no Jash. There was no Carmen. There was no vid screen. There was no automated kitchen. But there were rocks. There were plants. There were trees, and birds, and air, and a stream, and cliffs, and dropoffs, and mountains...<br>
<br>
Derek was flying.<br>
<br>
Soaring out across the landscape, he realized this was the world as pure. Purity, before the obscene corruption. No, wait... this was after it. There were ruins of cities. Great, majestic birds flew from the tops, catching the thermals above massive lava beds. This was a tropical area. Open lava vents, mountains... for some reason, the word &quot;Andes&quot; popped into his head. South America, eh...?<br>
<br>
He was on the ground. Visions of spiders flashed through his eyes. Flash. Flash, flash. Tarantula. Black Widdow. Brown Lecluse. Spider, spider, SPIDERS!<br>
<br>
The spiders stopped. From the blackness of nothing emerged a sillhouetted shape. Derek shouted, &quot;ILLUMINAAAATE!&quot;  The darkness scattered away like scared puppies. Stalking forward, as if held up by a string, was a woman with a human torso and the body of a spider... much like Tsabo Tavoc, yet... not mutilated. &quot;Sp-e-eea-k,&quot; she whispered. Her unearthly voice seemed to leave ripples along his soul...<br>
<br>
She held out her hand. One leg almost glowed white. &quot;S-s-s-s-aa-rah,&quot;<br>
<br>
The legs stuttered and twitched. Each one seemed healthy, curled underneath her frame and drooping downwards. One leg had a yellowish tint to it. It seemed to cringe away from the fuzzy, black abdomen.<br>
<br>
She smiled. Derek looked down, and saw the second to front leg on her left side; it was shaking madly, twitching as if it wanted to be separated from its body. It was red... glowing red... Third from the front, on the right side, the blueish one, was still, calm. It didn't pulse, it didn't move... yet the blue tint began creeping over the red leg. She licked her lips. &quot;Mi-i-i-ka-&quot;<br>
<br>
The world flung backwards. Derek flew back away from everything, away from the forests, away from the landscape, and back into the room with a scream. His eyes were wide, tears streaming down his face. He was clutching the pillows and stuffing on the couch, the one he never allows harm to come to, and was ripping it apart with arms and feet spread wide.<br>
<br>
Even through their own weaknesses and distresses, Mika and Nefer ran to his side. Carmen bolted up, and Jash put his hand on his brother's shoulder ((figuratively speaking)). In a matter of seconds, Derek calmed down, bewildered. He embraced Mika, and kissed her fervently on the cheek. &quot;Don't let go, Mika. Keep a hold on it, don't EVER let go!&quot;<br>
<br>
For the first time, he remembered the beaten and battered Lor. Lor... &quot;Sarah, he says...&quot; Derek mumbled.<br>
<br>
Nefer's eyebrow went up. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek looked at her with an intense gaze. &quot;Sarah. This...&quot; Hairs stood on the back of his neck. Derek whipped around, and pushed through his friends to the wall. Yelling in rage, he brought his fist down on the wall, leaving a splattery mess where a spider once was. He grabbed a leather coat, neglecting the need for longer pants (( hell, shants are long enough )), and put the faltering Mika's arm around his shoulder. Nefer took the other. &quot;Sarah @#%$ Lor. Sarah's fuckin Mika. Sarah's gonna @#%$ us all. I say we @#%$ her first.&quot; As they made their way to the door, Derek tried to keep the thought out of his mind that he had no idea where they were headed... &quot;Computer! When Jerron and Devin get back, tell them to call my cellcom. We need to do this. Fast.&quot;<br>
<br>
They stepped out the door, Derek muttering about the cost of plane tickets to Peru...<br>
<br>

Jerron walked in behind, no keeter that had ever seen him was still alive, and he meant to keep it that way.  Three men, all giants among the mentalists stood guard.  They seemed to be lax in their duty, but each had a gun within a handspan of their fingers.  &quot;Devin, I'm going to make a distraction, I'm going to need you to take them out.&quot;  The cat didn't seem to be worried, and thats what worried Jerron the most.  He closed his eyes, which had recently been staying a constant shade of gold flecked green that seemed to glow yellow in the dark, and concentrated.  Their minds were weak, their muscles and guns were not, yet that mattered not....for now.  He prayed the mentalists didn't detect his work as he implanted in the minds of the brutes an illusion.  To them, it sounded as if their was a fight outside.  A quick glance through the darkness showed that the mentalists hadn't picked up on his message, yet two of the three brutes had.  They grabbed their guns and walked, cautiously over to the door.  One peered out to see what was happening, but he didn't quite get to see as a pair of fists slammed down onto the nape of his neck. The other turned to see as he fired a random shot.  Devin delivered a quick kick to the neck and it was out cold.  A bullet whizzed past Jerron's face as the third brute saw what was transpiring.  &quot;Let's go!&quot;  Devin put his hand on Jerron's shoulder as he leant down to touch the two unconscious brutes.  The four dissapeared from sight as another bullet flew right through were Jerron had been mere seconds before.  Jerron and Devin appeared with the two unconscious men, alone in Derek's appartment.  &quot;Whats goin on Dev?&quot;  Is Lor ok?!  Is Mika?, did they take them to the hospital, was it too late for her, either her.  I love them both, in very different ways.  Derek will know what to do, he always does.  Jerron raised his cellcom to his ear as he spoke Derek's name and got a dial-tone.<br>

<br>
Derek turned sharply, and headed down with the flow of gravity to avoid a head-on collision. Gasping for breath, Mika asked, &quot;Why the hell are we going to Peru?&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned his arm around to put his hand on Mika's throat. She pulled away, as if thinking it a threat, and nearly clocked him. Absent mindedly, he moved his head to the side, and said, &quot;Because I don't want you goin all Lumina on us. You belong with the world of the living, Mika.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And there's some plant in Peru that can cure me or something? Derek, you're making no sense!&quot; her confusion was bordering on rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had another flashback. This spider chick was smirkin at me. Lor had said &quot;Sarah&quot;, right? The spider chick said her name was Sarah. She also had a red leg. Kinda resembled the red thing on your chest. I think &quot;Sarah&quot; is tryin to @#%$ us all over.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mika huffed. &quot;Whatever. What does this have to do with Peru?&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek slid into a parking spot next to a transport tube. The tube went straight to the lobby; hopefully, there would be, like, ten seats left on the plane for them all. &quot;I got a hunch she's in Peru.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wide eyes stared at him. &quot;A hunch?&quot; they all seemed to say.<br>
<br>
Derek's eyes were wide. When he realize just how foolish this all sounded, he braced for impact... &quot;So... do you wanna just go home? Wait out the Lamia deal, possibley lose Mika?&quot; Derek's mind was made up. He was going, regardless... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umegrua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Megrua</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/15/02 6:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=210>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Covert 'perations</span><hr size=1> ** Is Carmen with your all or no she still in the kitchen?** <p><HTML>

No words, only understanding.  As his eyes closed, Devon placed his hands on Jerron's shoulders.  It was going to be difficult, to transport into a moving object, but he had a clear image of Derek's car, hopefully it would work.  He cleared his mind of all clutter, there could be no confusion.  Every aspect, his friends, the car, the dent in the side came forth.  In he felt the physical tug as he and Devon rematerialized in the car.  There was no suprise, they were getting used to his coming and going.  &quot;Hey everyone, Peru eh.&quot;  Derek explained the situation as the skyport loomed closer and closer.  &quot;So....we're basically just following a hunch?&quot; <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/16/02 3:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=212>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ( just for the record)</span><hr size=1> Derek just stared. &quot;Well... yes.

Why was she glancing at Derek so much? Stop it! She could have left. Yet, she had a feeling they'd need her, sometime. A flesh curtain fell over her violet eyes as she settled against Jash her head leaning on the window. <p><HTML>

Derek parked quickly as they all pilled out of the car.  &quot;Lets go, Peru, right?&quot;  They all nodded.  Jerron ran up to the machine.  He placed his palm on the reader, and spoke his code.  Mechanic lights beamed into life as a voice to monotone to be a human copy spoke, &quot;Hello Jerron.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Eight, Peru&quot;  Jerron was in no mood for leasure chit chat with the machine, although it had been programed for such.<br>
&quot;Yes sir, charging.....have a nice flight.&quot;  The glass doors slid open as the group walked onto the moving sidewalk.  Jerron leaned against the perfect walls, so sterile.  The human existance had become sterile, to unconfrontational and inhumane over the last century.  He didn't feel like talking....<br>

<br>
Well then. Jerron's decision kinda swept it all along, as they all piled into the ghostly white hall. Derek sensed a swing in his friend's mood, and put a hand to his shoulder. He thought he almost saw the faint outline of a smile... then realized he was still looking at the back of Jerron's head. He dropped back to where Mika and Nefer were whispering, uttering words of comfort to each other. The sincerity and severity of their ties to each other always amazed him. Derek broke the conversation, pulling a thread from his black cotton shirt. The touch, the feel... Ahem, &quot;Mika. You okay, sweet?&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled at him, and through the beaming friendship, he could still sense waves of tension ripping through her. After all, she was turning into a mythical, legendary... thing. {She's really got every right to be...}  ~SHE'S WWWWWWWEAK! Let her fall while you still can!~  {O_X;; Uh... you're still here?} &quot;Yea, I'm good. M'always fine, Der.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh, tough as nails, eh?&quot; ~...or an ironing board~ {<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SHUT THE FUKK UP!!!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> GODS, I think you need to be stabbed with a Q-tip or something!}<br>
<br>
With a softer smile, she said, &quot;Always.&quot; She and Nefer mini-flexed, and Derek chuckled a bit.<br>
<br>
They finally reached the seats, which were little more than compartments where one lounges behind a plastic box, two to a bug-bottle. Jerron tromped into one, and Derek figured he should strategize. After all, he remembered how he looked at Lor... Jash picked up a headset and accessed Derek's compartment. &quot;Yo dude. You got any clue where we're going when we get there?&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek stared blankly before responding... &quot;Uh... no...&quot; Then he smiled his classic, mischevious smile. &quot;But that's half the fun!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/02 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=217>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: peru?</span><hr size=1> OOC (Lets recap:  Octarine-Kali,Mika,Nefer,Jerron,Jash,Devin,Derek,and and and....Megrua's char, whats her name....well, I know her sign stands for money...The keeters are after us, Mika's turning into a Lamia, Life sucking cold monster thing, and somehow she can drain energy from Nefer without killing her(love?)  Lor is in the hospital, still hurt from the attack on Sarah, whom Derek saw in a vision is possibly in Peru and thats where were headin, riiiiiiight?!)<br>
Jerron sat alone.  He needed time to brood, as all did at times.  Lor is hurt, lor was hurt by this, this, BITCH.  He picked up his glass and mentally ordered a eight dollar glass of scotch.  A machine attached to the wall flew over and poured the liqour.  He took a sip before he threw the glass at the wall.  Glass shattered and the perfect white rug absorbed the amber drink.  He didn't care.  Within seconds a machine came by cleaning the mess.  How could this happen?  What did Lor do?  It was now that Jerron realized how little he knew about her.  He knew he loved her, he knew every little intricitacy about her thought patterns, but he doesn't know who she is.  &quot;Well, I'm going to.&quot;  Now on his feet, Jerron walked out of his bubble and into Derek's.  He didn't knock, didn't stop to acknowledge him, didn't even listen to what he said.  &quot;I'm going, you need me, call me.  Bye.&quot;  With that, he left.  His eyes were still closed, but the warmth he felt in his hand told him Lor was safe.  He was by her side, where he was meant to be, and where he will remain. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=218>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ( just for the record)</span><hr size=1> Something woke Derek from the mini-nap he's just fell into.

Derek lifted his head up, almost opening one eye fully. &quot;Uh... yea, yea,  what is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're only a few minutes away. You're the one who spurred us into this, so what's your plan?&quot;<br>

With a bit of readjusting his black shirt, he was fully awake now. &quot;Computer, conference between rooms A167, A168, A169, and A250.&quot;<br>

&quot;Okay, everyone, listen up. I saw something. I got a feeling some female with sadistic intentions is manipulating us.
