Let me sum up events from what other people (mostly belarious) have said:<br>
<br>
-Chanter camps ragefire for his twink, but falls asleep, dies, and the FG's respawn.<br>
-Someone in the zone notices ragefire up and that nobody in the zone is there to take him down.  He informs AV maybe because *gasp* they helped him and were nice to him in the past!!!<br>
-Somebody from AV enters the zone, sees FG's and ragefire up on tracking and nobody in the lair or at the FG's.  Furthermore, there are no guilds present with enough people to even begin clearing the FG's.   More AV enter and head directly for the FG's.  <br>
-Chanter wakes up and notices AV in the zone.  They are probably clearing the FG's while his own guild has maybe 3 people at the zone.<br>
-AV clears Naggy's lair, including Magi Rokyl, and probably has all of 5 minutes to notice Belarious's corpse there and that he's actually online before taking down Ragefire.  People were probably focused on ragefire, so looking for people to rez was not tops on the agenda at precisely that moment.<br>
-Belarious jumps into action and finds the man in charge: Rensak.  Rensak is AV's guild leader, and no he does not have any cleric twinks.  He then probably sends Rensak a tell something like &quot;What the @#$! are you doing in here?  That is MY ragefire spawn!&quot;  I doubt it was a polite tell.  <br>
-So at this point, Rensak has a force ready to take out Ragefire in Naggy's lair.  He's getting tells from someone at the zone who hasn't been near the FG's or Ragefire since anyone in AV entered the zone and has almost no guildmates in the zone on /who.  Those tells are probably rude.   What would you have done in his shoes?<br>
<br>
1. Apologize to Belarious?  &quot;I didn't know you had called this spawn.  I am so sorry.  This corpse of yours where Rokyl was 5 minutes ago is obviously a territory marker.  We will leave now so you can @#%$ around for 6 hours trying to get enough people here to take him.  Look, we even cleared the FG's for you!<br>
2. Ignore the rude person at the zone with no guild support for his twink loot-monger.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but you are being entirely unreasonable Belarious.  Your claim on that ragefire camp ammounted to &quot;Gee, I was there a couple hours ago, but then I fell asleep and all my friends left!&quot;  That wouldn't cut it for any other camp in this game and certainly not for Ragefire!  This is not a case of a more powerful guild walking over a smaller on on the way to ragefire.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>           <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>             You weren't even there!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Then you have the unmitigated temerity to call AV selfish loot whores when you yourself wanted that epic for your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>              twink</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and belong to a guild that has walked over others in the past under far more clear-cut circumstances.  Furthermore, you make *totally* unsupportable claims that we never help anyone.  That's a slap in the face for just about everyone in AV.  Nobody ever makes a fuss when we help them.  When BS like this crops up how do you think it makes us feel about helping people?<br>
<br>
And if that wasn't enough, you then claim that you were invited into AV and turned us down like you were better than us.  There is no way in hades that you would get an invite before showing up to our raids for at least a month on a regular basis.  Our recruiting process is a long one, designed to make sure that *everyone* in the guild gets a chance to know a person before they are invited.  We want friends, not people who turn into arses after 1 week.  Yes, a couple months ago we were tight for enchanters and before /targetgroupbuff and Koadic's came out I did have a rough time as a solo chanter on 50 person raids many nights.  I know I was a bit frazzled and it was showing.  People in my guild are a caring lot, and were probably sending out feelers to any chanters they knew to find out if they were interested in coming to raids as guests and seeing if they fit in just to give me a little help and keep me sane.  Now we have a much improved chanter roster and tools that make buffing easier.  If you thought you had been invited to come on a raid with us as a guest before, that invitation has definately been revoked.  <br>
<br>
Then of course we have all the unorigional, sexually frustrated, &quot;Uber's SUCK!!!&quot; bandwagon people blasting AV without a shred of evidence or reason.  Normally I try not to respond to flame-bait like this, but anyone backing up Belarious is just plain blind.  Did you guys even read his post?  Ye gods!  Put down the crack-pipe and take a whiff of reality.  For those of you who have dedicated hours to denigrating and tearing down what others have built, ask yourself if it really does make you a better or happier person by sh*ting on others.<br>
