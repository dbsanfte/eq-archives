The only person that had anything done to him was Bringeer (Maulin) due to ninja looting the head.  The only reason we didn't get awarded the head was due to the GM suddenly not being able to find all of our /reports.  <br>
<br>
As Jukik posted, when we jumped in it was all TD casters left and scrambling.  They were running back into where we were sitting, waiting, and tried to camp.  We jumped in finally when people that were not aggro and had relogged (some twice) were getting summoned to him and beat on.  The handful of people left alive should really be thanking us for saving them a rez.<br>
<br>
Just want to know when we trained you?  Was it during the time we were sitting back by the waterfall clearing your train?  Or mayhaps you're talking about the train TD created before the Dain was pulled down in the pit?<br>
<br>
P.S. Thanks for the faction with the 15+ guards that were jumping down the well. <p><FONT FACE="papyrus"> <a href="http://65.10.164.51/Scharn/Everquest/profiles/balandrus.html">Balandrus Sylentdeth</a> </Font>

We even have a /report that we pulled Dain that the GM examined.<br>
<br>
To put it as simply as possible:<br>
<br>
LoD attacked our pull of Dain with Dain at 40% health.  If anyone has every killed Dain they know it takes a while and with at time lots of losses.<br>
<br>
Basically, if they wanted to KS Dain when he was 60% dead and our pull with our members still alive and claim we ninja looted it, then so be it.  You can conclude the rest on your own.<br>
<br>
We were not all over the mob trying to ninja.  This is a blatant exaggeration.  The mob was locked by us and we kept it locked while we waited for the GM to arrive.  At the time it was locked there were 2 shields and the head.  The head is what is used in the quest for the Belt of Dwarf Slaying.<br>
<br>
The worry was that the mob would rot before the items were looted, which happened for the most part.  Why the head was looted is unknown to me, but it was subsequently destroyed by the GM.<br>
<br>
As for Ugle's comments.  The amount of conjecture there is pretty excessive.  GMs will not transfer items and would rather destroy the disputed items then deal with a bunch of fall out with all the bitching if things were awarded on a disputed kill of this nature.<br>
<br>
TD has killed Dain many times.  Several of our people have the belt, the crown, the hammers, and other items.  If you question this you can just examine them.  /tell me in game and I'll tell you who you should look at when you get the chance.<br>
<br>
When you see that we have these items you'll know that we are more then capable of killing Dain.<br>
<br>
When I arrived I noted the number of our people vs the number of LoD people.  We had around 22-25 people and they had 17.<br>
<br>
As I moved to the well I was behind several LoD members.  I watched them drop down the well.  I jumped down following them and was not agro'd by any mob as I was invis. The mobs were following their members out of the water and down the hall.  I watched them move right into the crowd of people that were getting rezes within my guild.  We had several members there already FD.  This was clearly a train by LoD.<br>
<br>
When the pulls began, our puller, Terias was calling them &quot;inc&quot; as he normally does.  We watched each one come and watched LoD attempt to kill them while we did.  We grouped up and got most of the experiece kills with multiple rogues, monks, and rangers grouped together.  When the time for Dain came, Terias did a /report just after his pull, and he called it in /gu that Dain was inc.<br>
<br>
Because all of the LoD people were there right in our area I immediately saw several key people go LD.  Sitting and roaming before a fight there's alot of lag but when the fights start the lag gets so bad people go LD.<br>
<br>
As the fight was progressing we noticed there were many frosticubes and skeletons around killing our casters.  The area previously had been cleared -- couldn't have been any other way due to there being almost 100 people in that small spot.  Since this was the case those mobs had to come from somewhere and we were focused enough to not be doing it ourselves.<br>
<br>
So, with the lag, the extra LoD people, and the adds from a train from them, we survived, doing what we do best (killling our target and fast).  At roughly 40% LoD members rushed our kill when we had clearly 25+ people still in the zone when I noticed LoD attacking it.  We could have had many that due to some being rez'd in during the fight.<br>
<br>
Arsenic yelled, near the start of our fight, some off hand comment about tactics and I noted then that her people had backed off.<br>
<br>
With situations similar to this TD never rushes a partially dead mob.  Our long standing guild policy is that we will wait for the other guild to die, then wait for the mob to go back and regen to full health, and only then will we go into and attack it.<br>
<br>
If any of you believe it is fun to rush in to a 40% dead mob while another guild is actively fighting it, and KS when the guild fighting it had 25+ people still engaged then I feel sorry for you.<br>
<br>
And, this Valsu person is a 57 Cleric of Clan Impact.<br>
<br>
If you have never fought the likes of Dain you probably don't have much room to talk when it comes to tactics or policy.<br>
<br>
And finally, our first kill of Dain was done with 37 people. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umetaphisto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Metaphisto</A> at: 11/10/01 6:22:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzerk1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zerk1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#778899>(11/10/01 6:15:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /clap TD</span><hr size=1> Yes, you did pull him, but technically, when he ported down to the pit he killed sania and attacked yurie first so gee I guess first aggro means it was ours huh?!? Most of us camped to clear aggro after being told not to attack right when he was pulled so Dain wouldnt aggro on us after you died.  When Dain was at 40% he was fighting a cube and was summoning all your casters while smacking some of our members since we are kos to him.  Not like we are gonna let Dain kill our whole force/res/re-buff cause you guys suck at the game of EverQUest, afterall, you guys had your shot.  You pulled, you died, we didnt interfere.  Hell, you wouldn't have even got Dain to 40% with the 10 or so guards we killed at the waterfall that were headed towards you guys fighting Dain.  You would have had Dain 10+ guards owning you guys.  Hope a 425 dain spawns next week.<br>

 can't tank dain fully buffed, they're not going to do very well unbuffed with res effects and 30% life.<br>
<br>
If we had wanted to KS you, we wouldn't have moved away after the dain dropped down.<br>
<br>
as for knowing about fighting dain, i've faught dain more times than you've seen him. and a 325 dain is nothing to have massive losses to, and he only takes about 4-6 minutes. but I guess if your damage is coming from a cube and whatever a resed in mele can do before they die, it would take awhile longer. <p><a href=http://65.10.164.51/scharn/everquest/profiles/iila.html>Iila the Wanderer 60 druid</a><BR>

<br>
during the entire incident, i was getting updates thru irc.  <br>
<br>
the beginning of the nite's festivities began when TD's monk jymm, trained and killed the LoD waiting in the pit.  this is the incident you refer to LoD managing to wipe out.  as we're used to being hounded by gimps, jymm was never petitioned.  as our officers tried to reason with TD's representative, Dain was pulled by TD, thus making a peaceful resolution of the situation a moot point.<br>
<br>
first in force implies that the force you have assembled can kill the dain.  45 TD apparently is not force enough to kill the 350 dain as evidenced by the screenshots posted by friend zerk.  personally i doubt 60 TD is force enough for Dain v2.0, but TD was given their shot at the dain.  at no point did LoD aggro and train the guards as our puller, arsenic, had not aggrod the dain.  stomach the hard truth that u managed to train urself with 4 guard adds.  as for ks'ing the dain, the LoD in the well camped out not once, but twice to remove aggro and allow TD their fair shot, however, when TD all but died to the dain, our ppl were being summoned by the dain.  at this pont, we had no choice but to dispatch the pesky dorf.<br>
<br>
now TD claims they had a fair shot at the dain with it at 40%, no melee and 1 frosticube.  unfortunately, in the game called everquest, that's called a wipeout, game over, you lose.<br>
<br>
in the end run, the proof is in the pudding, TD's true character showed when one of ur members ninja looted the head while the gm's were trying to sort out the mess. <p>Sandoval <BR>

TD members pulled Dain.  We aren't debating that.  The LoD members there attacked our Dain while he was at 40% health.  We aren't debating that.  LoD killed Dain while we were fighting him.

<br>
fact of the matter is, your guild decided to pull the dain before we could straighten out the matter, then ninja looted it after your guild died on your futile attempt to kill it.  try to spin that all you want, but imo your'e in the wrong guild.  there's more bringeer's in TD than duran's and your association with them just sullies your own reputation.  you can rationalize all the poaching, ninja looting and training you want, but when it comes down to it, TD hasn't shown an ounce of respect to the rest of the server.  LoD is more amused than hurt/angry by what you did last nite, but i doubt that's the feeling that other guild's feel about TD. <p>Sandoval <BR>

Letting a Dain head on a corpse just for entertainment? Obviously, you suck enough to ignore that it's no drop... Yeah no drop... Of course, I suppose you think you can multiquest it right?<br>

Dear Paly, I remember a time not so far ago when you sweared TD was soo evil that you were running on every Innoruuk's guild board to try and get a guild after TD... What a nice turnback... <p>Kelval Mafate <BR> Legions of Darkness</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukelval.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelval</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/10/01 9:25:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubuliwyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Buliwyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#778899>(11/10/01 9:44:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~awata/cast/images/duckno1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /clap TD</span><hr size=1> hahaha, wow<br>
