<br>
I know that there will be many people who don't know who I am, so a little bit about myself first.  I went travelling around the world for 3 months recently, so I left EQ behind for that time and traded it for some of the most amazing experiences ever.  I highly recommend that everyone try what I've done - there's nothing more exciting and freeing than packing your job in and just setting off around the world, with nothing but a sack on your back and so much around every corner, just waiting to greet you...<br>
<br>
While I've been away, I've checked up on the boards every so often, and so have been in touch with what has come to pass since I left - I am aware of the recent issues concerning the planes and the summit.  I know this is a tired and completely unpleasant issue and I'm certain I speak for the majority of the server population when I say, let's just get this over and done with, sorted out, and put conflict away, because it's just not worth it.  (Actually, I'm pretty bad in that way.  If I'm right about something and it upsets someone when I argue a case, I'll feel pretty damn guilty about it and might even start agreeing with the other just to avoid any unpleasantness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Especially in the light of what has happened in RL across the world - stuff like this really pales in comparison.  <br>
<br>
I pride myself on the way I am, both in RL and in game, towards the fellow members of my community.  If anyone has had any gripes with me ever (although in my memory, honestly, I don't think I have ever come into any conflict with anyone - please step forward if this is untrue! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  After all, I value the fact that although this game is geared to getting your levels and reaching the higher echelons of the game, some of my best memories have resulted from interactions with the other people who share this world with me, and helping others whenever I can.  I wouldn't trade any of that for any item the game could give me, because the pleasure derived from both of those things are totally different, and incomparable in my personal opinion.  I guess I see things rather differently now that I've been away and have had so much time to dwell on the many issues of life and such (but we won't go into that here...)<br>
<br>
NK are full of decent people, and this I know from my experiences in the guild.  KSing and running over guilds have never taken place in the entirety of my time here.  Of course, in the light of recent events, with the guild's decision to abandon the summit and go our own course, this is most decidedly not the general opinion of the people as a whole - and that I can understand.  There are two sides to every story though, and it could have been easier to not state openly that this is what they were intending and that the Summit was something that has lost the benefits it meant to provide in the first place.  About PoF/PoH - i'm sure many of you will say that NK have run over others etc, but if a guild were there already in the plane they would never do that.  They have been in the planes against the Summit, but they have not been furtive about it.<br>
<br>
I have told my guild on our boards that I will not partake on any further PoF/PoH runs that they have planned.  Not because I disagree with what they're doing necessarily, but because of the nature of who I am, as explained earlier.  Which leads me to my most important point:  this needs to be sorted out right now, without any further ado.  If there is to be a Summit, it must be decided without any further loss of time, to avoid more conflicts, unhappiness, and all that kind of stuff which I just hate to see.  If this is resolved, then we can just go ahead with everything and put this behind us.<br>
<br>
If the planes go FFA, then the advantages are that big guilds will get out of other people's hair more quickly than people might think.  It is true that epic parts that drop from the planes are the big problems as of now, but there are many solutions whereby other people from other guilds can join up in any raids if they tell the leader and are honest with what they need.  If they are looking for planar armour, they will get all they want; if they want epic parts, it is less likely, but still likely, that the guild will have all of a certain epic part and are just there for one or two specific ones, so they might be able to snap those up as well.<br>
<br>
The argument for the Summit is that it gives everyone an equal chance, and this is a good thing.  But going back to the point of people getting out of each other's hair, how many guilds would leave the epic mobs up on their raid in any case, when they could be downed and respawned every time, so that more parts have the chance of dropping?  Or if another guild came in to dispatch of those with others' consent, as seemed to be the case several times a few months ago (and the cause of much board discussion as well), how is that any different?  The guild who helped the raiding guild in order to get certain parts has essentially poached those mobs from the people going the next day.<br>
<br>
If an agreement is reached concerning a new Summit, then I will abide by it - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> without a shadow of doubt</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - assuming it is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> full</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> agreement.  I think that this server should go FFA for a while though and just see what happens in the planar zones, because then everyone can come and go at will.  Guilds, friends, everyone can band together and zone in with specific goals without having to worry, just like it is in other zones - as long as they are not taking what anyone who is already there is gunning for.  If that happens then people will realise that NK's reputation as good people was ruined in others' eyes simply because of their forthright decision to treat the planes as FFA, and to state this clearly rather than do it secretly anyway.  It might not be the best solution, but you never know until you try.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to reply to this thread for a while, because this is something that has been troubling me for some time - I really needed to get it off my chest and I want to know what people think (for hopefully the last time).  If it has sounded callous and rude, then please understand that it was never meant to be anything of the sort.  I can see things from both sides of the wall, for I have always followed the summit before, and as such have tried to put things down objectively, to a certain extent.  If it is incoherent and babbly, then please forgive me, it isn't easy to find the words to express how difficult I feel, emotionally, about all this.  I think FFA is the way to go, for the present, so I'm writing this in the hope that people will see this honest, personal and heartfelt ramble and realise that I'm not fanning flames, or advocating &quot;uncouth&quot; behaviour, but rather in the hope that something can be worked out, or at least agreed to.<br>
<br>
I've spent a while writing this, and I still don't think I've put down everything that I've wanted to say.  I like my guild, I hate upsetting people because it makes me feel absolutely downright awful.  So please, let's just agree to something right now.  I will not be going to PoH or PoF ever again, until this is resolved.<br>
<br>
Yours,<br>

The Summit issue has been building for quite a while.  The arguments and discussions have gone on too long.  I for one think that the breakdown of the summit is mostly due to the age of EQ.  The game has been out for over 2 years.  The number of high level (46+) people in the game is at a very large number, and is ever increasing.  In the days when very few were planes capable, it was easy to use a planes schedule; the number of planes capable guilds and people was much much smaller.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wish that we were still at the point that the Summit was going to be effective.  People were nicer to each other back then.  But the dynamics of the game have changed.  It's not any one person or any one guilds fault.  It's the make-up of the game.  Nothing in the enforceable rules of the game say a guild can't enter the Planes when another guild is there.<br>
<br>
We need to at least be respectful to each other.  If a guild is on the plane, and another enters, they need to at least not try and camp the same area, or train mobs on each other.  Think of how most non-planes areas operate;  if you get to an area with a sufficient force to hold it, it is yours until you can no longer do so, or choose to move on.   If we as a community choose to continue a schedule, we at least need to build in a few FIF days each week.  We can't all be naive enough to think that we need to be either completely FFA/FIF or completely scheduled.  Somewhere inbetween lies the solution.<br>
<br>
But no matter what, let's at least try to be a little (just a tiny bit) nicer, or at least respectful to each other. Let's have more fun! <p>Gladewalker Surefall<BR>

<br>
I am sorry but going in the planes when others have it posted on Inny Cal. is running over another guild. Just because the guild chose not to go there the first minute that they had it reserved does not give NK the right to be the judges of the server and call planes FFA and go in there. Some people change RL plans or take off from work or whatever so they can play and get away from RL crap, to only log on to find a bunch of morons over running everything as they whack off to the items that they just got. <br>
<br>
Being in a guild means you do support there activity, if you do not agree with what they are doing then why stay in there. Saying that you will not go into a zone after you got all the items you need does not make things ok for over running and destroying the fun for others. <br>
<br>
I am sure that many will flame me BUT I am not the kind to over run KS and go in zones unscheduled, then come on boards and say &quot;Can't we all just get along&quot;. I have more honor for the people who follow rules rather then break them and ask for forgiveness later after they got what they want. <br>
<br>
As far as i am concerned to make things right NK and Neo and the other little guilds that think they are all mighty should go back and find out all the fun that you Fu**ed up for others and help them get the items that they are suppose to have.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ufalcorr9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falcorr9</A> at: 9/26/01 5:07:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#778899>(9/26/01 5:21:35 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thetwelveofnever.junglelink.co.uk/graphics/fethead1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Long and heartfelt post:  please all read.</span><hr size=1> Uvavu, im sorry to go off on a different topic here, but I really have to this to you, and I think I know you will understand where im coming from.<br>
