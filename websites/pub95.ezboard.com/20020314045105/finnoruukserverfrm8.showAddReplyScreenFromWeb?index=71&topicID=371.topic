Person2:  You're absolutely right.  You are the embodiment of perfection.  We are all but dirt in your glorious presence!<br>
Person3: Actually, here's what I think.  Maybe it would be better if...<br>
<br>
<br>
Person1 is an insecure troll.  Person2 is being a sycophant.  Person3 is being a friend.  <br>
<br>
Aliya, I know you're trying to be person3 for Gamiene.  Give it up.  She doesn't come here for friends or even sycophants.  Some people thrive on and even get off on hatred.  You have to recognize these people and take a step back.  <br>
<br>
If you saw someone in real life acting like this you would figure they just need someone to be nice to them.  You would be there for them, no matter how mean and nasty they were.  That's the kind of person you are.   However, you have to recognize the unique properties of this medium.  A person that is a complete hate @#%$ here may be very nice in real life and have a dozen friends just like you.  For some reason, the darker side of human nature perhaps, they come here and want for nothing but angst and dissent.  The people who are the kindest to them are the ones they single out first for an endless stream of vituperation.  <br>
<br>
It is inconceivably difficult to change a person.  Knowing a person in real life you can only achieve the smallest changes over a long period of time through close personal contact.  It is immeasureably harder to change someone with a couple paragraphs of text on a message board.  They don't know you or respect you as a human being.  Your humanity itself is all but washed away when it's poured into abstract symbols, digitized, and transmitted across the harsh coldness of cyberspace.  <br>
<br>
Gamiene is not going to change no matter what you, myself, or anyone else here posts to these boards.  *This* is precisely the kind of thread that gives her what she craves.  Frankly, I don't give a rats ass about her.  She is going to pull this post apart and respond with anger and derision to everything I say.  Unlike her, this will not cause me pleasure.  I am posting because I see a genuinely kind person baring her heart to someone who will strike back with anger every time.  You are not human to her.  You are a digital plaything.  Recognize this, and spare yourself.   <p><TABLE><TR><TD><p><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/testuart/Corvansig.jpg" width="200" height="280" usemap="#CorvanMap" border="0"><map name="CorvanMap"><area shape="rect" coords="135,134,181,158" href="http://www.ashenvendetta.com" target="_blank"><area shape="rect" coords="128,165,187,182" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31367" target="_blank"></map></p></TD><TD><p><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/testuart/cordathsig.jpg" width="200" height="280" usemap="#CordathMap" border="0"><map name="CordathMap"><area shape="rect" coords="135,134,181,158" href="http://www.ashenvendetta.com" target="_blank"><area shape="rect" coords="128,165,187,182" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=42338" target="_blank"></map></p></TD></TR></TABLE>

But when a friend of mine or someone more than a friend expresses that they are tired of you popping up everywhere they go, then yes that is a problem.  The reality is this, my problems started with you a long time ago when I was a part of the seventh sigil.  Your condesending attitude was more that enough for me to form an opinion of you.  <br>
<br>
Here is the reality &quot;sweets&quot;, my opinion of you stands.  Your view on things I find totally funny, since you want people to see things your way or you determine that they are automatically wrong.  In a sense, your way or the highway, aye.  Sorry things don't work that way.  Not once have I ever seen you admit that you were wrong on anything.  <br>
<br>
I have not spoken to you in game since your return and I have no desire to speak to you.  So telling me that I tried to start sillies with you is an out right lie on your behalf.  Interesting isnt it.  You have to lie to get a point that you dont even have across.  <br>
<br>
That being said, I grow weary of your endless ramblings and falsehoods.  Be sure to have your facts straight before saying something you know to be untrue.  I find it amusing that you have alienated so many people you cant even remember who they are.  -chuckle- as you would say. <br>

Problem is, you're doing the very thing you claim I am. Does this make you an insecure troll?<br>
<br>
I posted this thread to express what I see, and to hear the perspectives of others. You know... thoughtful discussion of where the disconnect is... it can't be 'all me' any more than it can be 'all you'. Or is that something you have trouble admitting? <br>
<br>
Do you really think if I only were here to stir up hate that I would go through the effort of initiating a discussion that I know is going to be fraught with posts like yours? <br>
<br>
I write for a living. I make damn good money at it and am published in a variety of outlets. When someone out here says they take something I've posted in a manner I did not intend it, the one thing I *do* know is it can't be due to how its written. Does that sound arrogant? It isn't, it is seventeen years of professional success speaking. <br>
<br>
So there must be some 'third thing' in play that causes it. I think that 'third thing' is assumption based upon lack of personal knowledge. So far, there's no real rebuttal to that assertion, especially not in posts like yours.<br>
<br>
With the exception of three people (all of whom have been complimentary, by the way), no one posting in this thread knows me in person. They know only what they hear, or what they *feel* as a result of reading my posts here. What they hear is the greater portion of the problem, I think. What they read (mis-read) here isn't as much an issue, since only a slight subset of people who play on Innoruuk read here regularly. <br>
<br>
Maybe if I move to 6.6 on the Flesch-Kincaid scale, things will improve? Doubtful. As so many as are delighted to tell me, they're quite happy with the conclusion they've reached and have no real interest in changing it. And, as I have said, I'm not looking for change so much as understanding where the disconnect is... this is helpful despite people like you who seemingly want to see it de-railed.<br>

<br>
You ask why people don't like you and compare them to a bunch of Monkeys.  When people give you their reasoning, you (at least in your posts) don't give weight or substance to their reasons, you just pick out what flaws exist according to you.  When people tell you how your words come across to them, you immediately turn it around and say it's the reader's fault for misinterpreting you.  You talk about how unfair it is for people to hang on to stereotypes and misconceptions of you, and then you reinforce those stereotypes and misconceptions.<br>
<br>
I will tell you in my opinion one of the things you suck at in your writing, and if you're a professional you can separate the criticism of your work from a personal attack on you, which this isn't (yet) meant to be.  You are extremely ineffective at communicating effectively with your target audience on these boards.  Maybe you are great for your typical target reader in your RL profession.  But with the mentality and personality of the majority of the readers on this board (judging this based on responses over what, a couple years?), you don't communicate effectively, if that was ever your goal.  Let me try to expound on my idea.<br>
<br>
If you tell a joke about Fallopian Tubes at a Gynecologists convention, some people there might say that you were a pretty funny person.  If you tell the same joke at a Carpenters convention, the people there would be wondering where the hell you came from, and a reminder to catch the name so you didn't appear next year.  Is it the Carpenters fault for not understanding your joke, or is it your fault for telling a joke that they didn't understand?  <br>
<br>
In the military in a Combat unit, a motivational speech might be something along the lines of &quot;We're gonna kick the @#%$ out of those little commie @#%$ bags, rip their throats out, and drink their blood&quot;.  Try doing that as the CEO of a large corporation talking about competition with a Chinese company to the board of Directors and see how long you get to keep your job.  Is it the rest of the board that just isn't motivated enough to compete the way you want to, or did you not express yourself appropriately?<br>
<br>
Being someone of Polish descent, I am used to receiving (and telling) lots of Polish jokes.  A friend and co-worker of mine once told me after I had made one of my jokes that if I wasn't Polish and a friend of his he would have kicked my butt for making fun of him (he's an immigrant from Poland and has ties that I don't).  Is it that he doesn't have a sense of humor, or is it my fault for telling a joke that offends him personally?<br>
<br>
If you are a professional writer and know how to effectively communicate, then I only see one answer to your question about whether or not your entire reason for this thread is to stir up hate.  Yes.  I would assume that someone with your skills would be able to post on a Topic without p.issing the majority of the readers off.  If I am to believe that you are capable of communicating effectively, then I would also have to believe that your choice of words and writing style were chosen specifically to elicit these types of responses.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usteffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 8:59:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=76>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Figure this will...</span><hr size=1> Gamiene, you ever make it to HoT?

And yup, I had the unmitigated gall to look at Tunare's loot. What with her being my diety and all, I wanted to see what was under that green dress. So I did. Just like I have many other times, on many other kills. <br>
<br>
Could I have waited to read about it? Sure. Did I want to? No. Did I take anything? No. Did I harm anyone by looking? No. Well, unless you count the people who fell into fits over it. <br>

I understand the perspective of the folks who killed her. I apologized for the roleplaying that obviously upset them. I'm not going to apologize for something that hurt no one. <br>

Maybe its not because you use proper English and know how to use a comma, but the way you write <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what is being debated here by everyone but you.<br>
Some examples.  When you insert -chuckle- I find that insulting even when not directed at me.  When you place blame on us like the &quot;third thing&quot; above I find that insulting, you don't know anything about our personal knowledge.  When you deny what we believe because it doesn't mesh with what you write or &quot;meant&quot; I find that insulting.  In general I don't like the way you &quot;debate&quot;.  You do exactly what you claim others do to you which is insult and belittle anyone who has a different point of view.  Granted some people get pretty nasty with you and I can't say I blame you for responding in kind, it just serves little purpose.  If you insult me I might respond like I do here but what is the point of me calling you names?  Have I convinced you using reasonable logic?  I doubt it, but you will at least think about it without worrying about responding with more rhetoric or at least that is my hope.<br>

<br>
Myth, Legolamb is just upset because I ignore him. <br>
<br>
Berly, most of the people who post about me here have never met me in the game. So the notion they're responding to my actions there is somewhat specious. <br>
<br>
Ugle, ROFLMAO!  <br>
<br>
Ravanta, so would I. The difference being your situation occurs in real life, where such things are unacceptable. Show me the Verant rule that says you can't look at a corpse. Then make this same rant at the newbies looting the yard trash all around Norrath. Problem with your argument is that it presumes all the real life rules apply here. They don't. <br>
<br>
Solonaro, let's not be obtuse. People go out of their way to be offended by what I write. They twist it, they use gossip they've heard to determine the right or wrong of it, and they generally work pretty hard to misunderstand it. Not quite sure how many times one must say, 'Read what I fooking write, not what you think, feel, or heard.' before someone is going to understand it. <br>
<br>
Laldiyen, -chuckle- is a literal thing. So is -smile-, -giggle-, etc. They're called stage directions and they are intended to indicate literal actions happening here, as I type. If you read them as humor and not sarcasm or derision, the meaning changes. That's kind of my point in all this. I don't choose how you interpret something. Your assumption of intent (sarcasm, derision, etc.) results in your being offended. Why do you choose to take it as sarcasm, derision, etc.? Is there some reason that is preferred?  <br>
<br>
When I tell you that you've misunderstood, it isn't me saying you're stupid. That's your assumption of my intent at work. When I tell you that you've misunderstood, Its me saying you misunderstood me, period. <br>
<br>
Writing is a very precise thing... and words mean exactly what they mean. If you take more or less from a post it is your decision to do so. That doesn't mean that was the intent of the post. That I have to explain this to you or anyone is just sad. (side note to Ugle: Sure, I could pad my writing with apologies, with 'gee, I hope you don't get mad', and other grovelings... but why bother? People willing to work this hard to twist it aren't going to pay attention to that kind of thing.)<br>

Because your -chuckles- are often used  as tags at the end of a derisive message thats why.  <br>
There is no reason why my feelings are preferred it is simply a feeling.  Are you telling me feelings can be controlled?  If so, are you telling me how I should feel?  I have no personal animosity towards you I am simply answering some of the questions you asked and my interpretation seems to be in the majority isn't that something to think about?  <br>
Communication with a subjective language is never black and white as you seem to be purporting.  There are always as many ways to interpret the meaning as there are people to get the message.  What that means is that writing is not a very precise thing.  If writing was so precise we wouldn't have book clubs or critics and we for sure wouldn't be having this conversation.  So in other words if I say something that does not seem to get my message across I need to restate it in such a way as to help the listener understand.  It is not the listeners responsibility to grasp what I mean intuitively.  <br>
Well do what you want but as long as you place the responsibility on the listener and not on the story teller you are only stroking yourself.&lt;----opinion of the writer only not intended as an insult.<br>

It's unnacceptable on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Ask any guild that kills something if you can look at the corpse.  They will offer you a TL out of the zone, if not worse.<br>
<br>
Like most people, I've gone on lots of raids where boss mobs are killed.  I've been a guest with a couple guilds raiding big mobs on a regular basis.  Even though I knew lots of people there, and was invited to the raid, would anyone catch me 'peeking' at a guild event level corpse?  The only exception to this would be if I was looting for the group of course.  <br>
<br>
Hell no.<br>
<br>
When 20+ get together to kill something, the last thing they want to see is someone checking there corpse who had absolutely NOTHING to do with killing it.  It's the same theory with me and my wallet at the grocery store.  The guy in line behind me did not work for that money, and has no right to look to see how much is there.<br>
