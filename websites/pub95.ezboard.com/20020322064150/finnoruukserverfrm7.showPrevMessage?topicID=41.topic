The removal was either due to the content below or embarrassment of the attacks that it brought on this ranger in his five miserable days with the Norrathian Knights.  Those original attacks have since been permanently removed by the guild forums.  Since the attacks on the public forum continued and this story is now being wildly misrepresented, I post it again here for your enjoyment and bewilderment where it can't be misrepresented or deleted.<br>
<br>
Again, this story attacks no one.  Never did and still doesn't.  It does pose a question about what one should do with tradeable, class specific quest armor.  Should we:<br>
<br>
A - Destroy it<br>
B - Pass it on to a guildy that has not quested for it<br>
C - Sell it to a stranger that has not quested for it<br>
D - Let it collect dust<br>
E - Other option I haven't thought of<br>
<br>
For those of you who may repeat the attacks of the past, please show restraint and remember that your responses cannot be removed so easily here if what you say brings embarrassment upon you or your guild.<br>
<br>
To set the context, this was my first post in my new guild (Norrathian Knights) and, except for posting an email address upon my departure a few days later, my last.  The response was so harsh that it is the primary reason I left the guild and will no longer associate with anyone who wears the moniker Norrathian Knights.<br>

Enjoy.<br>

DEEORN ARRIVES AND IVY LEAVES<br>
<br>
Deeorn sits cross-legged on the floor of his small room in the Outpost, carefully cleaning his ivy etched tunic.  Something is different this day.  First, it's moving day as Deorn settles in.  The mattress provided by Captain Zandrame is now rolled up in the corner, a makeshift hat rack apparently, as his wooden helm rests atop the pile, his well used blades leaning against the side.  On his bunk is a well worn wicker pad.  The shutters are open to air out the once vacant domicile.  But there is something not quite the same about Deeorn himself.  Though his wrists and legs are bare as he cleans his ivy etched armor, he still wears a course woven vest apparantly made from supple tree roots, vines, and other organic materials.  The look of sentiment on his face is clear for any to see as he carefully continues his task of cleaning his beloved ivy tunic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, hello there.  As you see, I am already moved in and cozzy.  Quite a change for me, too.  I don't know if I can sleep well without the stars shining over my head at night or the rain softly pattering on my slicker.  Ahh, but I shall give it a try.&quot; <br>
<br>
Though the tunic Deeorn cleans is a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, your eyes are drawn to his vest.  What power was required to create a weave so tight?  What weapon could penetrate it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, you noticed my Treeweave.  I have fought my last foe in my ivy tunic, for this vest is truly superior.  Yes, it is a tight weave, as it should be.  Only the forest giants of the Burning Woods of Kunark have the art to make such vests.  I suppose their great strength is required to create such a tight weave.  It almost seems like a second skin.&quot;<br>
<br>
A second skin? Another look at this mass of intertwined roots and vines reveals a startling discovery.  The vest actually binds with Deeorn's own skin. Even more surprising, it has burrowed into his skin like an Endless Swamp leech burrows into its victims to drain them of all fluids before the sleep of death overcomes them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, don't be alarmed.  The vest binds with my own tendons and muscles to increase my strength.  I'm fine.  Marvelous isn't it.  No sooner had Spodo dropped me off in the Great Divide after our adventures with Jorealian, Dramaque, and the rest of the crew hunting the corrupted beasts of the Emerald Jungle, but I received a message through the bards.  A dear friend found a brave adventurer recently arrived to Freeport from the Burning Woods with a Tree Weave for sale.  I gathered my hard earned platinum and began the long, cold run across the eastern wastes of Velious when Sir Athel offered to lift me in the winds in the way only druids can do and deposit me safely in the Commons.  Off I ran, aided by the wolf spirit dwelling within me.  Soon, I was much lighter, my backpack containing my faithful ivy etched tunic instead of a load of platinum.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deeorn turns back to the task of cleaning his ivy etched tunic.  He carefully removes rough, mangy fur and fragments of bone, or claws perhaps, from the tight links of the armor.  A rare sight indeed sits before you.  A devoted ranger is caring for his ivy etched tunic for the final time.  Never again will it fall lightly from his shoulders in the heat of fierce battle.  The next time Deeorn turns his back on melee to dive to the rescue of Latata Obaybee, SheWoman of Halas, the supple ivy tunic will not cover his back.  When his weapons are next thrust between  Lady Wanini of Felwithe and an enemy, his exposed ribs will be protected by a mass of wood and fiber bound into his own flesh.  The ivy's day is over.  Are these the thoughts in Deeorn's mind as well as he begins to carefully cleanse the the arms of the tunic, removing vile-looking briars left by some fierce jungle plant beast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I will miss my ivy.  It has served my well since my days of fighting gnolls on the plains of Karana.  But don't dispair.  It is not just another tunic, but it is a tunic.  With this Tree Weave, I can better serve the people of Norrath and protect my companion Knights.  I have had my ivy tunic for longer than most rangers, for I did not quest for it as many do.  You see, I am a simple woodland trader at heart and I use my skills as a trader as well as my knowledge of the outdoors and, of course, my combat prowess.  Take a look here on my neck and here on behind my ear.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Deeorn pulls the Tree Weave away from his chest and raises his chin, the fibers smoothly separates from his body.  A horrid scar as one might imagine from the thrust of the Messenger of the Queen into its victim at the point of death is clearly visible.  At first glance, the Tree Weave has taken a terrible toll on Deeorn.  Once the shock of the wound passes, it is clear that this is an old, though terrible, scar.  As Deeorn replaces the weave, he indicates a slightly flat spot, one of several, on the side of his slick bald head.  A strangely tranquil expression passes over his face as old memories of battle come forward from the recesses of this ranger's past.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis true.  I did not quest for my ivy nor do I regret this decision.  These are the wounds of my own quest for ivy etched armor.  Though not earned taking down Meldrath of Steamfont or that brownie squirt in the dark reaches of Faydark, their impact was the same.  You see, from my childhood, I have yearned for the feel of ivy etched armor on my skin.  I would see the rangers in their Surefall Glade guild and dream of roaming the vast reaches of Norrath in that signature armor that only rangers can don properly.  Early in life, I discovered that I had inherited the trader's touch from my father, so I live the life of both ranger and trader.  Upon my true naming, I selected the moniker &quot;Deeorn Merchantson&quot; so that all might know of my calling.  But I digress.<br>
<br>
&quot;In my early years, even before my true naming, I saw in my adventures to the Commons that I could gain this wonderful armor from others in the auctions and bizarres.  Many there had rich families who financed their every whim, but I have no Uncle Twink.  I also discovered that the tailors paid a plat for every piece of quality spider silk for making swatches.  I knew nothing of tailoring, but I knew how to slay spiders.  Starting in Everfrost and then on to the Karanas, I slew spiders by the hundreds. collecting their silk and making the long dangerous journey back to the Commons to sell my harvest.  As you saw, the spiders did not lose all the battles.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Deeorn gestures toward his chest, the source of the scars there becomes clear.  It was not from some errant paladin's Messenger, but from the mandibles of a spider the size of a house.  Deeorn leans back and chuckles as this fact sinks into his audience of one.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you wish me to recount the tail of this scar?  Very well, but it is a simple tale.  The crag spiders of the eastern reaches of the Karanas are dangerous indeed, but the reward in silks is great.  No other spider in all of Norrath drops so much silk upon death.  As I first began to risk combat with these creatures, I under estimated thier fierceness and fell before one.  Upon regaining my senses, I found that my spirit had returned to the gates of Qeynos through the majik of my binding and reformed my physical body.  It was a long and dangerous return trip through the hills of Qeynos and across the length of the Karanas, a trip I made more than once, before recovering my possessions from the shell of my former self.  The head wound you saw is from the heel of Tarbul Earthshaker's boot, another encounter that sent me through the spirit world back to a gypsy camp I discovered in the north reaches of the Karanas.  I shall leave that horrid tale for another day.<br>
<br>
&quot;The days passed into weeks and the weeks into months.  Always the dream of the ivy etched tunic drove me forward.  On one trip, I met a tailor named Latsor.  He took me under his wing and educated me on the art of tailoring and gifted me with the sewing kit I still carry to this day.  He became a patron of sorts, visiting the Karanas frequently and purchasing the silky fruit of my labors. He taught me the art of making swatches and paid a premium for this work. I returned to Everfrost for the spiderling I once feared so that I could make threads and to make leather armor for the barbarians of Halas.  On one of these trips, I meet a young shaman named Latata.  She desparately wished to leave Halas and see the world in only her fourth season.  Reluctantly, I agreed to protect her as we journeyed together to the Commons to sell some bears skins of exceptional quality.  It was Latata who later introduced me to some of her new friends on the southern plains of Karana.  These friends were Norrathian Knights.  Fellow ranger, Sir Ianian.  Our dear departed comrade, the noble Typhlo of Felwithe.  Lady Cliora and Sir Eert.  If I trace the threads of my life, my own quest for ivy led me to the Norrathian Knights.<br>
<br>
&quot;Though I purchased ivy bracers and sleeves, which if have since traded for Ry'gorr sleeves, the day I heard the chant 'Want to Sell Ivy Etched Tunic.  Send tell' with a large cache of plat in my backpack was the most memorable day of my quest.  It was as if I had arrived at true rangerhood with the equipment to go farther into the wilds of Norrath than ever before and, more importantly, to protect the lives of my comrades.  I bargained and bartered and traded and, finally, came to a price I could afford - a price representing hundreds of spiders lying still on the plains of Karana and numerous trips through the spirit world.<br>
<br>
Deeorn has completed his task now...and for the last time. The ivy is immaculate, as if made only this day.  The green sheen reflects the light of the sun coming throught the open shutters in marvelous patterns that would be completely missed in the depths of the forest.  The ranger idlely strokes the supple metal as his eyes focus elsewhere on something distant from his memories.<br>
<br>
&quot;I later quested for ivy bracers, crafted warrior items from the centaur blacksmith of Karana, a wizard's item from the Temple of Solesek Ro, and various pieces of totemic armor from the barbarians of Lake Rath.  Several of these totemic items are still donned each day by Latata Obaybee, his dear shammy friend, including her Totemic Helm.  I am not adverse to quests.  In fact, I do love a good quest.  I have acquired the Ghoulsbane, which no ranger can now gain.  The famous gem-inlaid gauntlets of the Dwarves of Kaladim have passed through my hands on three occasions.  Ahhh, to quest for items for myself and my friends is an exciting way to pass the time on my journeys.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deeorn gently lifts the ivy tunic and stows it carefully in his fletching kit for safe keeping, the dark green fading to black as the lid of the fletching kit closes.  But as the color of the green armor fades, so to does Deeorn's mood.  A dark shadow seems to pass before him like the spectres of Oasis passing over the waters before their stronghold.  Deeorn is clearly troubled.<br>
<br>
&quot;What troubles me, you ask?  Well, I may as well share it with you, friend, for I am truly troubled.  You see, I care for my ivy dearly and worked as hard for it as any ranger opposing minotaur or brownie.  I cannot imagine the plight of a poor ranger who passed through the spirit world more against these enemies than I did on my own path to ivy.  However, many of my fellow ranger knights seem to feel that the only right and honorable path to acquiring it is through Gandari, the fearless, though eccentric, ranger of the Kithicor Forest Outpost.  I admire the rangers of the Kith as much as any rangers in the lands of Norrath.  You will never find me standing where they stand through the Kithicor nights, infested by the nocternal undead.  In spite of this,  take a moment to consider what Gandari requests for ivy armor.  For the tunics like the one here in my fletching kit, she requests only that you return to her the rune from the innards of a squirt brownie in lesser Faydark and the skull of Meldrath, the Malignant of Steamfont.  Oh, I nearly forgot.  Two rubies are also required, each costing around 130 platinums from a gem vendor.  Now I want you to understand clearly that I do not demean the effort required to do this.  Rare is the ranger who can accomplish these feats before his 35th season.  However, what on Norrath does Gandari do with these items?  You should see the bags of runes she has stashed behind that pile of ivy armor.  What she does with the gems is anyone's guess, but it doesn't go for dandy attire.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no doubt that Gandari wishes rangers to prove themselves while ridding Norrath of uncounted vile beasts at the hands of a legion of rangers.  However, this armor is not custom fitted like the Forest Stalker ranger armor of the Kael Drakkel giants.  No, any ranger can slip into this armor and it will fit just fine.  If I fight the goblins and giants of Kunark rather than these two creatures, have I contributed less to Norrath?  I think not.  The problem I have is that, by Tunare, I do not see that ivy armor is sacred.  Now that I have Tree Weave, what should I do with this ivy tunic.  If all honorable rangers must quest for their ivy armor, what is to happen to this fine piece of armor.  Can you believe that I have heard my comrade ranger knights comtemplating destruction of their armor when it is no longer needed?  If anything is dishonorable to me, that wanton destruction qualifies.  However, it is their ivy and they can do with it as they please.  I can say I am not likely to ever pass equipment to one who would take such action.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deeorn is clearly troubled to the core of his being.  He shakes his head in frustration as he contemplates detruction of such a precious resource when young ranger Knights are wearing banded mail.  His rough, calloused hands tap unconsciously on his fletching kit as he glares at the seams in the stone walls of his new home.  The fate of his ivy tunic is clearly weighing on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So if we agree that it is a shameful waste to destroy such a treasure to rangers, what should be done with it?  I will certainly not destroy it.  I cannot keep it.  I am a ranger, for Tunare's sake.  I travel light and have not the will to let it collect dust in a bank vault in Freeport.  So, if it is to continue to serve the poeple of Norrath as Gandari of the Kith clearly intended, it must come to rest across the chest of a ranger.  But what ranger shall next don this tunic?  Captain Zandrame has requested that rangers quest for their ivy.  This is certainly his perogative to make such a request.  Yet, should a Knight Ranger request this armor of me, I would surely pass it on for the price of the two rubies requested by Gandari, 260 pieces of platinum.  This is half what I paid for it, but tis for a noble cause.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I am a Ranger Knight under the command of Captain Zandrame, but I am also a merchant...and I have my own well developed sense of honor.  The easy course of action is, of course, a trip to the Commons and a quick auction, but if it is dishonorable for a Knight Ranger, it is dishonorable to any ranger to whom I sell the tunic.  In addition, it is a dishonor that I own it myself.  I do not accept this point of view.  If purchase of the tunic is honorable, as I believe it to be, I would give first opportunity to my fellow rangers.<br>
<br>
Deeorn looks as if he has come to a decision and a weight seems to visibly lift from his shoulders, all the more dramatic given their power under the influence of the Tree Weave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friend, I am what I am and will be accepted or rejected based on that.  I am a ranger and a trader and strive to do both with honor.  I shall make my ivy tunic available to whomever wishes it.  At the bizarres of the Commons, I shall ask the market price.  To a Ranger Knight, the price of only 260 pieces of platinum.  Each ranger in need of ivy etched armor can then make their own judgements.  I have made mine.<br>
<br>
Deeorn, the ranger knight and woodland trader, strolls confidently over to the shuttered windows and enjoys the strong, brisk breeze on his face.  He strokes the scar on the side of his head, attributed to the giant terror of eastern Karana, and begins to whistle cheerfully.  As he glances back across his new residence with a grin on his face, it's clear that he will not sleep here this night, but under the stars of Norrath.<br>
