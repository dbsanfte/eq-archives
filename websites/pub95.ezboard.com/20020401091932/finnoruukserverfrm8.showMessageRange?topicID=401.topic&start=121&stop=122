Agriculture was not &quot;well developed&quot; in North America outside the area controlled by the Aztecs (I confused the Aztecs, Incas and Mayans, so if I use the wrong one, I apologize. I believe th Aztecs were the only truly agrarian society in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> North</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> America.)<br>
<br>
What particular crops they may have grown is not as significant as the methods by which they grew them. A victory garden in my backyard does not suddenly make me the equivalent of a commercial farmer. I did say that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> vast majority</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were hunter-gatherers. Whereas the Europeans of the period had entered the industrial stage, the Americans had barely entered the agrarian stage, with the Aztecs, Incans and Mayans being the farthest developed. None of them ruled over even a major portion of the continents.<br>
<br>
At the time of the discovery of N. America, the Mayan, Incan and Aztec cultures were already beginning to decay. The suggestion that a few hundred or even a few thousand Conquistadors could destroy a civilization that, by your reckoning, must have numbered in the millions is absurd.<br>
As for predisposition to alcoholism and lack of disease resistance... hallucinagenic and other drugs had been available in the Americas long before alcohol made its way here. As for disease... a century before Columbus discovered the Americas (whether anyone else had previously discovered them is irrelevant; Columbus had never seen them before, so in this context it's adequate to say he &quot;discovered&quot; them,) western Europe was ravaged by the black death, bubonic and pneumonic plague. A disease not native to western Europe but brought there from the orient. There was virtually no sanitation, what medical treatment there was was most often worse than the cure. The disease killed 2/3s of the western European population... yet a century later they had rebounded, and were expanding. It's curious that the Americans, facing much the same situation (with a much smaller focus of infection, and a time period of isolation from further infection) would be so terribly ravaged simply because the diseases they encountered was alien to them. Later, it was a practice among some unscrupulous European-Amerians, to give blankets that had been used by smallpox sufferers to the then-native Americans, in an effort to spread disease and kill them. But that was centuries later.<br>
<br>
I suggest the cause of the alcoholism was cultural emasculation, so to speak. The apparent superiority of European culture (guns, steel weapons, etc) combined with the self-assurance and aggressiveness of most of the European invaders, in my opinion, caused the Americans to lose faith in themselves and their various cultures. Not all of them, and not suddenly, of course. Much the same would happen to the world if space aliens were to land tomorrow with ray guns and teleporter beams and what-have-you. We might survive better because we know that it's merely advanced science, but one cannot underestimate the effect of morale, for good or bad.<br>
Interesting that you should mention war as a cause of the death of Americans, because it's often overlooked that the various tribes of N. America did not play well together, to begin with. <br>
<br>
As for seeking help, alright, I'll call 911... what's your address, so I know where to send the ambulance?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   My stance is that nobody that is serious thinks that political equality is the same as biological equality<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Then nobody is serious, because that is exactly what is being pushed in the media, in politics, in sports, everywhere. In a twisted effort to support the agenda of political equality for females, those behind said efforts, even those who agree with said efforts, support and promote the proposition that (and I quote from hearing it a hundred times) &quot;girls can do anything boys can do.&quot; Thought is never given to the idea &quot;should they?&quot; Not, &quot;should they be allowed?&quot; Not even &quot;should they want to?&quot; Put forth the proposition that mammalian herbivores are the political equal of mammalian carnivores. And in order to promote this equality, you encourage gazelle to hunt with packs of wolves. Surely a gazelle can outrun some prey, perhaps even better than an individual wolf can. But what's the point in having it do so, other than pushing the idea that gazelles are equal to wolves? <br>
<br>
Should females be considered politically equal to males? I don't know; I confess a prejudice on this matter, born of the war of the sexes. As a matter of principle, I think everyone within a nation should be politically equal. They aren't, of course; consider Enron, Microsoft, Congressman Bribetaker, Joe Bureaucrat, you, and me. Personally, I think anyone insane enough to wish to be in all ways equal to male humans needs a keeper. Especially when the inequalities are in some way superior to human males.<br>
If females are biologically different from males, their interests, concerns and needs will be different; thus they should have an equal say in political matters. But if they are not, then there is no point in sending Jane Smith to Congress; John Doe will do the job just as well. By the same token, if they are biologically different, then these differences must be considered in the structure of society, as well. Having all restaurants serve rabbit meat is fine for the wolves, but death for the gazelle. Having all restaurants serve grass is great for the gazelle, but death to the wolves. <br>
And that's the fallacy of &quot;if boys can do it, girls can do it too.&quot; It doesn't address the question of whether they should.<br>
<br>
I once read where the black death was an unintended consequence of persecuting old widows as witches or some such. It seems old widows kept cats (which helped in the persecution of them as witches, I suppose) and when the widows were gone, the cat population declined. The population declined, and the rat population flourished, thus providing the medium of transport for the plague as it made its way from the orient. We are beginning to see, though most turn a blind eye to it, the flourishing of the rats as a result of the suppression of femininity.  Fair or unfair, females as mothers of households provided the stabilizer for our society. Watch a rerun of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. As it would have been in real life, it's not the men scandalized by Scarlett's behavior, or by the madame-friend of Butler's. It's not the men setting the moral tone of the society but the women. In making females the equivalent of males, we've removed that rudder from the ship. Turn on the news or open a newspaper to view the results. Perhaps not every female was able to ride a horse like a man, or climb Mt. Everest with the men, or play hockey in the olympics, but by puberty most already had the basic framework for running a household, when doing so was a lot more difficult than it is today. By the same token, by puberty most boys had learned their responsibility to care for and provide for the family. It seems to be a popular myth that females drudged away, day-in and day-out running the household, and that the males wandered off to drink, and shoot, and carouse, and have a  g a y  old time. The fact of the matter is that in most of western society males worked just as long and harder than the females. Neither are learning their responsibilities, or any responsibilities, now. It's all &quot;if it feels good, it must be good; if it feels bad, it must be bad.&quot; I keep an old tabloid advertisement for Virginia Slims in my desk. It shows a sepia-toned picture of a fat woman, dressed in early 20th century garb, with a basket of laundry under each arm, preparing to hang it out to dry. In the foreground is a color image of a sleek, lipsticked and made-up blonde wearing a sexy outfit, smirking gently. The caption reads, &quot;in 1906, it wasn't a woman's opinion that carried weight.&quot; I never did get that ad. If I wanted an opinion worth having, I'd ask the housewife, not the tramp.<br>
<br>
 And there's no mystery between the sexes. By puberty, girls know all there is to know about boys, and vice versa. It's very true that familiarity breeds, if not contempt, at least disrespect. Females are no longer mysterious and wonderful and at-arms-length to males. They're just males with breast implants. Males are no longer mysterious and powerful and at-arms-length to females. They're just females without breast implants.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Eh? I'm a male and I've been aroused by females many times; never once has getting the female pregnant had anything to do with it. In fact, up to this point, and for quite some time into the future, I'm gonna make damn sure NOT to get the female pregnant. Welcome to the age of contraceptives and alcohol, Aldrin. People have sex for pleasure now. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
People have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> had sex for pleasure. Getting the female pregnant had everything to do with it every time. That you thwarted the process matters not at all to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  cause</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the process. <br>
Your body, in some ways, is like a computer. It's programmed to respond to stimuli, in order to create behavior that almost always is pro-survival for the species. That your mind can reason, that it can thwart the process, by use of contraceptive, masturbation, or cold showers matters not to the instinct. That it can be short-circuited by drugs that produce similar effects doesn't change the instinctive programming. And if that programming is bugged, the individual responds improperly to the stimulus. <br>
Why is it so difficult to understand? There is no reason for sex to exist outside of reproduction. I don't mean there's no philosophical reason, I mean there's no evolutionary, no biological reason. Yes, you're aroused by a female and she doesn't instantly become pregnant; how inefficient. How pregnant is she going to get if your pud is limp? As the process was taught to me in school, no erection = no intercourse. And I can't recall a single instance in my life where I've had sex and not had an erection prior to intercourse. Is Viagra so popular because it's a great breath mint?<br>
You don't have sex for pleasure; you have sex because it is pleasurable to do so. More plainly, you do not conciously think, &quot;I will have sex now and that will give me pleasure&quot;, and then have sex.<br>
Your body feels &quot;I will have sex now <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  because</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sex stimulates pleasure.&quot; And it will drive you out of your mind to induce you to do so. Nobody told your instincts that your gametes will end their travels inside a prophylactic.<br>
<br>
I'm not opposed to having sex, even if just for pleasure. But it makes a heckuva difference once you know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  why</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you are programmed to want it.<br>
I didn't say evolution worked against homosexuality. I said there's no evolutionary reason for it, unlike heterosexuality. I've also said that evolution doesn't eliminate a characteristic until it proves dangerous to the species. That doesn't make the characteristic, good, desireable or equal to the most necessary and pro-survival characteristics. Humans still have an appendix, for example.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  In fact, some societies consider procreation such a burden on the planet that if you try to have more than one child they'll euthanize the second one at birth.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What a lovely way to refer to one of the most repressive, repulsive regimes on the planet. You neatly leave out the forced breeding programs instituted by Mao that led to the high population of China (nb. China != world.) It's not love of Mommy Earth, but political and economic necessity that drives the Chinese to forced infantacide. And you refer to it as if it were some noble, voluntary sacrifice. How sad.<br>
<br>
The world is not overpopulated. It's not even very full. And the evolutionary cure when an animal population overbreeds its living area is famine and disease.<br>
You refer to an activity between two parties that can result in the creation of a third party; that can transmit diseases to the general population; that can create social disharmony and crime (be it heterosexual or homosexual activity.) The tobacco companies have been demonized because use of their products can affect those around the one engaged in smoking activities. If I am stopped by a police officer and I'm not wearing my seat belt, I can receive a ticket, even though it's my body and I'm not harming anyone. People's livlihoods are destroyed for the sake of the harm caused to animals by their activities. You say that it's nobody's business when two people play at procreation, when that activity has as much affect on others as do any of those cited above? Moreso, because the activity is designed to create a 3rd party, and therefore often does in spite of the most careful attempts to thwart it. And this is the 21st century; it's not two people, it's two people, or 12 people, or 5 people a giraffe and a bowl of jello. And all the people, animals, and desserts they had activities with before and will in the future.<br>
I have been arguing science, Haagen, but you and others don't want to think in terms of science. You apparently want to think in terms of feeling-good. I'm imposing nothing. I speak of instinct and evolutionary drives, and you speak of your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  thought</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> processes. I invoke logic to describe a biological necessity, and you invoke illogic to talk about your sex life.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The only real-world society to connect these two notions in a nontrivial way was Nazi Germany, and look what happened to them.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Wrong.<br>
Every communist state has attempted to connect these two notions; it is, in fact, a part of communist dogma that all are blindly equal, male and female alike. Stalin murdered more people than did Hitler, a fact happily overlooked by self-righteous Westerners. The Soviet Union had females in combat as early as the 2nd World War. So they had the girls doing what the boys were doing with no accounting for the biological differences, because they were supposedly politically equal. And he equally slaughtered any who opposed the Party.<br>
Of course, Nazi is a short form of &quot;National Socialist&quot; not &quot;National Capitalist&quot;. So the left still holds a monopoly on mass-murderers.<br>
