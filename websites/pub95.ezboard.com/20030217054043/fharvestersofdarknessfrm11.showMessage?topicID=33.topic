a famly reunion</span><hr size=1> A man with a blood stained sword steps in glancing for familiar faces. He notices a woman talking to a man in a black cape in  <br>
A corner of the tavern. Some how she looks like some one he knew a long time ago but he just can’t make it out. He sits down  <br>
In front of the fire place and asks for a drink<br>
<br>
A man makes the drink and hands it to the man with the blood stained sword. As the man drinks he thinks about his mother and  <br>
Father when he was young. &quot;He remembers High Elf's sending his fathers chopped off head to his mother.&quot; <br>
<br>
A few moments later some one pokes him in the back. He stands up with his sword ready and about to slash the mans throat.  <br>
Five guards draw their weapons to defend the man on the ground as he stands up and dusted himself off. He tells the man with  <br>
The blood stained sword. <br>
<br>
&quot;All I ask of you is your name good sir and we will be off&quot; <br>
<br>
The man with the blood stained sword puts his sword back and tells the guards <br>
<br>
&quot;Adyik&quot;<br>
<br>
Adyik noticed the woman talking to the man in the black cape glance over at Adyik and her eye's light up and she smiles.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are looking for a man who attacked the bank&quot; <br>
<br>
The guard explains to Adyik what he looks like. Adyik tells the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have not seen such a man and I am sorry about the way I acted&quot;<br>
<br>
The guards nod and go on their way. Adyik looks at the man in the black cape as he sits in front of the fire place. Adyik  <br>
Gets up and walks over to the woman and tells her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vendui I am Adyik follower of Innarrouk and a knight of the shadows.&quot; <br>
<br>
He smiles at the woman feeling comfort being close to her yet doe's not know why.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milady&quot; May I ask thy name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Adyik waits for a response. . .<br>

 &quot; Excuse my Adyik, I am your sister and welcome to the halls of the Harvesters. How I have longed for you. I knew I would find you I could feel you were still alive. Right now I will have to introduce you to the rest of the family. They will want to know you.&quot;<br>

For a brief moment, she thinks about greeting him.  It is only proper to acknowledge a comrade when passing.  Just as she makes her mind up to approach the man, a group of guards push past her to exit the tavern.  She levels a chilling glare at the last to express her disapproval of their manners and he does a double take, but notices her youth and shrugs, thinking she is of  no consequence.  She lets him leave, but notes his face.  Should the slight be repeated again, even once, the guard would breath his last.  Turning back to the  young Shadow Knight, Lexiil is startled by a female  Teir'dal who shouts and throws her arms about the Knight.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

A small smile turns her lips as she watches the two embrace again and wishes for someone to welcome her in such a way.

But instead, she steps forward and greets both with a polite smile and a graceful incline of her head.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
