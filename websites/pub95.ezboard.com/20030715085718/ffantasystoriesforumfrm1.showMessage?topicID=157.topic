The time period was fourteen years following the rupture in the Grand Seal, but most knew nothing about that recent incident. However, rumors of an army arising in the south began to latch onto the ears of a few travelers that had passed through the Albanon Kingdom. Carried on flamboyant lips, gossip of war soon found itself a worthy hold in the minds of precarious people, as gossip always does. The blade armor of Holy Emperor Martrin had supposedly become infused with the body of a man; who this man was remained unknown. But of course,  rumors of an arisen Armor Lord stemming from the south were not entirely uncommon. Ever since the War of Redemption any fool spouting claims of there being an Armor Lord was taken seriously. Sometimes there were reported sightings of multiple Armor Lords at a single time, which was a preposterous notion, since there was only one set of blade armor to be donned.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
In any case, if there actually was a true Armor Lord out there, the Fundament would definitely know about it by now. The Fundament still occupied a few fortresses in the south; a good distance beyond the Fotenburg Plain and far to the north of the Hungry River. The Fundament held its forces at rest on the edge of the Blasphemous Lands, just beyond the two cities that bordered the Grand Seal. Caltrin and Nalfador were the names of the two cities, places where cutthroats and cutpurses were respectable professions. The two cities had allied themselves with Oztrenoth during the War of Redemption, and had served as blockades to slow the advance of the Fundament when they made their march into the south. The two cities had a great advantage defensively, since they were positioned high atop plateaus that overlooked the entirety of the surrounding lands. During the War of Redemption, they had lined up rows upon rows of ballistic engines of war on the edge of the plateaus, and had used them to shower their advancing enemies with fiery death and swarms of arrows. <br>
<br>
The land encircling the two cities was oftentimes enough to impede the progress of even the hardiest armies. Craters dotted the roughly hewn landscape, making roadways impassable or greatly reducing the speed at which an army could traverse them. Stacks of crags filed across the land in slanting rows, as if a giant farmer had uplifted them all with a single stroke from a massive hoe. Though not quite in the Realm of Malediction, this land still held many of its characteristics. Airborne clouds of dust criss-crossed the suns like a veil, netting out half the light being passed down from them.  The loose ashy soil was an ailment, coughing up more arid tendrils of dirt with each thrust of the wind. Only a few parceled shreds of green shrubbery found themselves a refuge within the cracks and nooks of boulders and dry land, making the place an altogether colorless region, aside from the predominant brown. Suitable farmland was hard pressed to find here; a few large, sectioned off areas of land were fed water and fertilizer daily, to create soil where crops wouldn’t whither away mid season. Before the War of Redemption, the two cities had mostly relied on outside trade to satisfy their supply needs, but now they were severely cut off from the rest of the world, and had mainly themselves to depend upon. Caltrin and Nalfador had been known for producing some of the finest in weaponry and armor, but now they manufactured little of either, since their main struggle had been shifted to survival. <br>
<br>
After the War of Redemption, the Fundament had decided not to wipe out the two cities, since such a campaign would be costly to themselves. They found that the two cities would better serve them if they were left intact, producing armaments for the Fundament’s military at near production cost. In return for this, the Fundament allowed a small amount of trade to be circulated between the two cities and other kingdoms. But to insure that the two cities remained crippled––should they decide to try and rise up again––the Fundament placed heavy sanctions on any imported goods. Also a tax was placed on any exported goods, collecting no less than a third and no more than a half of total profits. It maintained poverty at a safe level, but not too low, otherwise a massive amount of people would die off. There was a govenant reigning in each city, but they were rulers who cared little for their people, and strived to please the Fundament’s every whim. That’s why uneasy tensions were growing in the south, because if the Armor Lord truly had returned, then he would likely lead the people to battle against the Fundament, overthrowing the govenants in the process. The govenants would hate to see the return of the Armor Lord just as much as the Fundament would.<br>
<br>

<br>
To the northeast of Kingdom Algaroy, beneath bitter skies wrapped in fluffy white curls of snow, was the kingdom known as Glamisoreat North. It was a kingdom now ruled by a single High Decka, who was very young for her position. Hallgron was the capital city; a place where every roof bulged beneath the weight of winter’s fallout. The square buildings stooped low to the ground, where the snow would pack itself almost entirely around them; it served as a second layer of insulation, with asbestos between the walls being the first. The houses were mostly single-floored complexes, with fireplaces burning gently and emitting heat from the center of the room. Windows illuminated by candles spilled out golden puddles across the snow. Black smoke rising up against the falling snow poured forth from chimney pipes on every block and street corner.  <br>
<br>
The pebble streets outside were entrenched beneath deep layers of snow, where only a path made here and there by a plowman cut through the freshly fallen flakes. The midmorning sky was a quiet gray, with more crystals of snow slowly racing their way down from the heavens, landing with tiny thuds muted to human ears. Aside from a plowman or two puffing out silver clouds of fog while they worked, the streets were deserted.<br>
<br>
The serenity of the morning drift was broken by four men carrying a large chest between them. They methodically strode down a cleared path in the street, one of them positioned at each corner of the heavy box they were lugging. Their faces were concealed behind icicle-engraved scarves and hoods, with only their reddened noses poking out into the cold air. They wore long, dark heavy coats, which looked ruffled and worn from extensive travel. The falling snow clung to wrinkles in their garments, temporarily turning their wearers into walking snowmen before melting. Their chests heaved and wheezed with each step, generating synchronized breaths of frosty mist. They didn’t speak a word to each other, but kept trudging on, fur-trimmed boots crunching through the snow. Castle Hallgron loomed over the houses in the distance; the four men and their package steadily drew closer to it.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Heckens leaned up in his bed, then nodded toward the servant. “Thanks for the hot chocolate, leave it on my desk over there.” The suavely groomed servant bowed in acknowledgment, then proceeded to do as told. After completing his menial task, he clasped his gloved hands together and patiently awaited any further instruction. Heckens tossed off his thick blankets and stood up. “That will be all. You can go now.” The servant bowed away then exited through the door. Servants were not allowed to speak or act, unless directly addressed and told to do so.<br>
<br>
After throwing off his sleeping garments, Heckens sluggishly walked over to his wardrobe and picked out one of his advisor robes. It was a loose-fitting, royal blue robe, with nothing particularly fancy about it. The white snow owl, the sign of House Stellra, was stitched into the left and right breast. The two detailed owls stood tall on an olive branch with their backs facing one another, maintaining a guarded expression within their sunken eyes. The robe had a high neck collar, which went all the way up and barely touched Heckens’ chin. The collar was gilded with silver and inscribed with blocky symbols that held little meaning.<br>
<br>
After slipping into his attire and finding it to be a comfortable fit, Heckens walked over to his washstand and mirror. He bent over and looked into the gold-framed mirror; the reflection of his own dark eyes stared back at him. His long midnight beard was a tangled and matted clump, with a few rebellious hairs twisting off like broken lute strings. “Not again... at times it would seem maintaining this bush of hair is more trouble than it’s worth,” he grumbled to himself. He dipped his cupped hands into the crystalline waters of the washbasin, then splashed a few quarts of it onto his face. Having a beard was almost necessary to keep one’s skin from freezing over in this land, so he couldn’t easily part with it. After his beard was thoroughly soaked, he clamped both hands around it and rang it out like a wet sponge, spraying drops out onto the velvet carpet and tubby washbasin.  <br>
<br>
Heckens made a few more minor adjustments to his hair and robes, then walked over to his desk to pick up the mug of hot chocolate. While reaching down to grab the steaming cup, he took a quick glance out the window behind his desk. The window panes held up slopes of thick frost, so it was difficult to discern what lay beyond, but Heckens was still able to make out the shapes of several figures marching up the pathway in the courtyard below. There were four outsiders, holding some kind of box between them. They were escorted by several castle guards, men who were dressed in heavy black pelts beneath the cold steel of their breastplates. The guards wore large thick mittens, which resembled black pompons. Heckens could not even distinguish their fingers, it looked like their hands were nothing more than black balls of fur. The guards wore tall fuzzy hats, made from the same animal hide as their gloves. Their lips were all hooked downward, boring stern expressions on their faces. Their overall appearance, and the way they marched in rhythm, reminded Heckens of a wind-up toy soldier he had played with as a boy.<br>
<br>
“Well, well. It appears the High Decka has some visitors today,” he absently muttered to himself. Lifting the mug of hot chocolate to his lips, he took a long swig. The liquid was scalding hot, he nearly burned his tongue off in the process of swallowing. Most men chose to start the day with a glass of apple cider to warm their insides, but not Heckens, he was content with a simple chocolate mixture. He would have breakfast later on, after checking on the High Decka’s condition. Depleting his drink to the last drop, he set the cup back down onto the desk with a thud. It would probably be just another day of pointless politics.<br>
<br>
A slight rapping on the door brought Heckens’ attention around. “Be there in one moment,” he vacantly told whoever was behind the door. He crossed the red velvet carpet once again, then opened the door with a twist of the golden handle, revealing Tactician Skarn on the other side. <br>
<br>
The scrupulous looking man greeted him by mildly inclining his head and plainly saying, “The dawn welcomes you.” He motioned Heckens to come out into the hall. “Come, let us go find what our High Decka’s bidding is for this day.” The square-shouldered man turned on his heel and started off down the hall, the edge of his dark cloak brushing across the floor behind him. His plated boots jangled like sleigh bells with each step, resounding off down the square corridor. Long knots of braided straw-spun hair, which argued with the color of the rest of his dark grab, bounced on his back with each step.<br>
<br>
Heckens strode out into the hallway, swiftly closing and locking the door behind him. He had to take double steps to catch up to Skarn, who was already halfway down the hall to the next door. “The dawn welcomes you as well,” he formally greeted the other. “Any news today? Anything happening that I should know about?” He asked in a blithe manner. <br>
<br>
Like always, Skarn gave him the usual runabout of things. He spoke in a voice gruffer than a goat’s, “Well, you know how things are. If we aren’t besought by smaller nations for support, then we’re likely having potential treaties being rammed down our throats by our foes. Never give in to them; is what I always say. They only want us to lower our guard, then they will try and take Cloudsunder for themselves.” The man stroked the greased tips of his three-pronged beard, seemingly trying to think of anything else. “I can’t think of anything more to tell you. Nothing that you don’t already know, anyway.”<br>
<br>
Recently a multitude of events had occurred on Falax’mertenya. There were rumors of a new leader toppling one of the Fundament’s puppet regimes in the west; though it was unlikely this would provide any advantageous opportunities for Glamisoreat North. Kingdoms challenged the Fundament all the time, and they were put down like rabid dogs as a result. There was nothing to be gained from direct opposition to them. Heckens knew that one day the Fundament would implode in on itself, so why waste a war effort on them? The Fundament was filled with hypocrites and dictators, everything that it was supposedly against. A phrase they had adopted worked equally as well on themselves, ‘Leave evil to its own unmaking.’<br>
<br>
“I hear our sworn enemies, Glamisoreat South, are receiving support from the Fundament. This could spell disaster for us,” said Heckens dismally as he turned toward his companion. “Strangely, they are reportedly heading south. I don’t know if they are making a joint war effort or if the Fundament is using Glamisoreat South just as a staging ground. It would be best to keep an eye on them, though I doubt they would launch any massive offensives on us this time of year. They would freeze to death before they made it halfway here.”<br>
<br>
Skarn’s chest rose upward then released a deep sigh. He replied in a croaky voice, “I wouldn’t worry about them. There is supposedly an Armor Lord in the south, and I’m sure they want to destroy him completely and utterly before he manages to muster up an army. I have even heard rumors of Unconsecrated Ones roaming the land again, but even if they prove true, it’s not a problem of ours. Besides, to the Fundament we are the shadow always looming just out of sight. They know we’re not a threat, unless something else drastic should happen.” The man turned and studied the tapestries passing by on the cream-colored walls. The tapestries were whiter than the eye of winter, with the darker white forms of snow owls stitched into their center. The owls were hunched low, as if prepared to swoop down from their olive branches to collect a mouse. Their faces were etched with boundless wisdom––as much wisdom as could be presented by a masterful sewing hand, anyway.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
After passing through several doors and several more halls, the double doors leading to the Chamber of Ancestors appeared just ahead. A few servants going about their business stopped and bowed out of the way as Skarn and Heckens came through. Heckens had lived here nearly all his life, but the Chamber of Ancestors was still an eerie place to him. Skarn and he each pushed a door open, then entered into the darkened, domed room of the Chamber of Ancestors. The majority of light was closed off in the hall left behind, now, the only source of illumination stemmed from a few freshly lit torch stands. Long shadows played games of hide and seek across the walls, to the bidding of torch flames which bended and swayed in a fiery limbo. The walls were not entirely walls though. Glass showcases, as tall as an average-sized man, lined the dimly lit walls all around the circular chamber. A person was inside each one of them, or what had been a person at one point. The people inside looked as real as they had on the day they left the mortal coil. It was almost as if they were frozen in cubes of ice, never to walk or speak again, but always watching over the chamber with inexhaustible eyes. They were all ancestors of the High Decka, some dating back hundreds of years ago. Advisors and other important council members were preserved here as well; Heckens knew that one day he would join them. This room was a reminder that nothing lasts forever: cities, men, and beliefs were all meaningless in the end. <br>
<br>
The figures behind the glass stood silently with palms raised outward, as if offering the living a chance to come and take their place. The embalmers and taxidermists did an excellent job of capturing their life and immortalizing it in this way. Many historical faces, glowing a dull orange from torchlight reflections, stared out with astuteness that could never be lost. Heckens could almost see their lips move and hear their voices. Valaren, the Grand Duke, imperialistically stood over in one corner. A sword clasped firmly in his fist was held out before him in a permanent salute. In his mind, Heckens could hear, “My sword, my life, my honor.”  <br>
<br>
Skarn stifled out a hearty chuckle. “What’s the matter with you? I thought this place frightened you, yet you seem completely absorbed in it. Should I tell the High Decka you’re not coming today?” He grabbed Heckens by his shoulder and roughly pushed him forward. “Let’s go already.”<br>
<br>
Heckens nodded and compliantly continued walking along. “Sorry, it just seems the dead have much to say, if one only stops and listens.” They strode down the steps of the chamber and arrived at the door on the other side. The High Decka’s bedroom was down another two or three hallways. It really was a long walk every morning; he sometimes wished the castle’s architects hadn’t been so spacious.<br>
<br>
“I envy dead men. They have no regrets,” docilely grumbled Skarn to himself. The two of them finally arrived at the High Decka’s bedroom. Skarn gently knocked on the door, then crossed his arms and waited impatiently. “I wonder if the High Decka’s condition has been escalated or relieved some?” <br>
<br>
“There’s no telling for sure. We can just count ourselves lucky that the Achromatic Plague hasn’t stricken here in full force yet. I wonder what could cause such an...an epidemic? The High Decka hasn’t shown any plague symptoms yet, it would seem her illness is something else,” replied Heckens in a sympathetic tone. The High Decka’s health was fading rapidly––even though she was only fourteen years old! She was the last in a long lineage known as House Stellra.<br>
<br>
The door opened a crack and the well-rounded face of a middle-aged lady appeared. Beneath her thin eyelashes, two sapphire eyes surveyed the pair of men standing before her. She waved her arm and motioned them to enter. She spoke in an uncouth manner, “Come in. The High Decka has been expecting you like always.”<br>
<br>
Their shoulders swung with each step as they marched into the room, trying to look stern and disciplined in front of their High Decka. Their efforts were fruitlessly spent though. The High Decka lay face down atop a mountain of blankets and pillows, her arms sprawled flat out to her sides. Steam rose from a cup full of fresh soup resting atop her bedside dresser; it looked like her serving maiden hadn’t been able to spoon any of it into her mouth. <br>
<br>
The room was on ground level, with banks of snow just outside nearly reaching up to the windowsill. A small fireplace opposite the window blazed and sparked with fresh kindling, popping and spitting up ash every now and then. The tiled floor was glossy and spotless, whoever cleaned this room had it down to a science. A few chairs carved from hickory sat vacant against the walls, their rims facing the bed.<br>
<br>
There were two others in the room besides the serving maiden and themselves. John Brahn the Crooked turned his doughy face toward them as they entered, his misaligned eyes squinting behind rectangular spectacles. He was by all means a dwarf man, and he prided himself on it. John was a product of incestial relationships between dwarves before him, because long ago dwarves had been commodities among high ruling people; they served as entertainers and comedians. Awhile back, a large family of dwarves had been adopted by the Stellra family. These dwarves were all talented circus performers and accomplished comedians who thrived on their roles in entertainment, but to insure that their kind would live on, they had to inbreed, since other outsider dwarves were difficult to come across. Each generation spawning from their tight gene pool only became more twisted and crazed. Just looking at John was enough to make anyone sprout lumps, and be thankful that the union of their parents was not a sacrilegious one. The dwarf’s chin had more slopes and curves than a hilly landscape; indeed, much more than any humanoid creature deserved. He had more facial hair than most animals, and it was singed in many places, where he had decided it would be a good idea to light it on fire, because if there was one hobby John was good at it was starting things on fire. The dwarf was a pyro menace, and should be banished from the castle forever, but he made the High Decka laugh, and that was enough to earn his keep. Heckens was grateful that John was the last little scamp left, since most of the others had died at birth, or were born short a heart or other vital organ.<br>
<br>
Seated across from the fireplace was the hulk of a man known as Gunro, the Tumlander. He was a giant brute garbed in onyx leather, with his bare muscular arms bulging almost to the point of bursting. Blood vessels as thick as rope twined their way up and down his arms, disappearing beneath plated shoulder pads and heavy jet-black gauntlets. He came from Tumland, and was the High Decka’s personal guardian. He never spoke a word, reserving himself to a quiet vigilance over things he had no control over. Dark emotionless eyes, hidden behind long strands of loose black hair, flared up orange with each roar from the fireplace. His face was a livid mask which spoke louder than words, and people nearby were wise enough to listen, knowing that this man was not one who liked to be bothered. In his younger years he had been a guardian to the previous High Decka, but disease had claimed her life, and now the same thing was happening to the current High Decka. There was nothing a great warrior like himself could do about it either, his massive sword could not slay a virus.  Watching and hoping was all that could be done at a time like this.<br>
<br>
“How are you doing today, High Decka Dalfoy?” asked Heckens, unable to hide the touch of worriment in his voice. The young girl was still dressed in her silken sleeping garments, laying unmoving on her stomach. She struggled with the monumental task of twisting herself onto her back, then looked out at her two advisors through famished eyes. Great bags of purple sagged low beneath those cool eyes, either from lack of sleep or lack of nourishment, probably both. Millage, the woman who had opened the door for them, rushed to her side in case she should fall.<br>
<br>
“Do I look like I’m doing well? I am too weak to even step out of bed and take a bath! Why has this happened to me?” Her high-strung voice was powerless, despite the demanding force she tried to put behind it. She brushed a matted black curl of hair out of her face. “I can’t eat and I can’t sleep. When will those damned Hamotsfu Priests arrive and cure me!?” She fell back on her pillows, out of breath from shouting. The color of her skin was a yellow deeper than a bale of golden wheat. All her bones protruded throughout her entire frame; she looked like nothing more than a skeleton bundled up in a yellow bag. She was so thin, so frail. One touch and she might shatter into a million pieces.<br>
<br>
“I saw a group of strange looking men heading up to the castle earlier, perhaps they are the priests? They were heavily garbed, so it was difficult to see who they were,” replied Heckens. He could tell the High Decka wasn’t really listening though, her chest inflated and deflated like a bagpipe, and it always seemed like her next intake of air would be her last, but somehow she fought on. <br>
<br>
John, mostly content watching the fire, suddenly piped up. The dwarf’s voice was a choked wheeze, as if his nose was stuffed full with rocks as he talked, “I know what to do! I remember my uncle Yergen telling me something...err wait...uncle...maybe he was my cousin, or maybe he was my brother, or my father.” The dwarf twiddled his disproportionate fingers, pretending he knew how to count. Soon he gave up and threw his shoulders into a shrug, beaming a crooked smile as he did so. “Ah well! Ya never can tell with us, can ya?” His face stooped down into a serious expression, trying to mimic that of those around him. “So anyway, he always said, ‘If they be sick, bleed em till they be as thin as a stick.’ That’s just a handful of some very wise words that came from uncl––err I mean Yergen.”<br>
<br>
Skarn lowered his feathery eyebrows and only shook his head in bewilderment. “You imbecile! Does she look like she has anything left in her to bleed out? I’m glad the tumlander is here to watch over things. I’ll never understand why she trusts you.” Heckens could see no point in wasting words on the dwarf. He was what he was. John did not reply to the insult though, his gaze had unwaveringly wandered back to the fire, as if it was some kind of newly discovered phenomenon.<br>
<br>
“Oh dear, you have to try and keep down more food. You’ll die if you don’t,” said Millage in a soothing, maternal inflection. She was like a mother to the High Decka, always bringing food and fresh clothes, or talking of better times when things looked grim. <br>
<br>
Consciousness seemed to have slipped away from the High Decka. The poor girl’s eyes were sealed shut, and she lay motionless like before, with only her rising and falling chest giving sign that she lived. She slightly squirmed and rolled on her blankets, mumbling something through sleepy lips, “Rosethorn! I must have it––” her mouth twisted into a smile. “I will slay all sworn enemies barring my path, and those who oppress my rule will be destroyed this instant. No! I won’t let you take Cloudsunder.” The High Decka continued on, smacking her lips together, words rolling off her tongue as if they were delicious, “Mm, holocaust...yes...burn them all...burn them all.” <br>
<br>
Skarn and Heckens exchanged worried glances with one another. Skarn leaned toward Heckens, then spoke quietly into his ear, “It would seem the virus has gone straight to the High Decka’s brain. I fear it will soon be up to us to rule this kingdom.” Heckens could have avowed that he saw a smile creep up beneath the other’s spiked beard. “That would be acceptable to you, would it not?”<br>
<br>
Heckens staggered back a few steps, then retorted in a hush tone, “I think you’re jumping to early conclusions. When the Hamotsfu Priests arrive then we shall see, but for now, I’m wasting time here. I have other paper work to do.” He went for the door, but as he did, the High Decka’s eyes peeled open. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Leaving so soon, Heckens?” the High Decka petulantly asked. Heckens’ robes swished around him as he did a turnabout on his heel. She sheepishly looked at him. “Could I have you bring me Cloudsunder please? I haven’t held it in awhile.” Heckens turned toward the sword, which rested on a gilded rack in one of the corners. Cloudsunder was an unusual looking sword; its long, thick blade was hazy and translucent, as if it had been forged from glass. The hilt was sky blue, with a sunny gem encrusted into the center of its pommel. Heckens walked over to pick it up, but was interrupted by a sudden knocking at the door.<br>
<br>
Skarn turned around and opened it. An odd troop of men stood on the other side, holding up a giant casket between the four of them. They were escorted in the front and rear by soldiers armed to the last tooth, who stood straight and expressionless amidst all their armor––Heckens couldn’t help but admire them, not even the slightest trickle of a sweat broke out on their faces.<br>
Scarfs hung loosely around the necks of the four men, and crystals of ice were still visible in their beards and hair. Cheeks and noses still held a few puddles of red, but the castle’s heat had mostly thawed them out.<br>
<br>
“So, what do we have here? The Hamotsfu Priests we were expecting I presume?” Skarn asked indifferently. The four priests nodded, then placed their heavy burden on the floor. They all kneeled down, pressing one hand to the tile while bowing their heads low. <br>
<br>
The captain of the guards who escorted them shuffled his way over to Skarn. He clasped a hand over his heart, then slanted his other hand down from his forehead, giving a double salute. His face was young, but his voice was that of an old man accustomed to death. “Sir, their documents and symbols check out, sir.” The chin strap of his helmet creaked as he slowly turned to look back at the priests. “Sir, if I might add, caution would be advisable. Some of them seemed a little uneasy when I mentioned checking inside of the box, sir.”<br>
<br>
“Bah! Hamotsfu Priests are neutral to all kingdoms, and always have been. We have nothing to fear from the likes of them. Let them in and be on your way.” Skarn stroked his three-pronged beard as he examined the priests and their giant luggage. The captain of the guards tipped a bow, then strode back into the hall, commanding all his troops to follow him. Skarn signaled for the priests to stand back on their feet, then pointed at the box between them. “What’s inside of there?”<br>
<br>
“May Hamotsfu always shed his grace upon you. Greetings, I am Reverend Leopon.” The priest, still wearing his cumbersome coat, motioned back toward the box with a nudge of his head. “As for this chest, it holds tools that we may need to help us conduct the healing process. The High Decka is deathly ill, unless I am gravely mistaken?”<br>
<br>
“You’re correct. You wouldn’t have been summoned here otherwise. That box is big though...” Skarn’s eyelids lowered, narrowing his eyes into thin slashes. “Suspiciously big. What are you really hiding in there?” He casually marched over to it, prepared to fling off the lid. “I hope you don’t mind me taking a look.”<br>
<br>
“That’s enough, Skarn! If there are any trustworthy people left in this world they are Hamotsfu Priests. You’re making them feel threatened. I need to get healed by any means possible, and at this rate that’ll never happen!” Shouted an agitated High Decka Dalfoy. She continued on, her voice meekly scraping off, “Let them in, no more questions.” <br>
<br>
“I understand your concerns in times like this, but I assure you, we are here for the best,” said Reverend Leopon in a soft, compassionate tone. The three others and he lifted up the chest again, barging into the room with it. “You see, there are a variety of diseases and afflictions which all need to be handled differently. We took every precaution and brought all the necessary tools that we might need. The Power of Sanct is a strange thing, and sometimes needs ingredients and other objects of power to make it work. But not to worry, we have a little of everything here. We’ll have her remedied and in full health within a week’s time at most.” The man smiled benevolently; the baby fat retained in his cheeks squishing together from the force of his grin. “Now, I must ask that everyone leave the room. We need utmost silence and concentration to complete our work.”<br>
<br>
The tumlander didn’t budge, in fact, he hadn’t moved a muscle the whole time. None of them made an attempt to reach the door. Not even John or Millage. Heckens scrupulously eyed the box, concluding that it was large enough to house several people inside. And another thing...he had a question of his own to ask. “You claim to be Hamotsfu Priests, well then, where are your female counterparts? It is to my understanding that the Power of Sanct does not work to its fullest extent unless there is a female and male unifying their strengths.”<br>
<br>
“A well-placed question. You must know by now that the Achromatic Plague is sweeping across the lands, so we need the majority of our healing strength to remain in the ziggurats. Due to an imbalance in the number of male and female priests, we could not spare any females. Basically, we are reserves,” instructively replied the priest. He walked over to the side of the bed, examining the High Decka’s current state.<br>
<br>
It was all very dubious. Heckens wanted to trust these men, but he was unable to force himself to do so. “So you’re saying a High Decka’s life isn’t important enough to send out the best that you have? I find that hard to swallow.” He could probably debate with this priest all day, and it wouldn’t gain him much overall. He had always felt that lying was a virtue every priest had to be well versed in. There were some who spoke truth, but they were like a white sheep amidst a flock of black ones.<br>
<br>
Reverend Leopon, turning his face away from the sick girl, was now noticeably irritated. “Did you ever think that Hamotsfu Priests treat all life equally? We don’t show favoritism even among humans, draconeers, and gridikkors. We will always respect and hold true to the fact that no form of life is greater than another. Now, will you please leave? Or do you plan on being the death of this girl?” Heckens decided it would be best to let things go, after all, even if they did try something they wouldn’t get far, with all the castle guards around them.<br>
<br>
The High Decka was very inflamed by the lack of compliance. “Everyone get out now! And that includes you too, Gunro and John.” Heckens watched the dwarf wave goodbye, then waddle his way out of the room. Gunro rose from his chair slow and deliberately, unsheathing his massive sword, Zealheinder, as he did so. Holding the blade out with one hand, he menacingly pointed it directly at Reverend Leopon. Reflections from the fireplace washed up and down its length, granting it a hellish glow. An unspoken warning was passed between the two, then the big tumlander’s boots thudded across the tile floor toward the door. He had to stoop low so his bulky form could squeeze beneath the doorframe.<br>
<br>
“Don’t do anything foolish. You know where you are and whom you’re dealing with. We don’t take any form of treachery lightly, so watch yourselves.” Skarn’s cloak flourished about him as he turned and exited the room. <br>
<br>
Millage stroked the back of her slender hand across the High Decka’s thin cheek. “The priests will make you all better, then we can go on long walks like we used to.” She turned her head and wrathfully cringed at the priests. She whispered into the High Decka’s ear, “If they do anything suspicious don’t be afraid to scream out. We’ll hear you and come right away.”<br>
<br>
The High Decka looked away and shook her head. “I’m no longer an infant. I’ll be just fine, now leave us.” Heckens took that as his cue to leave as well, following just behind the serving maid. Closing the door behind them, they walked out into the hall, where Skarn and Gunro stood with backs leaning up against the wall. The tumlander was solemn and impassive like always, acknowledging no one around him. He had been withdrawn ever since the previous High Decka passed away.<br>
<br>
“Skarn, I don’t have a very good feeling about this. Reverend Leopon seemed sincere, but there was something about those others with him. I can’t really put it to words, but they didn’t seem like...um, well...priestly types.” The other priests hadn’t uttered a single word, and their expressions had held a chill bearing. Something was definitely unusual about them, but the High Decka’s wish to be rejuvenated from her enfeebled state had blinded her reason.<br>
<br>
“I feel the same, Heckens, but we can’t just disobey the High Decka’s orders. Perhaps we were a little wrong in our assumptions of those priests after all. We have enough enemies as it is, and I would hate to add Hamotsfu to the list.” Skarn swung his head back and croaked out a fit of clamorous laughter. “We’ve certainly become paranoid, haven’t we? I can’t believe we’re now accusing priests of ill deeds.”<br>
<br>
“Personally, I would rather be paranoid than dead,” replied Heckens nonchalantly. He looked around and saw that John was nowhere to be seen. The dwarf had likely gone off to do whatever it is dwarves do in their free time. Millage was a bit on edge, she incessantly tapped her foot while glancing around at tapestries that should be familiar to her by now<br>
<br>
After a long hour, that seemed to stretch out into a day, the door opened and Reverend Leopon’s chubby face popped out. Or was it Leopon? He appeared almost the same as Heckens had remembered him, only now his cheeks were more rounded off.<br>
<br>
“Please, come in. Our efforts were successful, but make sure you remain quiet because the High Decka is soundly resting.” The man’s voice was different too, it had become more coarse and scratchy. Almost in response to Heckens’ thoughts, the priest cleared his throat. He now spoke in the pacifistic tone he had used before. “She must be allowed to sleep for at least six hours. Do not try and wake her before then, for if you do, it will cause all our work to be for naught. Sleep will restore her back to good health.” The three men and he went to pick up the massive crate. “We will return tomorrow to see how she’s doing, so disturb her as little as possible until then.” As they steadfastly walked out the door, Leopon turned and bowed his head to them. “May Hamotsfu always shed his grace upon you.” <br>
<br>
Unless Heckens’ memory lied to him, as it seldom did, another unfamiliar face had taken the place of one of the previous three carriers. He only resorted himself to watching them leave though. He turned toward the High Decka’s bed, and wouldn’t have been at all surprised to see her missing, but she was still there, buried beneath a mound of blankets and pillows, only her head and scattered tendrils of black hair visible. <br>
<br>
The tumlander took a seat back in his chair and resumed brooding. Millage went to the High Decka’s bedside out of habit, but she made no attempt to pester the sleeping girl. Skarn investigated the room thoroughly for a few moments, then took up position against a wall, yawning to himself.<br>
<br>
After a long while, Skarn spoke up. Boredom flowed freely from his voice, “It looks like they did their job, so we might as well go about our daily business. We can come back and check on her later.” The man went for the door again. Heckens decided to do the same. There was no use sitting around here while there was other work to be done. <br>
<br>
The room suddenly darkened as the tumlander stood up and plodded toward the window, his overbearing frame blocking out half of the sunlight seeping in. He stared out into the winter decorated courtyard for a brief time, then his dark eyes went wide, becoming huge black moons of astonishment. Heckens had a difficult time keeping up with the big man’s fluid movement, but he suddenly turned around, and swept a massive hand over the High Decka’s bed, throwing off all the blankets and pillows piled on top of her. What lay beneath was shocking.<br>
<br>
“Skarn! Get back in here! We’ve been had.” Shouted Heckens, still somewhat in disbelief. It wasn’t a huge surprise. He had suspected the priests of something all along, but why did they do it like this? Skarn came barreling back in, muttering a few curses as he saw what had happened. The High Decka had been replaced with some kind of replica; a human-sized doll that resembled the High Decka to near perfection. It didn’t take long for Skarn and Heckens to draw their conclusions. The four priests must have switched this with the real High Decka, and were now carrying her out of the castle in that crate full of surprises. <br>
<br>
Millage stood in muddled stasis for a long interval, her face drowned in a bedazzled expression. Suddenly, shattered glass rang out as Gunro dove shoulder-first through the window. Shards of it stained with the tumlander’s blood bounced to the floor, breaking off into even smaller pieces. The tumlander unfalteringly dashed off through the snow, as if the glass slicing into him had been merely a pinch.<br>
<br>
“What’s he doing!?” Skarn gave no time for a reply though. “We have to catch those priests before they escape the castle! Come on, let’s go.” Heckens gathered up his advisor robes then dashed out into hall, trailing behind Skarn. Guards lined along the corridor turned their heads, either from the sound of Gunro breaking through the window, or their two superiors rushing out in a frenzy. Skarn began pointing and shouting orders, “You and you, come with me! You others, go to the western wing and put everyone else on full alert. The rest of you, block off the eastern wing and don’t let anyone through without questioning.” The guards began jostling to do as told, unaware of whom their enemy was. Skarn almost forgot to add, “It’s the priests. Stop the priests!”<br>
<br>
As they hustled down several other corridors, more guards fell in behind them, clanking in a disorganized symphony of armored boots. Bastard swords were now drawn and held at a ready position in front of them. Their shoulders and hips swayed with each step, now in a more synchronized manner. Their young faces were calm and impartial, showing no sign of any distress they might be feeling. <br>
<br>
It was not long until Heckens and Skarn and their convoy came upon the Hamotsfu Priests, somewhere beyond the Chamber of Ancestors. The throng of them came to a clanking halt, raising their blades into striking position as they did so. The priests stopped dead in their tracks, dropping their crate to the ground with a reverberating thud. Revered Leopon turned around, fearlessly gazing at the column of armed soldiers poised to cut him down. “Is something amiss?” The mockery in his voice was apparent.<br>
<br>
“Damn right there is! Now open that box and give the High Decka back to us immediately.” Skarn drew his short sword, spinning it with a twirl of the wrist, testing its weight. “We’re waiting.” Heckens had no weapon, but there were plenty of soldiers around him, so he wasn’t worried. It was strange that the priests didn’t look the slightest bit uneasy, despite the swords that could be shoved down their throats in the next moment. <br>
<br>
“As you command,” said Leopon in a seemingly interminable tone. The four priests knelt down, lifting off the lid. Everything happened so quickly afterwards that Heckens had no time to see what was inside. Almost as soon as the covering came off, a barrage of shining objects spun through the air, slicing into the forefront guards. One blocky-shouldered guard went rigid as a board, then spun around to face his comrades, a dagger hilt stuck between his eyes, which were now milky white marbles rolled into the back of his head. He sank to the ground, convulsing and twitching from the scattered commands of dying nerves.<br>
<br>
“Kill them all!” Shouted Skarn with disdain. He waved his short sword, and more guards marched forward to take the place of the fallen. It was a narrow corridor, allowing only four to pass through it abreast at one time. The daggers hidden inside the box were obviously limited, because now the four priests hunched low and stalked forward, steel points glistening in their fists. It was total madness to Heckens. Hamotsfu priests that were weapon masters? He couldn’t believe it even if he wanted to. <br>
<br>
“No! Don’t kill them all!” Exclaimed Heckens, wanting to discover who sent these assassins–– or whatever they were. “Save one for questioning.” Maybe he wouldn’t have to worry about it. The priests might actually kill them!<br>
<br>
Revered Leopon slunk his way forward, bouncing a curved dagger from hand to hand. The first guard to engage him, an older man with a long black beard and mustachios, charged forth while emitting a timorous shout. He thrust his blade forward like a pike, but missed Leopon entirely. The reverend danced aside then stuck out his foot, tripping up the guard with the force of his own momentum. The guard tumbled face forward, but before he could hit the ground, Leopon’s dagger rose up to meet him, plunging through thick leather and mail with a satisfying grate and squeal. The guard coughed and gurgled, drowning in the well of blood now swelling up in his throat. He fell with an immutable clangor, rolling out onto the floor as the dagger was withdrawn from his chest. The man’s beard and mustachios were now caked in red, and he showed no sign of standing back up.<br>
<br>
Leopon’s face remained a neutral veneer; the face of a cunning killer that refuses to die, even when cornered and outnumbered. The three priests and he stole their way forward, walking like common street thugs prepared to clash with an opposing gang. The younger and bolder guards, beating the thick of their blades against their palms, rushed forward to meet them. The results were devastating. Streamers of blood showered out amidst the screaming of blades and pained groans. The snow owl tapestries soaked up the nearby carnage, slowly growing from cloud white to deep red with each dagger and sword stroke. When it was all done: one priest lay dead, another’s arm dangled loosely on threads of sinew, and another clutched at a crimson puddle growing on his side, but Leopon remained unscathed. The guards were hewed to shreds, faces turned to scarlet ribbons, and bodies filled with the kiss marks of daggers. <br>
<br>
Heckens and Skarn only sat back and watched with increasing trepidation. They had a few more waves of guards left to send, but still, they shouldn’t have suffered this many casualties. Heckens had never seen a man take such a powerful blow and remain standing, like the priest with his arm falling off.<br>
<br>
But the priests were out of luck. While they were busy fighting the guards in front of them, another squadron of guards, drawn by the sound of commotion, came charging down the corridor behind them. They rushed forward and repeatedly hacked through the priests with sweeping strokes; blades cutting through flesh like lumber axes rising and falling to split blocks of wood.<br>
<br>
Heckens pointed at Leopon, shouting above the scuffle of boots and swords, “Save him for interrogation!” The guards encircled the reverend, blades lowered and ready to find their mark should he attempt one false action.<br>
<br>
“Drop your weapon!” Commanded the rough voice of a high ranking guard. The reverend didn’t comply though. His dagger was held motionless near his hip. He bore a smug grin on his face–– a cat-like smirk!––then lifted his dagger. He placed the blade end against his own throat, then fluidly ran it across his windpipe. Moments later he was on the ground lifeless, a sluice of blood pumping out of his self-inflicted wound.<br>
<br>
There was nothing Heckens could really say or do, except cast a gape-jaw stare. Soon after, a few guards dragged the bodies off to the morgue, while Heckens and Skarn stayed behind to investigate the box. The real Reverend Leopon was stuffed inside, deader than a worm in a desert. His neck looked like it had been broken by one quick snap. The Reverend Leopon that had just killed himself, prior to, must have been impersonating him to avoid suspicion. So maybe the fake Reverend Leopon had been hiding in the box all along, then came out after the door to the High Decka’s room was closed. They must have sedated the High Decka somehow, then murdered the real Leopon, and then allowed the fraudulent one to come out. But why? The two of them must have been related somehow, how else would they look so much alike?<br>
<br>
There were more mysteries than could be solved, with the biggest one being the High Decka’s disappearance. She was not in the box, as they had suspected all along. But surprisingly the sword, Cloudsunder, was in the crate. It must have been swapped with some kind of replica. All of it was very suspicious. Whoever had sent these people must have had some higher up connections within Castle Hallgron.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
“Feels good to finally be out of that box, eh? I bet it was a tight fit in there the whole ride.” Darm took a deep inhale of winter’s fresh breath. “Not to mention stuffy.” Crystalline tears of winter cartwheeled down from the sky all around him, piling up onto the already thick blanket of snow beneath his boots. The sun was a weakly burning torch behind a mist of gray clouds, with patches of blue stitched into them between scarce intervals.<br>
<br>
 The two companions trudged across a field of snow, huffing out laboriously as they did so. A box was being lugged between the two of them. It was not as big as the one in the castle, but almost.<br>
<br>
“Glamisorean guards have to be the dumbest lot we’ve ever dealt with. I still can’t believe we got past all the ones at the western gate. They didn’t even so much as suspect us. ‘Yes, there were four of us, but two stayed behind in case the High Decka’s condition should take a drastic fall.’ Ha! They bought into it all like beggars in a flee market.” Garrid was blatantly smug about the plan working perfectly. He gestured toward the box with his forehead, “Now we just have to drop her off near the river, and a ferryman will come along and collect her. How quaint. Though I would rather hold her for a ransom, but I’m not one to disobey orders.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, she would fetch us a hefty sum.” Darm readjusted his grip on the edge of the container. “I’m glad she’s lightweight. We’ll be able to cover ground fairly quick at this rate.” The smoke rising up from Hallgron was becoming more and more distant, and the naked trees of a forest just ahead were growing closer. “We should be in the clear once we make it into there.”<br>
<br>
A distant rumbling drummed in Darm’s ear. It was so dim of a sound that it almost didn’t exist. “Pursuing horsemen?” He and Garrid simultaneously glanced over their shoulders. They were taken aback at what they saw. A single man, galloping like a black stallion, was knifing his way through the snow, heading straight for them. “Hm, I would have to say it’s that tumlander.”<br>
<br>
“Tumlander?” inquired Garrid.<br>
<br>
“Yes. A big oafish man, with more muscle than a grizzly bear. He was in the room for a little while, watching over the High Decka, and I’m sure he’s very pissed off by now. He must have caught on to our little scheme.” The two of them hoisted up the crate once again. “Let’s go, double time!”<br>
<br>
Upon lifting the crate, the two of them tore their way through the snow as fast as their legs could carry them, but the tumlander noticed they had spotted him, and quickened his own strides in response. He was gaining on them with the speed a hare gains on a fleeing tortoise. They didn’t have the time or desire to handle the box gently as they ran, and could hear the High Decka bouncing around like a rag doll inside. A shower of snow and slush was kicked up behind the advancing tumlander, like a wake of waves trailing behind a speeding boat.<br>
<br>
The tumlander must have been half ox, because he seemed not to tire, while the two priests began to run doggedly, choking to take in more mouthfuls of the stinging cold air. By now they realized evasion was hopeless. The tumlander was not about to give up on his query, even if they did make it into the woods. It was fight or flee, and they chose fight. Dropping the box for the last time, they slid off the lid. Inside were a few daggers sheathed in pouches, some of them empty, where the other priests had taken and placed them within their own box. Darm and Garrid each armed themselves with two; one for throwing and one for melee combat. They stood patiently, reining their lungs into slower respiration as they waited.<br>
<br>
They didn’t have to wait long. Each of them tensed their muscles and clutched their daggers tight. Darm briefly whispered, “For Dark Mother.”<br>
<br>
*****<br>
Gunro squeezed the hilt of Zealheinder with both hands, then lifted it up to shoulder height, holding it out like a knight holds a jousting lance. In a voice that could crumble mountains and make seas quiver, he shouted, “Dalfoy! I’m coming!”<br>
<br>
In response to his volcanic cry, the two men just ahead nearly toppled over clutching their ringing ears. Nothing wrong with that. Gunro continued gliding across the snow, his long black hair dancing out behind him.<br>
<br>
One of the kidnappers regained his posture, then pulled his left arm back, revealing a twinkle of steel in his hand. “Lady Death take you!” He shouted with scorn. The dagger whistled forward, tumbling hilt over blade through the air, but it never so much as scratched flesh. With skill and dexterity acquired only by training for years under a tumland master-at-arms, Gunro batted the projectile away with the broadside of his sword. Another dagger flew forward, but it met a similar fate. <br>
<br>
“You come in from his left and I’ll come in from his right,” sputtered the tall wiry-looking man to the shorter one. But they never had enough time to position themselves. Gunro took a mighty leap forward, like a great stallion leaping across a river. Zealheinder was pulled back, and came crashing down with the force of an avalanche. The first man was taken completely by surprise. He only managed out a pained, “Aaaaaaurg...” as he was clove open from head to groin. Gunro’s massive blade slashed straight down through each one of his vertebrae, shattering them like a stack of boards being split down the middle by a chop of the hand. The man’s eyes became deathly wide, capturing his last emotion of fear and holding it there forever. With a grievous red slit torn down his middle, he fell back onto a cushion of snow. The white fluff he landed in drank up his blood like a sponge.<br>
<br>
The other man was more cautious, strafing from side to side, looking for an opening to place his dagger in. Gunro feigned a thrust off to the side, and surely enough, the smaller man lunged forward like a wolf. With surprising grace, the big tumlander stepped aside, avoiding a fatal blow meant for his heart. He fired out his massive hand, and caught his assailant by the wrist. The man dropped the dagger and shrieked in agony as his wrist was slowly crumpled up into a pulp of mashed bone and blood.  The tumlander lifted him from the ground, then spun his elbow behind him, bending his arm in ways it was not meant to be bended. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Who sent you?” The tumlander quietly asked. The man squirmed and struggled, but it just proved to be more painful in the end, since Gunro applied more pressure to hold him steady.<br>
<br>
The man cackled defiantly. “I’ll never talk, and I’ll do this to ensure it.” He opened his mouth wide then chomped down on his own tongue, biting it clean off. The vexed tumlander shoved him into the snow. The man was bleeding profusely, coating red himself and everything around him. Gunro only shook his head dispassionately and raised his sword once again. Zealheinder swooped in for the kill, the broadside of it careening off the man’s skull, flattening it like a lump of clay on an anvil, splattering brains out from the ear opposite of the blow.  All the spilled blood in the surrounding snow began to steam.<br>
<br>
Gunro spent no more precious time. He spun away from the gruesome battle scene and ran to the High Decka’s rescue.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
It was not until later that day, when Gunro returned with the High Decka in his arms, that things slightly began to make sense. Heckens could not understand the purpose of the attack. It had been relatively obvious that something had been awry all along. The priests all had medallions, proving that they were Hamotsfu Priests, but when given an autopsy tattoos denoting them as members of the Secret School were found. The Secret School was a branch of the Fundament’s military. But what was the Fundament doing sending in these assassins? Maybe Glamisoreat North was meant to believe they were Fundament soldiers?<br>
<br>
Heckens recollected all his knowledge on the matter. Four men came in with a box, but within that box was a slightly smaller box: holding three other men, a replica of the High Decka, and a replica of Cloudsunder. While the guards were changing posts, two men had exited through the window of the High Decka’s bedroom, with the smaller crate containing the High Decka, and while that was happening, the other four tried to leave via indoor route, carrying Cloudsunder and the dead body of Reverend Leopon with them. So maybe one group was serving as a diversion for the other? Or maybe they had done it that way to ensure they made it out with something? Guesses and assumptions were all that Heckens could come up with.<br>
