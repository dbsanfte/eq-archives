Sooo, I guess I'll follow cracten's example and post, and then post more as replies.  <br>
<br>
For the story itself, I'm dissapointed in it overall.  The first sixty pages are shoddy.  This is partially due to the fact that the first thirty were written atleast two years ago if not more.  Well, saying that, this is chapters one through eight.  One through seven have already been posted on this site and the last, but there so far back, or not here at all, that I deemed it necessary to post all for the new readers.  Well, saying that, there will be only one more chapter, and a short one at that.  At this time, I have no intentions of a sequal, but a spin off, maybe, but doubtful.  Well, without further aeduie, i know, i know, I butchered the word, but NOW, without further adeui(I think thats it), here it is.The light provided by the torches barely lit the halls.  With a word of magic, the staff carried by the traveler erupted in an eerie blue light.  The walls of the caves were covered with hundreds of years of dried blood.  As he began his trek down into the depths of the warrens, six kobolds charged him.  Gerald thumped the butt of his staff on the ground, spoke a few words of magic, and began to glow a red akin to that of flames.  When the kobolds struck him, they each flinched in pain as small bolts of fire sprang from his skin and landed on their own.  With a dagger he kept concealed in his boot, Gerald sank five inches of cold steel into the head of a nearby Kobold.  It crumpled to the ground, lying beside four of its companions.  The sixth had fled in fear; Gerald shrugged and continued down.  He came to a split in the cave.  While rolling his eyes up into his head, Gerald spoke the words to a search spell, and continued in that direction the spell pointed him, down into the near black cavern.  As he pushed deeper into the Warrens, he came upon two suprisingly large kobolds.  They both charged Gerald whose hands began to glow with a neon green light.  The light dissipated and the kobolds seemed to recoil. They slowed in their charge, and began to crumple to the ground.  Their eyes rolled up in their heads, and their forms became still.  He had cast a fast acting darkness spell upon the creatures.  A half smile crept up on Gerald, but he quickly repressed the feeling of pleasure.  A crude door hung on a single hinge on the left of the tunnel, again Gerald cast the spell of searching, and passed through the door way.  The room would have been as black as pitch had it not been for the light from his staff.  He proceeded down a set of uneven wooded stairs and took a left.  As he continued down the corridor, the magus was attacked by yet another cluster of kobolds.  Gerald rammed the bone ferule of his staff into the inner thigh of the front most dog.  As it began to collapse, he brought the other end of the staff over whacking the second kobold on the head.  The force up the blow shattered the poor creature’s skull.  The third carried a large staff with a blade attacked at the end.  It flashed a toothy grin as it brought the weapon down on Gerald’s head.  The grin quickly turned into a look of horror as the weapon was deflected off of Gerald’s cap.  Gerald spun, swinging his staff, raking it across the thing’s chest.  It left a glowing red line. Within seconds, the thing blew up.  “Kobold crunchies”  To his right and left were two cells, filled with Erudites and a few Kerrans.  A voice came from the crowds, “Ger?” <br>
“Rillen!” shouted Gerald.  “Why are you here Rillen?  You are not so weak to be subjected to Kobolds are you?”<br>
“You are right about that Ger, the kobolds do not keep me captured.  I have come here to study, the Kerrans here have great knowledge on enhancements of incendiary spells.  Why did you come here Gerald?”<br>
“Why, to see you my brother.  It has been years since last your blessed me with your presence.  Ever since father kicked you out……”<br>
“Gerald, I know you to well, you did not come to just see me.  You are consumed with Necromancy and you leave no room for emotions such as love and concern.  One day you will awake and find that you yourself have withered away to bone, and all you will do will shrug.  I know you did NOT come here to see me, and we all know father did not kick me out, I left on my own accord.  Wizardry is not accepted by those of Paineel.  I tried as you know very well, but I couldn’t even conjure a simple undead servant.  So, again I ask, why did you come, do you need my assistance?  Translocation, Evocation? What is it you need?” Snapped Rillen.<br>
“You see through me to well brother.  I need you to………….”<br>
A large rumble echoed throughout the dark caverns.<br>
“What was that?” asked Gerald.  “It’s the kobolds, they’re coming for us, I shall prepare.”  Closing his eyes and raising his scepter, Rillen chanter words that even Gerald could not decipher.  Red, blue, and green lights poured out of the crystal on the end of the staff.  The lights formed a shield around the brothers, who both saw the waves of kobolds coming through the tunnel. <br>
“I’m going to be casting a very complex spell Gerald, I need you to get all the kobolds near me, but they cant interrupt the spell.” Shouted Rillen above the rumbling.  “Will do” replied Gerald.  Gerald threw a few bone fragments down on the ground and chanted the words to a conjuration. Within seconds a skeletal guardian had appeared, was standing at attention.  The first wave of kobolds came, they charged Rillen, who at the moment was safe due to his spell.  The second wave came, and soon there were hundreds of kobolds around him.  Gerald was doing his best to slay them, but they were just too quick.  Rillen finished the proper words and hand gestures for the spell, super nova.  Pure magical force erupted from his body, every kobold fell to the waves of force.  The force knocked the door to the cells completely off their hinges.  The purplish blood of the kobolds splattered everywhere, adding to what was already there.  Rillen slumped, but refused to fall.  He smiled.  “Where did you get such power Rillen, when you left seventeen years ago you were but a novice, some of the most basic spells were too difficult for you!”  <br>
“That was but a mere sampling of my power brother, I have learned much during my journeys throughout the world.  I assume your own power has grown quite much, the masters always thought of you as a very promising necromancer.”  One of the kobold corpses twitched, Rillen extended a hand, spoke a word, incendium, and the body exploded. “Where were we?  Ahh yes, what is it you have come to me for?”<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I need you to assist me in gather reagents for a spell brother.”<br>
“What spell do you seek to cast that would require reagents so difficult to obtain that you would need assistance?”<br>
“The spell I am seeking to cast will prolong my life by thousands of years.  It does not provide immortality, but it will extend my years beyond those of any race!  If you assist me, I will share my knowledge with you, we together can be the masters of Norath.” shouted Gerald.<br>
“I can not help you Gerald, my master once sought to do as much, and that is why I no longer stand by his side.  It is not right.”  With that, Rillen cast a spell of teleportation, which quickly brought him back to his own study.  <br>
“Damn that brother of mine, damn him!” shouted Gerald.  At least this trip will not be utterly useless he thought to himself as he turned to the erudite and kerran slaves.  “Your ends shall be quick” he told the slaves curtly.  He ruthlessly sent his skeleton into the cells to slay all the people.  With a crooked smile on his lips, he left the Warrens for the black marble of Paineel.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  “You know they need you Rill, Paren, Forna, Hoku, and Bren have already left.  Our friends need us.” Said Ulla in a pleading voice. <br>
 “I know my love, its just………, I’m  not sure.” Replied an uneasy Rillen.    <br>
“You know I will go with, or without you.  We need to help them.  And it will be good to see our friends, it’s been months since we’ve seen them”<br>
“I know all that, its just I don’t want to cause any more to die, I don’t want you to die, I don’t want our friends to die.”<br>
“Just because you don’t witness the deaths doesn’t mean they don’t happen Rillen Tarrant, Master of Wizards, the leader of the crimson hands, master evoker!”  Blue and Purple flashed surrounded the two, who within seconds materialized in the dreadlands.<br>
“Are you happy Ulla! We are going to Firiona Vie, we will help, I do this for you and the love that we share.” Shouted an angry Rillen, who in a more calm voice stated, “It will be good to see our friends, even during this time of war.”  The wizard and magician lovers set out for the trek to the elven outpost a few hours away.  The land was void of all the life that usually congregates here.  <br>
“Sathir must be amassing quite an army to have all the giants, drachnids, and drolvargs gone, the fight shall be difficult Rillen, but we will prevail as we always have.”<br>
“Ulla, if the fight becomes futile, I will take us and our friends out, I will not allow any of us the die.  I care to much for you and our friends.”<br>
“Stop being such a pessimist Rill.”  No words were spoken between the two for many hours.  The deathly quite of the dreadlands only emphasized the silence between the two.  They soon passed Karnors castle, the vacant home of Venril Sathir and approached the tunnels leading to the elven outpost.  <br>
“I hear the sound of war Ulla, I shall cloak our presence for the time being.”  With a jerk of his hand, Rillen encompassed him and his lover with his runed cloak.  When the cloak fell back in place, it disappeared, as did the two erudites.  They traveled through the caves leading to Firiona vie.  Through five hours of searching, they finally exited the caves and found themselves staring at a giant fort swarming with elves, dwarves, and a smattering of gnomes.  All were dressed for war.  With a word, Rillen raised his wife and himself high into the air.  They embraced, and kissed for three long minutes before they walked the distance to the keep.   <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How good it is to see you all!” exclaimed Ulla and Rillen at the same time.  The six companions all erupted in laughter.  Paren the boisterous bard, Hoku (Hokulani) the stolid enchantress, Forna the kind, serious, and furious monk, Bren the reliable cleric, Ulla the loving magician, and Rillen the wizard, the leader of the group, all reunited again.  The four erudites, Rillen, Ulla, Hoku, and Bren had all grown together, fighting in the toxullia forest.  Ulla and Hoku were sisters.  Paren and Forna had also befriended each other in their home town of Qeynos.  When they heard of the kobold invasion of the Toxullia forest, the rushed to assist their erudic cousins.  The six met at the entrance to the warrens, both groups planning to slay the canine beasts.  Coming to the conclusion that six was better than two or four, the band quickly vanquished many beasts.  Friendship was borne of the blood that flowed freely from the kobolds that day.  The six became as close as friends could possibly become, and rarely were seen outside the company of one another.  Rillen was silently proclaimed leader by all for his quick decisions and careful thought.  They all flourished under his leadership, and went on to become famous to all throughout Antonica.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So how have you four been? Both me and Ulla have missed you all greatly.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We are pretty much the same as always, as soon as you two left, we heard the call for people to come here to rally against the armies of Venril Sathir.  He has brought the Frogloks of kunark, the drolvargs, the drachnids, and the giants under his control and is seeking to drive out the threat that is Firiona Vie.(end chapter one)  I’m glad you came, your presence alone may change the war Rill.” Replied Paren who had his arm around Hoku’s waist, hugging her tightly to his side.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rillen and Ulla, you both must come with me, the elven Clerics and Wizards have erected a shield.  Every wizard(ess), enchanter(ntress), mage, cleric, druid, and shaman has added their strength to the shield, you must do the same.  So far the shield has kept us from the magics of the frogloks and Venril, but we all know it can not hold forever and that the battle will be soon.” Stated a serious Hoku.  Turning around, she led the group through several corridors.  They entered a large room with a glass orb in the center.  “Now, both of you place your hands on the orb.  It helps to close your eyes.  You should be feeling a pulling force from to orb, don’t resist it.  Let the orb take your energy, let it enter you and pull out your energy.” Commanded Hoku.  Both Rillen and Ulla looked pail, and more fragile than they normally are.  “It is done, I’m sorry you had to go through that, but it is necessary for the survival of us all, your power alone Rillen can keep the shield up for many more hours” she stated.  <br>
“Anything we can do Hoku, we will.  Any idea when Venril will unleash all his forces and charge?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There really isn’t anything we can do, and we have no idea when Venril will attack. We can only wait.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well!, anyone have a hankering for some fine elven wine and ale? I’m parched and this heat is practically unbearable under all armor”  stated Paren.  Five yes’s echoed throughout the halls.  <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Personally I find this inn to be the best here.  The ale isn’t very strong, but the food is good, as are the waitresses hehe.”  Hokulani punched Paren in the side.  Ulla and Rillen exchanged knowing glances, they were both thinking, Hoku and Paren?  Paren shouted to one of the bar maids, “Hey, Cinny, bring six mugs and a pitcher over here”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey Par, you have friends tonight? If there anything like you, Derik will have to close the inn hehehe.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Always the comedian Cinny, I’d like you to meet my friends, Hokulani, or Hoku, Rillen, Ulla, Forna, and Brenan or Bren.  Hey, where’s the pitcher? And can you get us some of Deriks fried tiger strips?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Pitchers coming right up and I’ll have Derik put some meat in the pan for you, it was nice meeting you all.”  In a minute, Cinna brought over the pitcher and then returned to the bar, where she returned to pouring mugs, taking orders, and running into the kitchen to pick up orders and tell new ones to Derik.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sooooo, what exactly DID you two do while you where away?”  Asked Bren.  Ulla and Rillen smiled at each other.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We went to the frozen continent of Velious to help the coldain with their war against the ice giants.  We met the dragons of velious, who were, at best apprehensive towards us, but they were willing to teach us some of their more umm creative spells.   Rillen went to visit the captive kerrans in the Warrens to see if they could teach him anything about their incendiary spells.  Oh, and we also got married.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You got married!” shouted Forna.  “I can’t say you didn’t catch me off guard with that one, I’m so happy for you!”  Everyone in the bar was now looking at her.  Luckily Cinna came to her rescue and ‘accidentally’ tipped a mug of ale over onto the floor where the mug shattered.  The noise quickly broke the tension in the room and everything returned to normal.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, we got married.” Ulla then squeezed her husband closer to her side with her arm.  “The fried tigers here, hello again Cinna.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hi all, here’s your fried tiger strips, Derik ran out of curry so there not up to par, no trading ships are willing to come here due to the war.”  She bowed her head at the mention of the upcoming battle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Have a seat Cinny, I don’t think the men at the bar need you any longer, I’d love it if you’d join us.” Asked Paren.  They all looked towards the bar and saw that four of the five men had passed out and the fifth was deeply involved in a conversation with a napkin.  As they looked around the rest of the area, they noticed that the rest of the customers had left already.     <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’d love to, but Derik really needs help in the back cleaning up, most of his maids and cooks left for Faydwer when they heard work of the war.  It was nice seeing you again Paren, good bye.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Bye Cinny!”  Paren said as he pinched her bottom.  Hokulani glared at Paren for the next five minutes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about a song for us Paren? I could sure use an uplifting tune.” &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why not, anyone have any requests?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about the one you’ve been writing, you know the one I’m taking about Par, I think its just what we all need.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s not finished yet Hoku my dear, cmon, how bout a nice denon, or jonathan, they were both much better composers than I.”  All five shouted, “NO DENON’S!!!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You remember what happened that summer in Highpass, the guard incident.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok Hoku pass me my lute, I shall play a song, that contains no lyrics that I have been working on.”  He whispered a second later ‘for you my dear’ in Hoku’s ear.  He played for about fifteen minutes and at the end, Rillen exclaimed, “well, I think your song has had a rejuvenating affect on me, I feel as if I have just slept for hours!, maybe you don’t have it in you  to write words, something I still don’t believe, but you sure can compose.  Your skills as a musician have also drastically increased since those few months since we parted.  Paren, do you think Cinna can get us a room here?”  “I have already made the arrangements, you and Ulla are in room 7, here’s the key, and don’t mind about the money, I made a small fortune playing here for the patrons.  Bren and Forna are in 5, and me and Hoku are in 6.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, I guess its time to hit the hay, although I am not really drained, I do feel a tad drowsy tired.”<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So, who’s this Cinna Paren!  I thought we were…. Who is she and what’s your connection with her!”  Hoku then proceded to close her eyes, and then open them.  Her eyes now glowed with a almost metallic purple light.  Pillows and sheets began to fly at Paren. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “OWWEEEEE! Shes JUST a friend Hoku, how many times do I have to tell you.  Her parents were both rangers, they were sent to scout out Sathirs army, they never returned.  Cinny could use some nice people in her life, I just like to be kind.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh Paren, I do love you with all my heart”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And I you my enchantress.”<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wake up, Wake up!!!!” shouted Bren.  “Sathir has sent in his drachnid troops and a few frogloks.  It looks like there all charging! I think he wants to shatter the shield with them, so then his drolvargs, giants, and the majority of the frogloks can slay us.”  With a strum of his lute, Paren teleported the group the short distance to the walls.  The drachnids had yet to attack, but they were all massed a few thousand yards away.  “I guess its time to prepare.”  Brenan murmured a few words to one of the gods of healing which caused the group to be shrouded in a purple mist that soon grasped on to the young warriors.  It became like a second skin.  “A new spell of my own creation, holy mist.”       <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, guess its my turn.” Stated Hoku.  With arms spread out wide, eyes closed, she whispered a few words.  She raised her arms, and from her hands sprouted a cloud.  It expanded above the group and then fell upon them.  “Well, that’s half of it, heres the rest.”  With her hands clasped, and eyes glowing yellow, she spoke five words very sternly.  Yellow sparks appeared in front of them all, and flew into them.  “There’s the rest.” Said a slumping Hoku.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The dragons taught me a spell that I think you shall all find quite interesting.  It wasn’t very efficient before, inferno shield, but the dragons have developed a way of making the flaming effects last for many hours.  We must all clasp hands for it to work fully.”  The six all grasped each others wrists.  Ulla unclasped hers for a second to grab a jewel hidden within her robes.  “This gem allows me to cast the spell without any ill effects on myself.”  With a quick hand gesture, the jewel flew to the center of the circle.  Ulla grabbed her husbands wrist.  The now flaming gem released six sparks which went into each of the friends.  The gem then returned to its place resting on ulla’s chest.  She smiled.  “There we go.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, I guess that’s it, me Forn and Paren can’t do much to help enhance the groups capabilities.  You three should rest, your spells must have drained you to some degree, Paren, think you can play a song to help my wife and our friends?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It would be my pleasure.  If you wish, you can assist me to some degree.  My lute makes the most efficient, but the addition of a drum to the song helps.  Just whack it, once every six seconds.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Will do Par.”  Paren put his hand behind his cloak, unhooked his drum from his belt, and tossed it to Rillen.  With his wand, he thumped the drum exactly every six seconds.  Paren played his song, and soon the six were in the best condition they had ever been in.  “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh” screamed Rillen.  He fell and started to twitch.  <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen looked around.  Where am I? What happened?  He appeared to be in a room made of pure white light.  A mysterious voice said in a booming monotone voice, “You are in your subconscious, an attack has been made through the ways on you.  I, or you if you will, called you here to defend yourself.”  “I don’t understand, who’s attacked me, what are ‘the ways’, why do I not feel pain from these attacks?”  “You do feel pain, but there are many yous.  As of now, you, the you I, or another one of you, is talking to, are the one in control.  Since you are not in your physical being the pain does not effect you, but it does affect your physical body.  The attacker has tried to infect you with some strange virus that you have no knowledge of.  So far, you have resisted, but you don’t know how long you can last without your conscious assistance.”  “What can I do, and again, what are the ways?”  “We don’t know what you can do nor do we know what the ways are.  If you yourself don’t know, how would it be possible for I, you yourself, to know?”  The light in the room began to fade, as did Rillen’s corporeal body.  “Our defenses are weakening, do what you can, for your own sake!”  He knelt down and placed his hands on the floor.  It appeared to be made of mist.  He sent a stream of fire mixed with magic into what he thought was his body to hopefully purge himself of the disease.  The magic to find the virus, the fire to destroy it.  “It’s working! Try harder!”  He put all his energy into his next burst of fire and magic.  “More, not all of it was destroyed!.”  “I have nothing left! Can’t you do anything?!” replied Rillen.  “I can do nothing.” It replied in an almost venomous voice.  The light in the room again faded.  “Then we are doomed.”  “I won’t except that!  There has to be……, the light, its getting brighter, fast!”  The light WAS getting brighter very quickily.    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rillen!!!”  screamed Ulla.  She ran to his side and cradled his head.  “It’s a seizure.”  Said a weeping Ulla.  Rillen’s body began to disappear.  Ulla summoned a bottle of water and some bandages.  She heated the water, drenched the bandage, and mopped her lover’s forehead.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do you mind if I cast a few minor spells on him Ulla, I think I can help.” Said Brenan.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Whatever you can do, please do, I can’t lose him, not again.” Pleaded Ulla.<br>
Bren knelt down beside his old friend and placed his hands upon his chest.  A blue light speckled with yellow encompassed Rillen who smiled and rose to a sitting position.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Someone attacked me through something called ‘the ways.’ My subconscious called me to defend myself.  I managed to fend off the attack for awhile, but I began to fail, without Bren’s help, I think I would have died.”  Ulla’s crying ceased for a second, and then continued, except now they were tears of joy. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I thought I had lost you again Rillen, I thought I had lost you forever.  Never leave me again, please never leave me again.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will never leave you as long as it is within my power my little Allu (It was customary for lovers of old to call their loved ones by their name in reverse.)”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, now that that’s over, anyone up for a drink, I brought a flask of some pretty strong stuff!” said Paren.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Paren your becoming an alcoholic, but I think I shall have a drink.  Think you can conjure me some Ulla, I don’t want to know what’s in that bottle of Paren’s.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sure Hoku, what do you want? The ice dwarves in velious taught me how to summon many different varieties.  They were all very eager to sample my produce hehe, I could have started a business.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Surprise me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ll have some of that special brew of yours Ulla, I could use a jolt.”  Said Rillen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Me and Forn will have some to if you have any left.” Stated Brenan.  With her eyes closed, Ulla place her hands palms up above her head, a tray with five goblets placed on it appeared on her slender hands.  She brought the tray down and said, “Each of you take a glass.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ll stick ta my flask hun, those glasses look a tad empty.”  Stated Paren.  “Guess I’ll have some then.”  She grabbed the last glass and in seconds, it filled to the brim with a think purplish liquid.  “Just think of a drink, and it’ll fill to the brim with it.  Bren, Hoku, and Forn, if you want to try my specialty, just ask and I’ll put a drop into your cups.  That’ll fill em up.”  All three agreed to try the heady red liquid.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That’s powerful stuff.” Coughed Forna.           <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Boom!  The drachnid and froglok casters had attacked.  The shield held up against their magics.  Rillen nodded to his friends, whoin turn nodded.  He then raised his scepter, and brought it down on the ground.  The six disappeared and rematerialized at the front lines of the troops of the elfs and their allies.  Rillen again raised his scepter and repeated the spell he had casted on himself and his brother back in the warrens.  A multicolored shield appeared around the group and then disappeared.  The six made a formation known to them over years of fighting.  Paren and Forna were up front with Rillen, Brenan, and Hoku behind them.  Ulla was a tad off the side due to the fact that her spells would not work with the physical interference of her friends.  The handful of froglok casters went back into the tunnels, the drachnids charged.  “It’s time.” Said Rillen quite coldly.  Ulla went into a deep trance and within about fifteen seconds, the air infront of her solidified and formed into the shape of an air elemental.  As soon as the drolvargs were within three hundred feet of the army, Ulla, Rillen, the elven and gnome wizards and magicians, and the archers all fired.  The first wave fell, but they kept charging.  They were almost at the front lines.  The elven troops let loose again, the last time they could before the drachnids would reach them.  Another wave fell, but the drachnids kept flowing.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seven particularly large drachnids charged the group.  “Hoku, ready?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yep Par.”  Hoku raised her hands spoke four sharp words, and then quickily lowered her hands.  The drachnids all stopped in their steps and their eyes glossed over.  “Let’s fly Hoku.” Said Rillen.  The two raised their hands and spoke seven spidery words.  The drolvargs flew up into the air and soon came crashing down.  Each curled into the position all dead spiders go into.  “There we go!” shouted a pleased Rillen.  “Next batch is up to you, me and Hoku need to rest for a bit, we wont be……….”  Before Rillen could finish his sentence, five more drachnids attacked.  Hoku rose and repeated the mesmeration spell she had cast earlier and then sat back down.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lets take the big one Forn.” Said Paren.  With his blade he put a notch in the lead spiders neck, with his dagger he opened a small hole in the creatures gut.  The drachnid was now free of Hoku’s spell.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We shall slaughter your filthy people!” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That’ll be the day.” Stated a laughing Forna.  The creatures raised its two front legs and lunged at Paren.  The attack would have hit him hadn’t Forna flying kicked the thing in the side.  Before she fell to the ground, she twisted in the air and kicked the thing in the head with her other foot.  It fell to the ground, twitching, and then went into the spider death position.  Paren sheathed his weapons and took out his horn.  He produced four notes.  From the end of the horn, a green mist emerged.  It crept into every crevice of the drachnids.  As the creatures awoke from their enduced sleep Paren quickily took out his lute, played three notes, and sang a few notes.  The drachnids nodded their grotesque heads and ceased their attack.  The five spidery…..things slowly crumpled to the ground.  Before they could die, four more drachnids attacked the group.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Attack the music man!” shouted a slight feminine spider.  “He’s the one killing our fellow soldiers.”  The four attacked Paren, one from the front, two from the sides, and the last from the back.  Realizing he was in trouble, Paren let out an almost bird like screech, which caused the four drachnids to run away from the group.  Unfortunately, since Paren had ceased his song of mezmeration, the other five drachnids had awoken and were trying to kill Brenan.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Heeeelllllllllllllppp!” screeched Bren.  One of the spiders bonked him on the head and he fell to the ground.  Ulla’s elemental did what he could to distract the spiders, but all its efforts were fruitless.  They all kicked him, and one sank its pointed leg tip between the side of his armor.  “Aaaaahhhhhhh!”  Hoku’s eyes flared open.  She mesmerized the five.  Within thirty seconds, they all died due to the affects of Parens poison mist spell mere minutes ago.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Paren, me, Ulla, Forn, and Hoku can handle the rest, please do what you can for Bren.” Pleaded Rillen.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Will do!”  As he strummed his lute to begin his healing arts, the four drachnids he had sent away returned with friends.  There were fifteen drachnids total, and Paren and Baren were out of commission.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Charge the encsslllllhantressssssssssss!  It is her who had slain many of our companions!” snarled the lead spidress.  Rillen’s hands became encompassed with numerous green bubbles.  Each bubble attached itself to a drachnid.  As soon as they did, the spiders slowed in their charge.  The lead spider noticed that Ulla was closer, and the group changed their direction.  With a motion of her hand, she rooted Ulla in place.  Hoku tried to mesmerize to spiders, but for some reason, it didn’t work.  Forna attacked the spider in the rear with a quick punch to the place were the human part of the creature meets the truly spider part.  Her jab had punctured the things think hide.  A dark purple, almost black blood sprayed Forna in the chest.  She threw something, apparently the heart of the creature she had just killed, at the next bug.  The back three turned around, and slowly made their way to the monk.  The other eleven had made their way to Ulla.  Her elemental had fallen quickly to the ravaging attacks of the spiders.  She was summoning acidic rain as quickly as possible, but she managed to only slay three.  The other eight had now surrounded her, and were about to kill her, but Rillen cast gravity flux, causing them all to fly up in the air.  When they fell, only two remained, the lead spider and what appeared to be her mate.  The female tore a chunk out of Ulla’s shoulder with her teeth, and the male slashed her robe with a dagger.  It tore the garment from the neck line down to her belt.  Her chest was exposed, and the male stared with eager eyes.  He raised the tip of his leg to her chest, and was about the thrust.  Hoku was busy assisting Forna with the two bugs attacking her.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen stood, watching the drachnid about to kill his wife.  “Alllluuuuuuuuuuu!”(end chapter two)  The drachnid had thrusted its leg tip into his wife’s chest, she had fallen to the ground.  With his arms raised, Rillen screamed.  His eyes became pure blood red.  His pupils and the whites of his eyes had disappeared.  His hair had flown up and was now engulfed in flames.  The ground beneath his feet began to melt, the air wavered and became unbearably hot.  White flames flared up at his feet, and began to move outwards.  “Dulak Minea Cerenui Saelifene Linisti Embire!” shouted a literally flaming Rillen.  The white flames turned red, and flared out to encompass the field of Firiona Vie.  The two drachnids who had slain his wife became ashes, as did all the drachnids who were touched by the flames.  Their short screams could be heard by all, until they became ashes.  Once the threat was gone, the flames quickly dissipated.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A cheer erupted from all the troops still living.  Rillen fell to the ground in exhaustion.  Paren, the revived Bren, Hoku, and Forna rushed to the couple’s limp bodies.  His hair and eyes had returned to their normal state and he was breathing steadily.  Ulla arose and saw her fallen husband.  With tears flying, she raced towards him.  “Heal him Bren, please heal him.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will do what I can, but my powers are near exhaustion from healing the wounded out on the field.”  With a medallion with the insignia of all the gods of good on it in one hand, and the other placed on Rillen’s chest, Bren did all he could for his friend.  A small blue light flickered into existance, it moved over Rillen’s body.  The light shrouded Rillen.  Color returned to his cheeks.  “He will be alright, he just needs some rest.  Are you all right Ulla, I thought I saw that drachnid thrust its leg into you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thanks for your concern Bren, but I am fine.  The medallion Rillen gave me on our wedding day deflected the blow, I only feigned death so that they would leave me alone.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Here Ulla, I think you just might want to put something on that’s not so terribly torn.”  Pulling out a plain red robe, Hoku handed her friend and sister the garment.        <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you my sister.  I think I shall take Rillen back to our room, he needs rest.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I must talk to the generals, but I will return as quickly as possible.” Stated a weary Hoku.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Were going to be sticking around here, Paren and I must do what we can to aid the wounded, and Forna is quite good at bandaging.  Shall we all meet at the bar in lets say, five hours?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hopefully my husband will be awake by then, if not, I don’t think I can attend, but I’ll only be just upstairs.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The generals won’t need me that long, ill be there.”<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bren, Forna, and Paren had gone out to the field to do what they could, Hoku had gone to the general’s tent, and Hoku had summonded an air elemental to carry her husband back to their room.  She had it gently place Rillen down on the soft matress.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh my husband, why do you keep leaving me like this.  First in velious, against that Statue of Ralos Zek.  Then back there with Venril, and now…”  Ulla wept for herself, but more for her fallen husband.  “The gods have something planned for you Rillen, I just hope it doesn’t kill you.  I need you, you are my other half.  I love you with all my heart.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you sure you wish for this my love, my little Allu?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, I am Nellir, <br>
I need you, you are my other half, <br>
I love you with all my heart,<br>
You will bring light to the world, where there is no light”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am ready Allu,<br>
I need you, you are my other half,<br>
I love you with all my heart,<br>
You are the light that brightens up the darkness of the world to me”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The room of ice soon burst into light as thousands of small balls of light appeared.  The two rose off their feet into the frigid air.  Rillen hung a medallion around his lover’s neck, and put a ring on her slender finger.  Ulla removed a ring and a medallion from a secret pocket in her robe, and did the same as her husband.  As they embraced, the balls exploded, yet the light remained. When their lips met, a red ribbon of light spiraled up their bodies.  <br>
<br>
I love you my wife, Allu <br>
And I you my husband, Nellir<br>

“You have brought light to the world, where there is no light my love.” She whispered.  <br>
“What’s that again my love?” stated Rillen.  Ulla’s eyes widened as she saw her husband awake.<br>
“Your awake! Thank the gods.  How do you feel?” <br>
“I’m not bad, I feel a tad warm and have a splitting headache, but otherwise I’m fine.  What happened? Did we win?  Is Bren all right?  How are you alive, I saw the drachnid kill you”<br>
“You don’t remember?  When the drachnid struck me down, you became……distraught to say the least.  Your hair and eyes flared up, and became blood red.  The area around you became well, flames.  Then you spoke some weird words I’d never heard before, and the flames spread out killing every drachnid on the field, you saved the day.  Bren is fine, Paren healed him with his song.  Forna, Paren, and Bren are out on the field helping tend to the wounded and Hoku is off at the generals’ tent.  My medallion deflected the blow, but I fell to the ground in hopes that they would think they had slain me.  Were all going to meet in the bar in about two hours.”<br>
“Two hours, now what can we do for two hours my love.”  Said a grinning Rillen.<br>
“In two hours, we can do that twice!” said an eager Ulla.<br>
* * *<br>
“I’m glad to see your alright Rillen.  I’m also glad that Cinny was able to serve us up here, the people at the bar kept suffocating you!”  <br>
“Thanks for the concern Paren.  I’m just glad that the battles over!  It means Venril is down to three quarter forces.”<br>
“We lost less than a tenth, or well that’s how the generals estimate.  I’m just afraid that they’ll get cocky, Venrils a snake.  This war is hardly over.  Who knows what he’s got up his sleeve.”  Stated Hoku.<br>
“Awhhh stop bein such a downer hun.  Here, have some beer, it’ll loosen yea up.  We should be happy, we won.”  Paren handed Hoku a mug with quite a few inches of foam oozing over the rim of the mug.<br>
“Maybe I should lighten up, we did win a big battle.  Think you can summon me one of those magic glasses Ulla? I could use a bit of your special brew.”<br>
“Sure, anyone else want some while I’m at it?”  No one responded so she assumed that the others were going to pass.  With a few words and hand gestures, she had conjured two glasses, one for herself, the other for her sister.  She passed the empty glass to Hoku.  “Now remember, just think of it and the cup will be filled with the stuff.”  Both ladies glasses were soon fill with the heady red liquid.<br>
“Anyone have any ideas on where to go after the war?” asked Forna.  “We’ll all probably need a vacation.  How about a Camping trip?”<br>
“Camping sounds fun, as long as I don’t have to trudge around the woods in this heavy armor!” said Brenan.<br>
“I’m sorry to leave so early, but my talk with the generals really tired me out, not to mention to battle.  I could really use some rest.”  The other five companions bid her good night as she stumbled down the hall to her room.”<br>
“I think I’ll join her in a bit, stummin that lute of mine all day can really tire a guy out.”  <br>
“I guess were all pretty tired, after I finish my drink, I’ll be hittin the hay myself.” Stated Brenan<br>
“I had a pretty long nap it seems, but I to am getting a bit tired.  And I think Ulla has already fallen asleep.”  Her snores could be heard coming from beneath the table.<br>
“Geeze she’s loud, how do you sleep at night Rill.”<br>
“Ha, tell her that and she’ll whack you on the head, I know from experience.  I had a headache for weeks.  Sleep, hmm, sleep.  Well, sometimes I can’t sleep because of the noise, but I have a sort of secret.  You all know I can teleport correct? Well I have a little hideaway that I teleport to sometimes when shes snoring pretty loud.  I always make sure to get back in time before she awakens.  Please, don’t tell her, I don’t want another headache hehe.”<br>
“Your secrets safe with us Rill, well, I’m tired, I’m goin ta bed.”<br>
“It’s time for us get some sleep to, we all need our rest.  Venril could attack tomorrow, or tonight for the matter!”<br>
“G’night Forn, Bren.”  With a flick of his wrist, Ulla rose to his waist level.  Rillen lifted his wife into his arms and carried her off to bed.  “Sleep well my love.”<br>
* * *<br>
“Get up Ulla, I made us breakfast.”  Rillen placed a plate right under his wife’s nose.”<br>
“Five more minutes, I need my beauty sleep Rillen!”  She did sit up when she smelled the eggs, pancakes, and meat of some sort.  <br>
“You are the most beautiful woman in the world, you don’t need beauty sleep.  “Here, try some of this.”  She picked up the plate, and took a bite of the eggs.  <br>
“Mmmmm, how come you don’t cook like this at home!”  Rillen replied with a shrug.  <br>
“My first time.”  Ulla ravenously devoured her meal.  Rillen did the same with slightly less gusto.  “Oh, by the way, the giants and drolvargs have taken a position out in the field, Hoku estimates the attack will come within the next six hours.  The others are heading to the walls, I said we’d meet them there.”<br>
“Lets go then.”<br>
“In your night gown Ull? You might want to change first.”  She hustled into the other room, and within a minute, she was out wearing a tightly fit blue robe.  <br>
“Ready Ulla?”<br>
“Ready.”  Rillen performed the spell that whisked the pair to the walls where they met their friends. <br>
“Ahh, you’re here, I’m glad to see you.  Rillen, general Laenith wanted to see you, he’s in the tent over there.”<br>
“Ok, thanks Hoku.”  Rillen walked off in the direction of the tent.<br>
“Wait Rill, we need to cast our spells before the battle and you have to be near for the effects to work, just like yesterday remember.  Brenan, Hoku, and Ulla repeated the spells they had the day before.  Once they were completed, he walked away.  “Hurry back”<br>
* * *<br>
“General Laenith, I trust you were pleased with yesterdays battle?”  “I wasn’t until you conjured those flames Rillen.  The flames you will be using again today Rillen.  If you do we are willing to offer you….” “Stop General, I can’t conjure the flames, I don’t know how I did it before.  Even if I did, I would not CHARGE you for their use, I am here voluntarily.  Do you have any maps of the area that I could look at, see if there’s anything I could use?”  The general pointed at the desk   “What are these lines on the field?”  “There tunnels Rillen.”  Ok, I’m going to need fifty of your men.”  “Fifty men! For what!!” shouted the general.  “They all will need as many pikes as they can carry.  Have them go down in the tunnels and set up the pikes with the point sticking in the ceiling so when they hear the charge, they can stick them up through the ground to impale Venril’s troops.  We will need the druids to solidify the ground so the poles don’t wobble and fall back into the tunnels It will work if we’re fast, get your men working and we can start this next battle with the upper hand.”  “Bah, we are the elves! We don’t hide beneath the ground pricking our enemies.”  “Sir, you’ll be the dead elves if you don’t listen to reason, my plan can work.  It’s not very honorable, but how honorable are they.”  “I’m putting you totally in charge of this Rillen, if it doesn’t work, it’ll be your head.”  “Now, about the archers and casters.  There attacks aren’t fully efficient from were they are.  I suggest you position them here, behind this hill.   I can teleport them all there within minutes, I have the image in my mind.”  “That will endanger them.  They wouldn’t have the protection provided by the soldiers.”  “I know that, that’s why they would have to wait until most of the army had engaged in combat with the troops, so that there attacks would be efficient, yet would be safe due to the fact that if venrils troops turned to fight the distance fighters, your soldiers would kill them as they ran.”  “There up on the wall right now, take them there.”  “May I go sire, there is much to do and the battle may happen any time now?”  “You may go”  <br>
* * *<br>
“Did you all sleep well?” inquired Ulla.  All four companions told her yes, but in reality, none had slept well due to the fact that they had heard her snoring through the walls.  “Rillen made me breakfast this morning, turns out he’s a really good cook.”<br>
“Lucky you, we had hard tack and warm water for breakfast!  That husband of yours treats you like a goddess.” Said Hoku, while she stared at Paren.  Ulla, with a flick of her wrist, summoned a deck of cards.  “Anyone up for a game?  The coldain taught me a fun one, but I don’t think I should be getting that drunk right now.”  Ulla’s four companions erupted in laughter.  Minutes later, Paren taught the group how to play a card game he and a few ‘bar buddies’ had created to pass the time between beers.  Hoku seemed to excel at it, until the group figured out she was cheating.  She had used her powers over illusion to change her cards.  Luckily, before she could be properly reprimanded, Rillen returned.(end chapter 3)  <br>
“Hi hun, what have you five been up to?”<br>
“Your in-laws a cheater!” accused an angry Paren.  “Oh you’re just mad because I’m better at cheating than you!”  With that, Hoku stuck her tongue out at her friend.  <br>
“Hoku, how do you do it.  Those generals, well, aren’t too bright.  They’re as thick skulled as an ogre!  He just expects that I will conjure that fire again and decimate Venrils troops!  I don’t even remember conjuring it much less know how.  Plus he has a great terrain that he’s not taking advantage of.  The archers, wizards, and magicians could be of much more use there (Rillen pointed to the hill where the ranged fighters were now hiding behind)”<br>
“It’s difficult working them, but being an enchantress, I have a few spells that hmm assist me in my persuasive powers of making plans etcetera etcetera.  You should feel lucky, you only had to deal with one.”<br>
“I’m just glad I don’t have your job.  Now what’s this about you cheating, again!  You’re as bad as Paren.  Oh by the way, we’ve been offered a position in the caves.  We have to hurry.”<br>
“What caves?” inquired Bren.  <br>
  “There are hundreds of tunnels under the field.  When the time is right, we’re to trigger a few traps.  We must hurry.”  Before the others could reply, Rillen turned around and motioned them to follow him.  He led the group through the streets into a pretty shabby gray-green house.  “Why are we here Rill?”  Rillen responded by pulling up part of the floor and going down the newly found steps.  The five followed their leader.  At the bottom of the steps, they arrived in an unlit room with a passageway leading off, most likely towards the fields.  He thumped his staff on the ground and the crystal on the top flared into life.  “We are here, the traps are ready for our use just a bit ahead.”  They proceeded down the passageway until they reached a widening in the tunnel where they saw poles sticking up into the ceiling of dirt.  “When we begin to hear the charge, we are to push these poles up, hopefully impaling many of the giants and drolvargs.  Once done, ill teleport us to the frontlines so we can participate in the battle.”   <br>
  “Sounds like a plan Rillen.  Sounds like that generals aren’t that thick skulled.”  Stated Forna<br>
“This tunnel idea was mine Forn.  By the way, how’s the foot, I thought I saw you limping yesterday after the fight.”<br>
“It’s not bad Rillen.  I’ll be fine, s’long as Bren and Paren are around ta heal me.”<br>
“By the way Forn, where’d you learn to kick like that, yesterday you were practically flying.”<br>
“Guess practice pays off Rill” she said with a shrug.  “So what do you all want to do while we wait?  Any ideas, anyone?”  <br>
“I think we’re all just to concerned about the upcoming battle to play anything Forn.  Or it may be due to the fact that Hoku and Par would both cheat hehe.”  “I would not!” “Nor would I!  I just did that one time because I never win.  It felt good to win, but I won’t do it again!”  <br>
“I believe you Hoku.”  “Oh you’re my brother in law, you’re obligated to say things like that.”  “Yes, but as your friend I’m also obligated to tell you the truth.”<br>
“There coming, I can hear them! They’re charging!”  “Are you sure Ulla”  “Yes Paren, I’m sure.”<br>
“Ok, everyone grab a pole, when you hear them coming, and can tell there about to go over where the poles are, push!  Forty seconds passed, and Ulla shouted, “Push!”  Six pikes were quickly pushed up through the dirt ceiling of the cavern.  They finished off the rest of the pikes in their cave a minute later.  Even through the many feet of earth, they could hear the screams of the dead.<br>
“Ready for me to take us to the battle?”  The all agreed and they were soon at the bottom of the wall, ready to meet the oncoming drolvargs and giants in their regular defensive position.  “Ulla, don’t forget to summon an elemental!”  She quickly did as her husband advised.  The enemy troops were now about 200yards away, it was a matter of seconds before they engaged.  Ulla and Rillen both nodded to each other.  Rillen envoked a giant ball of ice, which he threw suprisingly quickly at the oncoming army.  At the same time, Ulla had summoned acid rain and was pelting the front lines.  The ice from Rillen’s ball had frozen the bodies of those in the front lines.  The troops behind them were trampling to get by, and were being pelted by acid in the process.  “We work well together Rillen.”<br>
 “That’s what many years of practice gets yeah.  Its time” Six snarling drolvargs with a pair of giants in tow raced towards the group.  “Hoku, your turn!”  As she beamed a smile towards her old friend, she mesmerized the ugly beasts, but it was not as it should have been.  The two giants were unaffected by Hoku’s spell.  “You guys take the one on the left, the one on the rights mine.” Growled Rillen.  He raised his frail hands above his head.  He spoke the words to the spell ice commet.  To complete the spell, Rillen thrusted his hands forward toward to giant.  A giant ball of ice formed between the arch-wizard and the gigantic beast.  It rushed towards the giant and molded itself around the thing upon contact, it was frozen solid.  Meanwhile Paren had given Forna a boost on his shoulders so she wouldn’t be staring at her target’s kneecaps.  Hoku had other plans.  “Get ready to fly Forn, just make sure to thrust one of your sharp little toys down on the thing’s head on the way down!”  “Sure thing hun!”<br>
* * *<br>
“General sir, the enemy troops have reached the front lines, may we fire?”  “What, oh umm yes yes fire away. Regiment 1, fire!  Regiment 2, fire! Regiment 3, fire! Regiment 1, fire well you all know the drill proceed” The distance was a tad more than what the archers, wizards, and magicians were used to, but they made due.  With hands linked, and words spoken together, the magicians had summoned an acid-rain storm above the rear of the enemy army where the elven armies had yet to attack.  The wizards were using their spells of farsight to pick targets and fire away.  The archers were in a three-row system.  The first row would fire, bend down to grab another arrow and nock it while second and third fired.  They would then be renocking their bows while first fired.  The battle seems to be going as well as possibly could have been planned.  The ranged attackers where getting full firing capabilities without having to worry about being attacked, and the soldiers seemed to holding up wonderfully.<br>
* * *<br>
“That was fun Hoku.”  Wheezed an exhausted Forna.  “Next time your going to make me fly up, come crashing down, and then stop my fall with a levitate a FOOT above the ground, remind me to hit you!”  “Oh it couldn’t have been that bad.”  “I’m afraid of hights!”  “We’ll stop bickering with me and go help Paren, he’s doing his best but that drolvarg is about two times bigger than him.”  Forna ran up behind Paren, flipped herself onto his shoulders, and then leapt onto the back of the drolvarg.  She looped her arms under those of the drolvargs, and then behind its head.  “Kill it Paren!”  He nodded and plunged his curved sword through the thing’s chest.  Dark blood sprayed everywhere, and the almost dog-like creature fell to the ground.  Three drolvargs remained.  Paren removed his dagger from its sheath, and slid it into his unmoving targets neck, or would have had there not been a chain neck-guard.  The attack awakened the hairy beast.  It lunged at the unprepared bard and would have hit him had Rillen not fired a gigantic fireball into the thing’s side leaving half a drolvarg, and about thirty servings of barbecued drolvarg.  “Thanks Rill!”  “My pleasure Par.”  Forna had decapitated her drolvarg with a powerful flying spinning hook kick.  One remained, and Rillen could almost see a glint of fear in the thing’s eyes.  Before the group could slay the last beast, five giants and two other drolvargs charged in.  <br>
“Paren, we need that green mist song quick!”  With his nimble fingers Paren sheathed his sword and dagger, and reached back for his horn hanging on his belt.  He played the appropriate notes while Forna and Ulla’s elemental did all they could to keep the beasts at bay.  Rillen had slowed their running speed so they were not quick in coming, but they were coming.  The green mist made its way to the creatures, and was absorbed by their skin.  Almost immediately they began to look diseased.  “Hoku, mesmerize em!”  “Will do Rill.”  She repeated the words and hand motions for spell.  Three of the giants were unaffected by the spell. Again she repeated the spell, but the three were still unaffected.  “It won’t work on them, they are to strong for me.  It’s time I show part of the true power of the enchantress” Screamed the furious enchantress.  Her eyes appeared to turn purple, and her skin had a slight golden cast to it.  She did something similar to a jig, and then shouted out five words, in almost a hiss.  The three giants each went down on one knee, “Mistress.”  “I order you three to go slay all the drolvargs and other giants you see, if you see no more, slay yourselves!”  “Your wish is our life.”  The trio of giants now went back in the fray attacking every creature of Venril’s they could find.  The three drolvargs had died from the mist and the other two giants would soon be dead.  The constant spell casting of the day had taken its toll on Hokulani, she was weak and needed rest. <br>
 Rillen removed a small marble from his vest pocket.  He passed his hand over it three times and spoke the words to a complex spell an ancient dragon had taught him.  When it was complete, the marble disappeared and a luminescent globe appeared around the group.  “We are safe for the time being, but my spell will not last.  Please Brenan, do what you can for Hoku, Forn, and Paren.”  “Sure Rillen.”  Brenan stood with his chin up, staring up at the stars.  He clasped his hands together and began a prayer to Rodcet Nife, the prime healer.  <br>
* * *<br>
<br>
<br>
Brenan’s entire body began to glow blue and his cloths and hair fluttered as if in a strong wind.  The blue aura grew and expanded to encompass the whole globe of protection.    The entire group felt fully rejuvenated.  Once the light dissipated Brenan fell to his knees.  He seemed………older to his companions.  “Paren, can you now do something for Bren?” “No!, my condition can’t be healed, we have to return to the fight.  They need us.  Do as I say now Rillen, please.”  Bren doubled over and had a coughing fit.  “I will be fine, take us back.”  Rillen walked over to the edge of the bubble and placed his hands on it.  It began to shrink and continued to do so until it could no longer contain the six.  At this point, it popped and they were back in the battle.  <br>
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have an idea!, Ulla, if you taught the other magicians how to summon your special drink, could you make it rain that, all over the field?”  “If there were enough mages, and they were quick pupils, yes its plausible.”  “Well, can you summon me a glass quickly now?”  “Sure, but your not making an sense to me?”  She summoned the glass full of the heady liquid and handed it to her husband who placed it on the ground.  “Step back Ull.”  Rillen sent a small spark of fire at the glass which then exploded in flames.  “Just as I thought.  Hoku, Paren, Forna, Bren, will you be alright with out us for a minute?”  “Yeah” replied Forna as tore her through the calf of a giant and kicked it behind the knee making it fall and kill two drolvargs with the crash.  “Hoku, can you hurry into the city, and modify the shield from one purely against magic, to one partially against magic, and partially against physical attacks?”  “I can, but that would make the city susceptible to Venrils Magical attacks” “Just do it, have Paren, Forn, and Bren go with you, I don’t want them left alone.  I know they can take care of themselves, but where in a war, anything can happen and if I were to lose any of them.”  The second part of that statement, Rillen said softly in a gentle voice.  “Ok my brother, I trust you.”  “Allu, I have a plan”<br>
With a quick transportation spell, Rillen took him and his wife to the hill were one of the generals, the archers, mages, and wizards stood firing.  “Ulla, go teach those mages how to summon the drink and make it rain, quickly now.”  She nodded and ran off.  Rillen did the same, but he ran to find those of his order, the wizards.  “Are you the leader here?”  “Yes, I lead these wizards, I am Horken, what do you need, make it quick.  These apprentices will burn off their hats without my guidance.”  “You have new orders, you are to assist me in translocating our entire army inside the city when the shield changes somehow and it rains purple.  Got it?”  “Under whose authority!”  “Mine!” snarled Rillen “And if you don’t comply, I will make you!”  “Who are you, some young apprentice, to threaten me!”  “I am Rillen Tarrant!  I am a master evoker, I am leader of the crimson hands!”  “You are nothing compared to me!  No erudite will ever surpass an elf!  I have heard stories about you Rillen, I am sure they are greatly exaggerated!  Your just trying to get us all killed, I must stop you!”  With his hands raised, the elf performed the gestures and words for the spell conflagration.  He smiled as the fiery bolt went racing towards the erudite.  Rillen became consumed by the flames.  “I was right, no erudite could match me in skill, Ha, the nerve he had!”  When the flames died down, the elf took on a look of horror as he saw Rillen, untouched by the flames.  “Your ignorance could have caused your own people this war, but I won’t let that happen.”  Rillen removed another marble from his pouch and performed the spell he did before back on the field.  The now enlarged marble surrounded the elf, and then shrank back to regular size.  Rillen retrieved the elf-marble.  In a booming voice he said, “All of you, listen to me, I need you to help me translocate our entire army inside the city when the blood rains, please, just trust me.  I must go for now, when I return, can I count on you all to assist me?”  One among the crowd asked, “Are you really Rillen Tarrant, the one we’ve heard of?”  “I am”  The same one from the crowd then shouted, “Then I am with you!”  Shouts came from the crowd, all cheering for Rillen.  At this moment, the transparent shield became slightly rosy colored.  Thank you Hoku, my sister he whispered.  He walked the short distance to where the general stood.  “General Baenel is it, I need your assistance.”  “Oh, what’s that, whose there, oh hello, have we met?”  “I don’t believe so, I am Rillen.  I need your archers to fire flaming arrows when your army disappears and it rains Blood.”  “Blood you say, that’ll be the day.  I’ve seen water and all but never….” Rillen cut him off, “Please, just do it, will you?”  “Yes yes, we have just the arrows for the job, just haven’t used em yet you see.”  “Good” Rillen took a glance at the field.  They were losing.  He ran over to his wife, “How’s it coming, Hokus got the shield going, the wizards know what to do, as do the archers.”  “Heck Rillen, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’d say we need about five more minutes.”  Lets just say these aren’t the best mages I’ve worked with she whispered to her husband.  “Ok, I’m going to get our friends, if you start the rain before I find them, ill return to finish my plan.  He disappeared and rematerialized inside the room with the crystal that controls the shield.      <br>
* * *<br>
“Hello Rillen Tarrant, I am Venril Sathir, I believe you know me, I certainly have heard of your many brave deeds.”  He said the word brave with a snarl.  Venril Appeared to be an iksar with aged bandages wrapped around his limbs giving him an almost mummified effect.  His scales were gray-green and his eyes were green.  Not the green of leaves and grass, but the green of bile and decay.  No life could be detected behind those eyes.      <br>
“I know you Venril Sathir.  I know you for innocents you have killed, and all the innocents you are trying to kill right now with this war!”<br>
“Now, that’s not entirely true.  These ‘inocents’ sent assassins to kill me, of course they never had a chance at succeeding, but they were annoyances.”<br>
“They only did so because you killed all their scouts! You bastard.”  <br>
“And to think, I almost spared your life.  You impudent fool, you know you haven’t the strength to kill me.  Why do you defy me, I find your futile struggles…… interesting, but for your impudence, you shall never see your friends again”<br>
“What have you done with my friends lizard! And you are wrong Venril, I will kill you.  In a few minutes, your army will destroyed, you will die.”<br>
“Soon you shall find out about your friends.  And you think my army can be that easily decimated, ha, you are the deluded one.  My giants will step on the elves, my drolvargs will rake their bodies, they are the ones who will lose, you will lose.  And now it is time to prove that to you.”  Venril raised his hand.  “Are you prepared to die Rillen?” “No” “Good” replied Venril with a smirk.  From the center of his right hand, an eerie green spear of light shot out towards Rillen who narrowly dodged it.  Rillen responded by raising his hands, chanting, “Ultar Minul Imobi Geala” and then dropping his hands.  A magical net appeared above Venril and fell on him.  As soon as the first strand touched him, it dissolved.  The sounds of rain could be heard from outside.  Rillen prayed to himself that the wizards could get the army inside the city behind the shield, that is, if Venril hadn’t lowered it.  Venril shot his hand out and the rotting bandages surrounding his arm sprang to life and raced towards Rillen.  Rillen, now wrapped in Venril’s bandages, closed his eyes, “Firun Epides Inferih!” he rasped.  His skin became hot, the bandages went up in smoke.  “You aren’t bad Rillen, it’s almost a shame I have to kill you.”  With a flick of his wrist, Venril sent a cloud of black dust at Rillen.  Venril hissed the words to a spell, and the world went black to Rillen, Venril had blinded him.  “You are used to hiding among the shadows aren’t you Venril.  Afraid that if anyone sees you in the light, they will see you for the despicable coward you really are.”  Rillen muttered the words to a spell a crazy dragon had taught him, wily step.  It teleports the caster about ten feet away, and continues to do so until the caster wishes for the spell to end.  Venril muttered something about hypocrisy and sent a ball of flames at Rillen who luckily was translocated by his spell in time to avoid it.    “I begin to tire of this game, you shall die soon.”  Venril put the bottoms of his palms together his forced them forward.  A spear of bone shot forward towards Rillen and struck him in the shoulder where a line of blood soon formed.  Tears of pain streamed down his face.  Rillen’s shoulders drooped and his knees wobbled.  I need you Allu, I need you.  I can’t do this without you.  A small gate flickered into existence in front of Rillen.  He managed to stumble through and appear at the archer’s hill next to his wife.  <br>
* * *<br>
“Rillen!, what happened.”  Ulla rushed over to her injured husband.  “Oh Rillen, are you alright.”  His shoulder was torn terribly and much of his body was red from the fires.  <br>
“I’m alright Ull, but Venril has our friends.  Did the wizards get the army behind the shield? Did the plan work?”<br>
“The wizards did, the plan worked perfectly.  The archers fired the flaming arrows, and the flames spread from creature to creature.  We’ve won the war.  We need to get you to a medic.”<br>
“I’m fine Ull, Venril has our friends.  I know where he is, we have to hurry.  I can’t believe I let this happen, I should have been more careful.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’re not going anywhere until you see a medic, and you can’t blame yourself for their capture.  It’s in know way your fault.”  Ulla grabbed a passerby with the symbol of Rodcet-Nife on his jackets arm.  Rillen soon had a salve for his face and chest, and the cleric had bandaged the wound.<br>
“To much time has passed Ull, we have to go.  Venril has them, he has our friends.”  Rillen didn’t seem to put much energy in his argument, he was practically out of energy from his battle with Venril.    <br>
“I know hun, I know.  That bastard has my sister and our friends.  We will get them back, but you are…… what’s wrong with your eyes?”<br>
“Venril blinded me, my sight is returning, but it’s still blurry.  Lets go.”  Ulla nodded, and Rillen teleported himself, his wife, and her elemental to the shielding room where he and Venril had fought.  <br>
* * *<br>
“Is he here Ull?”  “I don’t see him, but I smell a vile presence in the air.  He is near.”  A green fog enshrouded the entire room.  Ulla could barely see a foot in front of herself, and Rillen could barely see at all.  Rillen reached over with his singed hand and grabbed that of his wife.  He leaned over and whispered in his wife’s ear, “I love you Allu.  Lets take a break after this, go to that little hidden cottage in the woods.  I want to spend the rest of my life in peace with you.”  She gently bit his ear and growled in a somewhat playful manner.  “He’s here, I sense him.  I don’t know how, but I just know he’s here.”  Rillen raised his scepter in a defensive position.  <br>
“How very perceptive of you Rillen.  Unfortunately, it won’t help save your life.”  From out of the mist came a spear of poisonous green light.  Ulla pushed Rillen to the side and dodged the spear herself.  They both narrowly escaped the attack.  She sent her elemental into the mist to attack Venril and within moments, she felt it die. <br>
“Your friends are dead, and soon you shall join them!” snarled the lizard man.  Rillen, remembering that lizards are susceptible to the cold began to conjure an icy comet.  His eyes frosted over and soon a ball of ice was flying towards where he sensed Venril to be.  The ball was accompanied by a ball of flames sent by his wife.  They were rewarded with a grunt of pain.  The irritated iksar scurried on all fours up behind the lovers.  He sprang and landed on Ulla’s back.  “Ulllaaaaa!” screamed Rillen as he brought the butt of his staff down on Venril’s skull.  <br>
“You bastard!”  in a more gentle voice he stated, “Are you alright Allu?”  “Yes……I’m fine Rillen, your eyes.  There back to normal.”  “I guess the spell wore off.”  He reached down and lifted his fallen wife to her feet.  Before she could regain her bearings, fear struck her.  Her regularly sturdy shoulders were drooping and she was shivering.  “Ulla, do you think you can make it rain, it think that would clear away this mist and make Venril fight us scaly face to face.”  He waited for a few seconds and said, “Ulla?”  He noticed her phobic condition and realized Venril had ensorcelled his wife.  He knelt down and cast a spell of nullification magic on her.  The fear didn’t cease, his spell hadn’t had any effect.  “Damn Ulla, I need you.”  He grabbed her quivering shoulders and shook them.  A spear of flaming light grazed the side of his skull.  Venril sent yet another spear towards Rillen, but he managed to dodge it.  Unfortunately, the spear hadn’t been aimed for him.  The target had been Ulla and the spear had hit her dead on.  Her body crumbled to the floor.  Her back was a bloody mess of charred flesh and crimson blood.  <br>
Not a whimper escaped his lips, but a bright red tear rolled down his cheek, and fell to the floor.  He growled in anger and from his body, a small wave of flames flowed out from his body.  The green mist dissipated when touched by the flickering flames.  “Step out of the shadows Venril and meet your death.  You have hurt my wife, I shall not stop until you are dead!”  <br>
Venril stepped out from behind a stone pillar and stared with his black beady eyes at Rillen.  His scales began to glow a slight purple.  Rillen’s skin in turn began to redden.  The space between the two sparked with the clash of energy.  As Venril raised his hands and fired a spear of poisonous light, Rillen teleported behind the iksar and fired a small comet of ice.  The spell encased the scales on Venril’s back in frost.  As he moved to turn to face his foe, the ice shattered, as did the green-gray scales beneath.  Pain exploded throughout Venril’s body as a smile spread across Rillen’s face.<br>
Hatred burned through Rillen’s veins.  He half chanted half shouted the words to a spell, “Aksmith Incentui Flaedea Sinteri uth Cindai et Lawunti”  A stream of fireballs was sent from the tips of his fingers toward the un-scaled section of the lizards midriff.  The acrid smell of seared flesh drifted towards the wizard.  He walked over to the crumpled form of the once strong and proud Venril Sathir.  Sathir snaked out one of his scaled limbs and grasped on to Rillen’s robed leg.  He screeched in his slithery tongue, “Sllichthrash Grachnicht Icht-tan Malachtiss!”  <br>
Venril seemed to have sapped Rillen’s strength and to given it to himself.  He now stood with new small scales on his back.  Rillen’s reddish brown skin had palled, and he bent over in pain.  Rillen muttered the two words to a short distance teleportation spell which hid him somewhere else in the room behind a pillar.  <br>
“Come out Rillen.  Stop ‘hiding in the shadows.’”  He stepped out from behind the pillar, “I am here Venril.  Come and kill me lizard.”  Rillen entered a deep trance and quietly muttered the words to a spell.  Venril noticed the drained Rillen, and readied a spell of his own to finish off the bug.  Before Rillen could complete his spell, a fiery spear darted towards him and struck him in the thigh.  The spearhead dug into the stone pillar, trapping Rillen there.  Another spear came and struck him in the side.  It tore through his skin into the pillar.  <br>
Rage boiled throughout Rillen’s veins.  He unbent himself.  The pain in his thigh and side was excruciating, but he didn’t seem to mind.  He would kill himself if only he could kill Venril.  He saw his fallen wife.  Her robe burnt, her skin charred.  She was alive, but barely.  He thought of all the dead elves, dwarves, and gnomes fighting for their homes.  Fighting because they had to, not for a noble cause, but because their homes and families were here.  And then he thought of Venril Sathir.  The root of his wife’s pain, the root of the deaths of all those elves, dwarves, and gnomes.  And he was mad.  <br>
His now red hair flew up in every which direction.  Not the red that most people have, his hair was the red of an apple.  His skin glowed an eerie scarlet.  Not the scarlet of rosy cheeks, but the scarlet of a robin’s feathers.  The pupils and whites of his eyes disappeared.  They appeared to be glowing embers.  Orange flames licked at his feet.  The air before him wavered, as if in the desert.  The flames leapt up and consumed him.  He seemed less consumed by the flames then a part of them.  The spears holding him in place evaporated and the remnants fluttered away in the breeze caused by the wavering flames.  He stared at Venril with his eyes of fire.  <br>
“You will die, now.”  He said calmly.  He raised his hands and sent a stream of liquid yellowy fire at Venril.  Before the attack reached Venril, he erected a shield to protect himself from the attack.  The glowing shield of light shimmered in the firelight.  As the fire touched it, it fell apart.  Pieces of it rapidly disappeared and soon Venril was bathed in liquid fire.  His scales went up in flames, and his gray flesh was exposed.  The flames died as the scales fell.  Not even ash remained from the bandages and scales.  There was nothing left.  <br>
Venril spread his arms as wide as they could go, and then brought them together with a clap.  “Diesthicksh Fiunhanae Qaushenae-et uth Giesht”  Lightning flared throughout the room.  A bolt flew towards Rillen and struck him in the chest.  The fires surrounding him flared up and whipped around, almost as in pain.  They grew and became more intense, they had fed on the lightning.  With his hands raised, Rillen sent a barrage of small balls of fire at Venril.  Each struck him dead on.  The lizard fell to the ground, dead.  <br>
All the flames in the room died down and Rillen returned to his normal appearance.  He rushed to his wife’s side.  “Oh Allu, my little Allu.”  He lifted his wife’s fragile body in his arms and walked forward through a portal that appeared in front of them. <br>
* * *<br>
<br>
The room was pure white.  The ragged rug on the floor had been bleached and the walls were all rudimentarily painted an egg-shell white.  Even the curtains were made of white lace.  The only part of the room that was not totally white was the places were paint had chipped off the wooden bed that Ulla now rested upon.  Among the sheets, she stirred.  “Ulla!, you’re awake!  Oh Ulla, I’ve been so afraid!  How are you.”  A mass of unkept hair popped out from underneath the woolen sheets.  “Terrible, do mind if I ask where in the world I am?”  “You’re in your room in the medical ward in the new city of Firiona Vie.  When the war ended from your….. explosive rain, there were many injured soldiers.  The city itself needed to be rebuilt.”  Ulla moved to sit up in her bed.  “Please don’t move my little Allu, your burns are not fully healed.”  “What burns, why am I here, what happened?”  “You don’t remember, me and Venril fought, I was losing so I came to get you.  Together we went to fight him.  He injured you, and now here you are.”  “Oh my head hurts, but it’s all coming back to me.  What happened to my sister, did you find them, did you find our friends!  Where are they!”  “They are all alright my sweet.  After the fight, I took you here to be healed.  The clerics refused to allow me to remain with you while they healed you so I went back to the place where I fought Venril to see if I could find some clue as to where he had taken our friends.  In the back of the room behind a large pillar, I found our friends chained to a pillar.  He had severely tortured them, but miraculously they were still alive.  Hoku, Forn, and Paren have already recovered, but you and Brenan were both injured terribly.  He has yet to awaken.  Kalandia the head priestess of the gnomes and Kakmer, the king priest of the dwarves have both been working on you, but their efforts do not work so well against the effects of Venril’s spells.  Now that you are awake, I really must go.  The city has yet to be fully built, everyone is lending a hand in the rebuilding.  The dwarves have sent some of their best masons and quite a few humans have come to lend a hand.”<br>
“Well then, we have work to do.”  Ulla forced herself to rise and propped herself up with her arms.  <br>
“We?  No Ulla, you have to rest.  Although you are awake, you are not fine.  You were physically drained from the battle and terribly injured from Venril.”  He grabbed the fleece blanket and brought it up to his wife’s neck.<br>
“I AM fine Rillen, I’ve been asleep for…… a long time!  We came to help the people of Firiona Vie and that’s exactly what I intend to do!”  A short blond haired female gnome waddled up to the pair.  She was dressed in a golden armor that seemed to glow.  Her strawberry-blonde hair was streaked with gray, but she wore her age with a certain grace and dignity.<br>
“Actually Rillen, now that your wife has awakened, it means that the effects of Venril’s spells have worn off and that Ulla is in a fine physical condition.  Although her burns are terrible, that lazy, fat, obnoxious dwarf and I have woven a shielding spell around her.  Minor physical harm that would normally affect her will have no effect now.”<br>
“Thank you! Kalandee is it?”<br>
“It’s Kalandia, and you are welcome.  Men can be so ignorant at times, even ones such as your husband.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Some are better than others.”  Yet another person approached the husband and wife.<br>
“Ahem, I believe it was a MAN who saved your life Ulla and I believe it was a man who came up with the plan who won the war.  And who are you to call me lazy, fat, and obnoxious.  Why just yesterday I saw you sleeping at two in the afternoon.  And who are you to call me fat!  I may be pleasantly plump, but you yourself are one to talk.  Ever since Wren started serving those pies you’ve been………”  “That’s enough Kakmer.  Lady Ulla has just awoken and I doubt that your rambling can hasten her healing.”  “And your nagging me is a HUGE help!”  Grumbled the other person who appeared to be a dwarf.  He also was dressed in glowing golden armor.  He brown beard flowed down to his waist where he tucked the rest in.  His skin was blotchy and his nose was red, most likely to the heavy drinking most dwarves do.  The expanding girth that all male dwarves had was quite apparent on him.  The straps on his sides holding his armor together were strained and his Jerkin under his armor did not totally cover his stomach”<br>
“  I’m surprised you’re not at the pub drinking yourself into a stupor.”<br>
“Hold your tongue old hag.  I am the dignified leader of the dwarven clerics of the light.  Both Quellious and Rodcet-Nife have given me their favor.  And, I am no drunk!  I may every now and then indulge in a drink or two, but it’s nothing a dwarf such as myself can not hold.”<br>
“Old hag! Why your twice my age you 173 years old, while I’m a fresh 87.  And I wouldn’t say anything about your drinking habits had I not seen you just yesterday with your head under the spigot of a barrel of ale.”  Both Ulla and Rillen sighed.  He whispered to her, “Shall we go, I think these two are going to be going at it for quite a while.”  She responded with a quick please do.  He spoke the words to a spell and in seconds both Ulla and Rillen rematerialized in the ruins of the city.  They were in the shattered remains of a stone road.  The once strong stones had held firm together were now dust.  Fragments of the old city were scattered throughout the dirt.  Dried blood stained the brown earth a murky crimson.  Corpses yet to be hauled away littered the road.  <br>
“Oh Rillen, I didn’t know the desolation was so terrible.  I didn’t know.  How did all this happen?  I thought you had a plan.  I didn’t know, I didn’t…….. I didn’t know.”  She said shakily.  In a more firm voice she said, “Well, we’ll just have to get working.”  <br>
“Yep, but don’t despair Ull.  This is the worst sector of the city.  Most of the others have already been repaired, or didn’t even need to be.  Are you sure you’re up to it?  Your back really hasn’t come close to being fully healed, and you did just wake up.”  Ulla bowed her head, lowered her hands, and chanted, “Evoi eht Threa Gaiea Shoika thai Gunan!”  She raised both her hands and head, and were her shadow had lain stood an earth golem.  <br>
“We shall heal the city Rill.  We came to help, so we will.  And again I ask, why did this happen, I thought u had a plan.”  She said in the tone which she used as a young eight-year old when she first met Bren and Rill.  <br>
“My plan was to change the shields efforts to reflect physical, instead of magical damage.  It worked to some extent.  While the wizards teleported our troops into the city and you and the mages started the rain, I teleported to the shielding room in hopes of seeing Hoku, Bren, Par, and Forna there changing the shield.  Hoku had begun to alter the spell, but didn’t have the time to finish it before Venril came and attacked them.  The shield reflected the alcoholic rain, but it didn’t prevent the remains of Venril’s troops from marching right into the city.  The remnants of his army charged at the city in a futile charge of vengeance.  They managed to kill a few citizens before our archers took care of them.  Hold on, I’ll be right back.”  He disappeared, and in a minute reappeared with Hoku, Paren, and Forn.        <br>
“Hey!  What happened?  Rill?  Ull? Why are you here, and a better question.  Why am I here!  And why are you wearing a nightgown Ull.  It’s quite becoming of you but ouch!”  Hoku had playfully slapped Paren’s side with her back-hand.  Ulla had looked down at her tattered gown and blushed a bright apple-red.  She summoned a leather jerkin and skirt which she quickily strapped on over her dress. <br>
“Hehe sorry bout that Paren.  Ulla awoke and decided to help.  I’m sorry for whisking you here without telling you, but….. well, I am sorry.”<br>
“No problem Rill, just glad to see Ullas alright and back in tip top shape.  So, what are we doing here?  It’s not what I would consider a pleasant area.  And how’s Bren.  Better?”<br>
“Well, I told Ull that we were all helping restore the city, so that’s why were here, but I think we could all use a break.  And Bren is much better.  The aging effects of his spell have seemed to wear off and his wounds from Venril have begun to heal.  It could be many days before he awakens, but he will be fine.”<br>
“So what are we doing, cleaning, or taking a break?”  inquired Paren, who showed his vote with his enthusiasm by practically shouting ‘taking a break.’<br>
“I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m FAMISHED!”  stated Forna.  <br>
“Well, I guess I could use a snack, I’m up for a trip to the inn.  How bout you Rill and Ull.”<br>
“I guess I could use a break Hoku, but I have a better idea than the inn, shall I take us there?”  The other four consented to have Rillen take them to the mystery spot.”  He raised his hands and pressed his knuckles together.  With his fingers, he grasped the air and pulled it apart.  A Purple split appeared in the reality.  As he moved his hands further outwards, the slit expanded to form a hole the size of a door.  “Ladies first”  said Rillen as he motioned Hoku, Forna, and Ulla through.  The three looked at each other, and then at the gate.  Forna gulped and timidly walked through the tear in reality.  Seconds later, her grinning head popped through.  <br>
“Come on in guys, it’s safe.”  Paren, Hoku, and Ulla soon followed Forna’s head through the portal.  After they were through, Rillen stepped through.  He came out at a secluded forest setting, with a small pool of water near by.  He grabbed the edges of the purple portal and forced them closed.  <br>
“Oh Rillen, its perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  It’s exactly as I remember it.  It hasn’t changed a bit.”  They five friends were on a small hill set in the middle of a dense forest.  The sounds of wildlife were the same as they were so many years ago when the six were becoming friends.  The pool was as clear as ever.  This was where the six would go to rest and relax after tiring battles when they were younger.  There was the stump were Paren would sit to play his lute, or whittle.  There was the giant oak that they would hide under when it would rain.  There was the pool that they would swim in.  There was but one change.  Down at the base of the hill stood a house.  A quaint little blue house.  At each of the four corners stood round bulges much like the eruditic style of buildings.  The roof was slanted and shingled like those of the homes of Qeynos.   The four stood silent in shock, and awe of the serenity of their surroundings.  <br>
“Wait right here, ill be right back!”  exclaimed Rillen.  He turned around and ran down the hill towards the home.  Seconds later he returned laden with four baskets bulging with food.  “Here we go.  It’s not much but its all I could really scrounge up.”  <br>
“It’s a feast Rillen!, but I don’t understand.  Why’s there a house down there, that’s new.  I thought our spells would protect this area from other people finding it?”<br>
“Oh they do, that’s our house.  Well, me and Ulla’s, but there are rooms for each of you there Hoku.”  From one of the baskets, Rillen procured a large quilt which he spread out on the ground.  In the center he placed the baskets and then plopped down. “Well, what are you all waiting for, lets eat.”  The other four quickly sat down and ravenously tore apart the contents of the baskets.  Paren downed a bottle of wine while Forna ate an entire chicken.  Hoku and Ulla removed some sandwiches from one of the baskets and quietly nibbled on them.  Paren had pried open a box of dried deer and was noisily gnawing on the rough meat.  Forna was working on a haunch of bear meat when she remembered.  Poor Brenan.  After he had done so much for them all, they were gorging while he was lying ill in bed.  <br>
“I know what you’re thinking Forn.  I was thinking the same thing a few days ago.  What right do we have to be joyful and merry while he lays sick in bed, but try to remember what kind of person Bren is.  He always puts others before himself.  He would be happy to know that you are enjoying yourself here.”  <br>
“I know Rill, but I still feel guilty.  I know Brenan, and that if he knew we were as happy as we were right now, he wouldn’t mind that we were here without him.”  She bowed her head, and when her eye caught the haunch of meat that she had been devouring earlier, thoughts of Bren became a second priority.  <br>
To the four, Rillen said, “Well, I’m not that hungry.  I’m gonna take a swim, would anyone care to join me?”  Paren and Forn didn’t seem to hear him, but Ulla saw the glint in his eye and knew that although he was asking all four, he only wanted her to join him.  Hoku, who would have loved to go for a swim, also saw the glint and knew that she should give her sister and brother in law a few minutes alone before she joined them.  <br>
“Sure I’ll go hon. No offence but your sandwiches need a bit of work.”  Stated Rill’s husband.<br>
“I’ll join you two in a bit.  I’m just going to take in the beauty for now.  I still can’t believe we’re here.  It’s been years.”  Ulla walked over to her husbands side by the pool and removed her leather garments.  Rillen discarded his coat and shirt, and dove in.  Ulla soon followed wearing only her snug woolen shift.  Rillen appeared behind his wife.  He placed his hands on her hips and turned her to face him.  The moved closer to each other in the warm waters.  Rillen’s arms jetted out and clasped his wife around the waist.  He pulled her tightly and she pulled him to her with her own arms now clasped around his back.  Their lips connected in a kiss.  He pulled back and whispered in her ear, “Follow me.”  He dove beneath the waters.  Together they swam to the bottom of the pool.  Rillen swam beneath a rock into an eerily lit tunnel.  Ulla faithfully followed.  Rillen quickly turned upwards and swam up another tunnel.  His head broke the surface of the water, and soon later, Ulla’s did the same.  They were in a small stone room many meters below the ground.  A gasping Rillen pushed himself up onto the stone ledge.  He pulled his wife up and then sat down.  <br>
“I love you Nellir.”  <br>
“And I you my Allu”<br>
* * *<br>
Hoku sat at the edge of the water, playfully splashing water at Paren with her foot.  The cool water felt good to his hot skin.  “I wonder were they are, its been almost an hour.  Wait, I think I see something!  It’s them Paren!”  Hoku stripped down to the lacy shift Paren had given to her and dove into the water.  Paren, who had already removed most of his clothing and all his armor dove in after his lover.  They waded in the water waiting for their friends to surface.  <br>
“Hey Rillen!  Hey Ulla!”  The two had emerged from the water and swam over to their friends.  <br>
“Hey Hoku, hey Paren.  Where’s Forna?”  inquired Rillen<br>
“Ahh ummm, shes still over at the picnic eating.  I guess the war and restoration took a lot out of her, so shes trying to put a lot into her hehehehehe.”  Rillen erupted into laughter.<br>
“Have you two taken a swim yet, the waters wonderful!”<br>
“Nope, we were just about to Rill.  Hey, think you could do me a favor and heat the water a bit.  I don’t know why but I’m chilled to the bone.  I could use a warm bath.”<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sure Par.”  Rillen closed his eyes and rose out over the water.  Transparent red waves seeped out from beneath him and floated down to the water.  The waves seeped into the water which now was boiling from the heat.  Rillen opened his eyes and plummeted down into the water.  Before he hit the surfac, he rolled himself into a ball, cannon balling his friends.  When he emerged from beneath the water, Hoku and Paren were ready to get revenge for the splashes.  Paren pushed water towards Rillen with both his arms while Hoku brought her arm out of the water, and then quickly skimmed it over the water causing a mini disc of water to rush towards both Rill and Ull.  Both Ulla and Rillen were hit dead on.  Hoku and Paren laughed as they prepared for a counter attack.  Rillen and Ulla who had both recovered from the splashed had giant grins on their faces.  Ulla flopped on her back and started kicking.  The water splashed all over Hoku and Paren.  Rillen with hands raised fired a small bolt of cold at the miniature waves making them near freezing.  The chilled water struck both Hoku and Paren front on.  Rillen and Ulla both decided to get away on the high note and dove beneath the water.  The swam to the other side and hopped out.  Hoku, mad at them for the cold water trick, closed her eyes and murmured the words to gravity flux.  A large portion of water flew up into the air and came crashing down on top of Ulla, Rillen, and their cloths. <br>
“Ha!” shouted Hoku, who was now reeling with laughter at her sister and brother in law.  “Never try to get the last laugh against me.  It just wont work hehe!”  Paren and Hoku both emerged from the water and dried off.  Rillen used a spell of warmth to dry himself, Ulla, and their clothes off.  He shouted, “We declare a truce, do you accept?”<br>
Hoku responded with a loud yes, for now.  After they were all dry, they headed back to the picnic.<br>
“Well, it’s about time you two returned, I’ve been here waiting this entire time for you.  So, are we heading back to town?”<br>
“Well, it’s up to you guys.  We can either stay here, in the house, or we can go back to Firiona Vie to wait for Bren to wake up and help with the resoration.”  <br>
“Well, I would like to go back to check on Bren, but I would really like to stay, so its up to you three Hoku, Ull, and Par.”All three agreed that it would be nice to spend the night there, and that they would return to Firiona Vie in the morning.  Rillen packed up the baskets and led his friends down to his home.  He led each person to their respective room.  Each customized for that person.  Paren’s had a mini bar in the back.  <br>
“I’ll get you all up when its time to leave.  Try to get some rest, and help yourselves to whatevers in the kitchen.<br>

“Hello Rillen.  Your late.”  The wizard found himself in a room of reddish marble elaborately adorned with gilded ruby tapestries.  Across from him stood a grizzled old woman.  There was a twinkle in her eye which flared red.  Her eyes erupted in red light, and her hair, now an unnatural red, fluttered as if in a breeze.  Her skin also reddened, as if his blood was seeping to the surface.  “Who…What.. How!?”<br>
“My name is.. was Kora.  I was once like you, a Shi’an.  Have you had the pains yet?  Oh of course not, for most that doesn’t occur until the fourth, maybe fifth outburst.  Oh I wonder who the other three could be.  Well, I guess I better stop rambling now.  I have brought you here so that you may come to learn what you are.  All things in life are balanced, the pantheon of gods, the powers of dark and light, night and day.  When these balances are thrown out of whack, things are done to correct them.  You Rillen, are a cog thrown into the system.  Whether you will fight for justice or corruption, or not fight at all, is up to you, but I believe you have already made that decision for yourself.  Shi’an are people of extraordinary power.  Never have there been more than one, but for some reason, there are many of you scattered throughout the world now.  Most have yet to come into their power, none have yet to master it.  You will be able to master it, you ARE a Terrant.”<br>
“I don’t understand, am I a mistake? Something meant to help restore balance, or something to disrupt it?  And what has my ancestry to do with this this, power.”<br>
“Not even the gods know any more than what I have said, for the Shi’an are as old as the gods themselves.  Some Shi’an have been able to rival the powers of the gods themselves, but that power has long disappeared.  At one point, thousands of years ago, there was more than one Shi’an.  In fact, there were thousands.  They were born with magic, some children learned to manipulate the forces within themselves before they could even speak.  Over the centuries, the powers of old have been diluted, but every now and then, a child is born with a scrap of the power a Shi’an had.  People can acquire the power of a Shi’an through self meditation and study, but the knowledge of exactly how has been lost.”<br>
“So I was born by pure chance, a one on a thousand chance.”<br>
“No, somehow you managed to ‘come into yourself’ and gain control of the power of your ancestors, but here, I have summoned you to give you this.  Also know this, the men of today have learned to tap into their spirits through words and hand gestures.  This relatively new power is strange.  Instead of studying to regain the power of the Shi’an, something any one can do, something you yourself did, people study books, instead of themselves.”  The woman of ruby features tossed Rillen a leather book bound in a red hide.  “It contains some information that may assist you in controlling what you are.  There is much more to your history, what I have told you is all that I was able to discover during my life, may you have more luck in unfolding your, our, history.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a brilliant flash and Rillen found himself drenched in cold sweat sitting up in bed.  Was it a dream?  When he saw the hair on his arms, glowing faintly red, he assumed it had not been the whim of his mind.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The five friends had awoken, some more easily than others, to the pleasant aroma  of fried wolf and potatoes.  Grumpily, and both half clothed, Hoku and Paren stumbled out of Paren’s room.  The bar appeared to be empty, explaining the massive headaches of the two.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Here, have some tea.  Toxullia Tea, your favorite Hok.”  Both moved to grab a cup when Ulla said, “I made it myself.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No offense Ull, but I have no idea how you and Rillen managed to survive on your own, you both are horrible cooks.”  Paren had not meant to be so blunt, but the effects of the liquor still hung about him as did the smell of elvish wine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ll have you know the dragons of Velious loved my cooking, as did those picky Coldain.”  Both dragons and coldain have been notoriously known for eating anything placed before them, whether it be raw or cooked.  <br>
 “Oh, everyone, I went to see Bren this morning.  Hes doing fine and the clerics have released him to our care.  I brought him here, but Kalandia and Kakmer insisted on coming, at least until he is no longer bed-ridden.  He was resting in his room but he should be awake by now.”  Stated a calm, yet slightly excited Rillen.<br>
As they approached the door, they saw Kakmer, standing in all his glory blocking the door.  “The chubby gnomes workin on Brenan at the moment, come back later and you can see him.”  <br>
“I heard that you ugly cow!  Chubby! Hmmpf!”  came a voice from inside the room.<br>
“Well, is anyone up for a nice swim?”  Hoku and Paren decided to stay and take a long needed bath while Forna, Rillen, and Ulla headed outside, stripping down to their undergarments as they went.  As the reached the edge of the pool, Forna dove in and swam to the other side leaving the two alone.<br>
“Ull, I had a dream last night.  During the first battle, and the fight against Sathir, I…lost control of myself.  I don’t quite know what’s going on with me, and I’m afraid.  I may have to go for a while, I need to find out who, or what I am.  The lady from my dream called me a Shi’an, and gave me a book.  I must go, soon.  You and the others can stay here, I will reinforce the shield and open a gate to Erudin for you.  The master has allowed me to leave a permanent opening to the palace in one of his chambers.”  <br>
“Alright.”  With that, she bent her fingers, spoke the words of the arcane, and her travel gear appeared next to her.  “When do we leave, you know there is nothing you can do without me Rillen Terrant, and I will not allow you, my husband, to escape me so easily.”  She dove beneath the crystal waters leaving nothing in her wake before he could rebuttal.<br>
“That wife of mine”  he shook his head and at that point, he noticed Forna, who had slipped away and had apparently listened to his short speech.<br>
“A shi’an hu, I’ve heard of them.  The monks have taught that Shi’an are people that have managed to ‘master themselves.’  The greatest of monks have been known to have been called Shi’an, they know every inch of themselves and can control their actions perfectly, but we believe that a state of Shi’an is nothing one is born with, but something achieved.  Yes, some the mastery comes more easily to, but all have the capability to do so.  If you are going, I to will follow, and you know I am just as stubborn as your wife.”  She winked and said, “If not more so.”  She, just as gracefully as Ulla slipped into the water and swam through the tunnels to where Ulla had gone.  <br>
* * *<br>
She found Ulla crying on the ledge of a rocky outcropping in one of the underwater caverns.  “What is it Ull?”<br>
“Rillen, he’s going to leave me again.  And if he does, I don’t know if I will be able to stand it.”<br>
“What do you mean, ‘again.’”<br>
“Me and Rillen did not set out for Velious together, I followed his trail and met up with him in the wastes.  He had originally not wanted me to come for fear of my safety, but I then assured him I would be fine.  When we were married in the way of the dragons, we were bound together in more than the way of conventional marriages.  Our lives are bound, but he knows nothing of it.  Only the woman can feel the ties, and if he leaves me again, I am unsure if I will be able to survive emotionally, or physically.  I love him more than life itself, and he I, but he fears for me.  I can sense it in his heart.  He is unable to control this power that he harbors within himself, and that scares him.  He is afraid that until he can master it, he will be endangering us all, but what he doesn’t understand is that by leaving us, by leaving me, he is hurting us more than he could ever by staying.  A blind dragon confronted me on the day of my marriage telling me that she saw in my future pain, death, and great sadness.  She could not have been more obscure, and none of her predictions have yet to come into fruition, but still….”<br>
“Everything will be fine Ull, I won’t let Rillen leave you, I won’t let him leave any of us.  He is my best friend, well, one of five of my best friends, and I help my friends the only way I know how, with my fists.  He will go and we will follow.”  The tears on Ulla’s cheeks dried somewhat and she heart feltedly thanked Forna for her wisdom.<br>
“You are right of course, but if I know Rillen, he’s probably already gone.”  The both swam out of the tunnel and up to the beach.  On the sandy shore was a letter with Ulla’s name on it.  “He has gone, I knew he would” she whimpered.  She stated more firmly, “But I will follow.”<br>
“WE will follow Ull, together, we will.  Once Brenan is ready in a few days, we will set out to find him, I believe I already know where he is headed.  As a child I stumbled across an old text explaining some of that which comprises a Shi’an.  Although the records of the monks refer generally to monk Shi’an, or Grand Masters as we have come to call them, there is a tale of a high elven mage, who was said to have been able to conjure acidic rain that would dissolve the rain of a druids before it hit the ground, fire bolts large enough to engulf a house, and the largest of elementals.  Her name was Ulla.  It is said her laboratory and library were in Felwithe.  I believe it is there that Rillen will first go, but you say Rillen and you befriended the Dragons of velious?  They are the oldest of the gods children, and some may remember previous Shi’an, and have information for him.  He may go to them, I am unsure.”<br>
“Rillen has never been one to readily except the help of another for a task that he himself can do.  If there are equal reasons for him to go to the dragons and the laboratory of the shi’an Ulla, than I am certain he will go to see what Ulla had uncovered about their power.  Most likely he will already be in Felwithe searching for her tomb, we must go with haste.  I have a friend in the palace who can get us there as quickly as possible, and Rillen said he had opened a gate for us in the house to there.  Hurry and tell Hoku and Paren of the predicaments.  This task is not an onerous one, so I will require none of your assistance.  Brenan needs your emotional support more than I.”  As Forna ran down the hill to the quaint home of her friends, she shouted, “You are my sister in all but blood, I will not leave you!”<br>
* * *<br>
As Ulla opened her closet to change into her battle gear, she found the portal Rillen had opened.  Brenan had recovered enough to the point where he could do basically anything, but casting clerical magics were extremely taxing still.  She had promised to allow her companions to accompany her, but if she left now it would be hours, if not days, before they could catch up.  With that thought, she hitched up her skirt and stepped through the portal, arriving next to the fountain inside the Erudin palace.  Looking around she identified the wizard guild and went to find her friend.  <br>
From behind her Ulla heard a shout.  “Ulla, its been months, years actually.”  She turned around and hustling to get to her was her friend, Wren.  As Ull saw her, all the memories of fighting together with Wren came back.  Before she had ever met Rillen, Forna, Bren, And Par, Wren had been her best friend.  The tiny gnome was an odd sight among the seemingly giant erudites, but she had an aura of self confidence that said she was not one to be trifled with.  Wren had been adopted by the couple living next to Ulla’s own family.  Having no children of their own, the couple adopted Wren and raised her as their own.  She had been trained as a wizardess and Ulla and her had fought together as initiates.  Many beetles and skunks had felt the fires of Ulla and Wren.  <br>
“Hi Wren, I’m afraid this isn’t a visit of pleasure.  I need your help, but I have no time to explain.  I need to get to Felwithe as quickly as possible, think you can help me out?”  Wren raised her eyebrow, “alright, no questions asked, but I’m coming too.  I’ve heard of your numerous adventures and its far time I’ve left this stuffy library or dust and old men who soon will become dust.”  She raised her hands and began the incantation to take them to the forests of the elves.  Purple and Blue sparks fluttered through the air and the pair materialized between the four spires on the path to the marble city of the high elves.<br>
As they walked, Ulla asked her friend if she knew anything of the arch-mage Ulla.  “I know of only one arch-mage named Ulla and that would be you Ulla.  The masters are angry with your exploits, but they respect the power you have become able to command.  If you returned home, within a few years, you would command the title of arch-mage.”  Silence remained until the arrived outside the gates of Felwithe.<br>
“It reminds me of home Wren, the grace, the white arches.”<br>
“I’m not surprised.  It was the dwarves who designed and supervised the building of both cities.  It amazes me how they can produce such wonderful pieces of architecture, yet have such a hovel as a home for themselves.”  They walked past the gate, bowing to the guards, to the headmaster of the arcane.  Pushing past the novices and guards in the room, Ulla daringly approached the headmaster, “Sir, I have come seeking the tomb of the Shi’an Ulla.  I have reason to believe her tomb and laboratory are harbored within your walls and the knowledge contained within is vital to my survival.”  She wasn’t telling a complete lie in the fact that her life essentially hang in the fact that she needed to find her husband, and if he wasn’t here, there might be evidence within which could point her to him.<br>
“Shi’an Ulla, I know nothing of that which you speak of, and if you are to address this court, you are to go through the proper procedures.  Good day!”  The master said matter-of-factly to them as he walked away.<br>
“Than can you tell me of my husband, Rillen.  I have reason to believe he is here.”  Master El’riangalthin stopped in his step and slowly turned to face them.  <br>
“You are Ulla, wife of Rillen, savior of the city Firiona Vie?”<br>
“I am and I have come seeking my husband.  Like I said, I have reason to believe he is here, and that the knowledge of the location of the tomb of the Shi’an Ulla would greatly help me.”<br>
“Follow me.”<br>
* * *<br>
Rillen, with the permission of the king, had entered the library of the elves.  He knew exactly what he was looking for, a small leather book bound in a red hide.  Within minutes, he had found it and had decrypted the location of the tomb.  He didn’t know how he knew the head master would be of no help, and that the book twin to his own was the one he needed, but he knew that something was urging him forward, and he was never one to question his own hunches.  He turned to the eight page and read, “And the ancient Shi’an Ulla had been buried along with her research under the oculus of magic.”  Having known an oculus was an old term for the focal point at the top of a dome, it took him literally no time to find the tomb.  The portal beneath the waters there had been rusted shut and, even through spells, would not budge.  Short ranged teleportation spells had no chance of getting through, and there seemed to be no other entrance other than the rusty portal.  When he placed his gloved hand a last time upon the door, a voice spoke, “Only the mage may enter, no other.”  Rather than waste time on such an obvious dead end, Rillen opened a gate leading to the land of the dragons, who he hoped would be able to help him, from himself.  <br>

“So you know of the location of her tomb Master El’riangalthin?”  asked an anxious Ulla, who sounded as if she had more motives in finding to the tomb that finding her husband.  The idea of reading the notes of one of the greatest, yet most obscure mages was intriguing.  <br>
“Please, call me El’ri, and not exactly.  The council of ages past came to the decision that not one person should be deemed fit to have complete control over our greatest landmark.  Only two others know of the tomb, and it is they we must see.  I myself was flabbergasted that you even knew of the arch-mage, and I still can offer no guarantee that you will be allowed entrance for although you helped us save our outpost in kunark, no person has ever been recorded as having entered the tomb.  There are no precedents, and there are but six tomes throughout the world that contain knowledge of Ulla.  We have sought to destroy them, but have yet been able to acquire them.”<br>
“Why do you seek to destroy your heritage, and the pride of your people?  I have only recently heard the word Shi’an for the very first time, but I believe they are something of a rarity, and something your race should be proud of.”  <br>
“Your right Ulla, but we no not of what is inside and we do not seek to unleash anything hazardous upon the world.  Ancient spells of untold power, and beasts of hidden strengths may lay within.  Ulla was known her….collections of rare animals.  And here we are, Deri and Eldren should be inside, it is up to you to go inside and persuade them to permit you to enter.  Once you have their permission, we may go get the key.  She walked up the pristine white marble steps and past the magnificent oak doors into the     large room where the two leaders of the mage and wizard guilds sat sipping of a tea that reminded Ulla, much like the architecture, of her home.  <br>
“Hello Madam, Sir, My name is Ulla Terrant, and I have come to ask of you your permission for me to be allowed to enter the great tomb of the arch-mage Ulla so that I may find my missing husband.”  All high elves looked alike to their untrained eye, but for some reason, Deri and Eldren looked more akin to each other than most.  The two startled high elves looked up from their tea and spoke in unison, “How do you know of Ulla!”<br>
“Please, I haven’t the time, I swear I shall not harm the magnificent landmark, I need but to see if my husband is within its walls, and to check the archives for information upon his condition.”<br>
“We have no reason to trust you Ulla, what right do you believe you have to use, much less see, the tomb of Ullarinariel Dis’garinion.  You are of a race whose hearts are fickle, and can never be certain.  The heretics of your race only further prove that fact, had you been born of elven blood….but you were not, and therefore, I do not deem you worthy to see the tomb of Ullarinariel.”  <br>
At that moment, El’ri entered and spoke to his fellow masters, “You must allow her to enter!  I know not why I feel so strongly towards it, but I feel, I feel…right about helping her.  Yes, all that we have been taught screams at us to kill her for even knowing of such things, but I sense in her a strength, and only she can control the wonders within the tomb.”<br>
“You have spoken to much already brother, shut up before any more dribble is emitted from that giant trap of yours.  I deny admission Ulla, and I ask of you to finish your business here and leave as soon as possible.  We are done with you now.”  Ulla bowed understandingly and left the audience hall with a sense of regret.  With El’ri and Wren following quickly at her heels, Ulla hastened down the steps and sat by the edge of the pool over which hung the center of sorcery.  <br>
“I wish I could help Ulla, but without their keys, I have no idea where the tomb is, much less, how to open it. All I know is my third of the poem,<br>
 <br>
  <br>
<br>
And beneath the eye of solusek shall the greatest treasure of the elves remain until she whose name is that the same comes to claim her rights.<br>
<br>
“Well, now all we have to do is decipher it, hehe.  Well, Solusek is the god of fire, and wizards tend to be the greatest wielders of fire, so the guild of wizards sounds to be a good start.”  <br>
“Good thinking Ulla, and in dwarven architecture, the eye, or oculus of a building was the focal point of a dome, and I believe there is a dome at the center of the floating wizards guild.  So bellow that, we shall find the door.  But who is she whose name is that the same?” stated Wren.<br>
“Isn’t it blatantly obvious?  She whose name is that the same, it is you Ulla.  You bear the name of Ulla, and it is you who shall claim the rights of the greatest elves mage in our history!  I hope that we will need not the other two thirds of the poem, and I warn you again, if we enter, we may be walking to our deaths without the knowledge of that which we need.”<br>
“If the knowledge within will help me find my husband, I am willing to die a thousand times over to see it.  I would beg of you both, that you not follow me into the chamber until I have discerned it to be safe. I will not endanger those who have made sacrifices enough to help me thus far.  And I have doubts as to whether I will be allowed to enter.  Who am I to be allowed entrance into the tomb”<br>
“Do not fill yourself with doubts Ulla, the greatest enemy of the strong is their own sense of weakness.”  The three dropped down into the waste high pool and waded through the chilled waters toward the point beneath the wizards guild.  Beneath the towering building, supported by arches from land, was the pool, and on the wall of earth that the arches sprung from, was a door so rusted over that it appeared as if it would never open.  Wren and El’ri ran up and tried to open the ancient portal to no avail.  “You must open it Ull, the poem says that only you can claim the powers within, so maybe it is only you who may get to them.”  She nodded and stepped up to the door.  With hands clasped on the iron ring, she pulled with all her might.  The door refused to budge.  “Keep pulling!  It has to work!”<br>
“No!, I believe that Ullarinariel would have wanted those who would inherit her strength to have the intelligence to use them, not the brute strength.  Maybe a spell is necessary to open the door.”  Ulla closed her eyes, chanted some arcane words, and contorted her hands.  Acid sprung into being and dribbled down the door hinges, causing the rust and metal to melt off, dribbling into the water.  A voice came from out of no where, “You are Ulla, you may enter!”  The door sprung open with the speed of a cheetah.<br>
“I will be back soon my friends.”  Ulla hitched up her robe and stepped through the door into the dark room.  The door closed shut as soon as she was safely inside.  Torches burst into life and the room was illuminated.  Desks littered with old notes, tables with things unknown in jars, and bookshelves covered the room.  Not a drop of dust had touched anything within.  Her eyes caught a tome open upon a stand.  She walked over and peered down at the page.  <br>
“Throughout my studies I have discovered the power of the Shi’an is not that of which one is born.  It is something acquired, something only the best can achieve.  I think I have finally mastered the abilities I have had since I was a child.  The pain has subsided, and now whenever I need them, the powers come at will.  The power of the ancients flows through my veins, through the veins of all living creatures.  I have discovered how to control myself.  You Ulla, are my successor.  This laboratory is now yours.  Read the incantation bellow.”<br>
She read the words, causing a bright blue flash.  Before her stood a high elf with long ruby red hair.  “Hello my daughter.  You shall inherit the power of the Shi’an.  It is within you, and I will only help you bring it out.  Most must struggle for decades before they can tap into the power of their spirits.  War is imminent, you have no decades.” Ullarinariel stepped up to Ulla and placed her hand on Ulla’s head.  Ferash Inohk Lishu Spirum Dille Renah Gorab!  The red of Ullarinariel hair faded to a dull yellow, and Ulla’s hair seemed to darken.  It took on the color of blood and wavered with power.  “It is done, now you must do what it is that you are destined to do.  Hopefully you will not walk this path alone as I did, well, except for Gan.  On the bookshelf, there is a golden book.  Within is a spell which I should hope you will find useful.  In the corner is a wand, the spell and it are all I have for you.  I hope they are enough.  I will be watching over you my child.”  The image of the most beautiful high elf disappeared, and Ulla was left in wonderment.  She walked over to the corner and grasped the gaudy, gem crusted scepter.  As soon as it’s cold metal touched her skin, she knew where Rillen had gone.  She felt the bond more strongly than ever, he was in velious, and she would find him.  With it looped around her belt, she proceeded to get the golden book.  She opened it, and an old scroll fell out onto the floor.  She bent down, grabbing the scroll.  The words, were in dragon speech, a language she had studied with her husband on velious, but that she had never mastered.  She needed their assistance.  The door sprung open, and she stepped out, meeting El’ri and Wren.  <br>
“I met  Ullarinariel, and now I must go visit the land of the Dragons.  Is there any chance you can translocate me there Wren?  I would ask neither of you to accompany me there, fore the dangers in velious are far greater than anywhere else on this world.”<br>
“Unfortunately, I do not yet have the skill to get you to the land of the dragons, the closest I can you is the Iceclad Ocean.  I am sorry.”<br>
“Than please, send me there.   The farther I wait, the more time Rillen has to escape from me again.”  Wren nodded and within seconds, Ulla had rematerialized at the dragon gate in the Iceclad Ocean.<br>
* * *<br>
Three new dragons had hatched since last Rillen had been to the skyshrine, and everything was crazy.  It did not take much begging for Rillen to be allowed admittance to the enormous library of the dragons.  After two days of searching, he had unearthed some information.  <br>
“Every person has a skill in which they can excel at.  Generally, a mage was predestined to be a mage, and the same with a warrior.  Although these predestinations can be broken, the person will then, most likely, find himself weaker in his chosen class than he would have been in the one of recommendation.  It is these people who we most often find as Shi’an.  They rebelled against their future because it showed to them a future they did not wish.  The dark hearted who were once destined to lead lives as great clerics and paladins, who forsook their future to become necromancers or shadowknights, are those who know themselves more so than others.  It is they who find the strength within.  To gain control over the powers of the Shi’an one must know himself to the fullest, only then will the pain stop, and the wielder be able to control himself.”<br>
“So, I know myself, just not well enough.”  A voice from the back of his mind beckoned, summon me.  I am thyself.  ‘Summon me, I am thyself.  I don’t quite understand.  It spoke again, speak the words, evoke me.  Rillen responded, “I know not how.”  Than you will die, the voice retorted.<br>
* * *<br>
Ulla had traveled through the wastes to Kael Drakken, in which she cast a spell of invisibility upon herself to get past the guards posted throughout the city.  Once outside in the wakening lands, it was but a mere twenty minute walk to the outpost of the dragons, skyshrine.  “Hullo sir, I am Ulla, and I have come in search of my husband, and in need of help.”  The dragon to whom Ulla had addressed turned around, and upon seeing her, greeted her fondly.<br>
“Ulla, we have missed you and your humorous husband.  He has been here for the past few days, why were you not with him?  Well, I wont delay you, he’s in the library.  Oh, and congratulations.”<br>
“Congratulations? For what?” she responded.<br>
“Never mind, follow me, I will take you to your husband.”  Through a spell of illusion, Keri, the dragon whose child’s life had been saved by Ulla herself, turned into an erudite not intirely unlike Ulla.  “Oh, by the way, what happened to you.  Your hair, your skin, your POWER.  Only now am I truly noticing it, but it has grown exponentially since last we met.  Well, never mind, we’re here.  Your husbands inside, he hasn’t left the library for the last three days.”  <br>
“Rillen?”<br>
“Ulla?! What are you doing here.  Your supposed to be in Erudin, with our friends.  Why did you come?  I don’t understand.  What happened to you!”  <br>
“Oh shut up.”  Ulla brusquely walked over to her husband, kneed him in the groin, and kissed him, both at the same time.  “Never, never leave me again Rillen Terrant.”<br>
“I’m sorry Ull, I was just afraid for you, but now it appears it is I who should be afraid.  I have discovered that without coming into myself, I will die.  A voice told me it is you who can help me.  I need to…summon this…thing within me.  Have you any idea what it was talking about.”  <br>
“I came to find you, the bonding from our marriage harms me if we are not together, plus, I love you, and I was given the Shi’an powers of the arch-mage Ullarinariel for some ‘great war’ that is to come.  And I believe that the spell you require is in my possession, I just need dragonic assistance to translate it.  She shouted out to Keri, her voice enhanced by her power.  “I need you to translate this into the language of the arcane Keri, please.  She handed the scrap of paper that she had found in the golden book in Ullarinarial’s laboratory to Keri.  Keri summoned a vial of ink and with a finger, now a talon, she scrawled upon the paper her translation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thanks Keri, now Rillen, read this with me, I believe we are both meant to read it.”  The two voices rang out like clear crystal, Teral Kye Duran Shi Envo Tiluk Rivum an ko Nallae!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before the pair appeared two small creatures.  In front of Rillen stood, or I should say flew, a small dragon.  And before Ulla hovered a plump pink bear with tiny wings. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hello Rillen, my name is Chirokanisalanitanimarieleshinektor.  I, am your familiar.”  Growled the small ruby dragon.  “And I, Ulla, am your warder.  My name is Delinorikskartanabilliustar.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t understand, what is a, familiar.”  “And what is a warder?, and do you have shortened forms of your names?”  inquired Ulla.   <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dragon responded, “You may call me Chiro, and a familiar is a creature whose own spirit is tied to his master, much like the bond you and your husband share Ulla, only less intimate, and in other ways, more so.  Warders are very similar, only for magicians.  They are allowed to change form according to the whim of the mage, whilst I shall always remain in this corporeal form.  Due to both your extraordinary powers, we are allowed to commune with you, had you been less of sorcerers, we would not be able to.  When a mage summons an elemental, she does not bring with it its self, only its physical form.  We are like elementals in the way that we are here to serve you, but the similarities end there.  I, Rillen, am no fighter.  I may aid you only by enhancing your magical abilities.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And I Ulla, am your gaurdian.  Think of me as a sentient elemental with whom you are forever bound to.”  Piped in Deli.  “Oh, and you may call me Deli.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rillen, lets go home.  I sense that soon, we won’t be able to enjoy such luxuries as bathing together under the moon light.  War will be upon us, and I don’t want to waste what precious time I have.”  At that moment, Ulla got a telepathic message from Keri, “Your pregnant!”<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deli and Chiro were off playing in the woods as Rillen and Ulla sat side by side in the shallows of the pool.  Paren and the rest had gone to Qeynos ‘bar-hopping.’  Ulla sat lazily and slipped into the water.  She had gotten quite large in the last four months, as had her sister Hoku.  She summoned herself quite a large glass of brandy and drained the entire glass in a single swallow.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You alright Ull, normally your not so tipsy.  Is something on your mind?”  Ulla stood up and swaggered over to her husband.  Her last drink had not been her first. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your whats the matter!  Tell me, what is it.  There’s something your hiding from me Rill-hiccup-en.  Please tell me, I hate it when you hide things.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Its nothing, there’s nothing.  Everythings perfect.”  Quickly retorted Rillen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No it’s not Rillen Tarrant.  I’m so damn tired of your tirades!  Why can’t you ever except help you arogant, pompous man!  Something IS wrong and your going to except me @#%$ help this time!”  shouted Ulla.  “And if you don’t, I can’t guarantee that I will come for thee again Rillen Tarrant.”  She said more solemnly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s the fire Ulla.  Its burning within me, burning ME.  Your abilities were awoken within you, and although you can’t control them, Ullarinariel managed to stop that which is happening to me from happening to you.  It’s getting more and more frequent and I think..”  There was a long silent pause.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You think what Rill? What is it?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I Think, that if I don’t manage to quell the flames, they will consume me, but I will not allow that to happen.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nor will I!”  exclaimed a resolute Ulla.<br>
* * *<br>
A small, yet imposing, dark elf man sat with his head down upon a bench of black marble.  His robe had that look to it.  It appeared to be black, but yet, was not.  Black is a color, while this robe seemed to have a lacking in color, a lacking in substance.  His stark flowing white hair served a contrast to further bring out his features.  As he stood up, Rillen noticed that the ‘he’ was actually a she, a very shapely she at that.  “Hello Rillen of the flames.  Finally you have arisen.  It’s taken you long enough!  It is time to fulfill our destiny Rillen, it is time.”<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Who are you, where are we, and what destiny?”  asked Rillen with a somewhat impatient tone.  He wondered, why does this always happen to me.  Why does it always seem as if I’m the only one left out in the dark.  <br>
“You may call me Venira.  Were we are does not matter.  And for your third question.  You truly know not of your destiny.  The prophecy of the children of power.  Ha!  So much power yet such a fool.  You are a Shi’an, haven’t you realized what that means!”<br>
“No, I have not realized what it means!  And I would be pleased if you would not speak to me in such a damned condescending tone!”<br>
“I will speak to you however way I chose to!”  Venira spat.  “I thought all Shi’an were gifted with intelligence, I guess those of the Eruditic race were not!”<br>
“Why did you summon me.  If only to mock me, then you have wasted your time for I care not about your opinion wench!”  <br>
“I am no wench!  I summoned you to prepare you!  The final battle approaches.  It is their were our destiny lays, our destiny to die!”<br>
“Tell me Venira, what do you know of….our people.  The Shi’an.”<br>
“Alright Rillen, you deserve as much, to know what you are.  Many millennia  ago, there was no magic, no prayers to benevolent gods, and warriors had yet to develop effective fighting techniques.  There were no cities, and the continents were separated.  The mortals were weak, mere playthings of the gods.  This was not meant to be.  As god invoked thunder decimating the mortal populations, and earthquakes shattering what little hovels they called homes, a few people discovered within themselves a power known only to us.  At first, the gods saw these people, and claimed them as their own, saying that only creations of the gods could have such power.  They became known as the children of the gods.  The most powerful were the child of healing, to represent all that is good, the child of hate, to represent all that is bad, and the child of fire, to hold the two sides in balance.  As they were poked and prodded by their gods, they became irritated and rebelled.  This was called the War of the Gods.  Factions broke out, Shi’an and gods joined forces to slay the others of their kind.  Many gods were slain, all shi’an were killed, but mortals may procreate, Gods may not.  The ability to become a Shi’an is open to all, but few have ever become Shi’an.  Those who do, were born with a spark already lit within them.  It is these people whom the fearful gods have slain, before they can once again challenge the powers of the gods.  There are thirty three gods living as far as my knowledge, and each have now chosen a new child.  I know not if we are of the thirty three ‘chosen’ or cursed I should say for most will inevitably die, or if we are mere ‘regular’ Shi’an.  And whether or not the thirty fourth god, the nameless, has chosen a child is unknown, for if he has, we may all die.  Good night Rillen.”  She waved her hand, her robe flowing behind it, and Rillen’s world turned black.  <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He awoke sitting up in bed, wearing the same clothes he had on when he had met Venira, NOT the same clothes he had on when he went to sleep.  Was his visit with her a dream, or reality.  Better yet, had he made the dream a reality.  Was Venira real, had they shared a dream together, or had she somehow summoned him?  Yes, she had to have been real.  He saw his wife, lying next to him, Deli and Chiro curled up next to each other in the corner, and a flame out of the corner of his eye.  He turned his head to the side and saw an aged man, with flaming hair and a flaming spear.  Solusek Ro!  He remembered the words of Venira, and how the gods feared and hated the Shi’an.  The words to the spell: shadow step came to mind.  If he could reach Ulla, grab her, shadow step them out of the house, and teleport them away, they may escape.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Relax Rillen, if I wanted you dead, you would be.”  The god laughed at that.  “I have come not to harm you.  Unlike my brethren, I was one of the few those many years ago who refused to chose a Shi’an as a pupil, instead, I had one thrust upon me.  I thought the whole idea of treating humans in such a manner was bestial, we were wrong, and for that, many of us paid with our lives, but enough of that.  I have come to tell you, and your wife, that the hour of the dawn draws near.  You both will be needed to stand against the assault.  The prophecy has existed for thousands of years.  <br>
The son of fire<br>
Shall light the way<br>
For all to follow<br>
Away from the darkness<br>
That has shrouded them so<br>
The fires of purgatory<br>
Shall burn bright for many years<br>
But only for those<br>
Who fear him<br>
Their armies will fall<br>
New nations born<br>
Like a pheonix<br>
Life will rise again<br>
It is he who will cure the world<br>
Of the taint<br>
That will infect it<br>
Ignis Summa Pugabat<br>
 <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ignis Summa Pugabat, the fire will cleanse the world Rillen, the fire will cleanse the world.  We are afraid Rillen, for the second time on our lives, we are afraid.  And we will not stay to die.  A shadow looms over the Faydwer as we speak.  Danger is imminent.  I seek only to keep the balance.  I sense the child of fire will soon awaken, and death will follow in his wake, but so will life.  I seek ONLY to keep the balance.  Good bye my son, it is time for us to leave.”  The god spun his spear before him and disappeared in a flash of smoke, leaving Rillen yet again with more questions than answers.  He walked over to his wife and shook her awake.  He bent down and kissed her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ulla, I love you.”  He spoke as a tear rolled down his cheek.<br>
* * * <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That morning, Rillen wrote a note to his friends, warning them of the impending danger.  He also made it clear that he did not want them following him and his wife the Faydwer, for he sensed that soon, the Faydwer would not be the only place worrying about dark clouds.  He know there was nothing he could do to stop Ulla from going, but he was gonna damn well try to keep his friends out of danger.  Minutes later, Rillen, Ulla, Deli, and Chiro arrived at the wizard spires in the Greater Faydark.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What’s wrong with the sky!”  Rillen looked up and indeed, the sky was gray.  Something was definitely wrong.  They heard faint screams coming from the west.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “C’mon! lets go.”  Spoke a hurried Rillen.  They ran quickly through the gray wood, arriving at Kelethin.  They found it no different from when they normally visited the lofty trees of the elves, but as they looked closer at the faces of the once care-free elves, they noticed a change.  Their faces were haggard and worn.  Their skin seemed taut, and pale.  No longer did smiles decorate their faces, the twinkle in their eyes was gone.  They heard a wail off in the distance.  Hurrying across the treetop bridges, they arrived in front of the druid guild.  An elderly woman was their, praying on her knees.  Tears streamed down her face.  “Karana, he has left me.”  Her wails echoed throughout the branches.  “I know longer feel his presence, he is gone!”  She clutched her knees and rocked back and forth.  At closer inspection….<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Merinda?  Is it you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ulla, nooooooooo, Ullas dead, in Velious.”  She had a crazed look in her eyes.  A smile spread across her face.  “No Meri, I’m here.”  Ulla went over and comforted Meri.  “Oh Meri, everything will be alright.”  The ominous clouds let loose and snow began to fall.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And now E’ci has left us. Soon, we will be without our gods.”  Meri opened her eyes and peered at Rillen.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rillen?  Is that you? Noooooooooo, he died toooooo.  Get out of my head, get out!”  She clutched her head and more tears streamed down her face.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It is me Meri, my old friend.”  He went over to touch her, but she stood up and backed away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Stay away from me you demons!  Your dead!  You both died, stay away!”  Meri ran to the edge of the platform and leapt off without a second glance.  Rillen tried to cast a spell of levitation, but was not quick enough.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Meri!!!!!!!!”  Ulla gasped in horror as her friend plummeted to the forest floor.  “Damn you Karana! Damn you!!!!”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen stormed into the Druidic guild, a few meters away.  He demanded to speak with Shi’el, who quickly came to his assistance.  Although the Koada’dal and Fier’dal races were said to be unified, they were not to the degree people are led to believe.  The king of the Koada’dal has no reign within Kelethin, and it is widely known that Shi’el, the druidess, is regarded as the queen of the Fier’dal.  “Merinda is dead!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She was already dead inside Rillen.  About a week ago, the druids of Karana began to feel as if Karana had weakened, three days ago, they no longer felt his presence at all.  Two days ago, insanity began to set in.  Meri was the last to live, the rest had already taken their lives.  We mourn for them, but fear for our own sanity right now, as should you.”<br>
“The gods are leaving this plane.  There is a prophecy in which, they believe, foretells the death of the gods.  Karana and E’ci have gone already.  Others may have already gone as well.”<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I can not believe that Tunare would abandon her children.”<br>
“She may not.  The gods fear for their lives, but that does not mean they shall abandon their creations, their children.  Never the less, I fear the dark clouds flying above the Faydark symbolize something far darker than rain.”<br>
“I pray you are wrong Rillen.”<br>
* * *<br>
Rillen and Ulla had rented rooms at the local inn, The Green Leaf.  They lay side by side together in the small bed meant for a single elf.  Chiro and Deli slept together at the foot of the bed.  “Ull, I’m going to be taking another trip.  I must know what the gods are planning, so that we may decide what to do, and the gods aren’t the sort of people you can just call upon.  I need your help.  I need access to the plane of the sun, but I have no knowledge of how to do so.  I must speak with Solusek Ro.  He has always assisted the mortal kind, he may help us in our hour of need.”  The sound of hail pelting the roof outside stood further to show the distress of the elves.  <br>
“I….I know how.  When Ullarinariel gave me her abilities, some of her knowledge was passed on to me.  To gain access to the plane of fire, you need only incant these words.”  She opened her hands, which were soon filled with pen, ink, and paper.  She scribed down the words for the spell.  “But Rillen, there is an urge in the back of my head telling me, we should not go, we should not meddle in the affairs of the gods.  But I know you too well don’t I Rillen, shall we go?”<br>
Before he had a chance to respond, Ulla began to recite the words to the spell.  “Wait, Ull, can you cast it?  You’re a umm, mage.”<br>
“Ullarinariel did, and she passed down to me the powers she retained, so I am most certain I can.”  Rillen, content with this stood back as his wife recited the harsh spidery words to the spell.  With her hands, Ulla pulled open a doorway in reality.  A flaming doorway appeared before them.  “After you.”  <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The flaming doorway closed abruptly as the pair emerged in the plane of the sun.  The scent of brimstone was lain heavily in the air.  Molten lava flowed freely near were the pair stood.  With a pair of batwings, and a pair of words, Rillen had them both hovering above the ground.  “Just in case.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sky itself was a myriad of red and gold hues.  Before them stood an exquisite temple of red marble, not an impure vein within it.  Pillars of pure gold held the loft building up.  Ebony doors stood open.  “Well, at least the doors open.”  Timidly, they stepped into the temple. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before them stood Solusek Ro in all his glory.  His crown of flames blazed, his spear writhed as if in pain, and his golden armor shined like the sun.  Even then, he had a haggard and worn look on his face.  “Come to wish me farewell eh?  We will all be leaving soon.  Some of us have left already.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You too will join their ranks Solusek?  You fear the child of flames?  You will abandon us in our hour of need?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It is willed that I go, and we have been banned from directly interfering in the mortal realm.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Who is it that has the power to tell a god what he can not do.  What has happened to you Solusek?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The shadow.  Good bye Rillen and Ulla Terrant.  Watch over each other, if you don’t, who else will.”  Solusek raised his right hand, and sent the pair back to their room at the Green Leaf.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen shook his head, too many damn questions!  With that, he fell asleep.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoku and Bren had decided to go home after being kicked out of several bars.  With a gate spell, they were both back in the comfort of their friends home.  A quick search produced the note written by Rillen.  They decided to sleep on what to do, whether to obey his request, or follow him.  Quickly they collapsed onto their own beds of soft down.  Ahhhhhhhh!  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Bren, are you alright!”  Hoku ran from her room.  She found Brenan on the ground crying.  “What is it Bren, what is it?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Quellious, he’s, he’s….gone.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What do you mean, he can’t be gone.  Gods don’t just vanish.”  She bent over and closely hugged her old friend.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “He is gone Hok.  Gone.”  Sleep did not come easily to either of them that night.  They succumbed to the frightening clutch of sleep only when they could no longer keep it at bay.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoku’s sleep was restless and traumatic.  Her transparent night gown fit tightly to her as beads of sweat dripped down her body.  Terris Thule had visited her many times that night.  She saw visions of Paren and her sister being slain.  Blood splattered upon her slippers. Flaming death rained upon the city of Kelethin.  She found herself outside, in the dark of the wood.  Little moonlight filtered through the dense foliage.  The shadows before her……rose and became a woman.  Hoku cringed at the sight of her, for she was the antithesis of life.  Her skin, her hair, her eyes, instead of filling space, seemed to be an absence of it.  A crooked smile plastered the dark woman’s face.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I welcome you my child.”  Fear kept Hokulani rooted to her place as the shadow walked up to her.  She feared for her unborn child, for her sister, for her lover, for life itself.  It placed it’s full lips upon Hoku’s voluptuous breasts.  A black mark was left upon her left chest, and she smiled in return.  She no longer feared.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fear spread throughout the Faydwer as the water level rose rapidly.  The Koada’dal and dwarves had fled to the loft trees of Kelethin to weather out the unnatural storm.  Both Kaladim and Felwithe had been flooded.  The gnomes of Ak’anon had managed to stop the flow with a series of pressurized doors.  The only casualties had been due to the scuffle over the design in their making.  Life resumed in Kelethin, if only a bit different.  The Koada’dal took to fishing off the sides of the city, while the dwarfs assisted the elves in their inferior blacksmithery.  Had it not been so damnably cold, it could have been said the three races actually enjoyed this not-so-natural disaster, but the cold served to heighten tension between the masses.  The people of the faydwer were not prepared for such cold weather.  Many elves died due to exposure.  Ice covered the trees and homes of the elves.  The trees began to die.  Ulla and Rillen did what they could to assist the remaining few druids with keeping the city warm, but the heat of the fires just seemed to fly away in the chill air.  Chiro did what he could, using his small flaming breath to light fires here and there, but it wasn’t enough.  They had been invited to a council that night, in the druidic guild, to decide the future of the elves.  The sun soon set and was replaced by the pale light of the moon.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Soon the sun may not even grace us with its warm glow.”  Solemnly stated Rillen, as he and his wife walked to the druid guild.  Hail pelted the wooden platform they stood upon.  There was silence between the two as they approached their destination.  They were late, shouting could be heard coming from within the guild house.      Damn idiots Rillen thought to himself, remembering the generals of Firiona Vie.  They pushed open the doors and took seats without a scene.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The room was of oak paneling of the darkest variety.  Bright candles illuminated the scene, of a smattering of dwarves, fier’dal, and koada’dal, sitting around a wooden table that seemed to grow out from the floor itself.  On closer inspection, Rillen realized it actually was a Tree branch sticking up through the floor itself.<br>
“Ahh, so you have finally decided to join us”  Snidely jeered a high elf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We are wholly sorry for our tardiness, but we were detained by the weather.  Again, I apologize.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An aged feir’dal spoke up, “tis alright Rillen, you have no need to apologize.  Erithenel is just agitated due to this odd weather, we all are.  On behalf of the elven people, I thank thee for assisting us….again.”  He bowed his head in honor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A grizzled dwarf from the back of the room spoke up.  “I say we attack!  If we launch an assault soon, we may catch them off guard.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Attack whom my dear sir?  The very elements themselves?  I am unsure but I believe clouds and ice do not feel the bite of thine axe.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The damnable tier’dal and their troll allies.”  He spat out the words troll and tier’dal with venom on his tongue.  “It is they who plague us with this foul weather.  Their very pressense offends me!”    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shi’el politely piped in, “Have you proof of these accusations?  I believe it is the absence of the gods that is the cause of our plight.  Karana left and we had rain, E’ci left, and ice fell from the sky.  Never before has this happened, surely the tier’dal have not the power to control the very elements themselves, lest they would have used them prior to now.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your words are wise Shi’el.  I believe evacuation is needed.  I know this sounds drastic, but if the water level should rise to the level of the city, casualties will be countless.  Leaving ones home is a terrible thought, but it is what I deem necessary.”  Suspicious murmurs resounded throughout the room, “evacuate?, never!”  Shi’el, in all her wisdom noticed the dissention.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Erithenel, with frustration painted across his broad face, spoke, “You know not what you ask of us Rillen.  Our blood runs through these trees, our spirits are tied into the soil itself.<br>
“I know Rillen’s thoughts of evacuation are drastic, but maybe necessary.  Although this is not your home Rillen, so that it is completely impossible for you to comprehend what you ask of us, I do believe you are right.  We are not prepared for the chill of the ice, nor the deep waters that now plague us.  If we do not drown, we will die of hunger.  In addition, once the water level has dropped, I assure you we will be able to return here to our homes.”  Grudgingly, the majority of the people agreed that evacuation was necessary for the survival of their races.<br>
“How shall we go about evacuating roughly fifteen hundred men and women?  Many of our druids can no longer cast spells of teleportation.  Garinel, how many wizards do you have available to you?”<br>
“Fifty, give or take a few Shi’el.  Not nearly enough to evacuate the entire population.”  Sorrow and despair cursed those in that room.<br>
“Actually Garinel, I learned of something called a ‘spell circle’ while in velious.  Were you at the battle of Firiona Vie?  My wife and I taught the wizards and mages there a rudimentary form of them.  Basically, one can greatly enhance the effects of a spell by working together with another.  With fifty wizards…..I do believe we can do it.”<br>
A spark of hope lit up Garinel’s face.  “Great, I shall gather them!  Shi’el, do you think you can prepare your people, Erithenel, you yours, and Grunan, can you ready the dwarves?  How long will it take you to teach my men Rillen.”<br>
“If they prove to be apt pupils, a day, two at the most.”<br>
“Wonderful, three days from now, have your peoples congregate around the center of the city.”<br>
“Erith, where shall I instruct your elves to teleport everyone to?  I believe Toxullia forest is the best spot, have you a better idea?”<br>
“Toxullia will be fine, one of the three greater spires would be best, and obviously we can’t use the one here, and north karana is home to many dangerous beasts.  Yes, the toxullia forest is perfect, will it be alright with your people Rillen?”<br>
“I sincerely doubt they will even notice, many of my people in all their years have left the lofty walls of Erudin.”<br>
“Wonderful!  In three days time, we shall meet in the heart of Kelethin, and We will be saved.”<br>
* * *<br>
In the dead of night, stood a magnificent woman.  Her long black-brown hair hung loosely half-way down her back.  Her tight robe revealed a form that would please any man, and her almost elven eyes showed off the wonderful color within them.  Black fire burned behind the purple of her eyes.  Voices whispered to her from within her head.  She was racked with pain, yet she didn’t seem to feel it.  Desire consumed her entire being.  She burned for the touch of another, ANY other.  In the dead of night, she ran towards the gates of the city of high men.  Through the fog, she saw the lofty pillars of marble, which sheltered the gate to Erudin, and the rigid men of quellious, guarding those very pillars.  What discipline and love for their home these men must have to stand so sternly guarding the very gates to it.  These thoughts please her, she yearned to touch them.  To FEEL them.  Urges rushed through her, blood pumping quickly.  Seductively, she sashayed over to the guards.  The swing in her step, showing off her shapely hips, mesmerized the guards.  She approached the man, sweat falling in beads down his head, and caressed his face with her supple fingers.  A brilliant flash of light flared in his eyes, which, when died down, left a murky coating over his dark hazel eyes.  The other guard, detecting something amiss, drew his sword and placed its tip at the base of her skull.  “Don’t move!”  Slowly, she turned around to face him.  At the sight of her eyes, her deep purple eyes, he lowered the sword and a daze overcame the man.  He was lost in the sea that was her eyes, he didn’t even notice the splendid hand reaching up to stroke his fair skin.  Forever he would be lost in those eyes, those eyes of everything and nothing.<br>
* * *<br>
Rillen sat, with twenty young elves draped in robes of crimson, on the wooden floors of a cramped, barely lit room.  The constant noise of dripping could be heard, as the melting ice leaked through the roof.  The water level had significantly rose over the last day and time was something the elves had little of.  Hurriedly, Rillen instructed those who would be assisting him in the translocation of the entire populous of the cities of Kelethin, Kaladim, and Felwithe.  To begin, they had conjured globes of light.  They were to feel the energy of one another, and shape the whole into the desired outcome.  A few of the novices had been at the defense of Firiona Vie, and new already how to perform the complex ritual of merging powers.  After seven solid grueling hours of conjuring single globes, conjoined globes, and shattering bursts of light, the twenty elves had finally managed to summon two successive giant globes of light.  Sighing to himself, Rillen hoped they would have the time needed, for if they didn’t…<br>
“You are advancing, but you must learn faster!  We have but mere hours, the last class had managed to finish that excersize is but five hours, you must hurry.”  With his palm upturned, Rillen summoned to life a ball of fire.  Tossing it to the wizard on his left he spoke, “Absorb it, absorb its life, its mana, and recreate it, with your own energy added to it.”  He was trying to teach them to feel the mana, not just use it.  He was trying to break the barriers they had put up, restraining themselves with words and gestures.  The elf, who could barely be seventy years of age, fumbled with the ball, but managed to absorb it into himself.  In his other hand, it reappeared…as a tiny ball of frost.  Rillen shook his head in frustration, whispering to himself, “no no no.”  It was going to be a long day.<br>
* * *<br>
This new experience pleasured her.  From the memories of the first man to feel her touch she heard a name, with a longing attached, Lunisha.  The name brought pleasure to her.  She remembered having a name all her own at one point, so she took it for her own.  Lunisha marched past the gates of Erudin into the heart of the city itself.  Her perfect, violet eyes widened as she took in the beauty of the city.  The perfection of the stone, the flashing colors, the people.  New sensations flooded her young being.  The two guards whom she had touched trailed her.  Their own senses burned away with her touch.  Forgotten were family, love, independence.  Again the desire to feel flesh burned through Lunisha’s veins.  She approached a stall, with elegant silk garments hanging on rods of bamboo.  She stroked the smooth fabric, gently with her delicate fingers.  <br>
“Ahh, you like the silk.  May I ask of you your name my dear?”  Tentatively, Lunisha responded, “Lu..Lunisha. My name is Lunisha.”<br>
“How odd, my daughter bears that name, I had no idea another of our kind did.”  A frown plastered the old woman’s forehead.  Were do you hail from, obviously not here.  Are you native to Paineel?”  She spoke the last bit with haste and scorn on her tongue.  Before the old woman noticed, Lunisha darted out her hand and grasped her throat.  She squeezed, causing the aged erudite’s eyes to roll back in her head.  Her fingernails dug into the woman’s neck.  Blood seeped down, flowing over Luni’s hand.  She giggled in delight, as she first experienced pain, through someone else.  The writhing of the dying woman slowed, and finally ceased.  Luni felt the warmth of her hot blood, the warmth of the dead.  As her spirit fled from her body, Luni saw the emptiness, the nothingness, the woman left in the world, and laughed.  <br>
A group of five guards emerging from the guild of prexus noticed the scene and hurried over to see what the matter was.  When they saw the tailor, lying dead on the ground with her blood staining Luni’s hands, they drew their swords.  <br>
“Halt!”  He raised a hand and cast a spell of stunning, so that she could be properly bound.  “Shikath Miser Factu et Cedet!”  Red light flared to light and clashed with Luni’s body.  The sparks of holy energy merely bounced off her resistant skin.  The guard gasped in horror as his strongest spell was resisted by this woman!  He shook his head in frustration as she smiled, raised his sword, and brought it down upon her head.  She elegantly dodged the attack.  In the corner of her eye, she saw her two guards defending her, fighting the other four quite well.  She slipped her hand past the paladin’s guard and lightly touched his face with her fingertips.  Gone from his memory were dreams, hopes, memories, will.  The only thing that remained was a desire to please his mistress.  <br>
“Go!”  The soldier charged his old comrades with no emotion.  His face was void of feeling, he did as ordered and no more.  Maliciously he tore into the flesh of his surprised ex-comrades.  Within seconds, the three had slain the four paladins.  She saw their spirits trying to leave their corporeal bodies.  She raised her slender hand, and pointed at the spirits with her finger.  Gasps of horror, and screams of pain escaped from the pale lips of the souls as their insubstantial forms were dissipated in an unnatural gust of wind.  A sadistic smile painted the wicked face of Lunisha.  She walked silently, as if she were hovering above the ground, where her entourage of guards faithfully following behind.  <br>
* * *<br>
Shi’el and Rillen sat alone, each with a slender goblet of elven wine clutched in their unsteady hands.  Each glass full, untouched, their faces were full of anxiety and fear.  Last night, Rillen had translocated his wife, unaware, to the dark forest of Toxullia.  Pain racked his sides from the power within, he had manged to subdue it, but the power of the Shi’an rested within himself, and burned to be released.  If only he could, if only. The clouds outside the window had darkened from a light gray to a near black.  It looked as if the heavens themselves would open up and rain death upon Norrath’s inhabitants.  Rillen looked up from the swirl of red in his glass towards the exalted druidess.  “They are ready Shi’el, it is time for the spell.  The water is mere feet from the second level platforms, ice rims the eves of the buildings, we must make haste.  Today is the day…”<br>
“Yes, I know, I shall miss these woods, more than you can know, but they are no longer the woods of my youth.  These clouds of gray obscure the sun, the ever living trees have begun to wilt, no, the greater faydark no longer is what it once was.  The majority of the people have gathered around the bank, luckily an alchemist from Halas had been visiting before the rains and we have been able to shrink the majority of the populace so that they will be in a concentrated area.  The platforms for the wizards have been built, the rest of the people are on their way, now we must go.”  As they spoke, they heard the sounds of hundred of shrunken feet heading towards the platform.  They carried with them what they could, what would remind them of their home, and the great tragedy that the loss of the gods had caused for them.  But no tears stained the faces of these hardened people.  Within the sanctity they provided for each other, they would forever be strong.  We will be strong, Shi’el whispered, “We Will.”<br>
The pair walked calmly out of their quite sanctuary into the gloom of the now deadening woods.  Rillen had recently found a spell of levitation, no longer requiring a bat wing.  With a snap of his fingers, and a soft word, he and Shi’el were hovering slightly above the ground, and the miniature people that raced over it.  Quickly, the hastened to the platform, where already a thousand elves had amassed.  The few remaining druids had coaxed the trees into aiding their fleeing inhabitants.  Branches now grew inward, a good four feet across, so that the wizards could stand above their targets while being close enough for the spell to work.  Their eyes drooped and actions had been sluggish, it had been a long last couple of days.  While the wizards of Firiona had been masters of their craft, these are but novices.  Uttering a prayer to Solusek, Rillen ascended to his platform and clasped the hand of an awaiting wizard.  To his right was Garinel, on his left was an unknown wizard, garbed in the lowly wine-colored robes of a novice.  Five minutes passed and a elf raced down one of the ramps.  He shouted over the rain, “The city has been cleared!”  The few large people left, excluding the wizards, drank of little vials, and were soon the size of squirrels.  <br>
Minutes passed in silence as the wizard(ess)s contemplated on what was to come, and the civilians prayed that they would soon have a home among the lofty trees of Toxulia.  They prayed to empty ears.  A gnomish firework went off, signifying the beginning of the spell.  Fifty voices echoed, every syllable was spoken in synch.  <br>
“Miser Catulla Desinas Ineptire et Quod Vides Perisse Perditum Ducas Fulsere Qoundam Candidi tibi Soles!”  Their hands were a blur.  Energy flowed through them all.  Not only their own, but that of their fellow wizards.  The hope of thousands rested on their shoulders, and it was taking a toll.  “Magisse Portam Injuisee Fuisset Scortam Gillium Teranchent et il Duiqwen tu Bellise Dalin!”  In the corner of his eye, Rillen saw the novice wizards shoulders go slack, as he slumped to the ground.  Fear filled Rillen’s mind as he felt that wizards mana dissipate from to spell circle.  He shouted, “Perisse Endura Qoundam tu et Gi’el Tuin Fey qoun Fac!”  <br>
The high elf standing across from Rillen faltered in her speech.  Her pale hair fell limp, and her face went slacken.  Her knees buckled beneath her.  The spell had taken a toll on her as she fell to the ground.  <br>
The words flowed freely from his mouth, but his spirit was failing.  Rillen’s own energy was failing, and the limp bodies of his student lined the ramps of Kelethin.  As he looked down in the crowd of hoping elves, he spotted the tiny face of an elven girl.  He could barely make out her features in the unnatural dark, caused by the black clouds.  She had a wild mat of hair, hanging down halfway down her waist, her tiny waist.  The rain had taken a toll on these people.  Food was scarce and morale was low.  Her eyes looked hollowed, and her skin was pale.  She looked as if she had smeared ash across her fine face.  But hope glittered in her emerald eyes.  The undying hope of a child stood so poignantly in her large curved eyes.  <br>
A ruby tear dripped down his face, he knew the spell had failed.  Only ten wizards remained standing, if that.  They spoke the incantations, and moved their hands, but they had nothing to put forth.  The image of that girl, so full of hope, was ingrained in his mind.  I shall not fail!   <br>
Purple lights flared into being before his hands.  The spell had begun, but it was not enough, there was not enough there.  Rillen poured forth his very essence.  His hair flared into life.  Fire blazed behind his eyes.  Wind rushed up from beneath the platform, lifting it off the support of the branches in a wild rush of power.  <br>
“I will not fail!”  shouted the empowered wizard.  Flames rushed down his arms, consuming his entire being.  Purple lights swirled around the people, dazzling them with their color.  Her raised his flaming arms, and brought them down upon the people.  In a flash of fire, they disappeared, and Rillen fell to the awaiting ground.  He succumbed to the awaiting rest of sleep.  <br>
* * *<br>
The city of Erudin quickly bored Lunisha.  Pillars of stone, cold un-feeling stone provided nothing for her.  She had drained the once fine city of its life.  The magic was gone from the air, the splendor from the marble.  Without the magics of the wizards, mages, and enchanters, Erudin was crumbling around itself.  As she left the city, hundreds of erudites followed in her wake.  The giant span of water had intrigued Luni.  She felt life, exhilaration, when the cool spray whipped across her face.  With a large red ring on her finger, she flew across the waves, always hovering above their hungry crests.  Her devotees sought to follow their mistress, but without the ability of levitation, they could not.  Many perished to the cold clammy hands of the waves, the hands of death.  Those who had managed to maintain a fraction of self, refrained from killing themselves, but they felt a pull within their hearts, urging them to follow their mistress, their queen.<br>
* * *<br>
Ulla awoke, full sized, on a hard wooden floor.  Deli and Chiro lay beside her, unconscious.  The spell had knocked everyone out, and she was not the first to awake.  Elves bustled around.  Those druids who stilled maintained their power, the druids of Tunare, were working diligently shaping the trees, to form for themselves a new home.  Groggily, Ulla rose to her wobbly feet to search for her husband.  He must have teleported himself and the others to the spires after the spell.  <br>
“Ulla, over here!”  Ulla turned her head, and saw the petite form of Shi’an.  She raced over, expecting news.  “Rillens in the tent, he and the other wizards taxed themselves greatly.  When we arrived here, they did not.  We feared something had gone wrong.  Me and Khali, my sister, quickly levitated ourselves, and teleported…Well, I’m droning on, Rillens in the tent over there, shall I take you to him?”  Fervently, She nodded in response.<br>
The tent smelled, as all places do when many men are cramped together in small corridors, foul.  Fires illuminated the room.  About thirty high elven women and men, in their burgundy robes, lay serenely on beds of leaves.  In the corner, slouched against a support, was Rillen.  Blood stained his lips, and he looked haggard.  Ulla, seeing her husband, raced to his side.  He cracked a smile with his blood caked lips.<br>
“Allu, I love you.”  She thrust her arms around his neck and hugged her worn husband.  “Lets go home, just for the day.”  He managed to croak.  Silently, she nodded.  <br>
From behind, Shi’an spoke, “Of course, we of the Faydark are indebted to you and are obligated to help you in any way.”  The events had hardened Shi’an and she spoke as a seasoned diplomat.  “….But, I have a favor to ask of you again Rillen.  You hold high standing among the council of Erudin, I would ask of you to tell them of our plight, and request that we be allowed to remain on their fair isle for the time.  I hope we will be able to return home to kelethin, but I am unsure as to we will ever be able to go home.”<br>
Rillen rose to his feet, leaning against his scepter.  “Of course Shi’an, but I doubt you will find much, if any resistance among the erudites.  For now, I hope you will allow me and my wife to return to our home in these woods, I must rest.”<br>
“Of course.”  Rillen hoarsely spoke the spidery words to a spell, and he and his wife arrived home.  <br>
* * *<br>
The two human twins stood together in a boat.  One, a palidan clad in armor the color of the dead of night, wielding a sword whose glimmer was akin to the weaving of the waves.  The other, a warrior who stank of brine.  Obviously a fisherman, he wore leather died blue and strapped to his belt was a giant trident.  No fish could survive a stab from it.  The two seemed obviously different, one a stern Palidan of moral virtue, the other a free spirit as wily as the waves themselves, but they both had hair the color of sea foam and eyes the color of coral.  <br>
The palidan looked up from her lap, “She approaches.”  <br>
“I can see her in the distance Tali, may Prexus be with us.”  Spoke the rogue in a voice unbefittingly soft of one such as hardened as he appeared to be.<br>
“He has always been my brother, and always shall be.”  The woman’s form was now easily seen by both twins.<br>
From off in the distance, above the spray, came a booming voice.  “Prexus, you dare defy me?!”<br>
  Defiantly, Tali retorted, “Prexus hath not sent us, it does not take a god to sense your evil, nor to destroy it!”  The woman, Lunisha, hovered closer, now barely fifty feet away.  She shook her head.<br>
In a voice more stern and mature than one would think capable of one so childish, Luni spoke with a hint of sadness, “Than you shall die.”  Her hair whipped about her in the wind, as did her robes which seemed to take on a life of their own.  <br>
She began to chant, “Ulthak Tu’el Qual te Inuiet Fierabend Aquan”  As she spoke, Tali raised her four-foot sword and charged.  Her brother followed suit, daggers poised.  The waves parted before them.  When they came within a few feet, Luni raised her arms suddenly.  A wall of water sprung up from beneath them, knocking Tali’s sword from her hands.  The rogue thrust his hand through the water with his dagger, catching Luni in the wrist.  Crimson blood stained his dirk.  Tali, unarmed, began to chant.  <br>
“Fluens Agu te Meins.”  As she spoke, the water died down and Luni reached out to touch the rogue.  He dodged the attack and thrust both his daggers in her unguarded side.  Hot blood seeped out of her robe.  She twisted with the agility of a monk, backhanding the rogue as she came.  He went flying, but she had not managed to touch him sufficiently.  Tali finished her spell as her brother flew through the air.  Using her god given powers, freezing water flowed forth from her hands right into Luni, knocking her off her feet into the waters below.  “Die Wench!”  A hammer materialized in her hand which she threw with the might of an ogre warrior towards Luni.  Luni caught the huge two-handed hammer with her own delicate hand.  <br>
“I will not die!”  She bent the heavy hammer with her hands.  With those delicate, powerful hands, she sent forth a torrent of shadows.  The tendrils extending from Lunisha’s hands encircled Tali, trapping her beneath their emptiness.  <br>
The rogue, seeing his sister in danger, unlocked his rage.  He charged with the speed of a shark.  His cerulean eyes flared into life.  He managed to approach Luni without her noticing while she was busy with Tali.  “Bitch!”  He stabbed her in the back with both his daggers.  They sank to the hilt.  Blue mana flowed down his wrists as a flood of power flowed through his veins.  Energy crackled in her back.  Luni doubled over and screamed in pain.  The shadowy tendrils withdrew into her wrists.  Tali fell to the welcoming waters.  <br>
I can not lose, I shall not lose!  Prexus can not beat me.  The inner fire they lay within her heart burst into life.  Black energy darted up the silvery blades of the rogue’s daggers.  The energy seared the rogue’s hands, and fried his skin.  In less than a second, he was dead.  His soul flew over to his sister, encouraging her unconscious body to rise, and flee.  The wounds in Luni’s back were already on the mend.  Her mana crackled about her in the air.  She bent down and retrieved one of the daggers that had nearly slain her.  She walked over to the fallen body of Tali, floating gently in the water.  As if out of no where, Tali rose, and slashed at Luni with her great sword.  She must have used her healing touch, and retrieved her sword while Luni was busy with the rogue.  Luni managed to dodge the attack, but her robe did not.  It was torn off her body by the massive sword, exposing her shift.  Before Tali could recover, Luni kicked her in the head.  Tali brought the sword up above her head, and quickly dropped it down.  Before the blade split her in two, Luni jabbed Tali in the gut, and side-kicked her in the neck.  <br>
Rage built up in Tali’s heart.  This demon has slain her brother, this demon has stolen the souls of the erudite race, this demon stands to kill Prexus, her father.  (Let it be known Prexus is not actually Tali and her brother Matteus’s father, father is a title used to refer to high religious figures, or in this case, gods.)  She realized that her sword would be of no use against this woman, she was to slow.  With all her might, she threw her sword at Lunisha.  While Luni was avoiding the attack, Tali raised her hands, and began to pray.  Father, I pray to thee, answer thine call, release me from the bonds of humanity that restrict me from releasing myself.  Help me wash this blight from the face of norrath.  Please father, I beg of thee.<br>
Lunisha looked up from her stance.  She shook as if having a seizure, and when returned to consciousness, she had an aura of emptiness around her.  “Prexus, if you assist this mortal, I will not allow you to remain.  You refused to oppose me, and in return, I promised you that the waves would forever wash against the shores of Norrath, if you oppose me, they shall not!  Stand not in my way, and you shall remain standing.”  Lunisha shivered, gone was the aura of emptiness, the coldness within.  <br>
There was a rumbling beneath their feet, beneath the very waters themselves.  A azure glow surrounded Tali.  She exuded a feeling of cold drowning.  Luni shook, her shift providing no protection against the cold of the deepest of oceans.  She was paralyzed, her limbs were numb and her will to fight was gone.  For a second, Tali thought she saw beneath those purple eyes of unfeeling destruction a glint of fear, akin to that of a child.  Tali backhanded her.  Blood splattered across her mailed gauntlet, and dribbled down Luni’s cheek.  Again, Tali summoned a holy hammer with a word.  She slammed it’s huge head into Luni’s arm.  It crunched under the pressure, only powder remained were once was bone.  She swung again at the other arm, but her attack was blocked.  Luni’s tiny hand held back the might hammer.  Rapidly, she kicked Tali in the face.  She broke Tali’s nose, and bloodied the rest of her face.  With her good arm, she punched her in the chin.  While Tali was doubled over, Luni began to chant: “Domum Gerian Fac te Insce Cooral Illiad.”  <br>
Tali, although injured, closed her eyes and focused upon the waves.  She felt their pulse as clearly as her own.  The waves behind her grew rapidly in size.  The clouds above blackened almost instantaneously.  I will sacrifice myself.  I will be a conduit for the raw power of the waters, if only to slay this shell of a woman.  Unrestricted by the words and hand motions required for all spells, unrestricted by the limitations of variations of spells, she sent forth a flow of power.  <br>
Luni finished her spell as soon as the waves hit her.  The water that hit her simply dissipeared.  Where once there was a giant wave, stood a giant wave with a woman shape carved out of it.  She reached out to the meditating Tali and caressed her cheek.  Where her gentle fingers touched her skin, burns blistered to the skin.  Pain seared in her cheek, and her eyes opened wildly.  Luni brought down her hands, clenched together, upon Tali’s unguarded her.  Blood sprayed about, and her hair was singed were Luni’s fists had struck her.  Luni stabbed Tali in the chest with the dagger of Matteus.  She fell to the waters below, dead.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen and Ulla found their friends huddled together in the house.  Brenan had been greatly affected by the loss of his god.  Unlike the druids of karana, the followers of Quellious did not die, but were plagued with a sense of loss.  An aura of sadness hung over Bren.  Just by looking at him one could tell he was at a loss.  His skin had grayed and his eyes were droopy.  Forna hadn’t left his side for the past week.  Her usual happy, excitable attitude was replaced with a sad serious version of its prior self.  After hours of coaxing, she had managed to get him to eat and sleep.  Paren’s music and Hoku’s illusions did nothing to uplift his spirits.  Hoku herself was also in a depressed mood of sorts.  She seemed disoriented, but no one really took notice with Bren in his current condition.     <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Off in the corner, Paren, Rillen, and Ull spoke quietly of matters of importance.  “The world is falling down upon our heads.  Solusek told us of grave matters.  Many prophecies foretold by Vazaelle spoke of a child of flames.  The gods fear this child, for some elude that he will bring about revenge.  He shall lead the world into the age of greatness, enlightenment, and peace.  The gods have taken this to mean that they shall die.  Among the prophecies of a child of fire comes the prophecy of darkness.  Shadows shall befall the lands of men.  The clouds that loom over the sunken Faydwere are proof enough of that.  When the gods leave, their domain is no longer being controlled.  The rain and snow that has been falling unseasonably is proof enough of that.  Now that Quellious is gone, I can only fear what is to come.  The gods leaving, this shadow thing, we must do something!”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your right Rillen, as always, but how are we to combat the weather.  My swords may draw blood, but they can’t stop the rain.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve been thinking about that Par.  I still have many questions.  I have been researching many things as of late.  As to what the ways are, I am unsure, but I believe they were a way of travel and telepathy developed by the ancient combine empire.  I found a book in Al’kabor’s personally library hinting that through intense study, one can master the art and send themselves, or something else, over many miles.  Kora, the woman who first confronted my about my powers, was a woman of great power thousands of years ago.  It was she who helped create some of the greatest spells today.  Who attacked my through the ways, I still know not.  How to master these powers within myself, I know nothing of.  I have been told by many to ‘know thyself,’ but I know who the hell I am!  I am Rillen Tarrant, and I wish this would all stop!, but it won’t, will it?  Ulla, Paren, I think we need to find the Shi’an throughout the lands, the final battle approaches.  I had planned for us to split up and search the separate continents, but with Bren in his current state, and Forna caring for him, we can no longer go that way.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why not?  With the Faydwere all but gone, and the hostile iksar basically unattainable, you and Ulla can search Odus, and time providing, Velious, while Hoku and I search throughout Antonica.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’ll talk of this later, I think we should take Bren to the head healers in Erudin.  To see if maybe they’ve found a way to lift this depression.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright Rillen, Brenan IS my first concern.  I have heard that some of the druids of Karana have recovered.  Few retained the ability to tap into the earth’s energy, but they have regained sanity.  Bren will be alright, he will.”<br>
* * * <br>
Her wounds had quickly healed.  During the fight, Luni had experienced a new emotion, Fear.  Not a fear of death, nor pain, but of herself.  Lunisha had lost control of herself.  The words that came forth from her mouth were not her own.  It was her vioce, but the words, the words were not hers.  After her battle with the children of Prexus, and her deep contemplation about fear, Luni had set her sights on Qeynos.  The boats that came and went, and the crude yet strong stone walls piqued her interest.  Silently, she floated above the walls under the cloak of night, and down into the city.  People, more than she had ever seen, muddled the streets.  Strange dialects, exotic foods and dress, and the PEOPLE.  She was overwhelmed.   This tiny girl who had charmed the entire city of Erudin, was overwhelmed.  Her head spun as she tried to take it all in.  As she approached a vendor, a corpulent, slovenly man bumped into her.  His greasy hands groped her as she tried to force him away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Getcha hands ofa me wench!”  he spat, although he seemed to her touch by the smile on his blotchy face.  His hair was slick with the grease that was the trademark of those who rarely bathe.  He pushed her with his meaty hands.  No one around seemed to notice the unprovoked upcoming fight.  Luni looked up at the man, who towered over her, with her intense purple eyes.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t touch me you bastard!”  She slapped him, leaving marks were her hand had hit his face.  In that one instance of contact, his mind was gone.  He was lost in a world of oblivion.  The only constant was his desire to please Lunisha.  With the meager grace a man of his large stature could provide, the man knelt down and kissed her hand.  “Mistress.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That’s better, pig.”  Luni had no idea what a pig was, but for some reason, it seemed like the correct thing to say.  “Now, give me your purse.”  He reached down his tight shirt and brought out a tiny leather pouch.  He handed her the bag, and awaited for another order.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Luni smiled as she decided what to do with him.  “Now, rid me of your presence.  In fact, rid the world of yourself. Go slit your throat, I do so hate to do the dirty work myself, but try to do it in some hole somewhere, I would hate to come across your bloated corpse later.”  She flipped her head and scanned the area to find suitable housing.  About half a mile away, over the walls, she spotted a home which she deemed ‘suitable.’<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen, Paren, Hoku, Ulla, Forna, and Brenan had arrived at Erudin around three.  Deli and Chiro had offered to stay home, guarding against anything that may come.  Paren had glared at the two, knowing they only wished to finish off Ull’s pie.  While the rest took Brenan to the clerics, Rillen was to go see the high council about the elves.  What they found when they entered the city, was startling.  No one could be seen.  Not a person could be found stooped over a book in the library, nor nibbling at a muffin in the bar.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where is everyone?  Have they evacuated?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know Ull, lets check the harbor, maybe they left by boat….”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But why Rill, there are deffinately enough wizards to evacuate the whole populace if something went wrong, and there aren’t any corpses so..”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know Paren!  Please, Shut up!”  He spat.  “I just don’t know!”  Hurriedly, the group scurried off towards the harbor.  When they arrived at the other end of the transportation crystal, they heard the moaning.  Hoku ran off through the corridors towards the bay.  Everyone else followed, Forna with Brenan latched on to her, Rillen, Ull, and Paren.  Shock and Horror filled their faces as they saw the salt-bloated bodies floating in the waters.  The normally clear waters where tinted red with the blood of hundreds of erudites.  Many still lived, held at bay from going like lemmings to their watery deaths, by the corpses of their companions.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In a fury of tears, Hoku began to cast, “Virum Canille Nullomb Nega’te il Nec tu Iocosa Sieset! Virum Canille Nullomb Nega’te il Nec tu Iocosa Sieset! Virum Canille Nullomb Nega’te il Nec tu Iocosa Sieset!”  <br>
Ulla put her hand on her sisters shoulder, “it’s no use Hok, disenchant isn’t going to help this time.”  Tears streamed down their faces.  Among the sea of corpses they saw friends, mentors, shopkeepers, people who didn’t deserve to die the death they did.  <br>
All of a sudden, Bren burst out in anger.  “Damn you!  Damn you bastards!”  He ran down the marble steps into the mob of living zombies.  He reached out to his them, grabbing them.  He traced the symbols of the gods of good in the air, Quellious, Rodcet Nife, Elrossi Marr.  Under his breath, he whispered, why have you forsaken us.  The words Rillen had said rung clearly in his head, “We must do something, if not us, then who?”  Tears streaked his face, and the spray of the salt water matted down his lengthy hair.  “Clandesti Spirum Pirus et Il’Ehq Tueen Gaulum Ikor Welse Argore Restuin”  The words he spoke were of a language not spoken in thousands of years.  Literally, they translate to, “With my blood I shall cleanse you, with my spirit I shall heal you.”  <br>
From his boot, Bren grabbed a wicked knife.  He slid the blade across his slender wrist.  Crimson blood poured out from his severed veins into the brine that milled about his feet.  The scrambling erudites stopped in their actions.  Bren screamed, “Clandesti Spirum Pirus et Il’Ehq Tueen Gaulum Ikor Welse Argore Restuin!”  His body convulsed in pain.  The tears in his eyes were not only of sorrow, but also of agony.  “Clandesti Spirum Pirus et Il’Ehq Tueen Gaulum Ikor Welse Argore Restuin!”  He began to falter in his chant, the loss of blood and pain was weakening him.  With his last ounce of strength, he shouted, “Clandesti Spirum Pirus et Il’Ehq Tueen Gaulum Ikor Welse Argore Restuin!” and collapsed to the watery ground.  His spell had failed.  <br>
* * * <br>
Luni had arrived at the house which she deemed suitable for living.  Two guards stood outside the doors.  They were at first reluctant to admit her, but both were soon subject to her touch.  The front room, a dark stone area with couches laid out for sleeping, contained much of the help, all who soon succumbed to Luni’s obliterating touch.  She walked up the carpeted steps, through the huge oak doors, and into the main sitting room.  On a chair that was more cushion that wood sat a middle-aged woman, dressed in extravagant clothes.  She looked as if she might have been beautiful some time ago, but her now painted face was creased and leathery and she had gone to fat.  Her hair was up in curls and her nails were painted a bright red.  <br>
She looked up from her nails, which she had been admiring, at the small cluster of workers.  “Well, what are you doing here?  Get back to work!”  Her voice was akin to that of one of those small dogs you can’t help but want to kick.  Luni took a step forward and The obese woman’s face quivered.  “What are you doing, get away from here you!”  Her second chin shook as Luni calmly approached with an evil grin upon her face.  Now thoroughly frightened, the woman spoke, “I..I..I am Lillia Bale!, leave now before I am forced to call the guards.”  Luni laughed at the thought, and with a flick of her hand, the two guards from outside walked forward and knelt before Luni.  As she walked forward, Lillia rose to her hoof-like feet and waddled quite quickly out the room screaming for her husband.  “Antonius!!!!!!!!”  <br>
Luni laughed as the woman fled.  “Kill her.”  The two guards rose to their feet, drew their swords, and chased after Lillia.  Seconds later, an irritating scream echoed through the Bale Manor.  <br>
Luni collapsed onto a couch, she felt a feeling she had yet to experience.  Her bones were sore and her muscles weak.  Her eyelids were heavy.  When sleep began to set in, a piggish man decked out in silver plate mail stormed in accompanied by seven guards.  In a booming voice ho shouted, “What are you all doing here!  Who hath slain my wife, Lady Lillia!”  He withdrew his sword an inch out of its scabbard and hefted his shield.     <br>
While still in a daze from lack of sleep, Luni spoke, “I hath slain thy woman.  She irritated me, as do you.”  She turned to her men, “Attack them.”   The help, armed with brooms, ladles, and their fists, along with the two soldiers charged the eight.  Luni seductively walked up to Antonius.  She dodged his clumsy slash and slipped her hand between his armor plates.  She thrust her hand into his greasy flesh.  His will to fight disappeared, as did his seven soldiers, who were soon disposed of by the kitchen crew.  <br>
 She smiled as she turned to Antonius, “Where is my….bed.”<br>

After Bren had collapsed, Forna rushed to his side, lifted his fragile form with her arms, and carried him out of the sea of bodies.  When she was again with her friends, she hurriedly dropped him to the floor and began to bandage her old friend’s wounds.  Her tears mixed in with the poultices which she heavily applied.  Paren sang a song of lamentation, to preserve Bren and help with the healing.  Ulla conjured more bandages as the old ones became too saturated with blood to work.  “You will not die on me Brenan Sanctu’Levis.”   Forna finally succeeded in getting the bleeding to stop, but Bren had lost much blood.  His forearms were coated in dried blood and his face was unusually pale.  <br>
A bright blue light flashed off in the distance.  “Rillen, do you see anything?”  <br>
“Longam Visum Volo” Yellow lights appeared before Rillen’s eyes as he spoke the words to a spell.  “It’s a person, not one of the dead, nor one of the mindless.  Rillen cast a spell of levitation on himself and promptly ran out above the wall of the dead towards the floating body.  He reached the body and knelt down to feel for life.  Above the droning of the erudite-zombies he shouted, “She’s alive!  Hold on.”  Again, he cast levitate, this time on the unconscious body, and dragged her back to his friends.  <br>
By the time he returned, Bren’s blood had ceased to flow and his wounds were on the mend due to Paren’s song.  Rillen gently lowered the womans body to the ground so that she could be examined.  He removed her helmet and unclasped her breastplate.  Her chest rose and fell with the waves.  She had a series of boils on her left cheek, and a wicked wound beneath her short cropped hair.  Through all that must have happened to her, she still had managed to hold on to her sword.  Rillen bent down to retrieve the weapon, but her fingers would not unclasp themselves from the weapon.  When Parren noticed her, he expanded the healing waves of his song to encompass her body in addition Bren’s.  <br>
“Lets get out of the cold, the temple should be warm. The six walked, Rillen with the bent over body of the woman cradled in his cotton-clad arms to the teleportation gem which would take them to the high temple of erudin.<br>
* * *<br>
A year has passed and much has changed.  An unseasonable heat had plagued the world.  Average people took it as no more than a slight abnormality, but it was the absense of E’ci that had caused such warmth.  The snow caps in the Everfrost had begun to melt and Velious itself was warming.  All the gods had left, or been killed, but for some strange reason, the events that had resulted from the loss of karana and e’ci were not present in the loss of the other gods.  Luni had obtained complete control over the city of Qeynos.  With their leader under her control, the rest of the populace had followed quickly.  She had grown from a hidden leader behind her puppet Antonius to the Queen of Qeynos.  Every official, and leader of every guild excluding those of the clerics and wizards had fallen to the seduction of her touch.  She had complete mastery over her abilities allowing her to leave the guilds in perfect condition with their leaders intact.  The city ran like a well-oiled machine with her watching the cogs.  Over the past eight months, the city had been bustling, forging new armors and weapons.  Every able bodied man and woman in the city had been required to spend a minimum of thirty days in military training ran by Luni herself.  Eventually, every person had fallen to her touch within the city.  To the diplomats from Halas and The Glade everything appeared as normal, for Luni made sure of that, but the city was preparing for war.  <br>
Luni was seated on a chair of exotic bamboo, sent from Odus.  She had been patrolling the city in her chair, atop the shoulders of six burly men.  Smoke rose from the buildings as blacksmiths forged weapons of war and tanners smoked the meat of animals and their skins to make leather armors.  She was dressed in a simple yet elegant black dress with a diving neck line to accentuate her large bosom.  Black soot had been meticulously painted around her eyes and a deep blood red had been plastered upon her lips.  Her ebony hair was carefully tied back with an electrum band.  As she was carried past the rabble, they knelt down upon their dirt crusted knees and kissed the ground.  Not until she had passed by them did they return to their feet and resume working.  Everyone working together for a common goal.  Never had an ideal been so twisted.  Among the commoners, Luni spotted Girard.  <br>
“Girard, come!”  Girard was one of the few humans Luni had refrained from touching.  It was his response that had stopped her when she first met him.  “I know what you are, what your about, use me, then you may kill me.  I’m better to you as I am, better than a mindless drone you will make of me by eradicating my very being with your touch.  Yes I know what you are, probably better than you know yourself.”  He had intrigued her.  Of course, when the time came, she would kill him, but he was right.  He did serve a better purpose to her cause as he was.  The dusty man hustled over to the side of her lofty perch.  <br>
“We are ninety-five percent complete with the…”<br>
Luni cut him off, “I know.  Make it faster.”  She waved her lace-gloved hand, motioning for her bearers to take her back to here home.  The hurried through the cobbled roads, past the kneeling subjects whose minds Luni had stolen.   They arrived at the great steps of her home, where her men gently lifted her off her perch.  They carried her into the home were she dismissed them.  She walked in to the elegant room were her numerous servants awaited.<br>
Her head throbbed with pain.  Over the past few months, she had been experiencing head aches and only recently had they become more frequent and painful.  As she seized her head, she dismissed her servants with a screech.  “Be gone!”  Images of a Marble tower flashed across her eyes.  She saw people, Erudites and elves together in a marble tower, men and women, none of whom she knew.  Yet, through the pain, she felt a kinship of sorts to some of them.  <br>
She screamed, “I killed them all!  They are mine!  Their spirits are gone, I have slain them!”  She stood up off her velvet cushion and clawed at the walls.  She tore at anything near her as her head throbbed in pain.  This had become a common occurrence in the queen’s manor.  She tore down the curtains as tears dripped down her face.  Blood seeped out between the cracks in her broken finger nails.  <br>
“All shall be gone soon, soon I shall have peace.”  <br>
* * *<br>
Much had happened on the continent of Odus over the last year.  Ulla had had a miscarriage.  The woman whom Rillen had saved from the water had recovered wonderfully.  All was fine with her but her memory.  She could only put bits and pieces together, the only thing she clearly remembered was her name, Tali.  Inside the Palace of Erudin, the six had found the remains of the conclave.  The wave of destruction that had terrorized the city had somehow glossed over the populace of the tower.  They were alive, but their spirits were low.  Somehow, the experience served to heal Brenan.  Seeing all the destruction around him must have showed him that he was needed.  Rillen informed the elves of what had happened, and they were quick to help.  The way to the bay was blocked off, and the rest of the city was reconstructed.  The liveliness of the elves must have rubbed off on the erudites who had emerged from their tower to help with the reconstruction efforts.  They sent magic back up the pillars of stone.  The erudites extended an open hand to the elves after hearing of their own plight.  Graciously, the high elves accepted an invitation to stay within the walls of erudin while their wood elven cousins worked on the construction of Korathan, their new city among the trees.  The dwarves helped the elves while working on digging an outpost for themselves, but they firmly believed they would return to their ancestral home of Kaladim shortly.  <br>
The six friends sat in Rillen’s apartment in the erudic tower with Deli and Chiro taking care of Matteus and Taron downstairs.  Rillen spoke up.  “How goes your experimentation Hok?  Have you and Bren come any closer to finding a cure?”  Bren and Hok had been working on finding a way to revitalize the zombie erudites.  They had found a way to give them food, and they had managed to corral them so that they would not leap to their death in the sea, but they had come no further to curing them.  <br>
“No, we haven’t Rillen.  It is discouraging, but we will continue.  We have to.  Through several scrying spells, we have discerned that they are missing a part of themselves.  We believe it to be their souls.”  Rill, Ull, Paren, and Forna were taken aback by this.  “Do you know of any news from around the world.  I guess I should be please nothing has happened as of yet, but I find it odd that everything has been so quiet as of late.” <br>
“Nothing, but, I have an announcement to make.  I fear that something WILL happen soon, and I would like to be prepared.  I am proposing we divide ourselves and search for those who will stand with us when the time has come.  Me and Ulla will cover Freeport, Neriak, and Akanon, Paren and Hok can cover Halas and Qeynos, and Forna and Bren, I was hoping that you two would travel to Thurgadin.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren spoke up, “I agree Rillen.  The elves and erudites have everything running smoothly.  I don’t like remaining idle when I know there are things to be done.”<br>
“Me and Brenan have already taken on apprentices in our efforts to cure the mindless, they now all that we do and can continue our research as well as we would be able to ourselves, I think your plan has merit Rillen.”<br>
“I am glad you all agree, here.”  From a pocket in his robe Rillen withdrew a sealed letter which he handed to Forna.  “I have prepared a letter of introduction for you to give to the Coldain, it should be all you need.  Lets meet back here in six hours, I shall teleport us all to our closest destination points.”  Rillen rose to his feet and, with his wife’s hand in his own, cast a spell which would transport them home.<br>
*Back home*<br>
Ulla and Rillen sat together by the lake in the woods.  It was the place of solace.  It was their home.  Rillen slipped his arm through his wifes and pulled her close.  “Everything’s gonna be fine Ull, it will.”<br>
“I know Rillen, I know, but with the gods gone and the clouds that hung over the Faydwer moving west towards Antonica….I don’t know what to do.”<br>
“I love you Ull, and that’s all that matters.”  Rillen squeezed his wife closer to his side.  <br>
“No Rillen, that’s not all that matters.  The lives of those who have died, the lives of those who will die, the fate of the world, it all matters!  We must find the child of flames, so that he may drive back the shadow and cleanse the world of the darkness”<br>
“Rillen moved away from his wife and stood on his feet.  “We will Allu, we will avenge the world.  Come on now, we must make preparations.  Together, they walked down the hill to their little cottage among the trees.  They could hear the sounds of the elves diligently working on building their Silvam Domum, their home among the trees.  <br>
“Gather your gear hun.”  They went inside their room, and removed their traveling robes and leathers from their drawers.  Rillen swung over his shoulder a travel pack filled with provisions for the journey.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While she was packing Ull spoke up, “Where are we going first, Akanon, Neriak, Freeport, or Rivervale.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think Rivervale.  The dark elves are both self absorbed and savage.  I doubt they would aid us.  The halflings on the other hand should be easily convinced, as they are kind creatures.  The loss of their gods has hardened them, they shall join us.  Ready?’<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yep, shall we walk back, we have more than enough time, Rill?”  Deli and Chiro Flew in at that moment.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Were you going to leave without me Ulla.?”  Inquired Deli, the tiny pink bear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m going away for a bit Deli, and I don’t want to endanger you, nor Rillen you Chiro.  We won’t be gone long.  Help the elves with their building, they need your help quite a bit.”  The two childish Familiars looked disappointed, yet understood.  Rillen and Ulla walked out of the house and headed north to the gates of Erudin.<br>
*Paren’s Apartments*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve never seen snow before Paren, I wonder what the home of barbarians is like.  I’ve heard that snow is like tiny pieces of crystal falling from the heavens.  It makes me cold thinking about it.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Than maybe I’ll warm you up my enchantress.”  Paren hugged Hokulani closely.  Together, they walked over to the bed.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Paren, I must pack my things.”  Before he had a chance to reply, she hurried out of the room into her own.  With a sigh, Paren began to pack his own things.  His armor and instruments were already safely packed away, but he needed his traveling leathers which he retrieved from his chest.  He packed him things away, along with a bottle of brandy.  For later, he whispered to himself.  From her room Hok shouted, “Done,  I never really understood the reasoning behind the thought that women take a long time to do things.”  Paren chuckled at that.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Most do Hok, your just special.”  She had walked in now and snuck up behind Paren.  She turned his head.  Passionately, she kissed him.  Her upper lip caressed him lower.  His arms encircled her waste as they walked over to the bed and fell down next to each other.  It was Ulla that broke the embrace.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We can’t, not yet.”  Solemnly Paren nodded in agreement.  “I love you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I love you Hoku.  And I was hoping that after this is over, you would…”  He looked down at his feet as he stopped.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I would what Paren.  What is it.”  Enthusiastically inquired Hoku.  She placed her hand on his shoulder.  “Please, tell me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Will you be my wife Hokulani?”  Hoku thrust her arms around his neck and their lips again touched in a flurry of kisses.  In between kisses, she exhaled, “Of course I will.”<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The six stood ready in a circle back at Rillen’s apartment.  “Hoku, Paren, are you two ready.  I can translocate you as close as east karana, from there you shall make your way.  They nodded and said their good byes.  “When me and Ull are done, we shall come looking for you.  Good bye.”  He went over and hugged Hoku, and gave Paren a hearty two-handed handshake.  “Mirkam Eashkalana Tilluis Goran Fiuret et Irqam il Vocam”  In a flash of purple and blue lights, Hokulani and Paren dissapeared.  “Forna and Bren, are you two ready?”  They both were.  “Good, Ulla, can you can a spell of invisibility over them, giants roam the great divide.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sure Rillen.”  She spoke the words to the spell and just as Hoku and Paren had disappeared, so did Forna and Brenan.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Good, good luck Brenan, good luck Forna.  You have the letter, correct?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yup, once we have convinced the coldain, we shall wait for you.  To get to the city we go directly south and follow the mountains east correct?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Exactly Forn, It should only be a four minute walk, if that.  The city is hidden behind a great waterfall and coldain roam the area so you should easily find it.  Again, good luck. Mirkam Frigidumi Tilluis Goran Fiuret et Irqam il Vocam.”  Blue and Purple lights flashed again as Forna and Brenan were translocated to Velious.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a knock on the door as Rillen was preparing to send his wife and himself to the commonlands.  “I’ll get it Ull, stay here.”  Rillen walked over to the door and opened it.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m coming with you….”  Before them stood Tali decked out in her curelean armor with her four foot sword strapped to her back.  “Don’t say anything, because there’s nothing you can do to stop me.  I don’t know who I am, but I know that you are an important person Rillen Terrant.  I will guard you with my life.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But Tali, I don’t know…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You can trust me!  On my life, I swear that I shall protect thine own.  You have known me for a year now.  You saved my life, let me return the debt.”  Rillen saw in her eyes inner turmoil.  There was anger, pain, regret, and confusion all swirling together.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sighed.  “Alright.  I just hope that you will not regret your decision, here, hold my hand.  Portam Tuesch Quinal Comolan et il Fieresch Tuin Pereninel.”  Energy serged down his arms as Rillen tore open a hole in space.  The ladies walked through after which, Rillen entered and the tear dissapeared.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren and Hoku arrove atop a small stone pyramind next to a river and a field.  Paren reached to his pack and unclasped his drum.  He removed the small stick from the side and began to stum a beat.  He felt a rush of heat run down his legs.  His muscles bulged and his leathers strained under the pressure.  He and his wife-to-be began to run.  They flew past fields of wheat and hay, hair flying in their faces.  After mere minutes of running, they had arrived in the Qeynos hills where they stopped to rest their weary legs.  What they had just run in mere mintues had taxed them as a run of hours would have.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren ceased his song of speed and began to thump a song of revitilization.  “Where to, Qeynos or Halas?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lets go to Halas first.”  She nudged him playfully in the side, “I hear the hot springs are wonderful.  That song of yours is great, I’m refreshed already.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then lets go.”  His beat changed and as they ran, their leg muscles bulged again as they had minutes ago.  They coasted along the rocky side intil they reached the fanged entrance to the BlackBurrow, the home of the gnolls.  At this point, Paren shushed Hoku and replaced his drum with his horn.  He sent forth one long soft note.  From the end of his horn, soft mist flowed forward enshrouding he and his love.  They crept under the cloak of the mist, through the initial tunnel into the main court-yard area.  Numerous gnolls sat around, picking at the bones of fallen humans.  Blood stained the ground.  Beneath the cloud, Paren whispered to his wife, “We can’t let them live.”  She nodded in agreement.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he unsheashed his sword and dagger, Paren appeared.  Nine very large gnolls charged at him.  They stood a good six and half feet tall and their short gray fur stood up on their backs.  Their tiny red eyes peered at him as they licked their foamy red lips.  Sharp teeth extended inches out of their fetid mouths.  Paren ran forward slashing at two separate gnolls with his weapons, killing them instantly.  The other seven charged.  A stone axe flew bye his unguarded head and a dagger grazed his chest.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hokulani began to chant in old erudin.  Her hands were a blur as she prepared for a spell.  Mana crackled in the air.  The eyes of the gnolls glossed over and they ceased their attacks.  “Finish them Paren.”  He ackknowledged her request and made short work of the mezmerized gnolls.  Black blood mingled in with the red in the soil.  “Are you alright, that dagger look like it sliced you up pretty badly?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m fine, the tunnel to the Everfrost is here, follow me.”  Paren grabbed his drum and once again thumped the song of speed.  They ran with the speed of a cheetah out of the dank tunnel up into the light of the sun.  A blast of cold air stopped them in their tracks.<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I never imagined it could be so cold.”  Hoku shivered as the cold pierced through her meager cloth.  The stood together looking out at a vast expanse of snow.  Large mounds of snow had grown several hundred feet in hight creating narrow paths in which they must navigate to find the barbarian home of Halas.  “Which way?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Surprised, Paren responded, “I thought you knew, you’re the one who had the maps!?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You mean the maps I gave to you last night so that YOU could study them and find the way!!  You mean THOSE maps!?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lets not be so hasty at pointed the finger.  It can’t be that hard…..Lets just pick a way and follow it.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And risk getting lost in this frozen maze, no thanks.”  A twisted smile crossed her lips.  “How do you feel about flying?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmm, no thanks, I’ve seen your work, and going ‘splat’ doesn’t appeal to me at the moment.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come on!  Once your up there, you can see the city, and then activate your boots.(Singing steel boots cast aria of the eagle, a song of levitation)  You’ll be able to slowly float down and we’ll be on our way.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not a chance hun, lets just pick a way and hope we chose the right one.  Or better yet, why don’t YOU fly up there.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t have the boots.”  Hoku raised her hands and began the words to a spell.  “Levum Torach il Ceasem.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh no you don’t!”  Paren reached out, trapping her hands in his grasp, stopping the spell.  With her hands still tied up he spoke, “Can’t you scrye for the location?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nope, we’ll have to do it your way.”  She muttered not so silently, “insolent bard” as she shook her head.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren began to sing a song of old elvish, causing the air to warm.  He bent down and tapped his boots, leaving him hovering many feet off the think layers of snow.  Hoku glared at him as she trudged through the foot thick layer of snow.  Although the weather had significantly warmed over the last year, the north is still a frigid place to be.  Another twisted smile crossed Hoku’s lips as she silently prepared for a spell.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Confusam Terach te Nech il Fortam.”  Mana coursing through her veins flowed down into the very earth itself.  Green strands of mana sprang up from the frozen earth and grabbed onto Paren’s feet.  “Race you to Halas!”  Shouted Hoku as she levitated herself with her a pair of words and began to run away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey!”   He struggled with the energy, but to no avail.  He was firmly in place and Hoku was getting ahead.    As a wandering bear strolled by, Paren removed his lute.  He produced one long melodious note, followed by another.  The bear, caught in rapture, wobbled over to the bard.  He had managed to charm it.  With some gentle coaxing, Paren had gotten the bear to lift him up onto its back.  With the disruption of the root spell, Paren was free to go.  He continued to play as he ordered the bear to take him to Halas, of course, unlike Hoku, it would know the way. Firmly seated on the back of the bear, Paren was speeding through the snow.  Boy wouldn’t she be mad when she saw him sitting in the hot springs before her.  The thought helped warm his chilled bones.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brenan and Forna had arrived in the freezing cold of the great divide.  Unfortunately, they had forgotten to accout for the fact that they would be unable to see each other with the invisibility and all.  They could both see the huge savage wolves, foam dripping from their maws and lumbering giants towering over the pair.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fear, an emotion general unknown to Forna, clutched her heart.  She whispered, “Bren, where are you?  Come here.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He whispered back, “hold on, put some snow on you, so I can see you.”  Two floating balls of snow appeared, and moved towards each other.  “Here, grab my hand.”  Bren felt Forna’s vice-like grip.  He felt as if his knuckles should be white, if only he could see them.  “Hurry, this spell won’t last forever.  Theres the icy river over there, lets go.”  He felt a pull as Forna sped off far quicker than he himself could go, but he would have to be fast.  Forna managed to glide gently over the snow, but Bren feared that the deep prints he was making would attract unwanted attention.  They arrived at the bank of the frigid stream.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Were s’posed to go left right?”  inquired Forna.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, I think so, wait, was it right?  I don’t know!  Figures the two people with the worst memories would get paired together.  Wait, I got it!  The city’s behind a waterfall right?  Well, if that’s the beginning of the river, than if we follow the flow of the water, it should take us right there!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Right!”  The two turned left and followed the icy stream.  They sprinted for two minutes, praying to empty ears that the spell would last and they would arrive in Thurgadin.  Before them lay a giant hill with a huge tunnel carved out of its front.  “Odd, I thought there was supposed to be a waterfall?  Maybe we’re at the wrong place?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know Forn, let’s check it out.  Uh oh!  I can see your arm, the spells wearing off…but I don’t see any giants around, we should be fine.”  Gradually, the rest of Forna appeared, as did Bren whose invisibility had also worn off.  Cautiously, the pair approached the cave entrance.  “Somethings been bugging me, if the entrance of the city’s behind the waterfall, wouldn’t the water be flowing AWAY from the entrance?”  A huge roar echoed throughout the tunnel as soon as Forna saw the red glowing eyes of a huge…beast.  No words were exchanged between the two, both knew what to do.  Forna raised her hands in a deffensive position as Bren readied his mace.  A gigantic crystaline wurm emerged from the mouth of the cave.  It must have been a good hundred feet long and thirty tall.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s intent was obveous, as shown by its many rows of glistening teeth.  Forna charged as Bren released a spell of holy might.  His blast struck it in the head as Forna lept off the ground and delivered a shocking hook-kick to the things neck.  Arcane words flowed forth from its maw, and Bren was soon stunned.  As Forna was recovering from her attack, it swung its giant tail and glanced her head.  The sharp edges of the crystal scales dug into her scalp.  She was knocked down to her knee, and barely managed to roll away as the beast’s sharp claws came crashing down.  Bren had recovered from the dragon’s spell and was preparing another of his own.  His energy flowed down into his hands as he spoke the words to his spell.  Mana rushed to his fingertips and crackled in the air, waiting to be released.  Bren was knocked off his feet as a river of force rushed forth from his extended palms towards the dragon.  The spell struck the thing right in the side of the neck, but it had barely been phased.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again, the dragon spoke the spidery words to a spell.  Icy shards darted through the air towards Bren.  Their sharp edges split his skin and a few struck him directly.  Blood seeped out through his wounds, staining the snowy ground red.  Forna scaled the thing/s leg and lept onto its huge neck.  With her legs wrapped around its neck, she began to pummel it’s throat.  The thing thrashed about, slamming its neck into the snow, hoping to crush Forna.  While she was keeping it busy, Brenan redied another spell.  “Mirag Terepidum Absoluc Hades Teret.”  The beasts eyes glazed over as it began to run in fear, but after a second, it shook its head and raced over to Bren.  It brought its giant head down in an etempt to crush him.  Brenan’s helmet deflected much of the blow, but he was rendered unconscious as he fell to the ground.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna erupted in rage as her closest friend fell to the ground.  While on the back of the dragon, she clasped her hands together and brought them down like a hammer on the back of its neck.  Crystal scales cracked as red blood seeped out from beneath its hard skin.  “Die!”  She pummeled the wounded area savagely with her fists.  It screamed in rage as Forna persisted in her attacks.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It attempts to remove her with its sharp tail were futile.  Forn’s firsts were drenched in blood, some from her hands cut on the dragon’s sharp scales, the rest its own. “Get off my back you damn human!”  It’s voice was much like that of a rocks.  Hard and garbled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Surprised by the fact that the thing can talk, Forna ceased her attack.  She saw from her vantage six stout dwarfs coming her way.  The thing kept thrashing left and right, if only she could hold on, they would be here soon.  Querulously, she asked, “Why’d you attack us?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s you people that seek to kill mine!”  With that, the thing rolled onto its back.  Forna didn’t manage to get off in time.  Her leg was crushed under the things massive weight and she screamed in pain before she blacked out.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen, Ulla, and Tali stood together atop the ancient stone temple.  “With Tali here, the option of going to Neriak is all but a impossibility.  Shall we try Rivervale or Freeport first?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rivervale, they are far more organized and should be more easily persuaded to join our cause than the disjointed Freeport.”  Tali stood there with her head bowed low, not looking as if she anything to add.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright then Ull, Rivervale.  We have a couple hours of light left, plenty of time to get through the cursed woods of Kithcor.”  Together, the trio descended from their platform to the trodden path below.  Unlike the majority of wizards and mages, Ulla and Rillen were in fine physical condition, and the three managed to set a quick pace.  It was in fact Tali, encumbered by her platemail and huge sword, that needed rest most after ten minutes of running.  By that time, they had reached the crevice in the hills that would take them to Kithkor wood.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen noticed her declining stamina, “Let us halt for a minute to catch our breath.  Tali, can you heal our stamina perchance?”  He knew of her pride and that she would do no such thing for herself if not asked for of others.  Although Tali had lost her memory, she knew she was a palidan.  She had forgotten her spells, but over the past year she had spent many hours sitting in the ancient library reciting and practicing her holy spells. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright sir.”  Tali raised her hands up to the heavens and recited the words to the spell.  “Erkash Holam et Nesh Khiral”  A soft blue glow surrounded each as their muscles were rejuventated and the pain in their joints dissapeared.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Surprised by the wonderous affects of the spell, Ulla thanked Tali for her efforts.  “We must hurry, the sun is setting and I don’t wish to be caught in these woods at night.”  Many stories had been told about the undead of Kithkor.  A curse had befallen the ancient woods, plagueing them with constant undead attacks in the dead of night.  Only the bravest of men dared venture out into Kithkor at night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They wound their way through the passage into the dense wood.  “Kithkor is within a giant valley, if we follow the wall, we shall make our way to Rivervale quickly, and easily.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Right Rill, lets go.”  Again the three began to run.  The shade provided by the trees helped cool off Tali, who had been previously baking under the heat of the sun.  The wind caused a eerie rusting in the trees and the shadows seemed to move as if they had lives of their own.  As they ran, Rillen scanned the area, just to be safe.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Breaking the silence, Tali spoke, “It’s odd, we haven’t seen a single animal since we entered these woods.  Should there not be wildlife?” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Maybe the undead managed to clear out the wildlife?”  responded an uneasy Ulla.  An arrow came out of no where and lodged itself in Ulla’s shoulder.  She screamed in pain as Rillen and Tali drew their weapons.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tali, heal Ulla, I’ll shield us.”  He raised his scpeter and spoke the activation word.  Multi-colorful mist emerged and clung to them three as Tali worked on healing Ull'’ shoulder.  She had removed the arror and blue lights signified the healing spell.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Four undead knights emerged from the woods.  Tali raised her sword and charged.  Rillen’s hands twisted in sync with the spidery words coming forth from his mouth.  Ulla removed a gem stone from her bag and began to summon an elemental.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Two of the undead slashed at Tali with their decaying weapons.  She blocked both attacks with her giant sword.  Dexterously, she twisted her weapon and spun her upper body.  Her sword cleaved through the first skeleton as if it was air.  The top half fell freely away from the bottom, and went limp.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen finished his spell and sent forth a ball of ice.  It collided into the decaying being before him, shattering its left arm and tearing a chunk out of its side, but it didn’t seem to notice as it continued it’s charge.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ulla finished the words to her summoning.  The gem of malachite dissapeared as a water elemental condensed from the air around her.  She sent it forth to battle the undead that was now within five feet of her.  Blade met water as they fought.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tali blocked each attack of the undead, but it kept her on her toes.  Its speed made it impossible for her to counter attack.  Frustrated, the skeleton raised its sword above its head, and brought it down upon Tali.  She dodged the blow and lopped off the things head.  Although headless, it stood and fought in a rage.  Like a bezerker, its blade was everywhere.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen had conjured magical roots to hold him enemy in place and was not working on chipping it apart.  His enemy, now missing its head, an arm, a leg, and part of its body, refused to die.  As he summoned a great shock of mana to shatter its remaining parts, a zombie clad in silvery platemail charged him.  As the mana left his fingers, a wicked-looking mace slammed into his arm.  Quickly, Rillen reacted casting a fast stun, but it was inaffective.  Again, the zombie bludgeoned him, this time in the other arm, paralyzing Rillen’s spell casting.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ulla’s elemental had taken a blow to the body and would soon be gone.  “Tirash il Nec Non Scortum Gladius Te!”  Thousands of bits of mana shocked the skeleton warrior, killing all that bound it together.  She saw Tali, weary and wounded, and telepathically sent her pet to help.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thoughts flashed through his head.  He clawed within his very self for the power he knew he possesed.  He felt the power of a shi’an within himself, but he couldn’t quite grasp it.  It must die.  A fire burned within his very self, burning to be released.  The pain from it racked his sides.  He coughed in pain as he was hit again, this time in the ribs.  He heard his very bones crack.  “Die!”  As he relaxed, he felt for the mana, and managed to grasp a smal bit.  For the fourth time in his life, Rillen’s eyes and hair turned blood red as fire seared the area before him.  In a flash, the zombie before him was incinerated, the armor melted.  Tired from his efforts, and doubled over with pain, Rillen crumpled over onto his bloody side.  With his very life blood seeping into the soil, he no longer had any energy.  His hair and eyes reverted to their normal color.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the aid of the elemental, Tali had finished off the second skeleton and rushed over to Rillen’s fallen side.  Ulla had seen the incident, but had been unable to help in time.  Tears flowed freely out of her eyes.  “Heal him!  Please.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tali nodded, but was unsure if she had the strength.  Her spirit was in it, but her bones were sore, and her muscles unwilling.  She slowly went down on her knees and placed her hands over his body.  “Coram Tu’el Feresh Guldan Foqui Tuscqel Wena’al”  She convulsed from the effort as her own energy was used to mend Rillen’s broken body.  His arm bones mended and his skin grew to cover the gash. “Coram Tu’el Feresh Guldan Foqui Tuscqel Wena’al”  His ribs moved back in their proper places, and the skin reknit itself over the wound.  Blue light encompassed his body as Tali’s own spirit grew wan.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We must go quickly to Rivervale, I sense more undead in the area.”  Telepathically, Ulla ordered her elemental to carry Rillen’s unconscious body.  They set off at a pace far slower than the one prior to the incident, but faster than their muscles would allow.  The soft earth of the walls of the valley were soon replaced with hard stone.  After minutes of walking, they had arrived at the entrance to Rivervale.  Slowly, they made their way into the city.  <br>
* * *<br>
           Luni stood before a window in her home.  She saw her people working efficiently like ants.  The smoke fires burned and hammers clanged upon anvils as the devices of war were produced.  She thought to herself, soon I shall bring about the oblivion.  Soon.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A single man stood before her.  He was one of the very few she had not touched.  He, like Girard, had given her a reason not to destroy his self.  He would be her spy, he would seek out those who had evaded her, and bring them to her.  His name was snake, she called him wurm. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pitifully, he spoke to her back, “Ma’am, I have come across some news that should interest you.  Apparently, the leaders of the cleric and wizard guilds who have eluded you have managed to come up with a cure of sorts to heal your subjects.  I know not how they do it, but I saw a man who days ago, was one of your own, now working with them.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Anger seared up in her.  She turned and backhanded him.  He flew through the air and crumpled in the corner.  “Find them wurm, and kill them!  Burn their notes and their bodies, or you shall find it is you who will be burning at the stake!”  <br>
<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren lay, stripped down to his undergarnments in a pool of hot, steaming water.  His bear, even after the charm spell had long since been canceled, refused to leave his side.  A stark-naked buxomous Halas woman slid into the pool right across from him.  Her winks and smiles were enough to tell him what she was selling, and he wasn’t buying.  Cautiously, he stepped out of the steaming water and onto the shore.  As he pulled on his clothes, she frowned.  He shuddered as he walked away with his bear behind him, her bovine face imprinted in him mind.  It had been a good hour and a half since he had arrived.  He had begun to worry, shouldn’t Hoku have gotten here by now?  The hot water on his skin had already chilled his clothes were becoming stiff as the water in them froze as he walked to the city entrance.  He hastened his step as thoughts of Hoku being injured entered his mind.  Could she have been attacked?  Could the cold have been to much for her?  No, she is too strong, too resilient.  His spirits rose as he saw her, walking with a grin on her face.  Although she was covered from head to foot in snow, and water was dripping from her robe, she was happy.  Obveously, she thought she was here first.  He shouted with a huge grin on his face, “Hey hon, had a chance to take a dip in the hot springs yet?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Her smile dissapeared as she laid eyes upon Paren.  In disbelieve, she spoke, “But how?  That spell should have given me a huge lead…..?”  Paren tilted his head, pointing at his bear cub.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Furry here gave me a ride.  We should hurry before night settles in.  I believe the Shaman guild would be the first place to approach, they speak for the city.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She glared at him, and with a wave of her arm spoke, “lead the way.”  A council of elders made up the governing body of Halas.  The majority of members were Shaman, but the warrior and rogue guilds had members also.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the walked, Paren spoke up.  “Of course, the warriors should be easily persuaded, but I am unsure as to which position the rogues and shaman shall take.  Warriors desire war and blood, while rogues seek only money.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have a way with words Hon, I’ll persuade them.”  It was true, Hoku did have a way with words.  Of course, her closest friends held suspicions about how much was natural charm, and how much magical.  The duo, walking arm in arm, had arrived at the dug-out shaman guild.  They crouched down and slipped into the warm confines of the guild house.  Its construction was crude, yet suprisingly warm.  The cold hardened dirt had firmed and created hard walls and sputtering torches lined the walls, providing both heat and light.  Shaman deep in meditation lined the walls.  At the end of the tunnel like structure was an empty nook, obveously for the guild master for its walls were lined with pristine furs and a small fire pit rested before it.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren tapped a particularily large barbarian woman clad in some not-so-covering wolf skins.  She grunted as she rose from her meditation.  “What do you want half-man.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He glared at her, but excepted the insult with grace.  “I have come to see the guild master, might I ask where he is?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mistress Halinora has stepped out for the night.  SHE will return tomorrow, come back then if you wish to see HER.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Our business is of...’<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your business is of no concern of mine half-man.  Leave me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Please, may you tell me where I can find her home.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The large woman let out a sigh, “Mistress Halinora is at the bathing pools.  If you hurry, you may catch her.  Now, leave.”  Quickly, the pair departed for the hot springs of Halas.  Fear and uneasiness were painted across Paren’s face.  They couldn’t be the same, could they?  The navigated the quick turns of the city and within minutes, arrived at the pool.  Hot steam rose from the water.  Three enormous men, almost ogres, sat lazily together, two of whom, staired with eyes filled of longing at Hoku.       <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oddly, Hoku pulled Paren to her side and turned him to face her.  With her hands behind his waist, she pulled him tight and placed her lips upon his.  Passionately, she kissed him.  Many seconds later, when the men had lost their interest in her, their lips came apart as Paren gasped for breath.  He stared at his wife to be.  To break the tension, she spoke, “C’mon, we must find her quickly before she leaves.”  He nodded in response.  “Where’s the woman’s pool?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Follow me.”  He led her through a rocky passageway to a room filled with steam.  A wooden hut had been erected around the pool in which the women solely used.  The air was dense and hard to see through, but Paren saw two women, one of whom, was the woman who had propositioned him not so long ago.  He moved behind his fiance to hide himself from her sight.  “Mistress Halinora?”  Paren breathed a sigh of relief as it was not the whore whose head was lifted.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The leader of the shaman guild did not appear to be as Hoku would have thought of her.  Instead of a large imposing woman, Mistress Halinora stood about five foot six, and couldn’t have weighed more than one hundred and sixty pounds, extremely small in comparison to the average barbarian woman.  Her graying long raven-black hair was tied back with a leather cord and her skin was leather hard.  Her blue eyes had a kind yet piercing gaze.  “Yes?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Me and my…wife, have come to speak with you as part of an erudic embassy.  We have come to speak with you of matters concerning recent events throughout the world.  Would it be possible for us to go elsewhere before we continue?”  spoke Paren.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her smile faded as she took in the information.  “Of course, my quarters are not far.  If you will be so kind as to follow me..”  She rose from the waters and draped a sheet around herself.  The sheet was worn and the water did nothing to help its transparencies.  Her ample breasts and voluptuous form showed quite clearly through her makeshift robe.  “You’ll excuse me, we rarely have visitors and our customs on public nudety are far more…liberal than those of the other races.”  They had left the bath house and were again going through the stone passages that were riddled throughout the city.  “My home is but a minute away, we shall talk as we walk.  Why have you come to see me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before Paren had a chance to respond, Hoku stepped forward and introduced herself.  “You obveously know of the loss of the gods.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Halinora blushed as she admitted that no, she had not been informed of the loss of all the gods.  “So it is not just Rallos Zek and The Tribunal…We thought that for some reason, our gods had forsaken us for some misdeed we had commited.  Please go on.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Numerous prophecies fortold by Vazaelle speak of a darkness that shall enshroud the world and of a child of flames who shall drive back said darkness.  This child was said to slay all those who fear and oppose him, the gods feared, and therefore, fled.  We fear that soon, the shadows shall come full force to our world and the child of flames has yet to be revealed.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’re here.”  A small house of pine lay nestled in a cave of rock.  Unlike the stark area around them, its pannels were painted in bright shades of blue, and the door a gentle saffron.  Halinora held open the door as they walked in.  She motioned for them to sit down upon a couch of bear fur.  With a flick of her wrist, a gentle fire started roaring in the fireplace, and small candles burst into life around them.  She sat down upon a iron chair of simplicity.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Let me be blunt.  More than two thirds the population of Erudin has been affected by some sort of curse and the continent of Faydwer has been blanketed with snow and rain.  We know not of other worldly affairs, but we of Erudin and the Faydwer alliance have proposed an military agreement between the free people of Norrath.  We have sent delegates to Thurgadin, Freeport, Rivervale, Ak’anon, and we will soon be traveling to Qeynos.  We were hoping that the people of Halas would join our cause.  As of now, we know not if our enemy will be able to be fought, all we know is we can not sit idly by.  The clouds that drowned the Faydwer are moving west…haste is required.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a sight, she spoke.  “That is certainly a lot to take in.  We have noticed the changes.  Less snow fell this year, the world is warming.  When our gods fled, our warriors cried and many shaman killed themselves.  We have struggled to survive without divine guidance, and we have survived.  BUT….something must be done.  A year ago, our people were happy and prosperous, now we are haggard, worn, gaunt.  We know not why we continue to live.”  She paused as she breathed deeply.  “I will speak on your behalf before the council.  I can not say what their opinion will be, but I think..”  Again she paused, “I think the people of Halas will be joining this Alliance.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren let out a sigh of relief.  “It is a comfort to know that the strong arm of Halas will be behind us.  We will send a delegate in a weeks time to further inform your people, but as I said, haste is necessary.  Will we be required further?  We must make our way to Qeynos and speak with Antonius soon.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your presence would help further promote your cause, but I believe I will be able to pursuade the council alone.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both Paren and Hoku stood.  Hoku walked over to her, “Thank you again.  We must leave, hopefully we may see the walls of Qeynos by dawn.  I look forward to seeing you again Mistress Halinora.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  “Good bye”  She whispered to herself, “I see in you both a strength that the I am glad to have known, fare thee well Hokulani and Paren.”   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   <br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna awoke on a hard bed of canvas and wood.  Her eyes darted from side to side as she took in her surroundings.  The light blurred her vision.  She was in a room of solid ice, and beside her rested Brenan.  Besides the bed, nothing else could be found in the room.  Her captors were people of stark frugality.  Both her hands and her head were tightly bandaged, and blood caked her skin.  She went to stand, and swooned under the pain.  Her leg seared in agony.  A single unadorned wooden door, slightly ajar, was on the other side of the room.  Ignoring the pain, she rose to her feet and hobbled to the door.  She leaned against the wood as she slowly pushed it open.  The wood moved easily over the smooth, almost glassy, ice floor.  About twenty dwarves were before her.  They were clad in the simple white robes of medics, and blue lights flared into life everywhere as they used their healing abilities to help the injured.  Other dwarves lay on cots, slings hung around their limbs.  Everyone was moving, quickly and efficiently.  She stared in awe at how well they worked together, everyone picking up where one left off.  They reminded her of gnomes, but she wouldn’t tell them that.  Pain seared through her thigh again as she collapsed to the floor.  She grasped the sides of her head, struggling to resist the urge to scream out in pain, her stitches had split and blood was seeping out.  A plump dwarven woman waddled to her side and knelt down.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Damn guards don’t know how to tie a simple bandage.   Hold still.”  Carefully, she unwrapped Forna’s leg wrap and lay her hands upon the wounds.  She chanted quietly in what Forna thought to be an ancient version of dwarvish as the area around the wound was shrouded in a blue aura.  The pain slowly became less searing as her flesh and muscles were reknit.  New skin grew over the wound, and in a matter of seconds, she was as good as knew.  “There!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you miss!”  As her eyes came into focus, she saw her healer.  She gasped as she realized it was no dwarf, atleast, it was no sort of dwarf she had ever seen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you…are you a coldain?”  The dwarven lady nodded.  Her skin was a pale blue, almost white and she had a mark upon her forehead, as did all the dwarves in the room.  Her hair was stark white and her eyes and lips a light indigo.  Like the dwarves of the Faydwer, she stood roughly four feet, and she had the same stockiness.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna recovered her senses quickly.  “I must see Colin Dain.  Please, take me to him, I have a letter…”  She patted her pockets searching for the letter, but it was not there.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Be still, your wounds are not yet healed.  We know of you Miss Forna, and your friend Brenan will be fine soon.  I shall heal his head wounds now.  With the giants and wurms acting up, we have had many injuries, I am sincerely sorry it to so long.  Colin knows of your arrival, and waits for you in the throne room.  Wait here, I shall go heal your friend.”  She waddled into the room, her plump thighs gently caressing each other.  Forna rose to her feet, her leg feeling fine.  She continued to observe the coldain.  So much like their hearty cousins, yet so different.  Minutes later, the woman emerged with Brenan behind her.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna realized she didn’t know the woman’s name.  “Excuse me, may I ask of you your name miss?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Curtly, the woman responded, “You may ask.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoku laughed politely, “What is your name?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The coldain woman looked up.  “I am known as Gurty.”  A faint smile crossed her lips.  “Follow me.  I shall take you to the Dain.”  The plump dwarf moved at a suprising speed, and the pair were hard-pressed to follow.  They observed the beauty of the city.  The walls of crystal and ice reflected and refracted the light so wondrously and an atmosphere of welcomeness was exuded from everything.  Gurty led them past numerous shops, in which hung weapons of war, wondrous cloth, and giant slabs of meat of dubious origin.  And of course, as all dwarven cities must have, numerous bars were littered throughout the city, with many patrons.  After a good five minute walk the trio arrived at a bridge of ice, after which was a large keep.  “Inside you shall find the Dain, he is awaiting your presence, I wish you luck, hurry.”  She bowed curtly, and then walked quickly back to the infirmary.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pair stared at each other, and then the keep.  With doubt clearly painted across their faces, they crossed the bridge of ice and into the keep.  Bright torches illuminated the area.  Dwarves clad is turqoise platemail with axes of ice stood guard, as stiff as the ice they were surrounded by.  Slowly, they walked through the great vaulting halls, through the huge doors of wood into the main audience hall.  Sitting atop a throne of plush velvet, was the king of the coldain.  He was a pitiful sight.  His cheeks and nose were red from too much drink, and his stomach no longer fit behind his generous platemail.  His beard was unkept and his eyes were blood shot.  The dwarf before them looked more an obese drunkard than a king.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna had been expecting a hardened dwarf of impeccable physical and mental stature.  It took a moment for her to recover from the shock of what lay before her.  Respectfully, she bowed before him.  “Sire, my name is Forna, and my companion here is Brenan.  We have come to speak with you of a Norrathian Alliance.  May I speak frankly?”  She took his ignorant grunt as a, ‘yes.’  “Well then, I know not if you have heard of the destruction of the Faydwer, but let me say it was complete.  Rain and snow have burried even the mountain peaks, nothing remains.  Diplomats have been sent to the cities of Freeport, Qeynos, Halas, Rivervale, and The Sunken Ak’anon.  Together, we have we can survive, apart, we believe we will not.  So far, there is no knowledge of a war of sorts, only natural disasters, but we believe war will ensue.  I will be blunt, Will you join us?”  After a long delay, Forna looked up from her shoes to find the king snoring upon his plush throne.  She felt like smacking him across the face, but restrained herself.  From a side corider in the room, a dwarf whispered, “Come here, quickly!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna shrugged, and then hurried over to his side.  Quietly she followed him.  He led her and Bren through a few passageways before stopped and turning to adress them.  “Thank you, My name is Bornlin.  You have unfortunately met our king.  He has not always been that way, not until he found the drink…”  The dwarf sighed in sorrow. “Anyways, you have come with information of an alliance of sorts?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Correct.  I’ll make this short.  Prophecies have fortold of great danger for the world, we are trying to create an alliance so that we may work together if need arises.  Obviously, we came to ask of the Coldain of Thurgadin would join our alliance, but with the king in his current condition, I am unsure if the aide of the coldain would be entirely helpful.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There is a secret council, hidden from the king, who now governs the city.  We honestly would join an alliance, but we can not.  The giants have increased attacks.  It is their belief that they lost favor with their Ralos Zek, and that is why he is absent.  To prove themselves to him, they seek to kill us all.  You saw the injured in our infirmary, we would be unable to help with such an alliance.  I am deeply sorry, there is nothing I can do, nor the coldain people.”  He looked down at his feet.  “I am truly sorry.  Go find Gurty, she will find you accomidations, or will you require transportation out of the city?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brenan replied, “I understand your situation, and hold no ill will towards your people.  Our friend, Rillen, will be by soon enough, but a nice room would be wonderful for the time being.  Gurty will be in the infirmiry.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, please go, I shall tell the king when he awakes that you have left.  I doubt it shall matter.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you for your time Bornlin, I wish for you and your people peace.”  Bren bowed politely, and then proceded to leave with Forna in tow.”<br>

Each guild had two representatives, a male and a female.  The clerics, paladins, druids, rangers, warriors, and ‘entrepreneurs’ were all present, each wearing the armor of their respective house.  They sat on a raised bench in a round room, hollowed out of a giant tree.  Their faces were not those of the jolly halfings of old, but the cold faces of the hurt.  The female halfing was obviously the leader, and it was she that spoke first.  “Hello, my name is Pelinor.  Ulla Tarrant, you come bearing news from Erudin?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ulla slowly approached the bench.  “Yes Ma’am.  A year ago, my husband and I were informed of a series of prophecies fortold by the goddess Vazaelle.  She spoke of the coming of a new age in which darkness would descend upon Norrath, and that darkness would be vanquished after a time by the child of fire.  The horror that has befallen both the Faydwere and Erudin was only the precursor to a series of tragedies that we believe shall affect Norrath.  To help prevent some of the damage that will be caused, we propose an alliance among the elves, humans, halflings, erudites, gnomes, and barbarians.  We have sent delegates to the foreign cites of Thurgadin, Ak’anon, Freeport, Qeynos, Halas, and your wonderful city of Rivervale.  It is our belief that, together, we will surive the events that are to come.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Querulously, Pelinor begged the question all had on the tip of their tongues.  “And which of these cities have agreed to join said alliance?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “At the time, only the Faydwere refuges and the Erudites have signed on…but we have sent diplomats to every other said nation and it is our hope that each will agree.  I am sorry I can give you no solid reassurance this alliance is worth your time, but I speak bluntly.  Two thirds the erudite race was affected by a curse, the continent of Faydwere is now burried under hundreds of feet of water, and the clouds that hung over the Faydwere are moving west, towards here.  With the combined efforts of the druids…who knows, we may stop the rain.  Again, I am sorry I can offer you not which you seek.”  Ulla bowed respectfully before the council, and took one step back to join Tali.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I thank you Ulla Tarrant, will we converse with our selves, return upon the hour and we shall give your our decision.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, Pelinor.”  Again, Ulla bowed before the council, and then quietly left the room.  Once outside the room, Ulla spoke, “Tali, do you honestly believe they will join our efforts?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your words were both eloquent and powerful, I think you have an ally in Pelinor, but I know not how the others will vote.  If the decision was solely hers, they would agree.  I pray to the gods they do.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they hurriedly began to walk to the cleric guild, Ulla asked a question that had been nagging her.  “Tali, why do you still hold faith in the gods, they abandoned us and can no longer aid us?  They fear that which comes to all mortals, death, and rightly so.  They have fled to the planes outside those of Norrath’s influence.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ulla, if you have not your faith, you have nothing.”  Her answer puzzled Ulla, while giving her something to think upon.<br>
“But why faith in the gods?  I perfer to believe in the hope and power of the mortal soul.  Only when one can trust in herself, and those around her, can she truly have both faith.  My husband is my faith Tali, it is he who without, I would have nothing.  Now, let us forget our philosophical debates for a time, we have arrived.”  The cleric guild of Rivervale was a sole room dug out of a hill.  Stone arches supported beams holding up the dirt ceiling, but other than that, the room was carved out of the soil itself.  In the back lay Rillen upon a cot.  Many halflings milled about, studying scrolls of healing and training in combat.  The unspoken ordinance that clerics shall never shed blood held no water in Rivervale.  Maces crashed against sheilds as spells clashed against magical shielding.  Ulla walked off to the side, avoiding the training, and hurring to her husband.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hi hun.”  Rillen’s wounds had been essentially healed by Tali, but the clerics here had finished the cosmetic work she had not the energy to do.  He had slept through the night peacefully, and was now moving to get up.  Quietly, he whispered, “They won’t let me leave!  I am apparently not ‘fully healed.’  How are things going with the council?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, we have spoken, and they are deliberating.  We shall know within the hour.”  Replied Ulla curtly.  Out of the blue, she felt an urge to kiss her husband, and urge she took to fruition.  Her lips caressed his own.  She whispered in his ear, “Lets go.”  Without delay, she spoke the words to a spell of invisibility.  In a flurry of bubbles, Rillen disapeared.  Ull’s only knowledge of his presence was her husbands hand, tightly clasping her own.  Nonchalantly, the due walked quietly out of the guild with Tali trailing behind, constantly watching.  The clerics noticed nothing as they continued their practicing.  Once outside, Rillen hugged his wife as he reappeared.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A halflings, barely eight years of age, hurried over to them.  As he panted, he coughed out his message.  “Mistress Ulla, Mistress Tali, Master Rillen, the council has finished.  They wish to speak with you now.  You will follow me.”  Before they had a chance to respond, he turned his back to them and walked far faster than one would think a halfling would be able to move.  He led them through the twising streets of Rivervale.  Men and women stood behind wooden stalls, hawking their wares to others.  Food stuffs and weapons of war hung apon hooks and clothing lay on shelves.  They hurried through the streets, shoving the many halflings aside respectfully.  Upon their arival, the young halfling turned to face them.  He panted for a minute, and then proceded to regain to posure.  “They await you inside.”  He bowed politely as he turned to rush off.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Together, the three walked into the dimly lit hollowed out tree that served as the meeting house for the Halflings.  Twelve pudgy halflings sat before them.  At the forefront was Pelinor in her shining golden armor.  “Hello again Miss Ulla, Miss Tali.  And hello Master Rillen, I am glad to see you are well.  We have reached a decision.  I am sorry to say that we will be unable to sign such an agreement.”  There was a long, silent pause before she again spoke.  Both Ulla and Rillen were crestfallen.  “But, should the people of Erudin, or any other free city of Norrath need our assistance, we will most graciously help in any way possible.  In addition, we wish to keep close contact with those of Odus so that, should the need arise, we will be able to aid in time such as you two did for those of the Faydwer.  Again, I am sorry for being unable to sign your agreement and join such an alliance fully, but we of Rivervale wish not to leave ourselves defenseless and are therefore, reluctant to put our full confidence forth.  We wish to send with you a delegate to safeguard you on your travels, and then to stay in Erudin.  Would this be possible?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rillen was at the least confused.  The halflings had agreed to basically exactly what the agreement’s terms were, yet they refused to join.  “I am pleased you wish to establish diplomatic relations, but I am unwilling to endanger one of your own on our own travels.  I would be pleased to send him or her to the forest of Toxxulia were, with a letter provided by myself, he will be treated with the utmost respect.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I agree to your terms Rillen.”  Pelinor turned her gaze from the trio off to the side.  A youthful halfling they had seen nothing of upon entering looking down upon her hairy feet was the target of her looks.  “Melora knows well of our laws.  She will serve you and your people well.  She has been trained for an occasion such as this, and will serve your people well.”  Quickly, Rillen removed a scrap of paper from a side pouch in hidden beneath the folds in his robes.  He scribed down his instructions and handed the youth the letter.  She looked up at him as she took the writ.  Her eyes were large, almost elven and of the most shocking green he had seen.  Her slender fingers were lithe and looked to be quite dexterous.  By the look of the scimitar strapped to her waist, and her leather armor, he took her to be a druidess.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Shall I translocate you miss to the forest of Toxxulia?”  She shook her head as she began the hand motions to open a portal herself.  Within seconds, she was gone.  Again, Rillen looked up at Pelinor.  He saw in her face emotion only a mother could know.  Melora was her daughter.  It was as clear as the tears that rimmed her eyes as she saw her daughter go.  “Once again, thank you.  I am sorry, but we must be leaving soon.  We hope to reach Freeport by nightfall.  Thank you again for you time and consideration.”  With Tali and Ulla at his sides, he spoke the words to his spell, and the three arrived once more upon the pyramid of the Commonlands.<br>
* * *<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The trip through the icy mountains of the Everfrost had been not nearly as difficult as last for Hoku and Paren.  Paren’s bear had led them both over the snow back to the enterance to the home of the gnolls.  Although it had been his devout servant, the bear had refused to leave its home.  As Paren left the snowy peaks, it roared in protest, but it wouldn’t leave.  Quietly, Paren and Hoku slipped through the Blackburrow.  Suprisingly, the area was empty.  Not a sound echoed throughout the caverns.  They emerged into the Qeynos Fields, wondering were to head next. From the corner of his eye, he had seen a man, so quick it was difficult to spot him.  A rustling in a bush, the sound of birds fleeing a tree, there were those around who sought to remain hidden.  Out of the blue, Paren grabbed his wife and pulled his fionce tight to his side. He clamped his hand over her mouth as she struggled to get free.  Silently, he whispered in her ear, “There are those around us who may strike us down with a single arrow.”  Slowly, he removed his hand from her mouth as she gasped for breath.  He scanned the horizon for the man, and his possible companions.  “I think it best we hurry to the Surefall glade.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She was afraid, yet, at the same time, exhilerated.  Her heart pumped rapidly as she and her lover ran through the hilly terrain.  She saw her husband looking from side to side, and she knew he saw men with dark intentions.  Within minutes, the arrived at the stone wall into which was carved the small enterance to the glade.  Oddly, no guards stood watch.  “What’s going on hon?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know Hoku, but I have a mind to find out!”  Together, they walked into the city/town of Surefall. As soon as they entered the tunnel, they heard the sounds of smiths working diligently, metal striking metal, and the shouts of men.  When they emerged from the earthen tunnel, they saw hundreds of valemen armed for war.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quixotically Hoku looked at her husband.  “Are those of the vale usually this prepared for the which is unseen and unknown of?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren seemed to be in a state of shock.  He spoke emphatically.  “No!, these people are generally happy and carefree.  Yes there is an attitude to them, and a caution, but never have I seen it to such a degree.”  He jumped in surprise as he felt a hand upon his shoulder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren turned around.  A group of battle-hardened soldiers stood before him.  These must have been the men following them.  A palidan with the creased face of a man in his fifties steped forward.  “Hello, I am Dalalron.  Why were you two traveling through the fields?  Do you not know of the danger?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both were shocked.  Paren responded politely, “What danger do you speak of?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dalalron appeared shocked.  “You know not of the armies of Qeynos?”  He looked at the two and was again shocked to see both shaking their heads.  As he began to procede, he furrowed his brow.  In a stern voice, he spoke “Why are you here?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    “We have come as delegates of Erudin.  The erudites, dwarves, and elves wish to create an alliance with those of the free world to prevent against the unnatural occurances we believe soon to come.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apparently convinced, or at the least, intrigued, Dalalron spoke, “Follow me.”  Although no threat was present, Paren knew at any moment, he may be struck down by a hundred arrows.  He held is wife’s hand tightly as they followed Dalalron into one of the few wooden buildings in the area.  Dalalron struck a match and lit a lamp, bringing light to the room.  He ushered them in, and motioned for them to sit.  He closed the door, and went to sit down across from the pair.  “Something odd is happening in Qeynos.  They have prepared for war.  Our scouts report that thousands of humans stand together out on the edge of the fields of Karana.  We have sent messangers, but none have returned.  It doesn’t make sense, but they are marching somewhere, and we fear the worst.  Now, what is this alliance you speak of?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hokulani spoke up.  “To sum it up, we fear exactly what you say is happening, war.  To help prevent such actions, we have sent people to all the free cities to form an alliance.  We hope that, together, we can stop that what the fates have fortold.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How many other cities have agreed to this?”  Questioned an unsure Dalalron.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “As of now, the elves, dwarves, and erudites are all as one, and the barbarians have all but agreed.  Delegates are at every other major city as we speak, telling them the same.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright, have you need of us, we will aid.”  Hoku was flabbergasted.  Never had she thought politics to be so simple.  Before she had a chance to speak, shouts of alarm went up.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ATTACK!  The Qeynosians are attacking!”  Hoku, with her knowledge of war, knew something was amiss.  Those of Surefall glade had scouts and runners riddled throughout the hills.  They would have known of an attack hours before it had happened.  Dalalron rushed out the door.  He spoke as he ran, “If you wish an alliance, help fight!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoku and Paren followed him out the door.  Men and women appeared out of nowhere clad in the platemail of Qeynos.  Children as young as six and seniors nearing their seventies swung swords and blocked blades.  Hoku’s instincts rose as she punched an elderly man in the face and kicked another in the crotch.  She screamed, “Block the entrance!”  A few druids, out of harm’s way, began calling upon their natural powers, cunjuring great thorny bushes.  Quickly, vines grew around the entrance, but even quicker, they were slashed apart by more men appearing from the vary air itself.  Of course, a small troup of soldiers, hidden by spells of invisibility, would have been able to enter the city!  The archers from the top of the stone walls shot no arrows out towards the hills.  Again, she shouted, “Shoot around the enterance!  The soldiers are hidden by spells!”  The glademen fought hard, but it was difficult to fend off a foe who had the advantage of giving the first slash due to being hidden from sight.  If only they could gain the enterance…  The qeynosians had entered the city, hidden by a cloak of invisibility, and then had attacked.  They held the tunnel, which would decide the battle.  The gladesmen fought hard, but with the qeynosians holding the entrance, they couldn’t lose.  Their archers were placed wonderfully, so as not to be able to be attacked by sword or bow.  White fire exploded in her eyes as she felt the sting of a blade bite her arm.  Restrained anger burned within her.  Quickly, she spun to meet her attacker.  In his eyes, she saw what she had seen in those of the erudites who had fallen ill.  Whatever had cursed those of Erudin, had spread to Qeynos and held it’s power over these people now.  She brought her hand up to the man, and with a word of power, sent a stream of magical power into him.  He fell silently, dead.  Charms would not work on these people, nor mezmerizations.  She saw amidst the fighting, Dalalron, weilding his giant sword of lightning.  <br>
When he struck, it was as if electricity surged through his enemies’ very souls.  There was nothing holy about him though.  Blood caked both his weapon and his armor, which had neither glow nor sheen.  Although his appearance was neither heroic nor beautiful, his might voice rallied those who fought beside him.  Paren had also fought bravely, but it wasn’t enough.  A pile of corpses lay at his feet, but there were hundreds more and he was already tiring.  <br>
Hoku saw the druids, about twenty of them chanting in the language of nature.  Rock sprung forth from the soil, closing the enterance tunnel.  The tide had turned.  The archers from above killed many below with their bows as the rangers and palidans methodically butchered the remaining soldiers.<br>
* * *<br>
Lunisha was on a pedistal of ebony.  Thousands of humans stared silently at her.  Her voice, aided by magic, carried for miles.  “My children, I will be leaving you for a time.  Do not despair for I shall return.  More will come to aide you in bringing about the destruction, welcome them.  Kill all who come with bad intentions.  Guard the Surefall Glade.  Kill all those who leave.”  She descended from her platform, and as her foot touched the last step, she dissapeared.<br>
* * *<br>
Ulla, Rillen, and Tali had quickly jogged through the lightly wooded hills of the common lands.  They had encountered little wildlife and the inns were silent.  The only sounds they heard besides their own feet hitting the ground was the ever-rare bird chirping.  It was somewhat unsettling, yet, peaceful.  As they entered the cold city of stone, the black of night had already set it.  Rillen turned to his two gals.  “I think it’s a bit late to be calling upon the leaders of Freeport.  Shall we find an Inn?”  Ulla nodded, but Tali shook her head.<br>
“We would be better off sleeping in a den of wolves.  I have heard tales of this city.  It is said it was built on a festering swamp, upon which nothing would grow.  Animals refuse to nest here, for it is a place so vile that the gentle hand of humankind would do not to heal its wretched state.  Some say Innoruk hath planted his seeds in the murky waters.”  Her eyes shone in emotion, displaying her devout belief of what she had read.  “And, I have found references in the tomes from your great library that insinuated Freeport having a extremely organized thieves guild.  You would be wise to hold tight your coin purse while here.”<br>
“There is a home to the gods of valor and love in this city.  I believe there we will be able to rest comfortably through the night.  And if not, the guild of wizards will give us accommodations.  A thief would be insane to walk into the guild of wizards with bad intentions.”  While uncomfortable, Tali grudgingly agreed to enter the city.  <br>
* * *<br>
Hoku, Paren and Dalalron stood together in a dimly lit room.  The shock troops of Qeynos remained outside the city, seemingly placated.  It looked as if no re-enforcements would be sent from the main army, and it was questionable if they would even attack.  Moral was low within the forested city.  They were outnumbered, out armed, and in a terribly indefensible area.  Although the conditions were grim, the steadfast people maintained a semblance of order and calm-headedness.  Breaking the silence, Hoku spoke.  “I think this is but the beginning.  Something has bewitched these people, and what it is….I don’t know.  Can we evacuate?”  <br>
“We can, and we must.  I have already given the druids the order, it will be done.  May we join your forces on Odus?  I am sorry for being so frank, but this is not the time for formalities.”<br>
“Of course you may, but you must realize that we are all together in this war.  The Qeynosians will not be the only ones to rise to fight.  I trust that they have allies with those of Freeport, or even Neriak.  Nevertheless, we must leave and prepare for the worst.”  He responded with a curt nod of his head.  <br>
“The druids have prepared for the evacuation to occur at sundown, at the height of their powers.”  He looked up respectfully to the sky.  In a voice void of emotion, he spoke, “we have two hours.”<br>

The swamp did not settle well with Lunisha.  Quickly, she had traveled through the plains no longer belonging to Karana.  No longer did rain plague such fields of blissful emptiness.  Soon, life would no longer disgrace the world that her master would create. She awaited that day, but to help make it a reality, she was forced to trudge through the vile jungle and swamps that the ogre’s and troll’s called ‘hom.’ Life was so full of ‘no longers’, everything was working, and soon, no longer would the ogres and trolls be at their hom.  The great wall of the swamp in which the trolls had carved out their city loomed ahead.  She quickened her pace, her lord’s will must be carried out.  Two guards, stomaches hanging over belts readjusted countless times, approached her.  Their clubs were larger around at the hilt than Luni was at the waist, yet fear had no hold over her, after all, Cazic Thule was gone.  The first of the two warty beings opened his mouth and a foul stench or fish and waste filled the area.  “Wut women doin’ in swamp!”  The purple eyed ‘thing’ raised its club in what could only have been taken as a threat.  Before it had a chance to swing the tree limb, Luni had her hands on the trolls.  Their minds now blank except for a desire to please, they fell in behind their mistress as she entered the gloomy city of Grobb.  <br>
* * *<br>
<br>
“How could they have refused our offer!  We were sincere, and only good could have come of such an alliance, yet these Freeport….bastards have refused our proposition.  Even the palidans were more than reluctant to speek on our behalf, what has happened to the city of men?”  Rillen was crestfallen.  Neither Rivervale nor Freeport had agreed to join the alliance of the free cities of Norrath.  As he looked to the sky, he saw the gray clouds from where the rain that doused the Faydark came.  He looked down into his wife’s eyes with his own rimmed with tears.  “Let us find Tali and leave, nothing good can come of the town.”<br>
“She is pleading our case to the Clerics, if she succeeds, we gain a powerful ally, we must wait.  Be patient my husband, all will be well.”  Even in her own ears her words sounded hollow and void of hope.  “And you very well know the gnomes won’t help.  You’ve heard the rumors as have I.  They fear the world has gone to unintellectuals, and refuse to leave their cavernous home.  The humans sent delegates there first, and it was that very refusal by the gnomes that stimulated the human’s refusal of our own offer.”  <br>
* * *<br>
“What do you mean we can’t leave!?”  Surprise and fear were laced into Hoku’s speech as she spoke.<br>
Dalalron calmly retorted, “We may not leave.  A magical net has been woven over our city, we can’t leave by way of spells.”<br>
“Then what do you plan on doing.”<br>
“We will wait, you have said that the elves, dwarves, and erudites support us, they will come.  The way to the forest is blocked off and the troups of qeynosians ensure escape through the entrace will fail.  What else can we do.”  <br>
Glumly, Hoku responded, “Could we possibly get a runner through their lines?  If we could reach the barbarians, we would have a chance.”  Queitly, she prayed her sister and brother in law came through.  <br>
“The possiblility is extremely impossible, and I wouldn’t ask one of my own to risk his own life were I myself would not.  The true question we must ask ourselves is why.  Why have the qeynosians attacked, and why have they not finished us of as of now?”<br>
“There is a curse spreading throughout the world, it affected much of the erudite race.  It leaves the people empty of emotion and will, it must have crossed the sea to qeynos.  What we lack in information is who has concocted the curse and who is controlling those affected.”  Hoku clearly recalled the horror she had seen in the bay at Erudin.  Those poor souls still remained there, their minds gone.<br>
“It seems we are undermanned, out-smarted, and trapped like rats, but we of the glade don’t give up that easily.  Our situation isn’t as grim as it may seem.  We have enough supplies for years, and although we may not leave, they may not enter with ease.”<br>
* * *<br>
In a little under four hours, Luni had encorporated herself into the system of the troll city.  Her residence, while not comfortable, was not disagreeable.  Her entourage of two had grown to seven in the time, and new trolls entered as she recovered her strength.  A growling voice of the next member of her army came from within the other room, “Wut goin on herre?”  Within rustling a single fold of her garnment, Lunisha rose from her satin couch and walked through the silk drape that seperated the two rooms.  Her perfect lips parted.  “Hello, and good bye.”  Before the g of good had graced her lips, her fingers had traced a line on the creatures stomach, he was hers at hello.<br>
* * *<br>
Tali had come, a group of nine followed her.  Their races ranged from ogre to halfling, and they claimed to be the clerics of the heart.  Their leader, a human by the name of Suwen, had advised the twelve go to a bar that the clerics visited often.  The Weeping Rose was an establishment of dubious appearance, yet Rillen for some reason trusted the group, even the ogre whose eye glowed an odd shade of purple.  Suwen approached the door and whispered something inaudible through a hole on the wall.  Seconds later, the door opened and the clerics walked into the smoke filled room.  Su led them all to a large table towards the center of the room.  She motioned for the others to sit as she herself sat down.  “Rillen, we have heard of you and your wife.  You know of the prophecy, the legacy of the Shi’an, and the obediance curse?”<br>
Ulla tried to sound powerful, yet the noise that came out of her mouth could have only been taken as that of a frightened child.  “Who are you, what obediance curse?”<br>
The halfling, Panda, answered.  “Like we have said, we are the clerics of the heart, the obediance curse is that which has plagued the city of Erudin and more recently, Qeynos.”<br>
Tali, now astounded near-shouted, “The curse that has affected the erudites that has stolen their spirits has hit Qeynos!”  <br>
Panda again responded, “Yes, as of now they are camped in the Qeynos hills.  Sadly, we know not of their plans.  You didn’t know of this?”<br>
Rillen again spoke, “No.”  Querulously, he asked the question begging to be asked.  “Who ARE you, are you Shi’an?”  <br>
Suwen raised her bowed head.  A look of sadness crossed her face.  “Yes….and no.  You know of the myth of the Shi’an, the great war of old?”  Rillen and Ulla nodded in reverence to the great mortals of old.  “We are as they were, pawns of the gods with great power.  While you found you power from within, we were shown ours by our gods.”  A tear trickled down her hollow cheek as she parted her thin lips to speak again.  “Elrossi Marr who taught me to love showed me the path to inner power.  The gods entrusted us with their domain, E’ci and Karana did not, that is why their elements were wild for a time.”<br>
“What of the child of flames, do you know of him?”<br>
“That is the thing, neither Solusek, nor his father Fennin chose a Shi’an, there is no child of flames.”<br>
“That can not be, the prophecy left no loop holes, he MUST appear and stop what is to come.”<br>
“What you have deemed as what is to come has already started.  It, is a woman, unfortunately, that is the extent of our knowledge of her.  She has mustered the armies of Qeynos.  As of now, she is at a standstill, we know not of her plans.  We must act soon.  We must head to Neriak, there our darkest brethren await us.  You know of one, Venira?  Innoruk’s daughter.”<br>
Rillen looked up.  She had been the most helpful of all, if in a condescending way, in helping him understand what he was.  “I know of her, but me and my wife will not be able to go with you to Neriak.  We have friends who are in the Qeynos area, we must go.”  <br>
“We understand, and we know of your efforts for a union.  Know this, Those of Halas have joined us, but the coldain are adament against joining such an alliance.  The balance is extremely wobbly, if death is weighted down by the passing of many, more will die, but if the cause of death is exterminated, another death-bringer will come.  We stand on a precipice, and we must jump.”  <br>
Rillen turned to his wife.  “Ulla, I think its time we get our friends, and kill this ‘woman.’  As he began to chant his spell to take them to the Great Devide, Panda graced the pair with spells of invisibility.”<br>
* * *<br>
Bren and Forna had grown restless.  Their coldain friends had been accomidating, yet their bones itched for….something.  They both felt useless.  Every day, they would go out and help the efforts to hold of the giant’s offense, but it seemed worthless when the real fight would be taking part elsewhere.  The morning had passed, the meager rations carefully distributed.  With the giants on the offense, the hunters had been unable to snare sufficient food.   As the sun set, Billions of snowflakes reflected the colorful rays.  This was the beauty of the frozen tunra, the aurora.  The wondrous colors that the tiny frozen crystals refracted were far more enchanting than any faceted gem ever cut.  Before the pair headed into the city to gain the most needed sleep, they once again stared out in the distance, looking for Rillen and Ulla in their fluttering robes, but there were no erudites, no robes.  Not today, maybe tomorrow?  Yes, tomorrow, they will be here.  With her hand holding his waist close to her, Forna led Brenan back into the city of ice.  His body felt nice against her skin, warm, so full of life.  He was her best friend, as she planted a sloppy kiss, she told herself again, friend, yes, friend.  They had grown close by default as Rillen and Ulla had always been close, closer than they were to others, and Hoku and Paren’s budding romance had recently left little time for friendship.  The Inn in which the pair was staying, The Drunk Dragon, was deffinately alive at the hour.  Songs of nonsense that only perpetuated more drinking were being sung, and the liqour was spilling.  A female dwarf wearing something so revealing that only a dark elf wouldn’t be ashamed of wearing was dancing on the stage, platinum pieces dropping before her.  The proprietor’s hair seemed to gray every day as more mugs were shattered and tables turned into splinters.  Generally, Forna would have stayed down and had a drink or two…. or nine while Brenan retired to their room, but the moment didn’t sieze her this particular night. Together they climbed the not-so-steep stairs(dwarf sized)  up to their room on the third floor.  Scones filled with magical globes lined the walls, spreading light throughout the dank halls.  Forna raced up the last few stairs, and opened the door.  She ducked down and entered their room.  There they stood, Rillen, Hoku, and Tali.  For what seemed like minutes, no one spoke.  Bren entered the tiny room and broke the silence.  “How went…the, the alliance search.”<br>
Rillen stepped forward.  “The halflings have joined our cause, to a degree.  The humans have not.  A small group of Shi’an from Freeport know of the prophecy and will stand with us, they have gone to retrieve their brethren from Neriak.”  <br>
“Well, that’s wonderful!  Unfortunately, our luck was not so great, the dwarves have refused our proposition, their own situation is grim.”<br>
“I wish we could Help Forna, but we must hurry.  There is a war, the war for the world.  We must go.”  Rillen turned to Tali.  “We are going to the Karanas, you must travel to Erudin and inform our people of what is to come.”  She nodded in response.  In her armor, with her sword strapped to her back, she looked quite the Palidan.  It seemed as if a holy aura emanated from her very soul.   Rillen chanted, and as if Tali had been but a memory, she dissapeared.  Turning his gaze from were she had stood, Rillen looked at his friends.  So strong, yet, so fragile.  His wife, the strongest of them all.  He loved her, more than life itself.  He would sacrifice himself for any of them, but he would kill them all to save her.  “Lets go.”  As his eyes fell upon his wife, he shut them and began to speak the arcane words that would take them to the fields of the karana, to the battle of a lifetime.<br>
* * *<br>
Thousands of Trolls stood at her back as she marched to Ogguk.  Quickly they had fallen.  Luni was dressed in a gown of black, the color of all her clothing.  Her hair was up and her lips were painted a vibrant shade of purple.  Luni held the odd suspicion that if she had merely told the trolls there was toe fungi pie to be had, they would have followed her every word, but she was more confident in her abilities than the never ending hunger of the troll race.  Anyways, it was time, time for the end.  She sighed, “I lack patience.”  She meant this not as a fault of her own, but to tell those around her that things were not fast, not right.  “The Shi’an shall fall, and I shall be Queen, soon.  …But not soon enough!”  She glared at the nearest troll and with a flick of her wrist, sent him into a fit of convulsions ending a in death of blood and pain.  She smiled as she always did when she saw something dissapear.  Not caring for her garment, she walked through the gory mess staining her slippers a terrible shade of green and leaving a glob of the sticky mess between her toes. Four guards, each weighing atleast five hundred pounds ran, or wobbled to the best of their ability, up the the approaching army, fear hidden not so well behind their small, piggish eyes.  <br>
“Whud you wa….wa….wan?”  The firsts’ treetrunk legs wobbled as he staired into the blank faces of thousands of trolls, and at the forefront of it all, Lunisha.<br>
“I am messenger of the father, he has come for  me to enlist you in the army of oblivion.”  Again, there was a faint curve in her mouth as she attempted to smile.  “Good bye.”  Her hand darted faster than the eye could see to grasp the throat of the first, and quickly she spun landing the back of her fist into the face of another.  The third was mutilated by the forefront of her army.  What a waste, but what did it matter?  Soon she would have the entire ogre race at her back, soon all would be gone.  <br>
* * *<br>
Tali arrived at the spires she knew all too well.  The sounds of the elves were faint, but it would be mere minutes before she arrived at the elves’ new home.  She set off at a quick jog.  The day was mild, the usual humidity of the Toxxullia forest not booming with full force.  Three minutes had passed and in the distance she saw the fortification.  While still many buildings were on the ground, new huts and walkways were sprinkled among the tree limbs.  The elves were making themselves comfortable, perhaps new wounds healed faster than assumed?  The largest building, the first created by the few remaining druids was were Tali was heading.  It was there were she would find Shi’el, and the Erudic and Dwarven ambassadors.  She entered the room, not bothering with the proper protocol insisted upon by the high elves.   She looked at the shocked Shi’el, the other Erudites and Dwarves.  “Assemble your men, we go to war.”   As she turned to leave, everyone began to shout, among them, Shi’el stating clearly, ‘why, who?’<br>
Without turning to adress them, she clearly stated, “Why, to save ourselves, who we war against is unknown, but she shall bring the end if we don’t stop her.  Assemble the troops….or die, the choice is your own.  I hope you understand that you have no choice.”  <br>
Shi’el turned to address those remaining in the room.  “We knew it was coming, it was just a matter of when.  I will muster the wood elves, I trust you all will do the same with your people.  Go, we meet at the docks fifteen hours from now.”  <br>
* * *<br>
Rillen, Ulla, Forna, and Brenan stood hidden to the eye atop the pyramid, a remnant of a power of old.  Thousands were camped on the field below and Rillen silently thanked his wife for thinking to cast a spell of invisibility upon them all as he teleported them to the Karanas.  He heard his wife, her voice trembling in fear.  ‘What power could muster the generally honorable and benevolent people of Qeynos to go to war against their brothers, those of Surefall?’  Surely the same curse that befell those of Erudin has stuck here.  Yet here, something is controling the mindless.  Something.  These thoughts plagued Rillen, and as he looked to his friends with spell enchanted eyes, he saw those same thoughts reflected in their own determined eyes.  “We must go, Paren and Hoku must be in Surefall.  If we can get close enough, I believe I can cast a spell of anti-gravity to help up breach the earthen walls.”<br>
“How will reach there undetected, surely among their troops there must be those who can see through invisibility.”  Asked Bren.<br>
“Let’s hope not Bren.” <br>
* * *<br>
Hoku and Paren sat together by the waterside.  A hundred soldiers stood ready in the tunnel with a group of six druids backing them up.  Eighty rangers were on the earthen wall, eyes enchanted to see the invisible, standing ready.  They would not be caught unaware again, no, never again.  With fingers intertwined, they kissed.  It was not a kiss of passion, but a long gentle kiss.  His lips barely caressed her own as he pulled her closer to him.  “We may not survive this my love.”<br>
“I know.”  Her eyes were teary as she spoke, but she was strong.  Never had it been said that Hoku and Ulla, sisters of blood, were not strong.  She would survive, and as she looked into Paren’s eyes, she knew he would to.  They would survive, if only for each other.  <br>
Paren came to a revelation as he stared into the deep purple eyes of his lover.  He realized he could stare at those eyes forever.  At first, for both, their relationship had been an almost agreement of sorts.  Just for pleasure, atleast, that’s how he took it, but something had blossomed of that, something deeper.  “Marry me.”  They had joked about marrying, but Paren never really understood his Hoku’s true feelings.  Hoku started to respond, but Paren would have none of it.  He wouldn’t allow for a no.  No, he wouldn’t.  “Now, Marry me now.” <br>
“I can’t Paren.  I love you more than this world, and I will marry you.  But, now, right now, is not the time.  I will have my sister at our wedding, along with Rillen, Brenan, and Forna.”<br>
“But!”<br>
“But no Paren, I love you.  If you feel the same, you should understand.  We will live.  We will survive.  We will.”  She caressed his cheek gently with her fingers before pecking him on the cheek.  It was necessary, she would have married him right then and there, but had she, he would have been more preoccupied.  They needed to have clear heads in the coming battle.  If they didn’t, they would die.  <br>
* * *<br>
She hadn’t the time to wait.  Luni had summoned the leader of the Ogres, Bloog, and taken him.  It had been a simple matter, and with him under her power, she controled the ogres.  As she left the swamps of Inothule and the jungle of the Feerot, five thousands ogres and trolls marched behind her.  <br>
* * *<br>
Suwen and the other Shi’an of the gods had traveled to Neriak.  They had been met with aversion, but Venira allowed them safe passage through the city to her home, a six-story estate that would have made the god of greed jealous.  They were ready, the children of the gods.  They would finish this.  <br>
* * *<br>
In a weeks time, Lunisha had returned to the fields of Karana.  Her troops were assembled.  The order would be given to attack.  After Surefall, Halas would fall, and then on to Neriak, Rivervale, Freeport.  All would die.  The elves, dwarves, and erudites had wasted no time in getting ready, but with the docks smashed, the karana teleportation pyramid guarded, and all but one ship destroyed, not all of the army had traversed Erud’s crossing.  The people of Surefall were ready, but they could not hold off thirteen thousand troops.  Rillen, Ulla, Hokulani, Brenan, Paren, and Forna, along with the residents of Surefall wait in fear for what they know to be coming.  <br>
* * * <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thirteen thousand ogres, trolls, and humans would end this.  This was the ending of a mistake.  Lunisha was the only one who understood.  In her were the captured minds of thirteen thousand.  In her.  For that reason she wept, but whether they be tears of sadness or joy, only she herself could know.  Her people were camped in the Qeynos fields, and those of Karana.  Life must not be allowed to continue.  With that thought, she gave the command.  Six hundred ogres armed with anything from six feet long swords to frying pans charged the entrance to Surefall glade.  The sound of their feet thundering upon the ground was deafening.  Two hundred archers released and reloaded, but the ogres refused to die.  They didn’t feel the pain, it was not in their capacity.  The archers fired again, this time aided by druidic spells, but it was enough.  Before they had again reloaded, the first wave had reached the tunnel.  With one sweep of his might arm, the first of the ogres had lain waste to five staunch paladins.  With a calmless unknown to the ogre race, the troops spilled the blood of their enemies.  Druids erected natural barriers to slow their progress through the tunnel, but the vines and thorny bushes were but slight irritants, much as gnats, to the giant ogres.  Hoku, standing at the forefront with the rest cast a spell of mesmerization.  To her horor, its comrades killed it without a thought and then proceded to slaughter anything in their way.  Rillen sent forth a stream of flames, searing the flesh of anything standing before him.  The fact that the dying creatures refused to emit screams of agony frightened him more than their wails would have.  From behind, he heard an almost feral scream as a man shining with the light of the gods ran by.  His sword flashed, Ogres fell.  In what seemed like moments, the man had cleared the entire area of Ogres.  Atleast fifty of the huge creatures had fallen by his hand.  From the clear sky sprang up clouds of black.  Swelling clouds let loose and rain poured down onto the earth, washing away the blood of death.  The sound of more ogres echoed through the entrance as Dalalron, leader of Surefall, led his men to death.  Rillen, Hoku, Ulla, Paren, Bren, and Forna followed.  They would die, but they would each die a glorious death.  When they emerged, they were shocked.  The field of Qeynos was filled with soldiers.  An endless sea, it was horrifying.  And at the midst, sitting upon a raised dias, was a woman.  Rillen turned back his gaze to the fight.  Forna had wasted no time observing, and already had her foot planted firmly in the face of an ogre.  They were the shock troops apparently.  They would weaken the enemies, and the humans and trolls would kill what they left in their wake.  He looked around, and realized his friends had already taken up arms.  A war was never one by a pacifist.  He sent forth Giant Ice commets and streams of Fire.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ulla was near her husband.  She would never leave his side.  This war, the whole ordeal had allowed her to tap into the powers gifted to her by Ullarinariel.  Her hair flared into an unnatural red and her eyes were as two giant rubies.  From her hands, she summoned acid and fire.  They were pushing back the ogres, but there were Thousands.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forna and Brenan worked as a team, as they always had.  He protected her as she risked her life, running head first right into battle.  She punched an ogre in the face, rendering him unconscious, and toothless.  Searing pain erupted in her side, but was soon soothed by a spell of healing by Bren.  Quickly, Forna turned to face her apponent.  Another Ogre wielding a wicked axe that most likely weighed more than she herself.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paren squared off with another, his blade the equal to the others.  While the ogre held brute strength, Paren had discipline on his side.  He blocked an upper strike and slid his dagger in the thing’s side.  It winced, giving him the opening to scream a song of pain in its face.  It fell down dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoku found her best tactic being mesmerizing anything in her way.  Those creatures were quickly cut down by their own.  Why did this have to happen.  Why did this BITCH have to create this curse.  She took away their minds, SHE took away their spirits.  She must pay.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dalalron struck out with his sword, killing an ogre with the lightning streaming down the blade, and blocked another blow with his golden shield.  His sword, like a snake, darted forth and slipped through the greasy skin of the attacker, but the attack had left him open.  Five ogres had surrounded him and one managed to slide its axe through his helm and breastplate.  His head was cleanly severed from his neck.  Blood poured forth, like a bubbling stream in a quiet mountain area.  In that moment, the sky was torn asunder as thunder crashed bringing death to the forces of Luni and Dal’s alike.  The force of the bolts threw men through the air.  As quickly as the storm had come, it dissipated.  With Dalalron, the true son of Karana gone, they would lose.  <br>
<br>
I appologize for killing off Dalalron and ending the chapter so terribly, and putting this together so shabily and out of the original chapter formation, but I deemed it necessary for the first two, AND, got lazy for all three. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dall@fantasystoriesforum>Dall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/02 7:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=111.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fires of the Heart</span><hr size=1> Now why did you have to kill off Dalalron? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rillen@fantasystoriesforum>Rillen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/02 10:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=111.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fires of the Heart</span><hr size=1> I guess I didn't.  I just wanted to add a depth to the story, an aura of sadness, but, I had more plans for him.  I kinda stopped writing this story as I realized it was junk.  It was full of such reckless writing, I've given up on this.  I have started a new story in the general fantasty story section.  I'd like to think I'm doing a far better job with it than I did for this.  After all, Fires of the heart started three years ago, when I was fourteen.  I should hope my writing has improved then....<br>

BTW, are you going to finish YOUR story?
