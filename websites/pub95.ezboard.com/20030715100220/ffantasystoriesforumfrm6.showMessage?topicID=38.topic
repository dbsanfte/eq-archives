Her eyes dared not glance up in the mirror; her reflection was the last thing on earth she wanted to see. It was the ever-present reminder of why her beloved answered to the others calls and forgot hers. Sleep lingered over her thoughts and kept her mind blank. Her head and emotions were at a stand still and like so many times before she finds herself feeling nothing. Mechanically she breaks the frigid clear column with cupped hands. Leaving them under she turns her head and looks behind her. Nothing. Alone still she splashes her face, shattering any remaining sleep. With eyes tightly shut, she reaches behind her blindly she searches the wall using only her sense of touch and, finding the cottony touch of a towel, tugs it from its place. Tossing it onto her face she pats the water from her skin. Alone still. Setting her hands against the counter she lets her eyes meet in the mirror. Today she was even less attractive than yesterday, if that was at all possible. The rushing sound flows through one ear and out the other, clarifying her nonexistent thoughts. Deep chocolate brown iris’s stare back at her in the reflection. Mussed brown sugar strands of hair surround her head and face. Such a mess. With tiny pale hands she runs her hair through, flattening it out with ease. Tearing herself from the near scary sight before her, she meets glances with the faucet. A fast flowing waterfall spills out of the chrome opening and shoots onto the glistening shore of porcelain and then through yet another chrome opening into a dark tunnel that led to god only knows where. How quickly the poor stream of waters ‘life’ came to an end. From one cold surface to the next and on into the depths of the unknown. It was saddening… Slender fingertips twist a pearl white handle and the stream stops, ending all pointless thoughts of the ‘sad water life’. Somewhere in the silence she found comfort. In the blank expressions and lack of complete thought she found it as well. One foot drudges on in front of the other. With some surprise she looks around the pale green hues of her kitchen. She didn’t want to come here, did she? The table. It sat in the same place it always had, but today it caught her eye. She could not take herself from it. They sat there, together. They ate, they laughed, they talked, they loved… Many a night through the candlelight she felt herself fall for him over and over, even harder than the first time. She remembered how his eyes burned with passion as he sat across from her and said those three dreadful words, the words she would give her life to hear this very moment just one more time… Her heart was not done snapping its own strings. From the table she saw the kitchen counters. As she looked on their surface now she saw it in her mind. She saw her sitting there, leaning against the side of the fridge with her feet near the stove and her hands holding a bowl filled with chocolate chip cookie dough. They would make it every year, and fight over who got to eat more of the dough. One time, they ate so much they threw up and only managed to make one sheet of cookies. The tears were coming, they were always coming. And as the tears came, and came strong, her knees left. Her legs were no longer a part of her body, they were a pile underneath her. It was the memories of joy that tore her heart out in the worst ways. The smiles that exchanged cheer with a single glance, the jokes that spawned undying laughter. The kisses and gentle passing touches that no longer wrapped themselves around her soul. It was torture. She could no longer wake up in the morning without breaking. How much longer would she be able to break? Her palms press against her face. These tears had to be hidden. No one could see them, they weren’t hers. She caused them, but they couldn’t be hers. She never asked for them, she never wanted to own them. She could feel the earth tremble as she did. She felt the universe bleed with her heart. She felt her world break completely as she did. <p><Br><Br><Br><Br><Br><b>A.D.D to me means you don't have to ask me why now</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/20/02 1:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Di luce e scuro - Good mourning</span><hr size=1> i'm awestruck, lovie. this is so greart... can't move fingers...  too engrowseeesedGRAR    Write mmore.
