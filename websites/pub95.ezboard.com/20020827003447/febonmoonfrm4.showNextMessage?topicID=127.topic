If you cant trust old friends who can you trust?<br><br>Next is all the people KS'ing (reason I blew up today). For the last 2-3 weeks every time I solo some one has to take what I was fighting (few maybe by mistake but I know some was on purpose). I have even had a guild come along a few times and take everything I was hunting (even when I was the only one in the whole zone for the past hour) leaving me with nothing.<br> And now tonight, I see a snow griff on track so off I go.<br>Seems Kelwin had the same idea, but I was unaware of this. Make a long story short another KS (although might not have been on purpose). I know I shouldnt get mad when a guildy does it, because most likely it wasnt on purpose. But considering it has been happening so much I get pissed when anyone does it.<br><br>Now dont get me wrong I still like EQ, but the people who play it is another story.<br>I will give myself time to cool off before I decide, but right now seems this game is more frustration then it is fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>19</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubartelthecleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bartel the Cleric</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hard Core Shadow</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> Re: Might be time to call it quits</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 6/13/02 11:53:42 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Those thoughts crossed my mind a time ago Ninye.

I do feel bad for the fact that this has happened to you, but please believe that I (and I hope no one else in the guild) would ever KS another guild member.  In tonights case, I did have the griff snared before you tagged it, I had already fired several arrows into it when I saw the message about my snare wearing off.  It confused me for a sec because it stopped and bythe time I realized what had happened, you had already nuked...<br><br>As I said in game, there are bad streatches for all of us...   I have not been able to get into a good xp group with any of my characters for a month...   it gets really frustrating when I spend 3 or more hours online running from zone to zone with LFG tag on trying to find a group and even when you can see there are spaces available they don't want ya...<br><br>It all has it's ups and downs...   I sincerely wish that you would stay.  I know there are times when ya just can't take it, but there are others that are great fun for all of us...<br><br>So, please, consider hanging in there with us.  If you get frustrated with a specific person, tell me about it in-game.  I have and will send direct tells to the person, to their guild leader and ultimately GMs (guides now, no more GMs).  It is part of my job as guild leader to make sure you have a good time and if someone is spoiling it for you, I do my damndest to make sure they don't do it again...<br><br>As for tonight, I can only apologize...  I will be happy to assist you and anyone else in obtaining the griff eggs, and I will do it whenever you have the time, just let me know...<br><br>Kel... <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>849</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ucendarienthistletongue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendarien Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ebonmoon.com/images/eclipse.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Co-Leader</span><br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/chimerapop/img/cen_tmb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> Re: Might be time to call it quits</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 6/14/02 3:02:42 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I don't understand why you would think KELWIN of all people would intentionally KS you.

I remember having Dred around 17 at Oowomp isle when you were killing the birds and those people came and took them. That's been quite a while, and I understand your frustration. I find I can't really solo Fae much either. It's just too competitive for xp spawns.<br><br>Personallly, I'd suggest a break before you cancel your account. Take a couple weeks away. If/when you come back, Kelwin is there to help. That's why you're in a guild. Well... one of the reasons, hehe. He can help with the KS'ing thing, and will. The other reason you're in a guild is, hopefully, so you can group up. Right now, the xp is pretty weak, but we're all working together as much as possible to get a solid base of people in their 50's. Then we can go back to grouping for really good xp on mobs above our level.<br>So, take some time, cool off. Make your decision. Know that we'll miss you if you leave, but we'll also understand, and if you should leave and then decide to start over at some point in the future, you'll always have a home in Shadows.<br><br>Take care. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Faedaer Ryverwalker<BR>Siege Captain<BR>Keeper of the Fist <BR>Woodland Priest of Tunare<BR></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>750</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthedwarfwithaspoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Dwarf with a Spoon</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Priest Elder</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> Re: Might be time to call it quits</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 6/14/02 10:12:22 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I have found that time can help with the Peeved off feeling.

You came to help a poor low level character out when no one would. For your kindness and friendship you have given to me, I respect you more than anyone else who plays this game. I will be extremely saddened if you leave EQ. <br>       I guess you can say you are my inspiration to keep striving to be a good player not just another @#%$.
