His vision was blurry.  The objects around him seemed to be swimming in a haze of fog, but his eyes weren’t alone.  Cendarien began to think about what happened to him and how he ended up here.  He sat up facing what looked like a wall.  There was an absence of sound around him.  Being a good ranger, he quickly realized that he was in a cave of some sort.  The smell gave it away.  He brought himself up towards the stonewall and leaned back against it to rest.  Cendarien rubbed his eyes vigorously but to no avail.  He glanced out ahead of him and could see nothing but darkness for a ways.  It seemed to go on forever.<br><br>“I see you’ve awaken,” a voice came from all around him.<br><br>“Who are you?” Cendarien asked, “And what of my vision.”<br><br>“I wouldn’t worry so much about your eyes young ranger, but more you life.”<br><br>Cendarien blinked hard to try and erase the fog from his eyes but it wasn’t working.<br><br>“Rub all you want ranger.  The spell I have casted on you will last quite a while.”<br><br>Cendarien stopped.  It was hopeless it seemed, “And what of my wife.  What have you done with her?”<br><br>“Your wife, oh!” the voice sounded excited.  “Your wife escaped my grasp.  But she will be back.  I know she will.”<br><br>“I don’t understand,” Cendarien tried to localize the voice, “Why have you taken me captive.”<br><br>“A bargaining tool.  You see, there seems to be a great price on the head of your wife young ranger.  A price that is to high to resist.”<br><br>“What of it?  What is this price?” Cendarien began to stand up.<br><br>“The price.  I rather should be saying reward.  You see, when that Sorrowblade struck me down I was doomed to hell for the rest of my life.  I had sold my soul to Cazic Thule in order to accomplish everything in this vile world.  Cazic wasn’t pleased with my sudden death and hid my soul from others.”<br><br>“Ranger, have you ever experienced pain?”<br><br>“Yes, many times,” Cendarien replied.<br><br>“Then image that but one thousand times greater.  Your precious Sorrowblade placed me in a rather unpleasing predicament.”<br><br>Cendarien laughed, “It was only fair.  You killed her father.”<br><br>“I killed her father because it had to be done, not because I wanted too.  But, that is history.”<br><br>Cendarien asked again, “What of this reward?  What could the gods be granting for the life of one half elf.”<br><br>“Resurrection,” the voice replied.  “The ultimate of all rewards.”<br><br>“You’re planning on being reborn when you slay Belana,” Cendarien took a step forward.<br><br>“Yes, it will be a glorious day.”<br><br>“You know I won’t let that happen,” Cendarien took another step forward.<br><br>Laughter echoed around the ranger.  It came from all different directions.  The reverberations off the cave walls made the laughter seemed louder and more distant that what it was.  Cendarien felt something in front of him.  The voice spoke again, and Cendarien could hear it loud and clear.  It was from right in front of him.<br><br>“I’m sorry, but only the living can kill me, and from what I know, in the next couple minutes you won’t be part of that order any more.”<br><br>( Back In Odus )<br><br>Inien felt the heat of the fire pass around him.  The flames escaped the void around Inien and engulfed a nearby bookcase.  A small fire began to burn inside.<br><br>“What the hell are you doing Phel,” Inien stood strong in the doorway.  Phelsuma was just finishing her incantation from the fireball that left her hands.<br><br>“I guess I underestimated your powers wizard.  But, the one thing you won’t be able to avoid is my blade,” Phelsuma withdrew a scimitar from a side sheathe.<br><br>Inien looked back at the fire, he raised his hand quickly and soon a huge wind blew through the opening of the door sending pages and books flying in different directions, but the fire was put out.  Inien stepped outside, “If it is a duel you are looking for, then I will have to decline.  I disdain from fighting with weapons forged by the hands of flesh.”<br><br>“Then this will be a short adventure for me,” Phelsuma charged Inien.  Inien held his hands out in front of him.  A long wooden staff appeared out of thin air.  He grabbed the middle of it and placed it down, horizontal with the ground pointing towards Phelsuma.<br><br>Phelsuma swung her sword in an upward attack sending a vibration through the staff.  Inien held on tightly and brought the weapon back down to block Phelsuma’s follow up attack.  Inien found himself on the defensive quickly.  She brought her blade back down but Inien matched it.  Her sword cleaved a notch in the middle of the staff sending small shards of wood flying.  Inien pushed her back, both combatants sat staring at each other a couple feet apart.<br><br>“I ask that you stop this foolishness Phel.  I will not be responsible for what happens to you if you do not heed my word,” Inien commanded.<br><br>“Your such a fool Inien.  Your time has run out grand wizard.  It is time for you to become a memory.”<br><br>Inien shook his head, “I don’t think so.”<br><br>Phelsuma smiled and reared back for her next attack but suddenly a small creature flew down and grabbed onto her head.  The sounds of Phelsuma and the creature screaming were all that could be understood.  The creature flapped its small wings as if trying to lift Phelsuma off the ground.  Phelsuma struggled with the creature for a little bit but soon gained the upper hand.  She made enough room between her head and the creature that she was able to expulse a small bolt of energy sending the small creature to the ground in front of her.<br><br>“Pardon the intrusion, but this imp must die,” Phelsuma placed her sword high above her head.<br><br>Inien’s eyes became white as snow.  Loose dirt and leaves began to vibrate around him and soon his body was encased in a white fire, “You leave him alone!”<br><br>Phelsuma glanced at the flame-encased wizard.  She gasped suddenly as she realized she had taken her eyes off of him for to long.  A ball of ice began to form in front of Inien.  It rotated and pulsed in a white glow.  Phelsuma had no time to react before the ice comet was upon her.  An explosion of cold struck Phelsuma sending her flying back into the small hut that Inien had crafted and through an open window.  The sound of glass breaking was muffled in the explosion of energy.<br><br>Inien’s mana calmed down.  His eyes refocused.  Inien ran over to the small creature, “Muffin!  Muffin, are you all right?”<br><br>The small imp shook its small head.<br><br>“Good! Now where did that druid go,” Inien walked towards his hut.  He peered through the window and noticed a body lying crumpled up against the wall.  He stepped up and over the windowsill and through the debris in the room to get a closer look.  Phelsuma’s body lay unconscious.<br><br>“Now what?” Inien asked himself.  Muffin flew up through the broken window obviously hurt from Phelsuma’s attack.  He was flying with a limp.<br><br>Inien looked down at Phelsuma’s body again but noticed something odd.  He bent over to touch her but he quickly withdrew his hand.  Phelsuma’s image began to shimmer.  Her likeness began to melt away revealing someone else.  Inien watched intensely to see who was hiding under the false disguise of Phelsuma.  It didn’t take long for him to recognize who it was and he gasped.<br><br>“Aianya!”<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/3/02 7:20:29 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>380</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Part VII - Beginning of The End</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 5/4/02 5:25:26 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> &lt; Close to the bridge in Felwithe &gt;<br><br>Zaboxx and Belana stood no more than ten yards from each other.  The atmosphere was of malice.  Kelwin still drew in breath but it was without any other movement.  Tension was thick.  A slight gust rustled up Belana’s hair.  Her short strand of white hair crossed her eyesight.  She lifted her arm to move her hair behind her half-elven ears.  Glancing down quickly at her garb she had wished she had gone home and changed.  Belana was still wearing her everyday street clothes and not her cherished Ry’Gorr Armor.  It would have served her more protection from the arrows than the cloth she was currently wearing.<br><br>Zaboxx turned to his side and began to face back and forth in front of her, “I wish it didn’t have to come to this Blackpoint.  Its impossible that I could ever turn down this opportunity.”<br><br>“I would hate to disappoint,” Blackpoint returned.  She glanced around to see if anyone else was patrolling the streets at this time.  There was no movement anywhere.  She thought of her training and the many battles she had been involved with.  Her style of fighting could not be matched by those that wield a single weapon, Belana would strike two or three times before her assailant could ever deliver there first blow.  She was still worried though.  It had been so long since she had actually dueled someone that was actually of a higher skill than her.  Zaboxx had shown her many times defeat.  They had sparred many times in their adventures but each time Zaboxx always found the upper hand.<br><br>“Your scared,” Zaboxx said.  “Your scared to lose, aren’t you?”<br><br>“I don’t have that option,” Belana replied.<br><br>“I know if I was in your situation I would be scared too.  I mean, to think that with your failure, your precious leader will also fall to my sword and the Shadows would be leaderless.  Broken.  Without Kelwin you would not even be associated with a name such as the Shadows.”<br><br>“The Shadows have undertaken a wound like that way before you ever decided to try Zaboxx.  I wish you be clear on your intensions.  Why are you doing this?  What is your motivation for turning your back on the ones that once called you brother?”<br><br>“Brother?” Zaboxx laughed.  “Look at me Belana! I am a Tier’Dal.  I am not like your other brothers and sisters in your band.  I am dark elf.  I will and always will be an outcast amongst everyone.  Strife is something I have learned to accept.  The bitter realism of this world prevents me from ever enjoying life.”<br><br>“And how does killing us satisfy your plans?” Belana lost her fighting spirit.  She let her hands rest at her side.<br><br>The wind kicked up once more blowing Belana’s hair again.  She soon wished to cut herself free of the bother on top of her head.<br><br>“Satisfy?” Zaboxx answered but was soon unsure of himself.  He drew a puzzled look on his face.  He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out.  He dropped his weapon to the ground and grabbed onto his head.  Zaboxx looked straight out at Belana and pointed at her, and he fell.<br><br>Belana watched.  She ran towards him but stopped.  She knew that Zaboxx might be laying bait for her.  She called out for him but she got no reply.  Belana brought her daggers up in front of her chest for protection.  She hovered above him, she made sure that his weapon was far from his reach.  She knelt down and shook him with from side to side.<br><br>“Zaboxx?” Belana shook him again.  “Zaboxx?”<br><br>She peered back towards Kelwin.  He still lay motionless on the floor.  She stood up and raced over towards him.  She pushed the shield off the top of him and cradled him forward so she could get a good look at his wound.   She could still see the shaft of the arrow still embedded in his back.  She grabbed the shaft with her free hand and pulled.  The sounds that followed were not something Belana could describe but the sudden release of the arrow from Kelwin’s body jolted him alive.  He gasped for air as the pain bolted through his body once more.  He opened his eyes and turned his head to face Belana.<br><br>He whispered to her, “Place my hand over my wound?”<br><br>Belana complied and moved one of Kelwin’s arms arms to reach behind him.  She rolled out his fingers and covered the wound with his now open palm.  Kelwin casted a quick heal and soon the open wound was gone.  Again he casted a quick spell that brought back the strength that he had lost.  The crafty ranger was soon back on his feet in the matter of seconds.<br><br>Kelwin looked over at the Zaboxx’s body, “Is he dead?”<br><br>Belana answered, “No, he is not.  He just fell over.  As if a great weight suddenly weighed down upon him.  I lifted not one finger.”<br><br>“That is good then,” Kelwin replied, “Because if you two would have engaged in battle I doubt I would be speaking to you right now.”  He turned and walked over towards Zaboxx’s body.<br><br>Belana knew that Kelwin was right.  The thought of her own death though never bothered her.  It was inevitable.  She knew one day that her life would cease to exist.  The Sorrowblade name would die with her.  She quickly shook loose the thoughts of death and doubt and followed Kelwin.<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/4/02 6:16:16 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>388</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Part VII - Beginning of The End</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 5/8/02 5:57:00 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Belana and Kelwin stood above their fallen comrade in arms.  Zaboxx still rested on the ground unmoving. Belana kept running the scenario in her head over and over.  The last motions of him pointing at her before he fell, she imaged his hand again.<br><br>Kelwin reached down and picked up the weapon that Zaboxx had drawn on Belana.  It was a simple longsword.  The craftsmanship was beautiful.  Kelwin took a second to admire the blade, the he pointed it down towards Zaboxx.<br><br>Belana looked at Kelwin, “What are you doing?”<br><br>Kelwin replied, “To attack a fellow member in our guild without just cause is an act worthy of death.  It will be quick and painless for him.”<br><br>“What!” Belana exclaimed.<br><br>“Need I remind you of the arrow that was put in my back?  How about that guard over there,” Kelwin pointed towards the full armored guard that laid still.  “He would have killed you too if he hadn’t past out.”<br><br>Belana bit her lip.  She couldn’t let this happen.  Kelwin lined the sword up with Zaboxx’s head.  His strike would be quick and clean.  He shook his head in disapproval of his actions but duty came first in his life.<br><br>“You bare witness to this Belana.  I will need you to explain why I did this to the council of Felwithe and to the Shadows.  They will surely want to know what happened to their guardsman.”<br><br>Belana didn’t reply.  The image of Zaboxx’s before he fell kept flashing into her head.  Over and over the image past through her head, her visions were swimming around that one point in time.  She kept seeing his hand.  His hand.  His hand.  She glanced up at Kelwin, who was just finishing some religious rhetoric.  His hand.  Belana couldn’t shake it.<br><br>Kelwin finished.  He brought the blade up over his head and closed his eyes.<br><br>[ Back in Inien’s house ]<br><br>Inien stood in disbelief.  He had seen pictures of the one they called Aianya.  She had been the one that started a band of brothers and sisters he now called family.  In his haste judgment of the figure it turned towards him and opened it’s eyes.  It brought its left leg up and kicked Inien away from her.  Inien went sprawling into the wall and fell against a bookcase.  The sudden impact jolted the bookcase loose from its foundation.  It began to lean forward and multiple tomes began to fall out quickly burying Inien.  The figure stood up and walked towards the bookcase.  With a quick shove the bookcase came crashing down upon Inien burying him in books and wood.  A cloud of dust kicked up.  The figure glanced in-between the bookshelves and could see a hand jutting out from the pile.  The figure watched it for a couple seconds and soon walked away seeing no life twitch inside.<br><br>The figures image flickered again.  Its skin soon melted away and took another form.  The figure walked over to a nearby closet and removed a robe of Inien’s.  It undressed from its current garb and placed the robe over its body.  Looking into a cracked mirror, the figure smiled in satisfaction.  The abstract vision filled the mirror with an image familiar to itself.  The image of the fallen wizard, Inien Astralwrath.<br><br>[ In an underground cave ]<br><br>Cendarien felt himself get pushed back down towards the ground.  His vision still hadn’t cleared up. Shaking his head, he again asked his captor what he or she wanted.<br><br>“If you’re going to kill me then do so now.  I will not be played with like an animal!” Cendarien rose to his feet once more.<br><br>The voice laughed, “In due time ranger.  I am readying your death as we speak.”<br><br>“I’m tired of these games!” Cendarien found the wall again and began to follow it.  He thought maybe if he followed the wall it would lead the cavern’s mouth.  He hoped he just picked the right direction.<br><br>The voice returned, “Then why don’t I shed some light on the matter for you?”<br><br>A blinding flash encased Cendarien.  The cave lit up as if one thousand torches had been lit.  Cendarien opened his eyes and realized he could  see once more.  He checked around him quickly and could see that he stood inside a large bowl.  He laughed quickly realizing he would have walked in circles until he past out from weariness.  Inside the bowl were a couple piles of bones and a dark object on the other end.<br><br>The voice came again,  but more direct.  Cendarien glanced above him and could see an image dressed in armor.  The chest piece bore the crest of the Felwithe Clerics.  The long white hair draped down around her head and down her neck.  Cendarien gasped!<br><br>“Willisa?” Cendarien stepped back to get a better look.  His elven eyes were not deceiving him.  He was seeing what was fact.  He was looking at the undead body of Willisa Sorrowblade, his wife’s sister.<br><br>She spoke, “This will be a grand event.  You see, I have found a couple of my favorite skeletons to occupy your time while I’m gone.  Unfortunately, your time won’t be that long.”  Willisa glanced down at the bottom of the bowl.  The three piles of bones began to reanimate themselves.<br><br>“But don’t think I’m unfair.  Three against one is not what I had intended, I thought I would rid myself of another that began to get a little close to the truth before I could act.”  Willisa stood up pointed towards the dark object on the other side of the bowl.  The shroud lifted off revealing a familiar face.<br><br>Willisa casted a quick heal spell setting life back in the inanimate figure.  She stood up off the ground and quickly glanced around.<br><br>“You two enjoy.  I must be going,” and with that Willisa walked out of site of Cendarien and his other captive.<br><br>Cendarien quickly ran across the bowl dodging the re-animating skeletons.  They hadn’t yet completed reforming.  He came across the female.<br><br>“Phelsuma?”<br><br>“Ow, ow, ow!  Where am I?” Phelsuma looked towards Cendarien.<br><br>Cendarien looked out again amongst the walking undead.  They had finished with their reforming and the unhinged skulls rotated around looking towards the two.  They raised their hands like mindless zombies and began to walk towards the two shadows.<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>399</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Part VII - Beginning of The End</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 5/15/02 2:58:26 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Phelsuma gained her bearings and stood up next to Cendarien.  A sudden pain shot from her chest that caused her to wince.  She quickly wondered what could of caused such a terrible shock.  Phelsuma took a glance out amongst the incoming gang of undead.  She looked over to Cendarien.  She laughed inside.<br><br>“These are no match for us Cendarien,” Phelsuma looked back over and extended her arms.  She began to chant the words that only druids could speak and soon a blast of fire encased one of the skeletons.  It erupted in an explosion of bone shards.  Cendarien and Phelsuma covered their faces quickly to protect their eyes from the splinters.<br><br>Cendarien looked back over to Phelsuma, “Your right.”  Cendarien hands began to radiate a red fire.  He charged after one of the last few skeletons and struck out with his fist.  The skeleton recoiled from the blow and fell down.<br><br>“I’ll finish it off,” Phelsuma again casted her magics and soon the second skeleton was no more.<br><br>The final skeleton slowly walked towards the two.  Its bones creaked with age.  It arms were still outstretched as if it was begging to be placed in pieces like the others, and soon it was.<br><br>“That wasn’t so hard,” Cendarien looked over towards Phelsuma.<br><br>“I know.  I can’t believe I let that witch get the best of me,” Phelsuma answered.<br><br>“Witch?” Cendarien walked over to the walls and took a chance at climbing out.<br><br>“Yeah, that thing masquerading as Whitepoint.  And I wasn’t alone.”<br><br>Cendarien scaled down from the wall, “Who was with you?”<br><br>Phelsuma glanced over at Cendarien and watched his attempts to climb up the bowl they were laying in.  She walked over to him and held out her hand, “Grab hold.”<br><br>Cendarien complied and soon a powerful force threw the both of them up and outside the bowl.  They landed with the gentleness of a baby’s gaze.  The perimeter of the bowl was unguarded.  It seemed that they were the only two left in this strange cave.<br><br>“Zaboxx was with me,” Phelsuma broke the silence.  She turned to face Cendarien again who was brushing himself clean of dust and debris.<br><br>“What happened then?”<br><br>“Zaboxx and I were walking through the Burning Woods and we came across a high elf that needed help.  We both stopped to see what we could do and before I knew it Zaboxx was knocked down by something.  I didn’t have much of a chance before I fell to the same.  The last thing I remember was her face,” she rubbed her chest.  The feeling of pain was beginning to throb inside her.  Again, she wondered what she had done to cause such pain.  Or what had been done to her?<br><br>Cendarien looked puzzled, “Then what happened?”<br><br>“I don’t know.  I awoke but couldn’t move.  Everything was dark and for some reason I couldn’t cast up until now.  It seems that someone she had locked my powers but unlocked them.”<br><br>Cendarien thought for a moment, “Wait a sec.  Why would she unlock your power?”<br><br>“What do you mean?”<br><br>“You were just laying there when I was tossed down here.  She casted a spell and soon you were moving and up and about.  Then she left.”<br><br>Phelsuma thought for a moment, “Your kind of right.  Why would she do that if she wanted to rid herself of us.”<br><br>Cendarien shook his head, “This is getting thicker and thicker by the minute.”<br><br>“Well, we need to find Zaboxx.  If he is hear.  Do you sense him?”<br><br>Cendarien closed his eyes for a moment.  He bent down low and then straightened himself up again, “No, I don’t.  But I do pick up one other instead of us in hear.”<br><br>Phelsuma walked away from Cendarien, “Your right.  I can feel it too.”<br><br>“Let us see who this is then,” Cendarien began to run in the direction of the scent.  Phelsuma followed.<br><br><br>[ Back in Felwithe ]<br><br><br>Kelwin held the blade over his head.  He made the decision in his head and brought it down.  His hands stopped.  Kelwin quickly opened his eyes to see what held his blade.  A single dagger blocked the path between the blade and Zaboxx.  Kelwin glanced over and could see Belana holding the dagger.  His eyes grew wide with astonishment.<br><br>“What are you doing?” Kelwin relaxed and brought the blade down to his side.<br><br>“I think we are acting on false pretences.  Zaboxx didn’t mean to do this,” Belana replied.<br><br>“You can’t be serious.  Is the hole in my armor not enough proof?” Kelwin looked angered.<br><br>“You don’t understand.  When he fell over he offered his hand out to me.  At first I thought he was pointing at something but when I look at it again he was actually holding his hand out for me.”<br><br>“And that means?” Kelwin asked.<br><br>“He was asking for help.  Something isn’t right here.  Where ever I am the truth is masked by falsehoods.  This whole fight was set up but somehow Zaboxx’s strong will broke the hold on whatever was holding him.  There are darker forces here in Felwithe.  They haven’t revealed themselves yet though.”<br><br>The sound of clapping echoed from behind them.  Belana and Kelwin turned to see who it was that was clapping.  A hooded figure appeared out from the darkness.  The figures white hands could be seen in the light that only the stars and moons provided.<br><br>“You are wise beyond your years Belana Sorrowblade.  You should have dabbled in the arcane arts instead of sneaking in the shadows.”<br><br>Belana reached down for her weapons quickly and withdrew them.  Kelwin followed suit with the long sword.  <br><br>“Belana Sorrowblade.  Rogue of the Dagger.  Wife to Cendarien Thistletongue.  Sister to Willisa Sorrowblade and Aaeon Stormbringer.  You have quite the family tree.”<br><br>Belana shouted, “What is your game?  How do you know of me so well?”<br><br>“This is not the setting I wish to describe to you your fate.  I will bring us to a more,” the figure paused, “suitable location.”<br><br>Belana and Kelwin didn’t have time to react before they were teleported away.  The sudden blackness overcame them quickly but soon they were surrounded by torchlight.<br><br>They found themselves inside a cave.  The walls were lined with torches.  Kelwin looked to his sides and noticed that Zaboxx was also with them, although he was still unconscious.<br><br>The robed figure emerged again, “Now, this is more like it.  I would hate to slaughter the whole town of Felwithe with one fell swoop of my hand but I know that the other gods would not allow that.  At least, not right now.”<br><br>“Other gods?” Kelwin asked.<br><br>“Ah, Kelwin Jumala.  Ranger of Tunare.  It is good to see that you have not lost your will to speak.  It would be wise though that you hold your tongue.  I have no quarrel with you and if you play your cards right you might be blessed to keep that pitiful life of yours.”<br><br>Kelwin did not answer.  He could sense a great power from the figure.  He just didn’t hope that it was who he thought it was.<br><br>The figure’s head turned towards Belana again, “It is to bad that Zaboxx refused my will.  I crafted him from my own mind.  A natural born warrior.  A warrior infused with the art of every known weapon to my mind.  With the added strength of necromancy he could have been invincible in my army.  It is unfortunate he did not work out.”<br><br>“So you were controlling him?” Belana returned.<br><br>“Again,” the figure chuckled to himself.  A dark, ominous tone filled the caves.<br><br>“Did you just hear that?” Cendarien turned towards Phelsuma.<br><br>Phelsuma stopped running, “I think so.  We have a bigger problem though than that.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“I sense five more in this cave.  And I know who three of them are.”<br><br>Cendarien used his acute tracking skills and gasped, “It’s Kelwin.”<br><br>“Yes, and Zaboxx and . . .”<br><br>“Belana!” Cendarien shouted.  He turned and ran as fast as he could.<br><br>“Yes, I was controlling him.  I was controlling him and another.”<br><br>“Another,” Kelwin asked<br><br>“Yes, someone I made just in case my plan was met with failure.”<br><br>“Your plan?” Belana looked over to Kelwin who had the same expression on his face.  She glanced over at Zaboxx but still saw no movement.<br><br>“Well.  I hate to give it away but since your at the end of your existence I will fill you in.”  The figure removed the hood from its face and revealed a figure that was very familiar to them.”<br><br>“Inien!  What are you doing?” Belana yelled.<br><br>“I am not your friend Inien.  He is dead.  I have merely taken his form.  I needed one more element to finish the deal, but I will explain for you are probably very confused.”<br><br>The figure began to pace, “Your sister’s body is now possessed by the demon that you thought you killed in the plains of the Karana’s not so long ago.  Unknown to any living being, the demon that now calls himself Darkpoint was brought before Cazic Thule.  He begged for a second chance.  Cazic granted him that chance but made a deal with the demon.  He would grant Darkpoint the dead body of one being of his choice.”<br><br>“So he chose my sister’s body,” Belana looked disgusted.<br><br>“Correct young one.  He did choose your sister’s body.  But, unknown to even him that something else was in the works.  Cazic approached Innorrukk and asked for his help in the matter.  Cazic does not like you very much.  Sins of the father maybe.”<br><br>“My father is dead!”<br><br>“And that is why Cazic is upset with you.  You see Belana, your father was supposedly no holy man.  He was agnostic, just like you are.  But, it was a lie.  Rogues don’t follow deities.  You were brought up that way and he was too.”<br><br>Cendarien and Phelsuma stopped.  They could hear a voice talking.<br><br>“Your father believed in that wretch Tunare.  The same idol that your sister, Willisa worshipped.  But, when your father died, his soul went to Tunare.  Tunare made your father a captain in her armies in a war that you living folk do not see.  It is raged in the skies and far below the ground.  Your father has been the biggest thorn in his side since his death.”<br><br>Belana smiled.  The sudden thought of her father in battle suddenly made her happy.  She wished to see him at least one more time to say things that she had always wanted to say to him.<br><br>“And that brings us to you,” the figure stopped moving, “I was sent from my Lord Innorrukk to find myself someone that was close to you.  Someone in this family you hold so dear.  So, I chose Phelsuma and Zaboxx.  I possessed their minds in a rainy night in the Burning Woods on Kunark.  They will never know the unspeakable acts they perpetrated against their fellow man.”<br><br>Cendarien looked over to Phelsuma who grew pale.  She brought her hand to her mouth and closed her eyes.  The thoughts of her harming anyone quickly made her grow ill.<br><br>“Phelsuma and Zaboxx finished off your half-sister Aaeon the other night to be exact.  It was a grizzly affair if my accounts of it are correct.  You can blame Zaboxx for the killing blow.”<br><br>Belana soon felt sorrow strike deep within her heart.  She had forgotten all about Aaeon.  The last remaining shard of her family.  <br><br>Phelsuma gasped at the thought of killing someone.<br><br>“But, she could not finish off Inien like I had asked.  Inien was too strong and defeated her.  In the debris of the battle, I traded places with Phelsuma and took a form that would shock the wizard into fright.  Then I finished the wizard off.”<br><br>A sudden pain shot through Phelsuma’s chest.  A stimulant to the truth that this figure had said.  Again, the thoughts of her harming Inien and Aaeon caused great depression inside her.  Her heart became weighted and soon she in tears.<br><br>Cendarien looked over to her and gripped her shoulder, “This was not your free will.  Be free of you demons.  We will be in action shortly and I will need all your wits.”<br><br>Phelsuma didn’t reply.<br><br>“Inien,” Belana whispered, “It can’t be true.”<br><br>“I used the guise of becoming the vision of Innorrukk to charm them into helping me.  It took a strong hold on both and they reported to me as if they were talking to the exalted one himself.  It is true rogue.  Everyone you have ever cared for is dead.  All except that ranger of yours but if my memory serves me correct he will not be walking amongst the living for much longer either.”<br><br>“What have you done with Cendarien!” Belana shouted with a rush of strength.  Grief stricken as she was, she couldn’t let anything else happen to her friends.<br><br>“He is of no concern.  Let me finish my story first,” the figure paused and took a step closer to Belana, “You see, Cazic and Innorrukk are betting for your soul.  When you die Belana, your soul will be, well, up for grabs, as they say.  You will become a prisoner and serve the god that chooses you.  Your strength will lead the dark armies to overrun those that Tunare and her friends battle against us.  You will serve us.”<br><br>Belana hung her head down.  Her life had seemed so ordinary up until a couple months ago.  The sudden facts were swirling in her head so quickly that her judgment was crowded.  She rose her head and looked straight at the figure, “I will never serve you or either of those two gods.”<br><br>“You can say all you want rogue, but you will turn just like everyone else before you,” the figure soon melted away its exterior to take on a more natural form.  Inien’s face melted away revealing a dark elf exterior.  “But, it is not my job to kill you.  It is someone else’s.”  The figure motioned with his arm for someone to come.<br><br>Belana and Kelwin watched as another figure walked into the light of the torches.  The face was all to familiar to both of them.  The time for a final confrontation loomed overhead.<br><br>The figure spoke again, “This should be a battle worthy of my viewing.  I can’t wait to see what kind of strength you both shall portray for both of you will be in our armies soon enough.”<br><br>Belana looked into the eyes of her sister.  They were white and emotionless.  Her hair was matted and dirty, unlike how it was when she was still alive.  The white adoring face she once had was masked by a shade of gray.<br><br>“I will have life once more,” Darkpoint spoke.<br><br>Belana who had held her daggers loosely quickly gripped them.  She was still dressed in her street attire.  Her quickness could not fail her for one false step would send her to her own misery.<br><br>“And just so there will be no interference,” The figure shot a webbing at Kelwin that sent him to the ground.  He struggled as a white web surrounded his body entrapping him.<br><br>Belana shot a glance at Kelwin but quickly turned towards her sister’s rushing body.  Armed with a sword that was greater than her daggers, Darkpoint charged in.  It seemed the inevitable had reached Belana at last.<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/15/02 3:01:41 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>415</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Part VII - Beginning of The End</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 5/20/02 3:22:44 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> [ Back in Odun ]<br><br>Inien’s cabin was still smoldering from the past duel.  The pile of tomes still remained unmoved on top of him.  The wind howled through the great hole that Inien had created earlier.  Pages of mystic writings danced around the living room.  Each resting in random spots with each breeze that blasted through the room.<br><br>A sudden squeak echoed in the room.  Muffin flew into the room.  He had been hiding outside in fear.<br><br>Muffin flapped over his buried master, his injuries still showed in his hovering.  Muffin looked down at Inien’s hand.  It  remained unmoving.  Muffin reached down and pulled on Inien’s fingers to try and massage some life back into his master.  There was no response from his actions.  The little red demon began to paw at the tomes of lore stacked around him.  Slowly, he began to move them from the orbit of Inien’s hand.  Muffin panted.  The load was hard on him.  He quickly flapped over the next tome and began to push it off from the pile.  Muffin flapped over Inien’s hand and again tried to pull his master free of the books.  He squeaked hoping that his master would wake.<br><br>Then suddenly Muffin felt a great pressure grip his arm.  Muffin let go and quickly flew across the room as he could sense a surge of magic gathering beneath him.  The books exploded out.  Muffin turned his small head so not to get struck by and random pieces.  He turned back to see Inien standing tall.  Inien brushed off his cloak and looked around the room.  He surveyed the damage.<br><br>“It will take months to gather this lore again,” Inien reached down and picked up a few loose sheets of lore.  A rage filled him suddenly.  Muffin could sense his master’s anger.  He flapped backwards to avoid any scorn.<br><br>Inien looked over to Muffin and quickly discharged the rage from his mind, “Don’t be afraid little one.  I will not harm you.”<br><br>Muffin squeaked in acknowledgement.<br><br>“Yes, it seems that we have a lot of work ahead of Muffin.  But, we must run and help our friends from this impending danger,” Inien walked from outside the circle of books and stepped outside.  “Come on small one, we must go.”<br><br>Muffin followed his master outside.  He flapped over the wall and next to Inien’s leg.  He gripped it tightly, happy to see his master back on his feet.<br><br>Inien looked down at Muffin and smiled, “To Qeynos first.  We have a small affair to attend to quickly.”<br><br>[ In an underground cave ]<br><br>Cendarien looked out to see the sisters prepare to engage in battle.  He glanced over at Phelsuma who had fallen to the ground.  He ran to her side and bent low, “What is wrong?”<br><br>“I’m ashamed of what I have done.  I won’t be able to ever show my face.  The evil that I have perpetrated on others is unforgivable.  It will be hard to forget,” Phelsuma looked up at Cendarien.  She wiped away a stray tear.  Her long blonde hair lay matted in her face.<br><br>“Phelsuma, don’t worry.  You were not of your right mind.  How could you have ever known of what you did,” Cendarien reached down and grabbed her hands.  “It might be hard for you to forget.  But I guarantee that they will forgive you once the truth be known.”<br><br>Phelsuma looked up.  She sniffed quietly, “You think so?”<br><br>Cendarien smiled, “I know so.  Come on hun.  It is time to help our friends.”<br><br>Cendarien helped Phelsuma to her feet.  She pushed her hair back from her face and wiped the dried tears from her face.  Cendarien peered out once more to see what was going on once more.<br><br>Belana brought her dagger’s points towards the underside of her forearms.  She pointed the tips towards her elbows creating a barrier of metal to protect her flesh.<br><br>Darkpoint was on top of Belana and swung the sword vertically at Belana.  Belana quickly brought her hands up blocking the blow with her make shift gauntlets.  She jumped back from the blow and backed away.  Darkpoint followed again attacking first.  The sound of metal against metal echoed through the cavern.<br><br>“I can’t let this happen,” Cendarien stood up.  He ran out from beside the wall and towards his friends.  Phelsuma followed.<br><br>The dark figure looked on towards the ensuing battle between the demon and Belana.  He smiled.  The plan had been followed perfectly.  He had her in his reach.  Even if she managed to beat the demon, he would finish her off himself.<br><br>Cendarien was almost upon the dark figure before he turned around and saw him.  The figure raised his arms and quickly fired the same webbing that snared Kelwin.  Cendarien dodged the blast.  The figure quickly summoned forth another bolt but to no avail.  Cendarien hit the figure with his fist across the cheek sending him sprawling.  Phelsuma followed behind and turned towards Kelwin.  She began to work on his bindings.<br><br>“I’m going to free you then were all getting out of here,” Phelsuma said.<br><br>“You will get no argument from me,” Kelwin replied.<br><br>Belana flipped backwards avoiding the blade of her attacker.  She had yet struck out with any offense.  She glanced over at her friends.<br><br>Cendarien stood above the dark figure.  He reached down and grabbed him with both hands around the collar of the cloak he wore.  Cendarien let loose another strike with his fist sending the figure to the ground again.<br><br>Belana turned back to dodge the next blow from Darkpoint.  Frustration seemed to cross her face, she was becoming annoyed by Belana’s tactics.  Darkpoint stopped chasing the rogue and turned towards his master.  Cendarien again was picking up the figures body from the ground preparing for another strike.  Darkpoint sheathed his sword quickly and began to run towards Cendarien.<br><br>“Cendarien!” Belana shouted.<br><br>Cendarien turned away from his enemy to see Darkpoint charging towards him.  The sight of seeing Whitepoint’s body drawing nearer caused him to stutter in his movement.  The dark figured capitalized and swept Cendarien’s legs out from under him.  Cendarien hit the ground back first.  The figure jumped on top of him and landed a right cross on Cendarien’s face.  The figure rolled off Cendarien’s body and rose to his feet.  He wiped the blood away that had begun to pool from inside his mouth.<br><br>Kelwin noticed the figure bearing his sight on them, “Phelsuma!  Watch it.”<br><br>Phelsuma turned to look at the figure.  She hadn’t been able to free Kelwin yet from his bindings.  She stood up and began to cast a spell.  The figure looked down at Cendarien’s body.  He was beginning to regain his composure.  The figure grabbed his body with one hand and with a  great showing of strength held Cendarien’s body off the ground with one hand.  He then tossed it towards Phelsuma.  She quickly stopped chanting and braced herself to catch the flying wood elf.  Cendarien struck Phelsuma and they both went tumbling across the cavern floor.  Phelsuma struck the backside of her head against the hard rock of the cave knocking her unconscious.<br><br>Belana turned and ran towards her friends.  Darkpoint unsheathed her sword once more and gave chase to Belana.  Belana shot a glance back towards her adversaries and noticed Darkpoint closing in on her.  She drew her daggers back once more and jumped forward quickly.  She landed facing the other way and charged forward towards Darkpoint.  She thought in her head quickly, “Please forgive me sister.”  She struck out at Darkpoint with both her blades but Darkpoint parried the blow.  Belana fell back from the force of the attack.<br><br>Darkpoint turned towards Belana and struck down with his sword to fallen rogue.  Belana quickly rolled to her right avoiding the blow.  A flash of sparks shot from the ground as Darkpoint’s sword struck.  Belana flipped herself forward back to her feet.<br><br>The dark figure walked towards the three friends on the ground.  He looked down at the unconscious druid.  He moved his sight towards the ensnared ranger and shook his head.  Cendarien struggled to his feet once more.  The dark figure produced a small dagger from inside his cloak and approached the unsuspecting ranger.  Kelwin’s eyes noticed the weapon.<br><br>“Cendarien!” Kelwin yelled.<br><br>Belana turned her attention to the shout and noticed the figure drawing near to Cendarien.  Darkpoint turned to face her once more and brought his sword back up into an attack style.  Cendarien tried to shake off his dizziness.  The robed figure showed his intentions and brought his armed hand back for the final blow.<br><br>Belana brought her daggers up into a throwing position and threw them towards the dark figure.  The first whistled by the figures head and missed.  The second one found its mark on the figures vulnerable arm.  The blade sank deep.  Crying out, the figure dropped his weapon.  Cendarien realizing his predicament grabbed the falling dagger from the air.  He turned quickly with the blade jutting out from his hand and caught the figure in the midsection with dagger.  The figure let loose a howl.  Cendarien met the figures gaze.  His white eyes began to loose their color quickly.  His face began to contort into an array of different colors.  Cendarien let loose the blade and stood above the figure.  He clutched the dagger buried in his body and fell to the ground.  Life soon left his body causing only momentary spasms to echo through body.<br><br>Cendarien turned towards his wife.  A smile of satisfaction crossed his face as he gazed at her.  She answered him with the roguish smirk he had gotten so many times in their youth.  It revitalized his soul to see her like that once more.  It had been a dreary time for both of them.  Seeing her smile again made this all seem worth it.<br><br>Then Cendarien’s smile left.<br><br>Belana turned around and felt an uneasiness inside her.  An explosion of breath escaped from her body.  She lurched backward but did not fall.  Belana looked down to see Darkpoint’s sword running through her body.  She glanced up to see the cold eye’s of her sister.  They were dark.  Cold.  She blinked to somehow dispel this reality.  She tried to speak but a sputter was all she could muster.  A trail of her own blood bubbled up from her throat and leaked from the corner of her mouth.  Her head tilted as she felt her life force begin to leave her.  Darkpoint withdrew the sword from her body.  The troubling sound of steel on flesh radiated inside the cavern for all to hear.  Belana stood in front of her sister.  Her arms hung at her side as if someone had tied a great weight to them.  She took a step forward but her body could not support her.  Belana fell to her knees, and then to her side.<br><br>Cendarien ran forward.<br><br>Darkpoint looked down at the sword covered in the blood of Blackpoint.  A sudden eruption from inside Whitepoint's body caused her body to stiffen.  He let go of the sword as a warm feeling began to build inside.  Whitepoint’s body began to pulse with a bright light.  The outline of a figure began to permeate off of Whitepoint’s body.  It stepped away revealing the form of the rogue that Belana had killed months ago.  Whitepoint’s body fell to the ground.  Discarded by the demon at last.<br><br>The deed had been done.  The quest for resurrection had ended.  The dark rogue turned to the two sisters.  Their bodies both lying in front of each others.  His body began to fade away as it journeyed to find wherever his original body had been laid to rest.<br><br>Belana gazed forward as the body of her sister fell in front of her gaze.  Her face was no longer darkened or disfigured.  The golden white flesh tone returned.  Belana smiled.  She inhaled one last time and spoke, “I will see you soon.”  She outstretched her hand towards her sisters.  She gripped the soft fingertips and squeezed.  Belana felt a slight smile cross her face, but it soon faded away as her face grew placid.  Belana sighed.<br><br>Cendarien pulled her gaze away from her sisters.  He cradled her head towards his and saw the streak of blood that ran from her mouth.  Belana slowly exhaled as her body became heavy.  Cendarien looked down at her wound and realized that it was to late to save her.  He brought her head up to his shoulder and held her close burying his head into her hair as he felt the rush of death pass over her.<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/20/02 3:24:09 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>429</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend" align=absmiddle></a> Email This To a Friend </td><td align=right valign="top"></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#006400><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 width=20%><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newtopic.gif border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=4><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a>  </td><td bgcolor=#000000><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.threadControl?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a> Topic Commands (Moderator Only)  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to receive email notification of replies  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies </td><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 align=right><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=33.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=33.topic"> Next Topic >> </a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=95% border=0 cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"></td><td align="right" valign="top"><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm20">The Foyer<option value="ebonmoonfrm12">Recruitment - New Members<option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
