<br>
He stole from a Character named Thaor. He was told to return the things, He informed guild leadership that he had made things ok with Thaor. So a few days later when thaor says I still dont have my stuff, we are surprised. We demand he return the property and he returns what he still has. BTW this was an item transfer he was doing at the time...so he just straight up stole the @#%$ in the first place.<br>
<br>
Fastforward a little...we boot his ass from Battalion for the &quot;snafu&quot; with Thaor and his dishonesty with leadership. So within 24 hours he is doing a gear trade for a battalion member, as an alt Ninji...character asking for the item transfer wasnt aware of his nefarious past. The Item was Gauntlets of Fiery Might. He of course stole them. When the Battalion member asked why he had been stolen from, he replied with because you are in battalion and because it is a 10k item.<br>
<br>
Fastforward again: He Joins Orders of Sirens -- We jump their Guild Leader Xiolia about returning the gloves, hoping she will pressure him into returning them. She says she will talk to him, over the next week or so they are finally both on, I ask her about it and she tells me that Bjornn said he didnt steal them, but that he had borrowed them. He also told her that he had made arrangements with him and it was all even now. Something sounding familiar? Well of course the person who had lost the gloves had never gotten a response from Bjornn when he inquired about his property from the time they were stolen to present...<br>
<br>
<br>
Xiolia also informed me that she knew Bjornn for three years and was going to take his word over ours. Like we would waste our time smearing him after we already had brought his previous theft to light on this same message board. <br>
<br>
The facts are simple, He at least at one point Had Gauntlets of Fiery Might. They were not his, but he claimed he Borrowed them. He said he worked out a deal with the person he &quot;borrowed them from&quot;....So do a little math, the story isnt made up. He has admitted that they were someone elses property, and that he had them, and that he still had them and had made a deal for them...clearly out PoV is that he is blowing smoke up her ass. <br>
<br>
He hasnt changed he is still a piece of grabastic amphibian @#%$...if he is you buddy you can go to hell with him <p><img src=http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/63/2417563.GIF

A cleric of theirs was in my group in Seb, and looted Blood Ember arms while he was 'accidently' disbanded. He was already in the looting crouch when he did so, and started asking questions about the price of BE arms as soon as he rejoined.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, the very next day, one of the group members was doing some trades in EC and this cleric was auctioning the piece he ninja looted.  A friend logged a twink and started a conversation with this person about how rare this stuff was, and the cleric said agreed, and told him how he'd just gotten them from Seb yesterday! All of this was logged,for what it's worth, since logs are so easily manipulated. &lt;and no, it wasn't worth keeping a copy :P&gt;<br>
<br>
When approached by group members, he made up a story about selling the arms for a friend, but declined to name the friend...<br>
<br>
Didn't seem worth it to bother doing anything about it, beyond never grouping with the jackass again, but as a group, the consensus was to tell his guild leader.  Needless to say, nothing was done, and we were told that they would 'take his word for it', because he was a guild member.<br>
While I understand loyalty, you'd think that 5 other people and logs would sorta make you take it more seriously than 'us against him', but oh well.<br>
<br>
In the end, it was far more satisfying to see him sitting at the Seb zone in, trying to find a group that would take him, in spite of his reputation... &lt;not earned solely from this incident I found out...&gt;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
as for this cleric, does he have a name or do you just throw out a class with guild title saying he ninja'd? <br>
