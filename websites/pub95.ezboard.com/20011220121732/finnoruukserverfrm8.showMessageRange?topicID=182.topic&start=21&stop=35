Sometimes I remember that our charter spells out explicitly that we are obligated to help others.  Sometimes I think all the well-meaning elders, myself included, created the  - first beg, then demand, then expect that &quot;MY EPIC, etc. is a gods-given right&quot;, mentality that seems to run rampant in Norrath nowadays.  I really don't know.  Chicken or the egg first?  All I know is that not having a lot of folks ANYWHERE who could SOW or bind for the first 20 levels of Norrathian life, seems to make me appreciate ANY mana-costing kindness more.<br>
<br>
The FIRST person I SOW, heal, buff, etc. is the low person who comes to the zone where I am standing, torn and bleeding from a close fight, sits down, and doesn't ask a soul for anything.  The SECOND is the person who asks politely and doesn't demand.  An offer of a donation is fine, but I've never accepted pp for spending mana to help someone.  I am a Ridgerunner.  <br>
<br>
A call for help across many zones?  Well, there again, how is the request phrased?  What is my current situation, especially if I am in a group?  If I'm in a group of RR's, nine times out of ten, we all go. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If it's not a CR situation for the asker, then yes, I feel it's only fair they travel to me to receive what they've asked for.  Lizz, my constant partner, faces different circumstances.  She can rezz.  There again, our charter specifically says if helping isn't futile or won't cause you, or your group, to die needlessly, it's a duty.<br>
<br>
Lizz is a halfling cleric, I am a half-elf ranger.  Our biggest laughs come when both she and I are asked for ports.  Halfling = druid, apparently in spite of purple plate armor.  I get asked for ports because /who says I am a pathfinder.  Our favorite chuckle is when someone runs up to both of us and asks, &quot;Lizz, may I please get a SOW?&quot; I immediately SOW them, and they thank Lizz, sometimes offering her a donation. <br>
I think a Thank You is great, even if misplaced. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My worst nightmare was a rezz request in DL.  The person was back in G Fay.  He asked Lizz for a rezz.<br>
Nope, he had no idea where his corpse was.  Lizz was running to join me at KC from FV.  So, I camoed, SOWed, and began searching for the body.  I actually divided the DL zone into search quadrants in my mind, and proceeded to search.  Approximately 40 minutes later, I found the body, got consent, and dragged the corpse to Lizz outside Karnors.  Then, the dreaded &quot;What level cleric are you?&quot; came to Lizz.  Followed by the &quot;nm, I'll wait for a higher level rezz&quot;.  If I were not a Ridgerunner, that body would've been dragged immediately back to it's original resting place.  Loot,including &quot;epics&quot;, is meaningless to me, pp's are meaningless to me, levels are meaningless to me.  The precious treasure in Norrath, for me, is the quality of my time spent there.<br>
<br>
As long as Gregar has existed in Norrath, I've made a point of visiting any nearby newbie zone, and spending time there buffing, SOWing, healing, and answering questions.  And, yes, it's nice that a 52nd ranger heal DOES mean more than diddle-squat there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I've done that for two purposes.  One, to pass on the kindness of beta players, way back when, who did the same for me.  And two, to keep an eye out for the real newbies who are going to be future RR's.  Over the course of time, Demands have increased, Thank You has decreased dramatically.  Guess which ones I remember for the future?<br>

        I don't see any solution ever to this. All you can do is ignore the morons and help those whom you feel are truely in need. Maybe if the gnomes build a buffing vending machine.  <p><IMG SRC="http://www.sunautogroup.com/eq/graphics/nimshaname.jpg">

I'm heading to meet some friends to camp in Upper Guk, I was somewhere between L18 and 24 or so.  Troll Warrior in mostly Crafted, BBK and Langseax.  Not anon of course.  So this D00rf outside Guk asks me for SoW.  Sigh.  I tell him sure NP.  So I start my typical response when asked for buffs from my Warrior.  /em spell fizzles!  /em spell fizzles!  /em spell fizzles!  /say One sec, dang fizzles.  At this point, a Troll Bouncer walks by and kills him : P<br>
<br>
I also always love the buff requests I get when playing my Mage or Necro.  First thing I ask is, what kind of buffs do you want?  They tell me AC and HP.  I then tell them I don't have any of those buffs, later.<br>
<br>
I will typically stop when running my Ogre through Nek Forest and give them everything a L26 Shammie can.  I'm always willing if I'm not in the middle of a fight to SoW, Cure Disease, and maybe some buffing.  But as a Shammie I'm not going to burn my entire bar of mana+ to try to CH some L25 Ogre Warrior running around soloing.  <br>
<br>
But I also recall when my SK and Shammie were doing DW Crocs at L13.  SK would get agro, I'd chain heal until I ran OOM, then sit and med, and almost always had given him enough time to live long enough to finish the croc off.  But I'd generally burn everything I had, even Cannibalizing a little.  So here I am chain casting heals on my SK, and some guy asks for SoW.  I tell him I'm a little busy ATM.  He then proceeds to just be an A$$ and start harassing me.  People like that make me sometimes want to just not help anyone bah. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 636<br> <font color=#778899>(11/29/01 12:28:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buff Beggers: A new twist</span><hr size=1> Ugle -- what you said is so common -- that's why we're all tired of it.<br>

I know one druid who only SOWs if someone is able to make the request in-character.<br>
<br>
For a while, I was only buffing when someone was able to actually spell out all the words.  &quot;plz&quot; doesn't cut it.  I got lazy about that, but I'm tired of people who spend less time making the request than I'm going to make fulfilling it.<br>
<br>
I just love the lowbies who ask for clarity.  I actually have to waste a coveted place near the front of my spell book for this spell.  I'd MUCH rather put something else in that spot.  Ditto Swift Like the Wind.<br>

I ported this guy to gfay and he was going to pay me 40pp. We zone in and he disbands and takes off... bastard has SOW! So I follow him as best I could. After a few I look to see if he's still in the zone and hiding in Kelithin or something (not responding to /tells). He's not. Well, he didnt go into Felwithe so I head to Crushbone. sure enuf, there that little SOB is in the throne room. I hail him and he say's &quot;Oh, I only got 5 gold&quot;. So I take it, wipeout the throne room, Crush/Dvinn, loot it all and leave. <br>
<br>
How about this &quot;now porting to such and such at such and such for donations!&quot;. I get 3 tells &quot;can you run across the zone to me and port me for free? I'm poor&quot;. or &quot;I'll need a port in 20 minutes, can you wait?&quot; Or I wait for them to come and after a few I send the /tell &quot;still comming?&quot; responce- &quot;no, got another thx&quot;.<br>
<br>
Or &quot;my friend in Halas needs a port to NK&quot; and I'm sitting in NK.<br>

I got a /tell once when I was 29 and the guy says &quot;I need a port to WC&quot;. I say &quot;nek close enough?&quot;. He says &quot;no, I need to get to the EC tunnel&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm standing at the Chessboard in BB PL'ing a guildy and this guy demands a port to Gfay.<br>
<br>
I was dead in PoA and sitting at the gfay spires when this guy walks up and says &quot;port me to WC&quot;. I tell him &quot;no, sorry dead, waiting for a rez&quot;. He says &quot;it won't take long and you'll lose your mana anyway from the rez&quot;. I say &quot;nope, sorry&quot;. He says &quot;TL me&quot;. I still tell him &quot;no, no components, take the boat&quot;. He then sends me a /tell telling me what a selfish ass I am and how he hopes I dont get my stuff back. His name is Giliean, human.<br>

I was sitting in Kelethin one day, and someone asked me for a port to BB... I explained to him that it would be just as easy to walk there, and told him how to get there.  He was happy when he found out where the BB zone was in GFay.  <br>
<br>
You know, it's almost like a lot of people are relying on ports more and more instead of running the distance themselves.  I've moreless spoiled myself by making a druid for my first character, so it's a humbling experience to play my cleric and not have the luxuries for porting, sowing, invising, and such, and almost fun to run around instead of porting myself (no, I don't ask for ports on my alts because I know how much of a pain it is... and if I do, I ask my friends if they're not busy, or I hoof it, and that's what sow potions are for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *support your local shammy*)<br>
<br>
I also feel sorry for the necros, mages, and wizards (and sometimes monks wearing robes) who get asked for clarity, the rangers who get asked for ports, and people of races who typically tend to be certain classes more than the class they play.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, does anyone know if they've fixed the port/boat whatever the heck it is now to get between Antonica and Velious?  <br>

If I can afford to pay at least 50PP for a port and am going several zones away I'll auction for one.  If any guild Druids are FREE to port I'll ask if I can get one.  Otherwise I'll either camp where I am or start running, depending on where I'm bound.  Sometimes I wonder how any of us ever did anything without porters when they were few and far between : P  <br>

ok, actually on the topic of this thread now ) I am fairly non-twinked, and still have a CCS on my cleric. I get asked for clarity more than anything else. Must be the light blue.

I do /who. It's a lvl 10 warrior who was in EC. Gotta love alts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umarttog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marttog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#778899>(11/30/01 10:17:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buff Beggers: A new twist</span><hr size=1> I had at least 2 fun times with buff beggers.<br>
<br>
The day I got my Velious caster's leather tunic I was in GD with a group of guildies.   They had just commented that I looked like a druid, when someone ran up to the group:<br>
<br>
begger:  Hail Marrtog<br>
begger:  can u sow me plz?<br>
Me:       No, I can't<br>
begger:  plz, plz <br>
Me:       I'd really love to, but I can't<br>
begger:  Plz, I have a long way to run.  plz sow me<br>
<br>
By this time, the entire group was ROFL.   I explained that I'm a wizard and everyone in the group buffed him.<br>
<br>
Another time someone begged me for sow, I explained I can't sow because I'm a wizard.  So, they asked for clarity.  I figured arguing was pointless, so I cast &quot;See Invisible&quot; on them and they went happily on their way.   lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umizlil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mizlil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#778899>(12/1/01 1:41:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buff Beggers: A new twist</span><hr size=1> All starting characters should have 4 class choices - Druid, Cleric, Shaman, Enchanter.<br>
<br>
You cannot pick any other class until you have levelled your first character past 20.<br>
<br>
There should also be a highly trained team of monkeys with lists of new characters who constantly send tells &quot; SOW PLZ &quot;  &quot;Can I get buffs plz?&quot; &quot;Can I get TP plz?&quot; &quot;Clarity plz&quot; &quot;Can I get stat buffs and regen plz?&quot;.  Preferably from different zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=182.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=179.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=180.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=182.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=182.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=182.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=182.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
