<br>
That's the point.. men don't. If men have the right to pursue a life however they choose, why are there jails? Why are we bombing Afghanistan? Why is there alimony? Why do so many men work at Acme, Inc rather than painting abstract pictures all day? How come Mel Gibson is a famous, wealthy, popular movie actor and I'm not? How come Bill Gates owns the world, and you don't? Hey, I have the right to be a multi-millionaire too! That I have no talent for business, that I don't have the contacts, that I don't have the BS personality necessary shouldn't stop me from pursuing my desired life! And if I don't succeed, why, everyone else should pick up the slack for me!<br>
It doesn't matter that I'm a short, middle-aged guy... I want to pursue a career as a professional basketball player! It's BIGOTRY and INSECURITY on the part of the NBA that they laugh at me for even trying out. Hey, I've played basketball before, any number of times on my family's driveway with a hoop over the garage door, and in the school's gymnasium during recess. It's not faaaaair that the NBA won't sign me up. Let's pass a law requiring a certain number of short middle-aged white guys have to be allowed to play pro basketball. All because I have a right to pursue whatever life I wish.<br>
You have the right to pursue whatever life you wish.. with whatever you have to start with. <br>
And I've no hostility toward a woman who chooses a career; I do have hostility toward anybody who tries to have their cake and eat it, too, while other innocent bystanders are handed the bill. Like a female who pursues a career yet still squirts out children. Or takes welfare and squirts out children to increase her payments. Or gets a divorce because the &quot;spark&quot; isn't in the marriage anymore, or she just doesn't love him anymore, or this other guy over here is cute. And these last ones apply to a male, too.<br>
<br>
Actions and choices have consequences. Women and men accept responsibility for their actions and choices. Feminazis do not. I'm not dictating how females should act; I'm judging how some, probably most, modern people act.  You create a kid, the responsibility of caring for him exceeds any desire you have to lead whatever life you may have imagined. And your job for caring for that kid is different if you are a man or a woman. Otherwise, &quot;mother instinct&quot; is a myth and serves no useful purpose. And I haven't seen even the most ardent feminazi surrender it. Because the war isn't about equality, it's about power and perceived insults. and I've never heard anyone speak of the 'father instinct' which I have seen demonstrated.<br>
<br>
You devalue everything that makes a female human different from the male by saying they are the same; then the only remaining difference is sex; therefore, you *did* say that's all females are good for. Otherwise, let's all be homosexuals.<br>
<br>
If I have a problem with individuals, it's with millions of individuals who are so caught up in political correctness that they don't *dare* suggest that maybe there's more to the differences of the sexes than simply slot A and tab B. That maybe there's a reason for men and women to be *complimentary* rather than equal? <br>

If you are bothered by people telling jokes about people with holes in their throats (to borrow from another thread) then don't play EQ.<br>
If you are bothered by people intentionally training others, or stealing their kills, or using vulgar language over /ooc, don't petition, don't gripe... just don't play EQ.<br>
<br>
I watch very little TV, actually, aside from the news. It's no longer about entertainment so much as it's about indoctrination. You can predict, easily, the outcomes of programs based upon the characters and situation involved.  Talk about stereotyping! Good guys always think a certain way (usually politically correctly,) bad guys always think another (usually the old-fashioned ways..) A hero who thinks homosexuality is wrong? God forbid. A crooked liberal politician? Never! An honest conservative politician? What planet are you from? A fundamentalist Christian who is quiet and cares for others and doesn't know one end of a gun from the other? Are you kidding? A housewife who's clean and conscientious, creative, intelligent, loving and supportive of her husband? A career woman who's shallow, vain, self-centered, slovenly and incompetent? A husband who works his ass off at work to pay the bills, encourages his children, worries about his wife, never lifts a hand or his voice at any of them, never even thinks about sleeping around, yet isn't a latent homosexual or stereotypically emasculated profession such as preacher? Not on Lifetime, the network for feminazis.<br>
<br>
How bout a commercial that talks about the new sexy news anchor Paula Zahn, and ends with the sound of a needle being dragged across a record? Should Barbera Walters not watch TV because she mistook it for a zipper and considered the commercial offensive? <br>
What you're saying is &quot;shut up, I'm not bothered by it, and I don't care if you are, because you hold views which are heretical.&quot; <br>
<br>
I'm sure you're aware that advertisers lie. I would feel better if this were a matter of the advertiser lying about his product. He's not just lying about his product, he's telling a lie about modern life. He's promoting something bad (letting females get away with being bad moms but still looking like good ones.)<br>
<br>
Worse commercial than that: Toaster Strudels. Mom makes sure son has a pop tart every day. Kid gets a toaster strudel from his friend, has a locker full of pop tarts. <br>
Excuse me.. is mom this dumb? Do you really think mom *cares* whether junior has a toaster strudel or a pop tart? It's still *junk* compared to a slice of home made apple/cherry/pumpkin pie with a light flakey crust. Y'know, the kind of stuff moms used to learn to make before they had a right to pursue life just like the boys.<br>
<br>
Think we'll ever see a commercial with dad looking out the window with concern as the kid on the bus searches his lunch for a Lunchable? With dad reminding daughter to remember her pop tart? With a guy telling the gal his canned soup is better than her canned soup?  Nooo.. because in spite of the drive for 'equality', there are some steretypes that feminazis still wish to embrace. And the advertisers know it.<br>

replying to the many sundry jabs Aldrin has made aginst women-<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, so I don't expect modern females to be able to cook a tasty or even nutritious meal themselves, but cripes, go to a restaurant once in awhile!&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm a kick ass cook.<br>
<br>
&quot;The immature, foolish females wanted to play like the boys, and the boys didn't mind prostituting their wives for the added income to buy vacations and nifty toys.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those &quot;immature foolish females&quot; were answering a call to help their country at war.  <br>
Don't you demean that.  <br>
These women were patriots who answered the call and helped the factories of America continue to function while the men were at war.  They broke tradition- likely something hard to do back then and they did the job.  When it was over, some went back home and were happy.  Some came to the conclusion that for them there was more to life than staying home and keeping a man happy.<br>
<br>
We are not living in a time whn the men are in short supply due to a war, but I am good at the job I do.  I am a paramedic, and that is frequently considered &quot;men's work&quot;.  But lemme tell ya- if you are in a wreck and need help- I'm one you would want to help.  I am good at what I do, and I have not given that up even though I had a baby two years ago.  I also manage to not feed her lunchables thank you. Just because I'm a working mom, doesn't mean I'm so dim as to believe every stupid commercial that claims to make my life better, easier or faster.  <br>
<br>

No, they are simply lying about the value of their product. From what I see of the commercial the Kids wants the crappy lunch. The mom is giving the child what he wants. She is not making a statement about anything of the quality of said lunch. They are saying your kids will like you if you give them this. They are not making any statement about society other than &quot;Your Kid might be happy if you give him/her _______ for a lunch&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Obviously you are hunger staved for attention and if I continue trying to argue with you to feed this character flaw, I will be just as guilty as the mom in that commercial. I would be giving you what you want, and not what you need which is some therapy. <p><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Shimmerdark Wyndfyre</font><br><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Sorcerer of Innoruuk</font><br><A href="http://www.fnurt.net/amici/"><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Amici</font></a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49696"><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Profile</font></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ushimmerdark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shimmerdark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/30/02 3:50:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uraakamofthenexus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raakam of the Nexus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/30/02 3:55:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://skeet.provoked.net/misc/humor/forum%20stuff/deargod.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I agree with aldrin on alot of points and some i dont really agree with the way he said em but still pretty much agree. Alot of &quot;Equality&quot; is just bs and no im not a redneck i dont need sunscreen thanks tho lori! <br>
<br>
I think from the way it sounded in the begning of aldrins rant is that basically to be a Mother ya do the old traditional cook clean and the like and ya RAISE yer kid. Now if dad does that he can be mother to right? /shrug dont know dont care personally if you take care of yer kids properly then you can call yerself a King or queen for all i care as long as yer kids dont grow up to call love line and tell adam and dr.drew about How they were abused as children.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for all this feminazi stuff i stopped reading it lol i dont even like talkin to feminists they have an innate hatred of man and really only wanna see one thing<br>
<br>
WOMAN where MAN was considered to be In the middle ages.<br>
<br>
Never meet one that didnt secretly desire this and was willin to argue cause as much grief as they could. <br>
<br>
Any way cookin is a acquired skill that everyone should learn just so you can feed yerself. Being a Mother father is something everyone needs to do so we dont Leave this World To People like us LOL<br>
<br>
I probly can never have kids but if by some miracle i can you can be damn sure ill go outta my way to raise em right.<br>

<br>
I do agree with your distaste for the toaster streudel-marketing pigs of the world.  The way I see it, capitalism is screwing the world over, because corporations have overrun the individual.  Big companies have to baby-sit their bottom line so much that advertising has become a crucial part of doing business.  Hey, I too would spam everyone if I was CEO of a big company that marketed food widgits--there are bucking fillions of vegetative idiots out there who will buy whatever slop you want to produce if you market to them.  It makes good business sense, but it f-ing sucks.  I hate marketing so much it brings me physical pain to see a goddam fabric softener commercial, or to hear the monotone ravings of Joe $19.95 on every voice mail system of every massive telecommunications company in the U.S. (yeah all 2 of them...competition indeed!).  Anyway I'm raving so I'll stick with the stream of consciousness format....take Home Depot or McDonalds for example.  These hosebags have modified their employees' psyche to the point that they become simple drones in an ant hill.  Mindless automatons working diligently for the benefit of the Great Corporate Brain.  Their robotic commercials keep you slugging down the high-polymer toilet seats and super-sized fries while mesmerizing you with pictures of the fantastic Ward &amp; June Cleaver home you can build, or the ever-present allure of the Collect all 5 Happy Meal Toy.  Home Depot keeps up the supply chain of low-cost prefabricated particleboard furniture so well that the mom and pop hardware store goes out of business.  Grandpa can't afford to keep his own hardware store because the lumbering corporate giant can beat his price point through volume.  Grandma can't afford to stay home and bake flaky apple pies for Grandpa because she's too busy working overtime at a Medicaid-funded nursing home to pay down the No-Money-Down-No Payments-til-2002-Super-Orthopedic-Mechanical Bed that Dr. Quack recommended for her osteoporosis.   Meanwhile she's also paying off the &quot;free long distance&quot; cellular phone calls to her son Ward who is nearly bankrupt after taking a job as a systems analyst for that HotDomains.com company.  Ward is a great programmer, but the steering committee heads got tired of looking at him after he grabbed the last $2.39 Einstein's sundried tomato bagel during the last LCD projector PowWow Joint Application Design session and slugged that sumbiscuit down with his grande latte.  And Ward's performance has been slipping lately anyway. You see, Ward has been in and out of counseling for his chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and virility problems for some time now--partially due to the fact that his wife June left him for Fabio the personal fitness trainer who is much more sensitive and knows how to treat a woman.  Ward just doesn't understand why he can't just buck up and shake off the pain like Dr. ScrooYoo, Ph.D said in the Chicken Soup for the Laidoff DotCom Worker book that Ward's been reading.  His ex-wife June drops the kids off at KinderCare on her way to the tennis courts in between meeting with her divorce attorney to find out how to extort more alimony payments from Ward, who has been slipping lately.  She's also devising a scheme to get Ward to eat the bill for the Soloflex that she saw on QVC (oh my doesn't Christie Brinkley look hot after using that thing! Check out those abs!) and slapped on her 26.99% APR Visa card along with the lobster bisque, ragout of field greens, and Montrachet lunch that she and Fabio had during a scandalous little rendezvous at Aqua last week.  Ward just might end up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anyway, because he really wants to keep the 60&quot; high definition Sony television that he bought with his 401(k) loan last fall.  Ward's neighbor Bob talked him into that and a subscription to AT&amp;T Broadband for $49.95 a month.  Ward has a real weakness for 6 channels of CSPAN and the Hindu Variety Channel.  Hell he even said F it and got four channels of Showtime for $15 bucks extra, but dammit Showtime hasn't played a movie he's heard of in six months, except for that one fruity skin-flick that was subtitled in Italian (that chick did have some nice hooters), and the fifteen-times-a-day reruns of black &amp; white Charlie Chaplin flicks.  But he really does like the way the local access channels show those nice rainbow color bands for 24 hours each day....they really show off the liquid crystal resolution on the TV...and holy jumpin jesus!...he can set the VCR to record it while he surfs Monster.com for another Sr. Executive Administrative Engineer job at DotBomb.com!!  But Ward is feeling better now...he's given up Prozac and lithium for marijuana and is really starting to not give a damn about anything, although he thinks a lot about his sailboat that was repossessed last fall.  Oh and did I mention the phone bills?  Ward bought the Complete Choice Plan!!!  He's got Caller ID, 3-way calling, star-69, 1-900 call blocking, automatic call forwarding, anonymous call return, and anonymous call reject for only $44.95 a month!!!  Holy Sheeit Dogs with Pickle Relish!  For $4.50 extra he can keep the telemarketers from calling him during his Swanson's Fried Chicken Dinner with a side of Everquest for $9.89 a month. Ward thought that the phone thing was pretty outrageous, but the Bell Corporation sales representative Alexis couldn't seem to transfer him to the Loser Line where they just have basic telephone service for cheapskate schmucks who can't get women. (Alexis is a half-wit liberal arts student who gets free drinks at every bar she goes to, because she's cute, and guys like a girl who wears tight, black, bell-bottomed polyester pants and drives a Jaguar.  She also has a nice apartment in Haight Ashbury!) So Ward just gave up and figured he'd pay for the Complete Choice Plan, the inside wire line maintenance plan, the FCC communications tax, the state communications tax, the high-cost communications service charge, and the FukYouPacBell re-connection deposit off later when his stock in WebVan was fully vested.  Unbeknownst to him, Ward has been calling Alexis' roommate Lacey for a few days now...he bought her a couple cosmopolitans at the Bubble Lounge last week and things are really starting to look positive.  (He had to get a $150 cab back from Pittsburgh/Bay Point because he passed out drunk as a skunk and missed his stop on the very last $2.50 per trip Bay Area Rapid Transit train back to Walnut Creek.)  The real drag of it is that Lacey lives in 415, and Ward is in 510, so he pays a bit extra by the minute to talk catty with her.  And even worse is that Lacey is a transvestite with a bigger organ than him!!!!<br>
<br>
What does that monstrous ration of baloney have to do with the price of tea in China you ask???  Absolutely nothing.  The mere point I'm trying to make is that directed marketing and fluffy services that the world doesn't really need have made it impossible for the otherwise well-to-do, college-educated American family to survive without two incomes.  You can shrug it off as frivolous materialism all you want, but trust me...I never went out looking for the $19.95 special for anything.  Those bastards came looking for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You see, there's a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.  My raving examples are just a few...some of them are quite true and personal in nature, but most of it is exaggerated stuff I made up.  (I really did pass out on the BART train once,  heh.  damn that cab was expensive, and I really hate PacBell)  In spite of the exaggeration, it really doesn't even touch the tip of the iceberg.  In today's world you can get yourself into some very deep financial hell before you can snap your fingers.  The single male is really screwed.  If you don't meat (er...meet) your perfect June Cleaver in college, then you've gotta delve into some very scary gene pools to even have a decent statistical chance of meeting the mother of your children.  If she's been living in the same propaganda-blasted world as I (you) have, then chances are good she won't fit the Happy Housewife Mold that Aldrin is presenting.  It all costs a fortune, and if she wants to carry out the delusional American Dream with you, then she better get off her ass and get a job....cuz I'm not paying for her drinks forever.  Screw it.  Nintendo can raise my kids...I'm too busy trying to keep this sinking ship afloat. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17550">Laelia Jadebreaker</a><BR>

His viewpoint of what a &quot;mom&quot; should be is in a traditional sense (stays at home, cooks, cleans, etc).  His viewpoint of anything else would be a female &quot;parent&quot;.  That's his personal viewpoint, and as with anything else anyone posts on these boards is subject to criticism and debate.  But that's his opinion, and telling him you need to treat someone who drops their kids in daycare in order to take more ski-trips is as &quot;motherly&quot; as a stay at home mom isn't going to change his mind.  Anymore so then him telling you you aren't being a &quot;mother&quot; to your children if you &quot;raise&quot; them that way.  String him up for holding onto traditional values, shall we?  Some of his perceptions don't seem to be reflective of the current social environment.  But then again, just because &quot;Everyone's doing it&quot; and &quot;It's the norm&quot; doesn't necessarily mean it should just be blindly accepted.  I think not all of the changes Women have made in the last 30 years Aldrin have been all bad, but everyone is entitled to their opinion about how things &quot;should&quot; be.  <br>
<br>
And the Women's movement having a man-hating Lesbian talking about how oppressed and demeaned housewives are has not helped their cause much.  And OMG, how can you seriously take Hillary Clintons claims that women need to be empowered when you look at how much crap she puts up with from her philandering husband.  I don't know anyone whose husband has that much political power, but I do know that none of the women I know are so morally bankrupt and have such low self-esteem that they would let their spouse publicly treat their marriage (and them) as such a joke.  But yet she seems to be held up as an example of a strong woman.  The problems women have had with career discrimination and such needed a spokesperson (or several), and if a woman chooses to work outside the home, she should be compensated equally, and I know as a country we aren't quite there yet (getting much better though).  Unfortunately, if a woman would choose to be a housewife as a career, most &quot;feminazis&quot; scorn her.  It again gets back to people claiming to be tolerant, and then showing they are only tolerant when you believe the same things that they do.  If some of the more vocal women's rights groups were more respectful of a woman's right to stay at home and raise her children, Aldrin would have much less ammunition to use in his rant.<br>

None of you have a right to put down a single mom working her best to support her family. My mother worked her ass off to make sure me and my two sisters had food on the table and a place to live. She sacraficed everything for us including her own wellbeing to make sure we were taken care of and raised as best as possible under the sircumstances. <br>
<br>
I havnt had the worst childhood by any means, but i am &quot;damaged goods&quot;. My friends, this is a very @#%$ up world we live in and untill you have been a single mom trying to raise your children in a mans world then you have NO RIGHT to put down a single mother. I am not being sarcastic nor am i jokeing i am DEAD @#%$ SERIOUS!<br>

<br>
I am a woman.  I have multiple degrees and I work in a male-dominated field.  I get paid quite nicely.  I am very good at what I do.  I am very busy, very tired, often travel, and would be completely incapable of taking care of a child.  I also would not have a child and give it over to a Nanny either, as I feel this is not proper.<br>
<br>
But this is just *me*.  Many women are forced to work even though they have children, as my mother was.  My stepfather was handicapped, and worked, but we needed more money to pay the medical bills than he could earn on his own.  As a matter of fact, I began working at the age of 14 so I could help pay the bills and purchase my own clothes etc.  blah blah blah ..etc etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the point of my post:<br>
<br>
I have this philosophy of the &quot;roles&quot; of men and women in the home, and it is based upon LONG TERM human history, not based upon the state of affairs in the U.S in the 1950's.<br>
<br>
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most families functioned at a subsistence level.  This required maintaining a farm or hunting, making the clothes for the family, making the thread for the cloth, making mattresses, cleaning said mattresses, making pottery, making ALL food from scratch (including the flour and butter...).<br>
<br>
This was a FULL TIME endeavor for the entire family.  Everyone, even the children, worked from dawn til dusk.  The women typically worked in the house area, as the field work and hunting was hot and required physical strength.  However, there are many examples of where women performed this function too.  (Ruth in the Bible for you religious types, women of the South when all their men were in the Civil War or were killed in th War..etc).  The point of these women being around the house was NOT to coddle the children.<br>
<br>
Now, we have ready made ingredients for food (butter, milk, eggs, flour..all available at the store).  We buy most of our clothes because it is cheaper usually.  We have vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers...the list is endless. The conveniences of modern day greatly reduce the workload of running and maintaining a home.   Most housewives I know have entirely too much free time on their hands, even with children, and have to find things to do to take up their time.  This is especially true once the kids are in school.  Babies and pre-schoolers certainly deserve to have as much time with a family member (mother/father/grandparent) as possible, but school-age kids really won't notice that you aren't at home waiting for them while they are in class.<br>
<br>
<br>
My time is short, so I must be succinct.  I think that what life made necessity in the past for humans, was twisted by our semi-Puritanical culture to be considered the &quot;right and proper&quot; way.<br>
<br>
I think all people, male and female alike, crave challenge and intellectual stimulation, and that they have a right to pursue those interests.  If they choose to have a family, then it is their obligation to spend as much time as possible with those kids and to make sure they get all of the care they need.  However, this obligation certainly doesn't exclude either of the parents from being able to do other things as well.<br>
<br>
