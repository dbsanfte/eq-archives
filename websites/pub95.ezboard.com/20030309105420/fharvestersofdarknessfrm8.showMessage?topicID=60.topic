For days now he had been silently removing the possesions from the closet he claimed as his room.  Most of it had been either detroyed or sold, depending on its potential to either bring harm or profit.  Now, as the Heritec started at the polished, dustless stone floor, the single empty shelf, the chipped stone where his hammock used to hang, he felt a strange pang of regret.  It lasted for but a second.  Without a word, the Gnome closed the door, and opened a gate back to the Plane of Knowledge.  With resolute determination, he strode off towards the portal to the Plane of Tranquility, where <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>He</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was waiting.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Together they started off towards the realm of Disease, both slowly stripping off their possesions as they went.  By the time they arrived, they were both naked, save for the most basic of coverings, a line of armor, jewelry, and weapons laid out behind them.  Without a word, both entered the Realm from which they were spawned, and were never seen again.<br>

The stench of the rot was extreme and preverse, yet went unnoticed in this realm of decay.  For what seemed like hours, the thirteen chosen of Bertoxxulous had fought and waged in mortal combat.  Now, only the Gnome stood.  His body showed testament to the torment it endured.  His left eye was swollen shut, a red stain of blood smeared down his face and chest.  His right thumb and index finger were now just bloody stumps, the flesh probably already starting to rot in the stomach of one the others.  The left shoulder slumped at a grotesquely unnatural angle, having taken the brunt of a massive harmtouch.  A spiderwork of bluish red lines covered his entire body, the poison of his combatants still coursing though his viens.  As Flacon looked to those that had fallen, his thoughts went back to the Harvesters.  His Family.  It wasn't the training.  It wasn't even the blessing of his God.  It was the image and memories of those select few that brought him through this.  Flacon knew that to fail here today meant to never see them again.  That thought, combined with the Hate and Bond that he had learned as a Harvester brought him though the trials.  He was now a true Heritec in the eyes of Bertoxxulous.  He would be allowed to return and continue his spread of his God's word through the art of necromancy.  But none of this mattered to him as he proceded through the final part of the ritual.  His thoughts were focused purly on the Harvesters of Darkness.  His Family.  His home.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=464455">Flacon Vex</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, <br>
