I'm not exactly sure if you're talking to me or someone else.  If it's me, then you're really making stuff up now.  I was the only person from my guild in the planes all week.

<br>
Ugle,<br>
Since leaving anything to some peoples imagination allows them to think the worst, I guess I'll take a moment to set you strait.  Shissar is a seemingly random once a week spawn, so whatever you're talking about with the other camps that have ph's and spawn within every 30 minutes is pretty out there.  As for IF it had spawned, well, if no one was there (which was what I'd hope for) sure I would have got people there ASAP.  If, however there was a guild/force even if it was 10, hey, it's theirs, BUT this way I can find out when it died last and try to get some kind of idea on spawn rates.  There is also the possibility that the raiding force doesn't need it.  By being there I have the ability to ask them just this.  If they don't need it, then yeah, I get guildy's there again, and/or ask the raiding force if they can help me.  Sorry if such behaviour is beyond you, but that's what I'd do.  You can't make such claims, because you don't know, and that didn't happen.  So don't go trying to put my guild in a bad light, we have a great reputation, and I'm not going to damage that over something that I'll have another shot at again.<br>

Whether they are negative or positive is up to the viewer to decide, but yes, we had a couple rather long threads in which several people (including him) talked about being able to &quot;hold&quot; the Planes with less then 18 people.  It wasn't meant to be a harsh attack of Lhile, he was just one of the more vocal ones about that topic and I found it relevant to this one in an obscure way heh.  The only &quot;animosity&quot; I've had with him was on some topics on this board, and that stayed on the boards.  You on the other hand sound like you need a good spanking, I'm kinda booked this week, but might be able to squeeze you in next week.<br>
<br>
Tunzell, the part about knowing when it died would make sense except for the fact that you say the Shissar is a seemingly random once a week spawn.  If that's the case, then what good would it do for you to know the exact time it went down?  As I said, I don't have any animosity towards you or your Guild as a whole.  I'm not going to come out and say you are lying, I just know that many, many, people act much nicer on the boards then they did the hour ago IG when they pissed someone off and got flamed.  I posted a flame of a Guild that ran my old Guild over when we were camping BR's in CoM because they wanted their Epic MOB.  And this sounded like the perfect scenario for something like that to happen again.  Unfortunately, the only way to &quot;prove&quot; your character would have been if the Shissar spawned and the people there in force would have either been allowed to hunt without interruption or had actually taken it down, so all anyone can go by is assuming.  But based on the way a large number of people act in this game, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume what I did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ujaleddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaled Dar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/22/02 10:06:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  ---------------------------------------</span><hr size=1> Hands down, the best post I've read all year.<br>

First off, I said seemingly, because I don't know the facts, if I spend enough time there, maybe I'll know for sure.  So, that in mind, wouldn't it make sense for me to monitor it to find out?  Since PoF is such a wierd type of zone I don't think there's been very many people in all of EQ that have been able to actually sit there and wait on the thing.  I'd like to be sure and improve my odds as best as possible.<br>
<br>
Second, it is totally unreasonable for you to make such assumptions.  You don't know me, or my guild, and it's always the bad ones that people here about.  Just because you got 'run over' by some other guild on your epic doesn't mean that everyone in the game is a bunch of Zerg rushing, KS'ing pricks.<br>
<br>
Sounds like you've just got some kind of jaded outlook on people in general though, so I guess there's not much I can do to help you.  Oh well, hope people start to prove you wrong soon, although I think you've got to let them do it.  There is sort of a saying that I think is quite relevant to you.  Can't say I remember it perfectly, but it's something like, 'if I run into 3 A-holes before lunch, maybe it's not everyone else.'  Nothing personal, I have to use it on myself sometimes.  It's easy to see the negative in everything at times, so it's better for me to just walk away and do something else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ublackard2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blackard2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/22/02 1:57:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Well, you're wrong.</span><hr size=1> Tunz!!!<br>

Does Order of the Charred Heart follow the Summit?  If the answer is no, then there's no need to read the rest of this post.<br>
<br>
If the answer is yes, then the way I would interpret Summit rules is that DoW either &quot;owns the zone&quot; or &quot;gets the zone&quot; depending on the section you are reading.  In either case, if they didn't want you up there and for some reason felt that you were being disruptive, by the way I interpret the Summit rules, they had every right to ask you to leave.  So you are either saying that you personally do not respect your Guild leader enough to follow the rules that he agreed to, or you are saying that your Guild leader is not standing behind the commitment he made.  That's not a criticism just to be antagonistic, that's the facts from what I see posted here.<br>
<br>
If you think I am jaded because of things that happened in the past to me, maybe it's because I see someone blatantly flaunting the rules that I am assuming your Guild leadership agreed to.  It makes me a bitter person to point this out?<br>
<br>
If you know any of my history on these boards or in-game, you know I never had any love lost for the way DoW acted.  But that doesn't mean that if someone KS'ed them or trained them or interfered with their shot at FiF in the Planes that I wouldn't be critical of the people causing the problems.  Sorry, no matter how obnoxious Fatty is, wrong is wrong.  Just because it might not have happened to a nicer bunch of people (sarcasm on), doesn't mean that it was the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
I wonder, what if it was Amici, or Ridgerunners that had a complaint, accusing you of training them because you never /q'ed out?  Fatty tends to just pi ss people off, but that doesn't mean it's fair to apply the rules differently to any Guild he's associated with then to one that he isn't.  But, if your Guild doesn't acknowledge the Summit then my words wouldn't mean @#%$ to you anyways, and therefore I don't think you and I would ever agree on this topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/22/02 4:34:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Well, you're wrong.</span><hr size=1> Ugle -- DoW wasn't THERE in force at the time the complaints happened.  I think you have to successfully have actually broken in to remotely be considered having sufficient force.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, he couldn't possibly be interferring with them, as he was FD on the north wall, no where near the west wall camp they were trying to break.<br>
<br>
Next, how the heck was he supposed to leave?  Last I saw, monks can't gate.  The mobs were up in the temple, so he wouldn't be able to run through.  And you couldn't expect him to run to the west wall to get a TL, because that really WOULD end up training them while they were breaking in.<br>

DoW was trying to break into Fear.  Y/N?<br>

If they had sufficient people to break in and hold the Planes, according to Summit Rules, they could ask this person to leave.  Y/N?<br>
<br>
If the answer is N/N/N, then DoW should just STFU.<br>
If the answer is Y/Y/Y, then they have every right to bitch and blame the Monk who should not have been there if I understand the Summit rules posted on the main page.  I've seen weird stuff happen in the Planes or even just normal zones when someone is there &quot;just watching&quot;.  All the Monk would have to do is have agro still, and be between the people breaking in and the MOB's.  Then when he stands up, the stuff will stop on the way to him to go after the people trying to break in.  And I still think if this was Amici or Ridgerunners, while perhaps they would have worked this out nicely, if they couldn't have they'd get a lot more sympathy with their posts.  I tend to believe that rules apply to jerks and sweethearts equally.  I'd post the same way if this was TD, or Dragonguard.  Or have we just all decided that gentlemens agreements to accepted behavior on our server doesn't apply if the people we screw aren't gentlemen?<br>
<br>
And Raven, it's closet, not closest fudge-packer, unless you happen to be sitting on his lap, in which case he would be the closest closet fudge-packer, but in RL Kaurik has probably come out of the closet, so it's still not a valid statement.<br>
<br>
Or did you mean to say Kaurik was THE closest fudge-packer? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udevissongweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devis Songweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/22/02 7:59:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tsmitheqpics.homestead.com/files/BMFF1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Kaurik is a closet fudge-packer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Tunzell's monk didnt train DoW in fear , you got that part right , he trained Vigil while they were making one of their less pathetic attempts at breaking in.  hell we actually thought they were going to make it.  that's why Meslow zoned in to loot his corpse.  he trained Meslow after his FD failed and the scareling that were on him had him down to about 40% hp.  we were never &quot;broken&quot; in the plane , so if you were FD on north wall the entire time how do i know you're using a fungi?  you could argue that &quot;all monks wear fungis~!&quot; which is a valid argument because -most- probably do by now , but yeah whatever.  point is Meslow died with you targeted with a funny little &quot;/gu @#%$ %t training my ass after i looted my corpse. I mean WTF kind of sorry @#%$ are these people?&quot;<br>
<br>
haha Meslow my little child prodigy~!  FU Meslow , sorry  =(<br>
<br>
and Kutee you fuqtard , compared to the previous &quot;hi i have no life&quot; hours i played before i technically -don't- play anymore.  oh and i've not once claimed to be the more mature person.  i'm like a 3 year old in a 20 year old's body , smaller @#%$ though of course.  people that know me know i dont lie 99% of the time.  of course we've all had sex with 14 more women than we really have , which accounts for that other 1% , but this goes back to me being immature , which is another argument for another time.<br>
<br>
FACTS:<br>
1.  we got trained 3 times so no PoF for us , oh well<br>
2.  i'm immature , again , oh well<br>
3.  Wolfypaw is a retard for disagreeing with me and because of FACT #2 i hope you get drug through the streets by an angry 90 year old man in protest of the 5 cent tax raise on cigarettes.<br>
4.  Kutee is just @#%$ stupid because the shemale thinks i care that i'm immature<br>
5.  i hate you Ugle but you're fair about most stuff so i guess props to you for that , even though half the time you just plain annoy me i can see your point.  and as a side note , your guild wasnt killing the Lord spawn we needed in CoM nor did you know how to get to the BRs to spawn him and even if you did spawn him you would have died because you couldnt have killed him.  old , moot(sp?) point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT!!  i just thought it should be pointed out that we arent the ones that started this @#%$ , it was stupid @#%$ monk in question that did. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kaurik>Kaurik</A> at: 1/22/02 9:43:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/22/02 9:26:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> Actually we had several Shaman Epics in the Guild already at that point, and had already gotten at least one Torch drop for the Mage Epic from up top, so I think we had an idea or two of how to do it heh.

Besides I had to bring that up to remind everyone that if I saw you drunk, passed out, and choking on your vomit I would remove both of your shoes and socks, stick both socks in that hole you call a mouth and watch you choke on your own bile.

I heard your name is now Zendareth and you even put him in another Guild just to throw people off.  So remember, Kaurik is now Zendareth, so DON'T group with him, just send him rude tells and laugh at him.  Kaurik is also playing Kywolfe (an SK), and Tunzell.  So remember, be on the lookout for these three characters and give fatty a tell and let him know how much you love him.<br>
