is evil</span><hr size=1> Brogun, part of my post was about the fact that people mourned someone they knew from a news clipping.  As I said, when I found out someone that I only knew from EQ passed away, I felt sorrow and loss.  I felt Sowl's post about his friend that he would miss in this game was very touching.  But Sowl had interacted with this person, and I agree with you Brogun, that you don't have to have personal, physical contact with someone to become attached to them.  I didn't see any posts from someone who knew her casually OR intimately.  If one of those conditions applied then for me to comment on that persons feelings was at a minimum in extremely poor taste, and I apologize.  But from what I saw, it was people who read the news clipping, found out that she played EQ, and somehow felt that now thier lives were changed.  My post was about those who would not have known she had died, or the circumstances of her life without seeing that newspaper clipping.  Perhaps their lives did change, but it boggles my mind that a news clipping of one person could do that, especially when you can find a similar story in any major newspaper pretty much any day of the week.  It might not always be above the fold as they say, but it's in there.  Brogun, which post in that original thread should I look at to see someone who knew this person, I'd be just fine with you showing me so that you can prove your point?<br>
<br>
As far as the military, I'm too complacent now to take the cut in pay and the workload.  Kinda struck me as odd though, those fellow Infantry soldiers I knew who had gone to combat didn't feel any joy in killing someone else, I can't say any of them described enjoying it as you had.  I'm not sure what your point was about learning about evil by joining the armed forces.  As an NCO on active duty and in positions up to PSG in my Guard Unit, I always found that the military did not allow the kind of evil that I am talking about.  Yes, up to a certain extent I guess I can understand, you are in an area with automatic weapons and the ability to leave a place with no witnesses.  But then again, you have a more likely chance of someone finding out what you had done there then you would have if you waxed a few Wino's in a major city.  If I were to go back I'd probably get my stripes back and go SF personally.  Most of the people I saw who had a few years in one of the Batts end up barely able to walk from all of the abuse they put on their bodies.<br>
<br>
And for all of you bleeding hearts asking me what I have done for me to criticize you.  I'm not coming in here talking about how much I care for my fellow man.  As I've said before, I really don't care about those who are not part of my life.  So my inactions would back up my words more then most people's actions in this matter would back them up.  That doesn't mean as I'm sure most of you assume that I am a rude person to those I meet.  But it means I won't lose any sleep because someone I've never met will die in a car crash tonight.  Show me someone who has been damaged physically or emotionally, and I become a basket case.  Show me a newspaper clipping and I'll use it to start a fire with.  I don't *think* I don't have any compassion, I just don't have enough energy to show compassion for every single person that I can read about in print.  Frankly, you could spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week reading obituaries and newspaper articles about the cruelty inflicted by man.  I'd prefer to do something more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Now back to my favorite punching bag.  I agree, I have no problem throwing stones, and I have no problem picking up the ones thrown at me and throwing them back.  My feelings aren't hurt by your words, yet you act like mine hurt yours.  Respect the deceased.  May I ask why?  None of the other posters in here showed any respect for her Father.  Does he deserve any?  Not that I can see.  But yet I need to show him respect?  For all we know (and I'm only using this as an example), this girl for her part molested other children, set fires, stole cars, committed assaults, etc.  That's the problem with a news story, people jump on certain aspects without knowing the whole truth.  That's a big part of why I can't respect the deceased without knowing them in some way.  And why I can say I don't feel loss when they are gone.  How many people are going to see the men in Black Hawk down as heroes, and get attached to one of the main characters, whose real life model is in jail still I believe for crimes involving children?  Yet how many people who will see that movie will know that?<br>
<br>
Holding people accountable for what they don't do?  Someone posted about stopping some scumbag from @#%$ a girl.  So if I stood by and watched, maybe took some pictures and a few notes that would be ok by you?  Brogun talked about protecting some innocents from someone in a blood lust.  If he had stood by that would be ok by you?  Do you get it now or do I need to draw a picture?  Inaction in some cases is the same as condoning or participating in someone else's actions.  If you hear your neighbor beating his wife or child, and you do nothing, then you are allowing him to do that, and yes, in my book that only makes you marginally better then him.  If you see a person at work who is obviously depressed, do you at least say &quot;Hey, how's it going&quot;?  For every Shintou who cries out for attention, there's probably at least another hundred people who could have a great day if someone just sat and talked with them for five minutes.  It's those people who will just sit and pass by that person day in and day out, until one day that person isn't there anymore that I blast for what they don't do.  At least I'll call them on their inactions when they try to tell me how compassionate and what a great person they are.<br>
<br>
Somehow life sucks for me because I don't feel personal pain for every wrong done by one human to another.  As I've pointed out many times Lal, you don't either.  You claim to feel pain when you read about someone you don't know.  Yet you feel no pain for that person until it's brought to your attention.  So then is it a fair comparison for a Christian to say that Jesus didn't love someone until he met them?  Tell me how you feel about the two children that died in my city last night because of some jerk-off drunk driver.<br>
<br>
Pal, I have to laugh about one of your comments.  You talk about school teacher playing this game.  I remember one of my good jousts with DoW members in the past.  It was a post from someone talking about how I shouldn't make fun of their guild because it had good people in it like himself, as a school teacher.  Of course, his post was absolutely filled with typos, poor grammer, in all honesty my 11 year old would have gotten an &quot;F&quot; on any report she turned in looking that bad.  Detectives playing this game eh?  Sorry, known too many cops for that to make me think that just being a Police Officer makes them a good person.  That's like saying I need to respect Jack Kevorkian since he's a doctor, or saying that I need to respect Charles Manson because he's a religious leader. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11>Innoruuk - OOC</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
