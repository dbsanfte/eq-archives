Smiling at the warmth she walked out of the water to a rock that lay in the sunlight. Stretching out and relaxing in the rays from the first sun, Jessica let her thoughts wander to Qneil to schooling. Her town was located to the eastern forests of Kelbic, a small island offshore from the mainland of Gilderfield. On the mainland though were the other races of the world, they were overrun by goblins and there was a threat of them soon coming over shores to their small island. The others of her people were the Illyanians, very diverse in skin tone and hair they did have the same ears and build. All their ears were slightly pointed some more than others, and the build of females were slender and more modest than the males who had strong bodies to better suit their work. The females of her race were the ones that kept the records and the ancient arts alive, they were the leaders of ceremonies and rituals. The system of leadership was based off of two leaders, one male and one woman. That way the male could run the security and defense of the nation and the woman can run the needs of the people and the economic system. Better adapted to her role in her town as a spirit guide, Jessica did not mind that she could never be a part of the army, those things should be left to the stronger anyways. Jessica was thinking very hard on her first ritual and whether or not her grandmother would help to start her journey into womanhood. She let out a soft sigh and started to doze off. These matters would be dealt with when they happened.<br>
<br>
Nikoli was frantic now; he could hear the shadows shouting for blood and the flesh of the innocent. Nearly going mad with his effort to get to the girl, Nikoli would have to soon turn his mind to finding other ways of helping the young spirit dancer. He had heard the shadows whisper; she had the smell of smoke and spices mingling in her hair, the sign of her profession. She was young and had not yet traveled the spirit ways, but soon. Nik could feel the power rising at the smell of her body and the shadow’s need for pain and blood. Almost there, he thought, almost there, but just as he leapt over a fallen tree a branch caught his foot and he fell to the ground. “No! Shadows you can’t have her in my forest!”  Standing again he took a stance and struck his right fist into the air at a slight angle. “To the Eastern Winds, come to my aid with your fire!” slicing the air with and open hand he bent his elbow and pointed his hand at the ground. “To the Winds to the South, loan me your calm.” Bringing both hands together and striking his open hand with his fist he stopped again. “To the Brother wind to the West, grant me your charm.” Turning his hands upward he looked to the sky. “And last! Father of the North! Speak to me of your wisdom and teach me of your knowledge.” With that he thrust his hands out in front of himself and a blue light emitted from them to pierce the dark places between the trees and fill the woods.<br>
<br>
Shocked at the feeling of being watched Jessica stood up and felt a breeze flow around her body and linger for a moment. Nervous she started to move from the rock to her clothes and leave when a black figure moved from behind a tree. More moved out from their hiding places and she could feel the hate coming from the beings. Letting a small cry come from her mouth she started to move but hands from the breeze pressed against her body stopping her from moving. Screaming now she fought against them, but they won out and brought her to the ground. Stretching her out on the dirt one of the black creatures strode forward and pulled a dagger. “You are the child of blood.” He said and bent down to slice a small cut above her breast. The cut bleed and the thing stood up once more. Tears of fear and confusion fell from her face. “You are the child of hate.” Another said as he bend down licked the blood from her and kissed her. Feeling embarrassed and now angry Jessica shouted at them to let her go. “You are the child of our master.” Yet another said as he bent down with a small brand and Jessica gasped at what he was about to do. With a snap of his fingers the brand turned red hot and he pressed it on top of the cut above her breast. She shouted with pain as the blood from the burn trickled down her side and the wound closed. Crying and gulping for air through the pain, Jessica watched the last dark man stand forward. Throwing back his hood she saw a pale face with hallow eyes. Screaming from fear she finally knew what was haunting her here. The Darkness. The Shadow was here for her. <br>
<br>
Closing her eyes in hopes of finding safety there, she heard the being cry out in pain. Her eyes flew open to see what had happened and she saw a blue light struck through the dark man. “NO!” he shouted. With a blink the man sank back into the shadows leaving only three still there staring at the young girl. The other three started to move towards her when she cried out again and felt the end close. She had been marked for the afterworld and given powers to use after her death as a slave to the masters of shadow. She closed her eyes again and instead of darkness she saw trees and someone running through the trees. She looked down and saw a sword in the hands of the runner and a bow bouncing on the shoulder. Opening her eyes again she saw the dark face, right next to hers, lick the blood from the wound, and hands start to caress her body. She felt it more than saw the blade slice through the head of the first dark man and shouts from the two left as they retreated into the woods. The breeze let go of her ankles and wrists and she lay there sobbing. Feeling a hand on her cheek she opened her eyes to find those of Qneil staring at hers. “You will be ok.” He said and she felt him cover her with her tunic and pick her up. She passed out while he carried her to a tent he had set up before he heard her scream. All would be ok she thought over and over again.<br>
