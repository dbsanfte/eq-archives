But on one condition,&quot; Sagorn agrees.<br>
  &quot;Name it.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Afterwards, I get a years worth of gold, enough to buy a Yodenbury for everyday,&quot; Sagorn demands. <br>
  &quot;Done. Now, I can only send someone else to this place, I am not powerful enough as of yet to do it for myself..which is why I need you. you are the best of the best, and none on this planet, save for myself, can stop you. Not any wizard, or warrior, or druid. None,&quot; Ordaino says, his hand movements complimenting his words. <br>
  &quot;Send me to where?&quot; Sagorn raises an eyebrow, puts his hands on his hips confidently. <br>
  &quot;Why, the Chrea's homeland of course, You are now an assassin. You are being sent to kill the Chrean King, King Thulahd. So what you saw in your vision will not happen. He is readying his army now for the invasion. None on this planet can stop him, save me and you. And, as I said,  cannot send myself to a place so far away,&quot; the wizard informed him. <br>
  &quot;How far away is it, exactly?&quot; the monk questions. <br>
  &quot;Eleven billion Ten-leets. Being that one ten-leet is ten light years, it is quite a ways away,&quot; the wizard smirks evilly, &quot;and you have already agreed to go, my friend.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Then send me, for Yurk's sake!&quot; <br>
<br>
  Ordaino Yougan reaches his hands in Sagorn's direction. He begins to chant, &quot;Lootha Yifyu Koolhe. Lootha Yifyu Kifhay!&quot; His voice bounces off the walls in beams of light, surrounding Sagorn in a goldish haze. Ordaino lifts his hands, screams &quot;Arguthe Jilite SHAGOU!&quot; The light turns red, compresses in on Sagorn. The monk stands there, completely calm, breathing deeply and slowly. The light covers his body, forming exactly to his body, and pulsates. Then Ordaino snaps his wrist, snaps his fingers, and claps his hand. Sagorn disappears in a bright flash followed by pitch black darkness. Everything returns to normal. <br>
  &quot;I hope he gets the job done. It will be the hardest thing he has ever done.&quot;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
  Sagorn finds himself laying on his back. He gets up slowly, brushes himself off, and looks around. There's a metal block to his right and left, a vine-like structure combining the two, and his eyes widen as he sees three green aliens walking across the vine. A hate rises up in him, consumes him, and he begins to climb the metal blocks. He begins to notice small nicks and cuts in the block that he didn't see before, making it easier to climb up. He reaches the top, just in front of the three green aliens. They stop immediately, look at each other quizzically and hiss profoundly. Sagorn stands there looking at them, his fists clenched. <br>
  They take off at a dead sprint, moving faster than any human on his own planet. But he wasn't on his planet at the time. The one in the middle reaches him first, obviously the fastest, and leaps at him, thinking him easy prey. Sagorn side-steps, throws his fist up form his side and hits the alien where the stomach should be. The alien screams in a high, shrill voice as he drops to the ground and roll over onto its feet, holding his stomach. Sagorn looks back the other way, the other two creatures just behind the first one. The one on the left lunges for his feet, the one on the right jumps at his face. <br>
  Sagorn jumps high enough to jump over the one going for his feet, and jabs his right fist out to meet the other in the air. The alien's head snapped back as Sagorn's fist hit it between it's black eyes, his feet and legs still going forward. Sagorn grabs it's feet, spinning around with it, landing on his feet, thrusts the alien to his left and down, hitting the other alien that went for his feet in the back of the head, as he is standing up, with the forehead of the one he is holding, knocking them both to the ground. <br>
  The first one stands back up, walks over to Sagorn, a little more warily now, and jabs at him with it's right hand. Sagorn grabs the alien's hand in his fist and uses it's momentum to keep pulling it to him, lunging his head forward and hitting the alien's already squashed-looking nose with his forehead. The alien screams again, holding his nose with his one hand. Sagorn throws the alien's arm back to it's side and kicks the alien in the stomach. The alien staggers back, the back of his knees hitting the railing of the vine-like structure. It falls over the side, screaming until it hits the bottom, a loud splat, and the alien leaves a big green spot on the ground. <br>
  One of the remaining two aliens jumps on his back, wrapping what they would call legs around his waist. Sagorn backs up, rightly guessing that the other one was right behind it. Sagorn tries to pry the alien's legs off of him, the muscles holding like iron. The other alien grabs Sagorn's foot and pulls him down. He grunts as his butt hits the ground, the alien rolls off of his back. Sagorn starts to turn around but the second alien is ready. <br>
  It grabs his chin, thrusting his head to the ground, then gets over him, straddling his waist. It gets closer, bending down to put it's face right over Sagorn's face. It's tongue slides out of its mouth slowly, slides up the side of Sagorn's cheek. Sagorn jerks his head the other way, trying to get away from the alien's tongue. The other alien goes down to his feet, grabs his feet before he can do anything, and holds them firmly to the ground. Sagorn's face straining as he tries to push the aliens off of him.<br>
  Finally feeling the alien on his feet let loose a little, he kicks his right foot out to the side. The alien jerks in surprise, letting go of both of his legs. Sagorn brings his legs up and around, wrapping them around the alien's head. Pushes down forcefully, squashing the alien's head on the ground, killing it. <br>
  The alien over him punches him in the face, hard, and then in the side, even harder. Sagorn rolls back a little, throws his legs upagain, wrappng around this alen's head and pushing his legs back. The alien flies away as the strength of Sagorn's leg throws him back. Sagorn stands up, the alien standing up right along with him. <br>
  He stands looking at the alien, the alien looking at him. The alien takes off at him, his mouth in a snarl, a growl leaving it's throat. It's hands grow metal claws at it comes closer. Sagorn winces at the sight of them, the alien smiles as best it can.<br>
