The woman is guilty of at LEAST manslaughter, and 2nd degree murder isn't too far off the mark.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I agree. Depending on the specific evidence I can see a very good case made for 2nd degree murder.<br>
<br>
I hope they apply this standard to anyone who trains dogs to be violent where the dog attacks someone.<br>

This was not a case of the animals attacking a person for the first second or third time, but under sworn deposition from other apartment dwellers there were at least 7 other attempted attacks by these &quot;Trained guard dogs&quot;.<br>
 <br>
 I put the Trained in parenthesis because it is highly doubtfull that they were trained to be guard dogs. One of the first things you train a guard dog is a release command which is drilled into them constantly. If that was the case both the wife and husband certainly would have known that command and she could have used it. Perhaps I am misremembering something but were the dogs on a leash?, if yes she could have pulled back hard enough to give the victim time to get into her apartment, if not then the owners of the animals are responsible for the actions of their dogs.  We want people to be responsible for their actions but at times are unwilling to take the necessary steps to enforce that ideal, but not this time. As a parent if I hand my kid a pair of knives then instill into that child an agressive nature, take the kid out into the<br>
public and she attacks someone then I am just as responsible for what occurs as she is. <br>
<br>
 If not such a harsh sentence then what would be more appropriate? remember the sentence recieved by the victim was death for the crime of being in the hallway while those dogs were out.<br>

<br>
First, I doubt the woman could have done much to slow the dog down - especially if she were caught by surprise - as it headed down the hall to attack.  So I don't think she could have just hauled on the leash to slow the dog down so the victim could get into her apartment.<br>
<br>
As for trained guard dogs -- don't imply PROPERLY in that phrase.  You can improperly train the dog.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not convinced the woman did a THING to get her dogs off the victim.  Furthermore, I am QUITE surprised that the dog would drag her owner down the hall to attack unless somehow provoked or encouraged.  That just seems strange.<br>
<br>
Scenarios where a dog will go out of it's way to attack a person:<br>
<br>
1. A history of some sort -- like if the dog had been maced in the past<br>
<br>
2. Another animal to attack<br>
<br>
3. Told to attack<br>
<br>
4. Extremely territorial<br>
<br>
My dogs are warning-level territorial on anyone they see -- like if someone is walking in the street.  However, they are not threatening-territorial until someone gets to the front step.<br>
<br>
While building the house I currently live in, I had to live for 4 months in an apartment.  I just had the female at that point.  But she was NEVER threatening-territorial to anyone in the hallways.  (Although she's also a LOT less territorial than the male is.)<br>
<br>
It's possible the dog considered the hallway part of his territory, and the victim was trespassing.  However, to attack like that is an EXTREME reaction, and even with a territorial dog, it just doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
We're missing some important detail, or it's not being driven home somewhere.  Even dogs who lunge at other people bide their time and only do it when you get really close.  Without some extreme provocation, it's VERY strange that the dog would actually drag his owner down the hall to initiate an attack.<br>

If you are raising killer dogs...then the idea that they may kill someone shouldnt come as a shocker. You should be willing to sacrifice life and limb to save the person the dog is after. People need to learn how to care for their animals properly. <br>

From what I heard, the inmates who actually owned these dogs wanted them trained to be viscious.  They said they didn't want wussy dogs.   With the ties the dog's &quot;trainers&quot; had to jail-house white supremicists, I have a suspicion that the dog may very well have been if not encouraged, not dissuaded from attacking a ghey woman.

That is exactly why I was saying people should never try to break up a dog fight with their bodies. Those people got torn up and they weren't even the objects of aggression. Obviously if a dog is attacking a person you should take much bigger physical risks to get them off.<br>

What this really translates out to is these dogs were trained to be pit fighters, so agression and not necessarily control was very high on their training regimine.<br>
 Lets not forget that the owners of those animals were not your average citizen, someone you would feel comfortable inviting over for tea and crumpets, they adopted a violent felon, had other violent felons who operated this dog ring as friends, raised and had trained by their friends these two &quot;loveable&quot; animals (her words on one of the dogs, I guess because it was only involved in 12 instead of all 30 previous agression incidents). <br>
<br>
 Is it surprising that the animals attacked and seriously injured someone?, not really. What is surprising is that the landlord and local animal control did nothing before this incident after so many complaints.<br>

ps. for those not aware, Pelican Bay is perhaps one of the most notorious penal facilities in the continental U.S. where they place individuals who were consistantly violent in other correctional facilities. <br>

I can personally tell you that it IS possible to get into a fight between two dogs and break them up...it might cause you some physical harm, but it is possible. I for one, have gotten between a fight between our two 100lb male dobermans and managed to break them up several times without injuries, only once was I injured, unless your dog is trained to attack, chances are as soon as they figure out you are in the fight, they are going to stop, most dogs love their owners too much to hurt them. In the case where I was injured, the male that bit through my hand (yes, his canines went completely through my hand and I had blood all over the place) was so upset by it that for the next YEAR afterward, everytime I came near him, he would shy away or act like a puppy around me, that was his way of letting me know he was sorry for pretty much crushing my hand. In this case, all the fights between these two dogs were because we failed to have both of them neutered, it was all male dominance fighting. Once we got them neutered, the fights completely stopped.<br>
<br>
Do I regret getting in the way of the two dogs h3ll no, they are great dogs and would do anything to protect my family. Dogs generally don't go out and intentionally try to hurt people. My family has even had a dog that was trained to be aggressive, it only took a few months, but we deprogrammed him and he lived among me as a small child and among other animals with no problem. IMHO, 75% of a dogs actions are the owners fault.<br>
