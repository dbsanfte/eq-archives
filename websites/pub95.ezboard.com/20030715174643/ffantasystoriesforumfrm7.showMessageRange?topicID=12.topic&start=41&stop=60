After I have seen to your accomadations, I'll have to find some place for my own practice and training, I think a paladin's hall would do nicely.&quot; Amy pulled closer to him and wrapped an arm around his waist. Nudging her slightly he threw his arm over her small shouders and kissed the top of her head. &quot;It will be different this time. I promise. But remember you can't trust everyone. These new people we've met are not our friends. We do not know them.&quot; Nodding slightly Amy gave a sigh. &quot;We will see.&quot;<br>

Healing and magic are the work of your kind, I have no taste in it and fear such a demise, but trust me I swear on my blades, steel vs magic, I could cleave you in half before you think to harm me or mine.&quot; Looking at the bard's reaction to the comment, Yavi pulled the blade up from his scabbard to check it was clear and let it slam back down. &quot;I mean no harm here I wish only to be let alone and not have to draw my blade against those following that of life. But I have heard of the corruption and expulsion of that which you people do not understand, and if you do not understand and raise harm even out of fear, I will truely give you something to fear, I have a power that is greater than that which you have ever seen. It is called vengence, and I will not hesitate to use my wraith on any of you even though I seem to have helped you, you are not my friends you have not proven yourself to me. The only one close is the bard and that is because he decided to fight when he could have ran. But without hesitation he would stand no ground with me.&quot; Looking at the faces of everyone, Yavi hoped he had gotten his point across, no one was going to hurt Amy again and he would die for that one charge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/02 4:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> haha ahaha A bird hahaha wait... whoops</span><hr size=1> &quot;Bren, you do kinda get carried away...

But believeing he could do a much better job of protecting that cleric, his judgment was also impaired. &quot;Right, well there you go. They are going to be perfect people. And if they aren't I'm sure that our guards could handle them with little ease. Although I'm certain that Amy, being such a nice girl, wouldn't want any trouble at all.&quot; Looking at the shy look on her face Paren smiled reassuringly. &quot;It's ok, while our moods are flying towards violence, we're all sensable people, me being the most of them all. I'd be happy to take you around the city sometime and show you some of the sights. I even know of a spot that you could see the stars from in the forest, would be nice to help a sister elf find her way. I know how hard it is without the stars to light your heart.&quot; Smiling still, Paren looked around to his friends. &quot;See was that so hard? All you need is a friendly word every now and then and everything will be just fine. And Yavi, I'm sure that you understand that no matter how sharp that sword of yours is it could not cut magic.

Forna was so lost, that's what happens when you get a mystery note from your father calling you away from your friends. She sighed, but no one caught on, because Bren was talking to Yavi. As Bren's words laced their way to her ears, inside she smiled. Quellious, her deity, her life support. Peace and Tranquility. It was what fueled her sanity, her life. <br>
<br>
As Forna followed the conversation, she grew even more lost. How could Bren think Yavi or even the furry one would harm any one? Her crystal blue eyes, watched him as he spoke. She yearned to talk with him, to confide in him, but now was nor the time nor the place. Maybe he would fill her in on this whole mess, then she could fill him in on the shattered mess of thoughts in her own mind. Outside she may have looked together, but inside... she was at war. <br>
<br>
Forna's sleek blonde hair whipped gently about, as a small breeze began to wind its way through the trees. The cool rush felt like water running over her skin, but the small bit of clarity she was feeling was smashed as Yavi began to speak. Could they not just move on! By Quellious, she wished peace upon them! She was all about the suggestion to eat earlier. Batwing Crunchies sounded so good right then...<br>
<br>
As Yavi rambled on about power, inside anger furrowed, 'I'll show you power,' she thought. It was one thing she hated. Boasting. Too bad she had nothing against the guy, 'til he started to boast. Could he not just open up to the gang! We were all so fun-loving, caring, and we were serious when need be. <br>
<br>
Forna's mouth opened to speak, but Paren jumped in. He, like her, wished this conversation to continue naught the way it was headed. She smiled as his words rang in her ears, they were beautiful...<br>
<br>
When Paren's little schpeel came to a close, she smiled at Bren, then looked back to Paren, &quot;Now, Paren, Hun, if you could only make your lyrics make that much sense!&quot; Smiling she looked to the group as a whole, &quot;What's said is done, shall we move on? I just came back from absence and I'm greeted by a petty spat. I don't know you at all, but I say we all make our way to town! We could hit the Tavren, have a round or two? Then, maybe even grab a bite to eat, yes?&quot; Her tummy rumbled at the thought. She chuckled, &quot;My stomach agrees, and we can all mingle while we're there, we can learn about furry there, Yavi and Amy? Hmmm? Whatcha say?&quot; Forna's eyes looked around, then right to Bren, they looked right into his, and she hope she got her message of distress across. She really wanted to talk, but she wanted to talk alone, with him.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/17/02 4:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha ahaha A bird hahaha wait... whoops</span><hr size=1> &quot;Forna have I told you that i love ya today yet? haha I also agree with that, guys we've just been done with a fight, and I'm starving starving starving!!! Let's go.&quot; Paren shot a glance over to Hoku who was silent this whole time, she had something on her mind and Paren was uncertain just what it was, maybe he'd get it out of her later, he'd have to sing a special song for truth. Thinking about that again, he decided that a song would be a bad idea seeing how she always took his songs the wrong way. So instead he gave his smile to Forna. &quot;Well Amy, you can come if you want, and Yavi I'm sure that if you're not fighting you're not happy, life of a true warrior, but you can come as well.&quot; Smiling at his comments, Paren looked around was there no smiles in this cursed forest either. &quot;Frankly Bren, I loved the sky so much better, fighting where you couldsee the sun and the moon and stars gave me such a feeling of lightheartedness, and I miss that, now we seem only to bicker and sqwabble. So let's plan on finding some sun soon, my tan, which usually is golden all year long is beginning to fade.&quot; Paren smiled again as he looked around. Everyone seemed to be as heavyhearted as he could take. &quot;Ok plan B, we go and eat, and then I think some of us need a nap.&quot; this time not able to hold back Paren laughed at his own little joke. &quot;Jezz people, I was only joking.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dahnyella>Dahnyella</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/17/02 5:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ha!</span><hr size=1> Forna chuckled at Paren, he was such a sweet heart.

Then beamed a smile at Bren, then at Hoku, trying to win a smile on her own face. She looked to Amy and Yavi, &quot;It's very nice to meet you by the way. I do hope you'll join us once we hit town, for a night out? Yeah?&quot; Forna was bouncing she wanted to get out of the woods for as change, she had been travelling with her father for far to long. Grabbing Bren by the hand she yanked him along with her, &quot;Come on, I could eat a horse, and I bet from all the mana you just used you could eat too.&quot; Glancing over her shoulder, she hoped the other's followed suit.<br>

But....he seems sincere enough.  Mayhap he be one who seeks peace in alterior routes?  Grudgingly, Brenan came to the realization that he had passed judgement on the man too quickly.  Perhaps his threats were not idle, but, maybe they were.  Unknowing if the warrior did indeed follow him, Brenan voiced an appology.  &quot;Maybe I spoke too soon for you warrior.  I do apologize.&quot;  To himself, he spoke a prayer for the wayward warrior.  I pray that you can find comfort, and shed this suit of metal that you wear as a second skin.

With mountains in the northern reach<br>
A band of travelers on their way<br>
On a quest, road hard for each<br>
It comes down to one which has to pay.<br>
<br>
While they fight, one will heal.<br>
Lightning will find each down their own trail<br>
And one with steel will prevail<br>
The one of song will bring bring down hail.<br>
<br>
Once the city of glory is reached<br>
A healer's song will be the end<br>
The blade will fail and heart will be breached<br>
A lone force it must defend.<br>
<br>
But now my friends the tale is heard<br>
It will not end here and you will send<br>
A song on the wind, one with a bird<br>
The song is done, but this is not the end.<br>
<br>
Looking up, Paren did not know what the words meant, he hardly did when he searched for a song in his skill. They came to him like cows to feed. Hoping that he had given them all a reminder that he truely could sing, Paren sighed and looked up to see a spot of the midday sky.  <br>

He wondered if there was a bit of selo's mixed into the rythem. He smiled as Amy held on to his arm in the relaxed pace. The light at first didn't even make him think twice, he smiled though at the thought, sun light in this forest was a nice thing. Noting that everyone else had kept moving, but the bard had stopped. Yavi turned around. He looked as the bard stood in the sunlight stareing straight upwards at the sky. His arms were outstretched and the smile on his face said everything. Yavi felt Amy at his side cling closer and give him a hig. &quot;It's beautiful.&quot; she whispered to him. Yavi's smile grew, &quot;If you want to I'm sure he wouldn't mind you joining. I know how much the sky means to your people.&quot; Almost laughing at the smile that almost reached her finely pointed ears, Yavi let her go.<br>
<br>
Running almost to the bard who was softly humming the tune that all elves knew to sing to the sun. Stopping before him Amy timidly looked up at his face. The bard was taller than most elves, which is what gave his hybred lineage away. &quot;Do you mind if I join you?&quot; She asked softly not wanting to break his reverence. Without a word Paren's smile grew and he slightly nodded. Looking up to the sky, Amy slowly stepped into the light. The warmth! that was the first thing she felt, her smile only grew as her arms spread. Her and the bard begun the dance and the two twirled and embraced each other as brother and sister of the sky. <br>
<br>
Yavi smiled as well seeing Amy in such bliss was something that nearly brought a tear to his eye. It had been months since she were this happy. He nearly broke his stoic resolve when she began to sing the words to the bard's tune. In elvish, Yavi could not understand, but a few things. At first when he had seen Amy sing to the sky before, he had been somewhat upset that he couldn't understand it. He had asked why she couldn't sing it in common so he could hear it too, but she had laughed and told him it was a prayer and what he could not understand really did not have words in the common tongue. Realizing that it was horribly rude to ask for a translation to a sacred prayer, Yavi had apologized right away. Looking at the two, he nearly felt as if he was no longer needed. *Maybe I'm not* he thought, maybe the blade wasn't as good as a guard anymore.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/18/02 4:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> wow dude nice</span><hr size=1> not careing where he was or who this was next to him, Paren was too absorbed in the moment. The song was perfect and the sunlight was not abridged by any clouds. This moment was perfect. He hadn't cared if the other's had kept going, infact he hoped they would. He didn't think that they would understand. After all Bren was euridite, and none of the others had even a small bit of elvish, atleast he was fairly sure. Again he smiled, but then his thoughts began to return to him. This was not the spot of the hole in the forest... maybe a tree had fallen, but wouldn't he see the stump or even the tree? Confused, but not even careing anymore, Paren kept his tune and spun the small elf girl in his arms. <br>
<br>
After the song had ended and the day's song to the sun was finished, Paren looked up at the sky. &quot;I wish I could stand in this light forever, but Amy, you look hungry.&quot; The smile on her face told him everything. &quot;Ok, let's go.&quot; he said helping her up.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/18/02 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okies here we go</span><hr size=1> ( sorry i was down for like 5 days im gonna make it up! and i love you all!)<br>

She grasped tightly on his arm as the bard played softly on his flute the jig of vigor. It appeared to Yavi the only thing keeping the two young ones on their feet. Glancing up ahead, he could not see the others. Paren had told them that they had probably just gone ahead to the city. He knew that Forna would want to eat more than any of them, and Bren needed some sleep. Yavi nodded and so simply followed the bard. There seemed to be things in the darkness following them, but the bard noted that they should pay them no attention. Paren had explained to Yavi and Amy that those were skeleton heritics that roamed and scouted, but hardly ever attacked unless attacked first. Yavi tried hard to keep his hand from the hilt of his blade. Growing wrapped up in his thoughts, Yavi let go of Amy's hand but kept walking. His eyes glazed over and his attention that was always alert grew sluggish. Soon he had found he was completely lost and did not know where he was. He looked to find Amy but found no one, not even the noise of the two walking. Panic coursed through him as he tried to remember just how long ago he had lost sight of them. His hand went for the hilt of his sword when swords from the blackness leveled on him. &quot;Drop your sword.&quot; came the demand. Peering into the darkness Yavi saw sets of red glowing eyes shine at him.<br>
<br>
Amy was now attached to Paren's arm. He told her he knew where they were going even though the forest was growing darker, if that was even possible. Feeling so comfortable with the bard, she did not even notice Yavi's absence. With her arm hooked with Paren's and her head resting on his shoulder, the two walked in companionable silence. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you!&quot; Yavi shouted. &quot;Where are you taking me!&quot; Kicking at the skeleton, he was smacked hard with the butt of a spear. &quot;Shut up fleshie. If you do not be quiet I will feed you to the hole!&quot; Yavi did not know what that meant and rubbed his jaw where he had been struck. &quot;Is that where I think it is!&quot; Feeling instantly foolish Yavi had wished he did not make such an aggressive impression on the cleric and his friends. &quot;I want you to know, that you will feel my steel before I die.&quot; The skeleton smiled, &quot;Not likely. If you could reanimate my flesh maybe, but you are no magician.&quot; Spitting at the bones walking, Yavi wished that Amy had found a good guardian in Paren, as they reached gates of Paineel.<br>
<br>
Reaching the gates of the city, Paren smiled at Amy. &quot;And we're here.&quot; Wrapping an arm around her shoulders pulling her closer, &quot;Now lets get you something to eat.&quot; Amy smiled and nodded. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/02 8:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okies here we go</span><hr size=1> ( I will play two people! the Kerran and rill's brother)<br>

The place started to buzz with requests of the bard. He had nearly forgotten that he was practicly a celebrity in this city. &quot;I am not taking requests at the moment, Off duty. But in time I will break out my lute and we will have a round on me.&quot; Smiling at the laughter that rang in the bar. He hoped that this would lighten their moods. Taking Amy to a seat, Paren sat at the table his friends had sat in near the back of the room. &quot;Well fella's looks as if we take a rest and then are on our way to the warrens. It will take some trickary on our part to get past paineel. But I'm game. Just as soon as I get some sleep.&quot; he said still hmming softly the jig for himself. Dancing in the sun had given him most of his energy back, but he still needed some sleep, as well as the rest of his ribs to be fixed. Thinking that once he had seen Amy to the cleric's keep he could take a few minutes himself to get that mended and then off to sleep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bellonakali>Bellona Kali</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://auction.2y.net/user/kanachan/jsk2.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 669<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/22/02 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/kanachan/XMas_1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okies here we go</span><hr size=1> ~*(fill me in on what's going on!!)*~ <p><br>

Looking around his room, Paren felt his sore ribs. Oh Erillosi, why would you do this to your faithful servent. Had he not only hoped to bring happiness to all.... Stretching out on his bed, he recaped over the day. His battle with the kobolds, those horrid monsters, the cleric... he had safely seen her to her guild and checked her in. His friends, still at the bar most likely... Hoku... was she mad at him? he did not know. He would ask tomorrow, but now he needed sleep. Dozing off his last thoughts were of her.<br>
