Funny... one of the characteristics I attribute to liberals (and yes, that's called stereotyping) is considering the value of something other than in cash.  Yet time and again I hear liberal ideologies defended in terms of capitalistic values. The story of the poor little rich boy with servants and chauffeurs aplenty is a cliche. Having money doesn't make for a better life (unless of course you're a shallow person.) <br>
<br>
But what the hell... again, it's like trying to argue with a Roman Imperialist why the Republic was better and why the barbarians are going to be scrabbling among the ruins someday. Instead, I'll just feel *incredibly* lucky and complimented that I grew up in a household with clean clothes, nutritious and tasty meals, that 3 of the 4 children went to college (the 4th didn't want to,) never knowing we were poor blue collar until I was 19... all on one income. Thanks for the compliment.<br>
<br>
If two incomes are required to make ends meet, blame the feminazis. Females wanted in the workforce. Hooray... the economy adjusted. It wasn't that people were starving until females started working outside their homes. The immature, foolish females wanted to play like the boys, and the boys didn't mind prostituting their wives for the added income to buy vacations and nifty toys. Only the economy adjusted and they became trapped.<br>

Just because people have a set place in society doesn't make it automaticaly bad. Yes, it's &quot;sexist&quot; but honestly if you do it right, parenthood should be a full time job. Yes, the father COULD do it, but usually wives take a break from their jobs to have the baby and end up just staying home with them full time. Don't automaticaly assume it must be evil if it's sexist, it worked for years and years and years, and from what I've seen of the 60's-present they were much better off.

I always thought that the most important job a person could ever have was to be a parent.  My Cousin's Wife decided to home school her child and be a stay at home Mom instead of working.  They weren't extremely well off even with both incomes.  Things might be tighter monetarily, but they won't go back to a two income family based on how much happier they all are.  But you know, if you didn't take that trip to California or Mexico this year, and got another couple years out of that car, you might not need both incomes.  While maybe not to the same extent as Aldrins posts, I do agree that if you're going to have a child, it's in the Child's best interest if one of you stays home with it, not that you can buy it the most stuff.<br>
<br>
You just have to look at statistics and see how children in the ideal &quot;Nuclear&quot; Family (at-home Mom and a Dad that lives with them) fare statistically speaking versus a Latch-key kid in a single parent family.  I know that's an ideal situation and I know it can't be helped sometimes (for instance my Mom was Widowed when I was 12).  But it usually boils down to which is more important to me: raising my own child, always being there for him and helping him grow up, or having more money so I can have more toys.  <br>
<br>
And yes, some latch-key kids in a single parent home in the bad part of town grow up to be prominent people, and some kids in the &quot;perfect&quot; situation become sociopaths, but statistically speaking you're putting the child at a disadvantage in life by letting someone else raise him.  Besides, do you really understand how much garbage the kids learn at school?  &quot;New&quot; math like &quot;If the DOE was going to hire 1000 teachers next year, but because of those evil Republicans who want to pollute our water and kill the elderly now we can only hire 500 teachers, how many teachers just lost their job?&quot;.  Of course the real answer is that NO teachers lost their jobs, but those people will argue all day long that 500 people actually did.  And we should leave our children in the hands of people like that? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umortiana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mortiana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/28/02 11:22:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I agree</span><hr size=1> Hey Aldrin, did you mommy read you bedtime stories too and scare the boogey man out from under your roadster bed? <p><img src = "http://www.csudh.edu/class/pics/ladydeath2.jpg" border="0"> <b>Mortiana Delamort.

I know that you folks are talking about statistics when you say that you need to raise kids with one parent at home and one working.  But I just wanted to add that my parents both worked while my brother and I were growing up, my dad was sometimes working 2-3 jobs even.  But I think we both grew up pretty well, the difference I think is our parents talked to us, all the time.  They didn't hold back either, we learned about drugs, sex, religion and politics from our parents first.  They started young and informed us about life issues, and also taught us responsibility.  I think that is a key thing that is missing.  <br>
<br>
What makes the &quot;both parents working&quot; life bad, is that on top of the parents both working, they don't spend quality time with their kids.  Our parents gave us a lot of freedom, but we had responsibilities to keep in order to get that freedom.  One very important thing is explanation in a kids life I think, and that is what helped us to grow up to be productive.  We were lucky enough to never have to hear things like &quot;you can't do that because I said so.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Moral of the story, talk to your kids and spend time with them, when you go on vacations be sure to bring them along.  And inform them about life, but don't make decissions for them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Bumbaz Tanx <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45646">Profile</a> <br> Dakin Drayklore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46166">Profile</a> <br>Saore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46017">Profile</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udakindrayklore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dakin Drayklore</A> at: 1/29/02 9:25:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uskorziks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skorziks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/29/02 11:53:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ooc: &quot;Lunchables&quot; aren't food</span><hr size=1> I got a pack of cigarettes and 2 nippers of cutty sark scotch in my lunchbox.

Wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong. Feminazi != woman. A woman is a special subset of female. A feminazi is an idiot following an idiot's philosophy.<br>
Women are neither evil, wrong, nor ruining the country. Feminazis are. Some wonderful women (I gave examples earlier) are quite independent in their thinking.<br>
But because your unconcously held beliefs in the way the world should be (ie, the way it is is just fine,) you lash out attempting to fit me to a stereotype that exists in your mind (and was put there by popular culture.)<br>
YES they were trying to sell a product. And if they say &quot;pig dung is yummy&quot; they are LIARS and should be boycotted. If they suggest you are a good person for giving someone you are supposed to love and who is dependent upon your oversight pig dung instead of nutritious, tasty meals, they are LIARS. As my posts here demonstrate, people don't like to have their views challenged. So if Ad Agency wishes to sell their product, they're going to try selling it in a fashion which reinforces people's views. So yes, the ad reflects the mindset of much of the viewing public.<br>

Lovely stereotype; males are addicted to sex and become (insert perceived problem here) if they are not given sex frequently enough. Well guess what? Some of us aren't addicted to Vah Shir. @#%$'s @#%$, even on a cow. <br>
If all a female has to offer is between her legs, she's not much of a human being. And if a male allows himself to be domesticated with regular bouts between the sheets, he's not much of a human being, either.<br>

Oh, and btw.. I get all I want, thanks for caring.<br>

There's really no right/wrong answer.  I guess it just depends on the kid.  I know some who turned out to be just nasty kids when they had a parent stay home with them.  And of course, vice versa.<br>

No @#%$? Glad you cleared that up for us. We never would have known that without your supreme guidance.<br>
<br>
I think women, just like men, have the right to pursue a life however they choose. If they would like to work, they can. If they would like to stay home with the kids, they can. You(in your narrow minded, egotistical, disturbed Rush Limbah way)dictating how females should act is to put it lightly wrong. For some reason you have an axe to grind with &quot;A&quot; women or a group of women that hurt you. Because as far as I know you are not a expert on half the population and what they think. There are radical people in every Sex, Class, Race, Creed, Country, religion, outhouse, backyard, garbage dump and sewer in the world. Harping on a few radical women as being the downfall of world or the US is narrow minded and short sighted. It seems to be the only issue you bring up when you post your rants or at least a very common theme.<br>
<br>
As to the &quot;Someone not getting any&quot; reference. I did not say that that is all women are good for. I was simply trying to get at the root of your obvious tension with women and your need to blame the worlds problem on a sex rather than individuals. It's a lot harder to attack a single person rather than a anonymous group of people, &quot;THEM&quot;.<br>
