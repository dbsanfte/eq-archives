&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *****<br>
<br>
Everything had sprouted from nothing. Emptiness was filled with only more emptiness, where the only things that stirred in the lifeless void of space were thousands of stars, the two suns, and the two moons. The suns danced like tiny candles in an endless abyss of shadow, being ever vigilant, like two golden eyes accompanied by two silver sentries, watching over the nullity that was destined to become the world of Rumolien.<br>
<br>
Countless time slipped away, draining slower than an ocean being siphoned through a hollowed-out stalk of bamboo. Soon a cosmic drift was scattered into the solar system, spraying silvery comets over the blackened canvas of infinite nightfall and twilight. The falling stars heralded the arrival of the being known only as the First Sire, who was seeking a gift for his wife, the First Matron. His face was as bright and beaming as a sun, with a warm grin bent like an overturned rainbow rising up to meet the puffy orbs of his golden cheeks. A curtain of shimmering light was all that he had for a body; an undulating cloak which seemed to entirely circle around him, waving out in a thin sheet of prismatic colors like Aurora Borealis.  <br>
<br>
His wife, like all wives, was very difficult to please with the ordinary sorts of gifts. A necklace of stars would never do, nor would a bracelet of nebulae rings. No, their marriage called for something greater, something special. The First Sire rested atop one of the suns for a very long time, ruminating what he was to do. Millions of degrees of heat simmered past his gentle sea blue eyes, which held more lucidity in their watery gaze than the stars that glittered around them.<br>
<br>
At last, the First Sire arrived at his decision.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *****<br>
<br>
Through blankets of rolling white clouds, beneath the thick, sapphire blue atmosphere of Rumolien, rested the lush, green island of Falax’mertenya. It was a known fact that it was only one island floating in the sky amongst many others, though they were distant, oftentimes not visible for dozens of moon days. Sometimes the islands flying above slashed their circular shadows over Falax’mertenya as they passed by; great spouts of water rained down from them in some instances, where the oceans must have been seeping through small knotholes at the edges of the land. <br>
<br>
No one––as far as history had recorded––had ever crossed over from one island to the next, since the hovering land masses were spaced far apart and seldom came into near contact with one another. The one known similarity that the islands all had in common was the fact that they revolved around the World Spire, which was a massive golden pillar that could always be seen stretching off into the distant sky. It vanished through the clouds, with foundations that could only be rooted somewhere far below. The structure was shaped like a unicorn’s horn, curling and winding around itself in a weave of silver and gold. The coils were so wide that even at the distance they were being viewed from; one could see that they formed pathways wide enough for an army of wagons to travel on abreast.<br>
<br>
The planet of Rumolien itself was in its midterm phase, its figure eight revolution carrying it in between the two suns. When one sun set in the east, the other was just beginning to peak over the horizon in the west, with at least one of the two moons hanging in the sky like a craggy ornament all the time. The red glow of dusk painted the land and trees with fiery outlines then soon bathed everything in the golden flood of dawn, washing across rocks and hills with the arrival of the other sun. The stars only briefly shimmered in the short time allotted to them, shyly glowing then winking away.<br>
<br>
Shigun’motsuo intently watched the sunset, anything astronomical always interested him. His teacher, Codo’zenn, had written many of the theories concerning the cycles of the moons and planets. It had taken him countless moon years of observation and gallons of ink to record it all, sometimes gruffly crumpling up all that he had collected and tossing it into the fire when one of his theories was proven wrong.<br>
<br>
But Shigun had not come to gaze at the stars, there were other dire events that had taken place which needed answers and not finding them could lead to dreadful ramifications. He turned from the sky and marched onward through the soggy marshlands, surrounded on three sides by a looming darkened forest. The soft ground was interrupted only by rising stones and leafless trees, covered in tangible strings of goo which fluttered up and down on the breath of the wind. Water and mud squeaked in protest against the steady footfalls of his bladed boots, which pushed long tendrils of swamp grass flat into the marsh every step. <br>
<br>
All around him, the doughy land gurgled out bubbles through gaseous fissures in the mud. The translucent orbs hovered up from the swamp in snaky motions, casting spectrums of rainbow light as sun beams filtered through them. In the glassy surface of a large bubble, Shigun was able to catch a glimpse of his own reflection. His eyeless face looked back at him, rolling creases of skin covered the portions of his face where eyes would be on a human. After halting for a few moments the bubble rose higher and popped on the angular tip of his sloping nose, splashing a few droplets onto his slightly ruddy skin. Whenever he imagined having eyes, it perplexed him, how could others bare only being able to see what was in the field of vision just ahead of them? Certainly, he could never manage it. He was too accustomed to being able to see everywhere around, below, and above him, a result of the sight follicles as they were called. The sight follicles were two lumps of skin spaced equally apart near the top of his brow. Bundles of slender white strands of hair protruded from the lumps, fanning out an arm length from either side of his head like overgrown feline whiskers. The thin fibers functioned like lenses, focusing in on the light and tunneling it back to the brow, where pupil-like structures were located beneath the skin. Behind each pupil was a retina, attached to the rod and cone cells which enabled him to see the world in vivid detail––which in turn was connected to the optic nerve. Of course, Shigun was nothing special; this was the way all people of the Gridikkor race perceived the world, and a valuable asset it was, never was a Gridikkor taken by surprise from behind or above.<br>
<br>
Thinking of his race pulled out a few unpleasant memories. Long before the War of Redemption, the Gridikkor were a savage bunch, waging battles against the neighboring kingdom of Albanon, where the Draconeers dwelled. After moon years of training, the fighting arts of Maz-fin-galgafer were perfected, a style which involved using the most deadly parts of one’s body as the weapons. When surrounded by multiple foes, a gridikkor would dive down and handstand on one arm, using his feet and sword arm to become a cyclone of blades around him, shredding into meaty chunks any who were bold enough to get close. Those were the days when the Gridikkor divided and conquered, before they had been cursed. Shigun didn’t feel any remorse that those days were long since passed. With age came wisdom, and he was considered old even during the War of Redemption. Now he was ancient, in fact, that was a blatant understatement. But the agelessness had not come without a price, all of the Gridikkor were infertile; unable to pass on their seed to create offspring. <br>
<br>
Following the Battle of Fotenburg, where the Gridikkor drove the Draconeers from their strongholds in the plains; they discovered what their enemies had been protecting all along. A sacred well of wisdom and youth was located atop a steep mountain near Albanon’s capital city, some say it was a pool formed from the tear drops of the First Matron, while others claimed it to be a fountain from the bile of the Prime Corrupter. In any case, the Draconeers seemed to never have taken advantage of it, though they fervently threw away their lives to defend it. The Gridikkor clans that fought to the mountain’s crest all sipped deeply from the well, consuming it almost to the last drop, spooning up in flasks anything that was left over. The effects of the water were instantaneous. Shigun basically felt the sands of his life stop trickling away, his internal timer leading toward death came to an abrupt halt. Of course, those who drank from the well could still be slain by physical means––just not by disease or old age. After returning from the mountain, the Gridikkor waylaid the Draconeer’s capital city of Karamoor. It was a pitched battle that lasted for many moon days, where the clans failed to even breach the outer walls. While the Gridikkor were fighting against the main gates, commando squads of Draconeers would slip out into the distant grasslands through hidden tunnels, attacking surreptitiously and disrupting trains of logistics, cutting off supply lines and breaking the battle spirit of their enemy.<br>
<br>
The Gridikkor were finally forced into retreat, lest they be overwhelmed by their enemies in their weakened state. They fled across the plains, back into the deep forests of Rettazon, where their glass cities lay. Even though they had failed in securing any of the rich farm soil which they had gone out seeking in the first place, disappointment ran thin. The elixir of immortality they had obtained weighed far more on the scales of value. Upon their arrival, the clansmen were greeted by their bouncing children and thankful wives. The flasks they carried, which had been filled to the brim with the enchanted water, were gifted to the rest of the city and villages, where all the inhabitants drank their fill to find this everlasting life. It was not discovered until soon afterwards...but the water had made them all impotent. No matter how hard they tried, none of them could produce offspring. To make matters worse, Draconeer armies were mobilizing to retaliate for what was stolen. They deemed the Gridikkor “Usurpers of the Wisdom” or “Malefactors of Life.”<br>
  <br>
Their conflict was about to begin but was forestalled by a new, invisible enemy which descended upon both sides. The Achromatic Plague. It was unknown where it had originated from, but it indiscriminately killed numbers beyond totaling. No one could combat this disease, for it was always multiplying and spreading, infecting the flesh with pus vomiting cysts. Familiar faces became unrecognizable heaps of white lumps, crowding out every last refuge of healthy flesh. Despite drinking the everlasting water, Gridikkor were not immune to this unseen adversary. Those infected died slow, torturing deaths as cysts burst and drained the body of all fluids.<br>
<br>
Not all hope was lost. For the first time known to the races of Falax’mertenya, the Nyriads descended down from the Lands of Benediction. They were unable to be seen by most, but there were a few who had a gift of sight between worlds––Shigun was one of them. He could only describe these creatures as utterly beautiful. Their bodies of pure white were more slender than a pole, flawless in every curve and shape, seeming to fade and flicker with their surroundings as they silently moved. Chins were rounded off to perfection, as if symmetry was their father. Their faces were mouthless, indeed, most of them seemed to bare no expression at all. Their eyes were deep-set pools of blue, spaced equally apart like transfixed gemstones filled with cerulean ripples of love and gentleness. Their hands were tiny shapes with five elegant fingers all the same length.  At first glance, they all appeared to be wearing tall golden crowns atop their heads, which were made of four branches––but in actuality, they were racks of fine antlers. The points on the antlers seemed to distinguish rank among the Nyriads; their leader, the Arch Nyriad Missenadala, held antlers on her head that towered so high they almost doubled her height.<br>
<br>
It was difficult to understand what they were saying but their intentions were obvious; to help Falax’mertenya. At first, Shigun thought they had come from another island, but they told him they had come from a world parallel to his own, the Lands of Benediction. A place that made the beauty of Falax’mertenya pale into a mere shadow in comparison.<br>
<br>
The people recovered miraculously from the Achromatic Plague as the Nyriads passed their hands through them, frothing out holy specs of white light from their forms all the while. The Arch Nyriad Missenadala claimed that the disease, and sudden violent nature of the world, were both a result of Dardaroff, the Fallen Nyriad. Dardaroff once sat alongside the Arch Nyriad, for they were both creations of the First Matron, left to govern Falax’mertenya in her absence. The Arch Nyriad was gifted the Seed of all Creation by the First Matron––some felt that Dardaroff had envied her because of this, after all, they were equals, so why had she been chosen over himself? But Dardaroff would never have done the evil deeds he had committed without the hand of the Prime Corrupter pushing him. The Prime Corrupter was assumed to be the wicked son of the First Matron and the First Sire. He was never seen, but he was there in all of them. Supposedly, he had tricked Dardaroff into taking the Seed of all Corruption, which was in turn used to taint other Nyriads. The Seed of all Corruption didn’t create, but distorted what already existed, molding a maleficent race from men known as the Tanzar––just to name one. Dardaroff and his sect of followers fled from the Lands of Benediction, forming their own spiteful sanctuary in the southern regions of Falax’mertenya, near the edge of the world. In later times, it came to be known as the Realm of Malediction, where the inverted Tower of Vozz plummeted through the island and protruded from beneath it, somewhere in the center of Oztrenoth, City of Conflagration. <br>
<br>
Now, Dardaroff was dead––killed in the War of Redemption by the Arch Nyriad. The war was the only time that the Draconeer and Gridikkor had fought alongside, uniting along with humans and other races to defeat what would inevitably destroy them all if not stopped. They formed a union called the Fundament, which still existed to this day, though not nearly as powerful as it once had been––in fact, it seemed to be breaking.<br>
<br>
Shigun no longer cared for the Fundament or any other alliance which had been formed. He worked alone, to learn more about Falax’mertenya and to preserve it as best he could, which may prove difficult. He was one of the few still alive from the War of Redemption and knew the deeper truth about what Falax’mertenya really was.<br>
<br>
When something died its soul went to the Land of Benediction to live forever in eternal happiness. The free-thinking creatures became Nyriads, while plants thrived forever in the Blessed Garden. So it was told, but Shigun didn’t believe it anymore. He could see the Spirit Flow, and as far he could tell, every departed soul now went south into the Realm of Malediction. It was a fruitless land, sanctioned off from the rest of the Falax’mertenya by the Grand Seal. The Unconsecrated Ones, henchmen of Dardaroff that were trapped in Tower Vozz, were also held in check by the Grand Seal, a dimensional barrier that had been erected all around the Realm of Malediction after the War of Redemption.<br>
<br>
But if the barrier was to fail...there would be no Nyriads to come to the rescue. Shigun was almost certain of this. He recollected the imprint left in his mind from the sundering cries that poured down from the Land of Benediction a short time after Dardaroff was defeated.<br>
<br>
Macbayeth...                                                                          Macbayeth...<br>
<br>
           Macbayeth...&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                                           Macbayeth...<br>
                         <br>
                           Macbayeth...         Macbayeth...<br>
<br>
                                          Macbayeth...why?<br>
<br>
Macbayeth...your arm will forever be tainted red with my blood!<br>
<br>
Macbayeth...the outlander who died killing the spawn of the Seed of All Corruption, a being known as the Master. The Master was like a son to Dardaroff, a son whose power surpassed his own. The Master’s mere existence brought on the Achromatic Plague and countless other afflictions––it was the bane of life. But there was a being called the Dreamer to counteract the Master, sprouting from the Seed of all Creation. The Dreamer brought on good health and prosperity, everything done by it was a benefactor of life. Alas, the dreamer was slain as well, by Dredikkon, who was second only to Dardaroff.<br>
<br>
Dredikkon was still very alive somewhere in the Realm of Malediction, along with the Unconsecrated Ones. He may even have an Unseen Sword, which was a weapon that had been wielded by Dardaroff and one by Missenadala as well. These were not ordinary swords, they were capable of shattering souls, erasing them from the Spirit Flow forever. Both of them were still unaccounted for, it was one of Shigun’s personal tasks to find both of them and keep them away from the hands of evil.<br>
<br>
But first, he would continue his long travel to the Forgotten Kingdom of Retazzon, in search of the Kredonicle, a book which spoke history and future within the same words.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *****<br>
<br>
In the Realm of Malediction, a barren land wrought through and throughout with the outlines of jagged edifices of stone that pointed out in slanted lines like rows of daggers, dark ambitions were being hatched. <br>
<br>
Beyond the hazy brown screen of dust storms and ferocious twisters lay the blocky City of Conflagration. It was a city soaked in the scorching warmth of undying flames, which turned to ice then back to fire, as quickly as lightning flashes and fades across a blackened sky.<br>
 <br>
Pillars of icy hot fire randomly erupted through the brown slabs of the streets and cubical buildings, tossing boulders and frost trailing fireballs into the city below. Mourn Fire was the name given to this brand of torture, which was so commonly used here. The people that shuffled on their heels through the streets were crude, hunched over shapes. Melted skin hung loosely from the black of their charred bones as if flesh were just clothing to be worn or discarded. These tortured creatures seemed mindless, uncaring of the chaos occurring all around them. Some were swallowed up as they drunkenly staggered and fell into the crevices of splitting streets; in response to them, Mourn Fire spewed out in winding wreathes of blue and orange flame, like a satisfied fiery belch. Death didn’t matter to them, for they would die many more times, such was their fate. The sky above was a complete brown-out, seeming to shift and move with the screaming winds. This airborne sheet of sediment repelled even the slightest shred of sunlight from bearing down on the city.<br>
<br>
The city was constantly reforming and reshaping to the rhythm of destruction that directed it. Slabs of stone moaned and cracked as they forcefully split off from buildings and streets, floating away from their structures and rising up into the sky above, where they briefly whirled and came plummeting back down, sending seismic tremors and clouds of dust rippling out around them as they slammed together in the form of new buildings.<br>
<br>
Agonizing bellows echoed back and forth across the buildings, answered only by more barks of pain mixed in with the prevailing roar of Mourn Fire. The dismal sky was broken only by small, silvery pellets of white light streaking across the sky, streaming out a rain of falling stars in their wake, heading directly for Tower Vozz. More souls to add to the inferno.<br>
<br>
The inverted Tower of Vozz was forever dark, its cylindrical shape cut down from its foundations on the surface through layers of rock and even pools of magma, hanging out from the bottom of Falax’mertenya like a bony hand with six spread fingers. The walls of the tower seemed alive, for they squirmed and writhed with the souls of those who were trapped there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deep within the tower strode a figure walking upwards at a vertical tilt, as if there was an invisible walkway that his feet were attracted to. The man’s body was wrapped in a cloak of darkness, wearing it like a tainted ermine coat. From the walls, hands disparagingly reached out for him, begging for respite or any other mercy he might grant, but their desperate requests were simply brushed aside. Glass cubes spun and shimmered all around him; the reflections of trapped faces were pressed firmly against their panes, mouths opened wider than chasms, screaming in silent torment. The glass prisons suddenly flashed in tendrils of blue-orange, flooding with Mourn Fire and blotching out the faces, then quickly vanishing, giving those imprisoned a small hope that it would not come again, but it always did. Mourn Fire sparked and burned to life everywhere. It was the only light to cast away shadows in this forsaken place. A bottomless circular abyss lay below and above––one unaccustomed to Vozz would likely not be able to tell apart up from down here.<br>
<br>
Dredikkon continued walking through his kingdom, his face was fixed into a melancholy complexion like it always was. His chin was a long, cylindrical protrusion, with icicles tipping off from the bottom of it in the form of a frosty beard. Flaming eyebrows were raised almost quizzically above his smooth forehead, like fiery caterpillars curled up into burning crescents. His visible skin was a pasty white, stretched taut like a canvas over his high-knobbed cheekbones. The man’s eyes were narrow blue slits, almost sealed shut from the passage of time, but his gaze still looked as if it could punch holes through stone. He was once a Nyriad of notable rank, but that was long ago. The aura of holiness had passed away from him ever since he threw his lot in with Dardaroff. His golden antlers had rotted away, leaving him balder than a spineless sea urchin.<br>
<br>
Dredikkon came to a stop before a wall which separated one part of the tower from the next. An average-sized doorframe gilded with bone was etched into it. A wall of flame barred shut the entryway, but it simply parted like a drawn curtain before Dredikkon. He stepped through the doorway and was whisked away into a room made from pure tan-colored bricks. The room was dully illuminated by two candle stands on either side, held up by their golden mounts, displaying a white burning stick in each of their five holsters. A simple desk lay between the candles at the end of a red carpet outlined with blue. Behind the desk, a middle-aged man sat at ease in a high-backed chair, reading a piece of parchment through his small, black oval spectacles, which hung at the tip of his refined nose. The man hastily scribbled a few things down on the parchment with a feathered quill, then the ruffled piece of parchment disappeared in a puff of smoke along with the writing utensil.<br>
<br>
Dredikkon walked forward, his shadowy garb flowing out behind him like a midnight cloak riding on the wind. His wizened face was in the dimpled expression of dolor which it always seemed to be.<br>
<br>
Ardren, the tan-skinned man seated behind the desk, leaned back in his chair and greeted him, “Salutations, what can I do for you Great Lord Dredikkon?”<br>
<br>
Dredikkon’s voice was scratched and faded, carrying like a dim grating noise, “Do you hear that sound?” He placed a hand to his ear and listened intently, watching the expression on the face of his secretary<br>
<br>
Ardren’s smooth lips rose into an inquiring arch as he listened carefully. Nothing out of the ordinary clicked in his ears, just the usual wails of suffering and woe, multiplying and drowning each other out. The man frowned, simply shrugging his broad shoulders and shaking his head, taking on a tone of slight expectancy, “I just hear the voices of millions of souls being torn apart by damnation. Nothing that surprises me. So, what’s so special about that?”<br>
<br>
Ardren was always this way, he didn’t seem to be an Unconsecrated One at heart, yet somehow he had fallen in with the rest of them. He was once a leader among the humans, originating from the Slatarian race of men, who were desert dwellers. In a bloody coup, he and his followers had overthrown the tyrannic dynasty which ruled their people. He and his family then claimed the throne for themselves, but not for long. One of his best and most trusted friends, a man whose name he didn’t even wish to speak, poisoned him and his entire family during a banquet held in his honor. His craving to avenge his own death and those of his family was palpable from the moment his departed soul first arrived. Dredikkon knew that such a strong feeling of vengeance needed to be harnessed, not to mention he was running short on Unconsecrated Ones, since the others were still trapped inside of an unbreakable prison from the War of Redemption. Unbreakable now but not for much longer. Dredikkon replied, “A hundred million souls, to be precise. Enough to break free of our prison and that of the Unconsecrated Ones. We will use the energy of these spirits to puncture the Grand Seal and they will be lost in the process, but freedom always exacts its price. I want you to release the Crimson Hounds, my eyes and ears. I am unsure whether or not the Grand Seal will rebuild on itself once we tear ourselves a hole. I want you to send the Unconsecrated Ones and the Crimson Hounds through the gap as soon as it is created, there is no telling how long it will hold, so we must act swiftly.”<br>
<br>
The man sharply stood up from the desk and pulled his black spectacles off with a quick flick of the wrist, hazy gray eyes clouded with anticipation. He clenched his fist into a ball and held it forward. “I will carry out your orders immediately. At long last, I can return to my kingdom and terrorize the ancestors of those who brought me this great suffering! They will not know what pain truly is until I am through with them, all that they now know will pale in comparison. Swords will seem like tickling feathers and their most horrifying nightmares will seem like fond dreams once I am done.” Ardren’s face lost its spurt of the moment conviction and sank back into a neutral expression. “But what if the Grand Seal is still unable to be broken?”<br>
<br>
Dredikkon shook his head in a dismissive manner, “The Seed of all Corruption is still out there somewhere. If all else fails, the Master will eventually be reborn. A sign in the skies will trigger it, but our barren skies hide from us anything occurring above. I no longer have the patience either. We have been cast away for far too long but we may yet have to wait.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The other slowly nodded, not wanting to get his hopes too high. But he had endured this place and its inhabitants for long enough, he wanted to be away from here, like all that were trapped in this stuffy box of damnation. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *****<br>
<br>
Shigun’Motsuo had traveled for days; his journey taking him across emerald fields inlaid with patches of giant quartaz rock that shone like clear, translucent gems. He also strode across many grasslands that spanned as far as his sight follicles could see, the wind gently combing through them and sending out calming whispers. His suntanned robes were now painted near the waist and feet with slashes of green, where long blades of grass had brushed across him and left their mark. He had taken many baths along the way––wherever he could find pools of clean water or, in rare instances, a waterfall. Washing away the coats of grime that built up on his face and body lessened the weight of the journey it seemed. It also felt nice to clean his white hair, which was flowing and whipping out on the breeze behind him in wavy tendrils.<br>
<br>
The long days of Rumolien would soon come to an end. The planet was over halfway through its cycle of revolution and would take a course into its apogee across from the second sun, where both suns would be on the same side of the horizon. It was the only time when night truly fell for lengthy periods.<br>
<br>
Shigun’s wooden sword scabbard wagged out behind him like a curved dog tail, swaying back and forth through the grass. It was at least twice as long as he was tall, spanning over two spread-eagle arm lengths. Despite the shildien-edge’s length, it was incredibly light and easy to handle, the blade itself was thin, almost too minuscule to be seen. Some could not even see it, if not looking at the flat side, which was a thicker bar of steel. The weapon was created from sheets of Zerconon––the hardest of the true metals––hammered flat and folded over and over in the forge. The hilt was molded from Trestonium; a cheap, malleable material that was lustrous gold in appearance.<br>
 <br>
Of course, such a large weapon could be cumbersome at times, especially when walking through doorways or crowds of people. But Shigun favored it. He hardly ever killed, only when absolutely necessary, for he knew exactly where everything went after they died. However, if it did come to a decisive battle to the death, his foes were usually slain on the draw of his sword. <br>
<br>
Shigun was nearing his destination of Rettazon, he had already passed the Albanon Kingdom––without any trouble, thankfully. The anatomy of the draconeers that lived there was interesting, Shigun had always wanted to study them. But asking to study them would be like a fox politely asking to examine a hen. The Draconeer and Gridikkor were not the best of friends.   A rolling plain that took steep dives and rises stretched into the far distance, the grass here was shorter and barely clung past the ankles. The skies were completely clouded in puffy tints of gray, with crevices of yellow finding refuge in them every so often, pouring down a few beams of light from the eastern sun. A flock of birds were dark silhouettes meticulously flapping their wings in unison, rising up from the grass in a single-file arch, taking flight to avoid the storm head which seemed to be fast approaching.<br>
<br>
The skies...in his dreams he had seen some disturbing images in the skies. Dreams were often more than premonitions––for him at least. The subconscious part of the mind that filtered through dreams was a valuable companion. Most failed to utilize it––though not by fault of their own. The mind was believed to only be using ten percent of its total capacity, a myth believed by the Hamotsfu religion and a belief widely accepted by many other races. This was not true; a healthy mind was always running at one-hundred percent capacity. But what the mind perceives is different. The brain has a will of its own––it knows what it wants to know and sees what it wants to see, despite the interests of its master. The thalamus, part of the brain that regulates information, discards incoming senses which it feels are unnecessary. This includes perception of surreal beings and worlds that exist as shadows overlapping this one. The first ones that came to mind were the Spirit Flow and the Faded Dimension, things that teetered on the boundaries of reality.<br>
 <br>
Regretfully, Shigun’s ideas were as widely accepted as lunacy since his mind was one of the few that could actually see these things. However, there was a drug that could help open the mind’s pathways. Something that came from the palwaa leaf or some such plant. It could be ground up into a fine powder and inhaled through the nasal cavity, causing chemical reactions in the brain which allowed neurons to flow freely. Alas, those who took the drug usually used it for their own pleasure––being unaware of its practical purpose––and had not the slightest idea what they were experiencing. Using the drug extensively could have undesired side effects as well, leading to addiction or permanently damaging brain tissue.<br>
<br>
After wading through more fields of grass, the darkened forest of Rettazon was visible off in the distance. It had been a long time since Shigun had returned to his homeland, abandoned aeons ago, following sometime after the War of Redemption. He could almost see the glass towers rising above the surface of the treetops, structures which had been erected by the fine architects of the Gridikkor.<br>
<br>
The forest itself contained many coniferous trees, with knotted roots that veined out below ground as well as above it, disappearing beneath the beds of green needles which covered the entire forest floor. The air was permeated only by a steady blue mist, its cold vapor reducing Shigun’s visibility into a smaller circumference. The mist slowly flowed and hovered through the forest like a lazy, frosty breath, chilling him as he walked through it. The mist was a gas that was poisonous if the lungs were exposed to it for too long, so Shigun took his breaths sparingly. It seemed to have no effect on the trees around him, in fact, they appeared to thrive on it.<br>
<br>
He was accompanied only by silence and the looming columns of dark tree trunks, supporting the shelter of green interlocking needles that hid the sky overhead. Bladed boots kicked pine needles out of the way, revealing a worn brick pathway beneath.<br>
<br>
At last, the path led to the outskirts of the city of Rettazon. It was a desolate place, populated only by more trees, crumbled monoliths, buildings, towers, and more of the mist. Stone pathways ran unevenly off into the mist, their slabs cracked or slanted at random intervals. After the sudden appearance of the blue mist––spawning from a gap in the soil somewhere––the Gridikkor had fled from their kingdom. Many of them died from the poisonous gas and those that perished were unable to be replaced.<br>
<br>
Shigun strode on through the city, the tufts of his sight hairs twitching and fanning out, glancing inside of abandoned buildings on each side. Finely crafted chairs sat empty around circular tables, undisturbed ever since the city was abandoned. The buildings were mostly shaped in stacks of cubes, each cube getting smaller every floor one went higher.<br>
 <br>
Glass towers came into sight just ahead, round near the bottoms like vases, their shape running smoothly up along the sides and meeting at pillars of shimmering glass, stretching above into the mist where they were topped off by flowery petals of more glass. Even the dim-light raced up and down their resplendent lengths, yellow beads that bounced from top to bottom on the glossy structures.<br>
<br>
Shigun took a brief moment to survey them with admiration, hands resting on his hips. He wondered if they were still active, well, only one way to find out. He opened his palm and reached down for a nearby rock. It was an egg-sized stone. Lifting the rock and winding his arm up, he pitched it down the pathway located between the glass towers. Surely enough, the towers groaned and rotated on their foundations, spinning around to bring their focusing lenses bearing down toward the intruding rock. Two bright, thin yellow beams silently crisscrossed each other and intercepted the rock mid-flight, vaporizing it into a dusty grain cloud.<br>
 <br>
Shigun grinned to himself; the craft work of his race was very impressive. But since the towers still functioned, he would have to take a different route to get into Castle Elgathor, which lay just ahead. The towers could only be deactivated from inside the castle, so it would be impossible to pass through them taking this path. He hoped to reach it soon because he was beginning to feel a bit light-headed from breathing in all this nauseating mist.<br>
<br>
Shigun worked his way back through the city, walking down abandoned streets and across yards, heading to the rear gates of the unscalable walls that were enclosed about the castle. Somewhere inside of there was the Kredonicle. It was unable to be taken from its pedestal so it had been left behind. The city’s innate defenses were all that now protected it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
After rounding a corner, the rear gates came into view. Beyond the wall’s archway were rows of statues, lined up tightly together on either side, facing directly across from each other, comparable to how the glass towers were positioned.  They were sculpts of Gridikkor warriors, blown up to twenty-fold more than their actual size. All the statues were kneeling and facing one another, peaceful expressions holding firm on their faces of wizened stone. Each warrior held up a  shildien-edge in his palms. Their crafted blades were crossed with those of their inanimate sparring partners directly facing them, forming a trilateral roof through the tunnel of stone swords.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
If the tower defenses were active, then likely so were these. Shigun would have to step into the Faded Dimension to bypass them quickly enough. But that held risks of its own, one could become trapped forever in the Faded Dimension if not careful, also, there were other dangers that dwelt there. The Great White Hunter and the Shadow of Murder came to mind foremost. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Staying out here would accomplish nothing though, waiting always led to more waiting, best to do now what could be done later. Shigun prepared to partition his mind, to balance it in between this world and the Faded Dimension. He retracted his sight hairs into his brow, to cover himself in darkness where it was easier to concentrate. He let himself slip through the curtain between worlds, soon, a sound like a rushing tidal wave grew closer and closer, until it seemed an entire ocean must be raging straight overhead. He felt himself become half ethereal and half flesh, sensations from both crowding into his thoughts. The sight hairs slowly grew back from his brow, fanning out into wide spans. The world around him was completely changed; all the colors of the city were reversed. Everything was distorted, silent, and unmoving. Maintaining the balance between each world was like trying to walk a tight rope across a bottomless chasm––one wrong step and it would all be over. The Faded Dimension pulled and tugged at him, it wanted him to become a piece of it forever. Phase Striding was the name given to this art. Not many could accomplish it and live to tell.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun took one step toward the archway and it carried him a much greater distance than any normal step. Distance and time were different between the two worlds but they came to a common medium when one was in each half. The gridikkor briefly looked ahead, then took off at a sprint. He moved through a haze of colors as he dashed right down the middle of the pathway. The stone statues on either side brought down their swords to meet him, crashing into the roadway with a force that seemed to jolt the entire city. The ground crackled and erupted into flying debris, stone flying back and forth, bouncing off of statues and pathway alike. Before the swords even touched the ground, Shigun was already past them. He stepped entirely out of the Faded Dimension upon reaching the other side. The trap he had just bypassed would have easily stopped any intruder unfamiliar with this city, so he didn’t feel it was flawed.<br>
<br>
Castle Elgathor was just ahead, its glossy walls faintly reflecting images of the blue mist surrounding them. The castle was a rectangle with two blocky parapets rising up from each of its ends, marked by a cylindrical tower protruding from the main floor’s center between the two outer battlements. The walls were bare and stripped of any banners, while flagpoles stood tall and lonely below without any flags to wave.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun’s bladed boots marched across the stone toward the entrance, a simple double door which swung open at his push, slowly winding inward and allowing a stream of the dim light to seep in along with some mist. The inside was like an icy wonderland sparkling to life with all the glassy walls catching any drops of luminance and throwing them back and forth. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Inside the rooms down the first spherical corridor, silver furniture sat unpolished and untampered with. Beds lay covered in fuzzy dirt-streaked sheets; years of dust and soot were compounded on top of them from being neglected.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Corridors slanted off from the main one, branching into servant living quarters and the kitchen area. There were a few sparsely populated courtyards visible through translucent panes to either side, bowl-shaped fountains of stone sitting dryer than a desert’s drought in each of them.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun deeply exhaled a few times. The toxins in the air were really starting to make him dizzy. He decided to pick up the pace, boots knocking across the floor in more rapid succession. The shildien-edge bounced around in its wooden scabbard, a hand rested down on the hilt to steady it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Just ahead, an intersection between four corridors opened up, with a staircase winding upwards into a circular tower at their focal point. Shigun unstrapped the sword from his belt and placed it on the ground, since the corridor would be too narrow for the long scabbard to fit through. Then he took to the steps, briskly walking up their length three at a time. The stairs curved high into the vascular tower. Raindrop-shaped windows along its walls opened up to show moving glimpses of the fog enshrouded city below.<br>
 <br>
The staircase opened up onto a flat oval platform with no ceiling or walls, completely exposed to the environment and air. Thankfully, the mist seemed much thinner up here. A sea of pointed green treetops extended out in all directions beneath Shigun’s new vantage point. The city below now appeared a smaller model of what it had been up close. After sticking his head out from the entryway, a refreshing gust of wind from the west stirred and whispered up the tower walls, filling his lungs with cleaner air. It was most likely a jet stream originating from the Star Shine Ocean which lay just on the other side of the forest. It was a good view, he could almost discern the outline of the World Spire off in the distance as well.<br>
<br>
A short length away, Shigun could see the Kredonicle resting atop a flat podium supported by a slender pedestal. He was in luck to have it sitting right before him because the Kredonicle simply vanished and reappeared without reason at times. He paced toward the book, reaching out a hand toward its red cover entwined with curling vines of gold and silver. It was the book which told the future and past within the same words. Before he could touch it, the book jumped from the podium and spread open all on its own, whipping through pages in blurs of parchment. Blank pages. Shigun was unsure what that meant, he had never used the Kredonicle before, only the clan chief was allowed to read it. <br>
<br>
The book began to float away, Shigun desperately reached out a hand and shouted, “No! Don’t go!” In response, the book turned toward him. Letters began to appear on one of the blank pages, written by an invisible hand. They words said, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Can I help you?”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun cocked his brow to one side and scratched through tufts of his white hair. The Kredonicle could talk? Well, he supposed he had seen stranger things. The gridikkor reached out for the book again, but it darted away from his grasp. More words appeared on the pages, scribbled in haste, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Please don’t touch me with your filthy grubby hands!”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Shigun frowned and looked down into his palms, they weren’t that dirty. But he was not one to argue, especially with books that were ill tempered. He stood there in silence for a moment, not sure what to say next.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The Kredonicle grew impatient, vexingly slanting words across its pages, “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’ll ask again, this time in bold and underlined,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHAT DO YOU WANT?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun’s chest rose as he sniffed, this was a very rude book. But he recollected his thoughts and managed to start off by saying, “What is happening to Falax’mertenya? I had a dream that I could not just toss aside. A dagger cut across the sky, opening a gash where a single red teardrop fell down upon a city. Soon after, a massive eye of the deepest blue opened up, with eyelashes like dove wings. It cried out a single crystalline teardrop onto the same city. What does it mean?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The book started writing something then erased it, new words popped up quickly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“I believe it means you are an insane old fool who thinks he’s a visionary. But I’ll give you the same spew I gave the last person like yourself who came up here. Watch closely.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The book flipped to a blank page, which suddenly flooded with the following words:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The First Sire gifted Rumolien to the First Matron, whose hands gently caressed the world.<br>
Master of creation, her breath blessed us in a swirl of bliss, filling us with life’s sweet touch.<br>
Will we ever see her all-knowing face? Our hearts yearn on with unwavering hope.<br>
Be our savior from the ireful touch of the Master’s scorching blood.<br>
Defeated in battle by the hand of the outlander, who journeyed from the lowlands.<br>
By the clemency of death, the outlander was whisked away, sent to the Lands of Benediction.<br>
The Arch Nyriad was slain, by will wrought in the forge of malice, her Dreamer was lost.<br>
Child of hope, your footsteps shine a path for us all, leading up to your inevitable downfall.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Beneath the passage, another line appeared, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“...That’s it, make of it what you will.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Shigun’motsuo committed the words and their placement to memory. He laid a hand across his stomach and bowed deeply, speaking out a muffled, informal gratitude, “Ahem, thank you.” But his attention suddenly wandered from the book to elsewhere. From the corner of his peripheral vision he could have sworn he saw a thin tube of light flash in the city below. He focused his vision on two of the glass towers. The gridikkor’s senses had not lied to him; two more beams of light silently fired. That could only mean one thing...someone or something else was in the city.<br>
<br>
The book wrote its last two lines, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Ah, it appears you have company. So long, good luck.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The cover slapped shut and the book began to spin and whirl as if it were being pulled into a vortex. It grew smaller and smaller after each rotation until it simply became a tiny spec, winking out of existence with a chime and starry flash. <br>
<br>
Shigun was already halfway down the winding staircase by the time the book vanished. He practically flew down the steps, nearly tripping several times in his haste. His long white hair madly flew out behind him as he tumbled back into the intersecting corridors. He swooped down and scooped up the shildien-edge without losing any momentum. If he was fast enough, he could probably escape without encountering the one he assumed was outside. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=153.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=153.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.threadControl?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1>General Fantasy Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
