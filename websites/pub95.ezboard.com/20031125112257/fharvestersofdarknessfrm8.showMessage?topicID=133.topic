Various herbs, roots, and powders were arrayed in front of her, and the lady herself was quietly carefully grinding leaves within a mortar and pestle.  She hummed softly, her eyes glowing in the near dark of the enclosed space.  The priestess of Luclin was in a -very- good mood.<br>
<br>
She smiled softly, thinking back upon the evening spent with her cousin, so recently restored to life.  Sarhea seemed fine, although she was a bit shaky on how things had come to pass, and how she was back upon Norrath again.  It didn't really matter though; she was back with her family.  Kerridwynn was tempted to petition Innoruuk for answers, but in her heart she knew she would gain no reply.  Her soul belonged to the Maiden of Shadows now, and the Dark Father would look upon the priestess no longer.<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn set the mortar and pestle down, pausing to rub her eyes.  She was tired, but it was a good tired.  For now she could rest, and truly sleep for the first time in several decades.  No more dreams would haunt her, dreams of the past.  They could rest now.<br>
<br>
She turned, and grabbed a crystal vial from the shelf behind her.  The contents of the mortar cascaded into it, and the stopper was replaced quickly with a muttered incantation.  When Kerridwynn returned to her workroom the contents would be fresh, no matter how long she was gone.  She returned the vial to its' place on the shelf and tidied up her workroom before stepping into the shadows.<br>
<br>
It was odd, the trick Luclin had shown her.  It was a feeling like dissolving, and her vision went grey as if she was seeing through shadows.  Or as if she -were- shadows.  And then, she was in the main hall, stepping out of the patch of shadow cast by the flickering torchlight.  As she crossed the hall, heading for the stairway, she saw movement near the door.  The priestess turned, her eyes flaring into indigo flame.  She relaxed when she recognized one of her spies.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Have you something to tell me?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The wretched thing nodded, its' wizened features turned upwards to gaze into her face. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, mistress.  The lizard, the one that threatened your daughter...the assassin took care of him.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn nodded gravely, her eyes blazing.  She waved her hand, dismissing the creature to wence it came.  It scurried away, cackling dryly.  Kerridwynn turned and made her way to the stairs, and her bedroom.  As she undressed, shedding the gnomeskin she wore while at home, her mind sped with thoughts.  Surely the Skathris would not let this action of hers go.  She'd known that when she hired the assassin.  She would have to warn the house to be even more wary of the Iksar now.  <br>
<br>
Kerridwynn slid into the bed she shared with her husband, curling herself against his warmth and resting her head on his chest.  She sighed, a smile curling her lips.  It had been a good day.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/Kerridwynn.jpg"><BR><i>~*Templar of Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows*~<br>~*Mistress of the Scythe*~</i><br><i>The hours go by like minutes,<br>And the shadows come to stay.</i><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208851>Garb of the Priestess</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=133.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=133.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.threadControl?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm1">Announcements<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm11">Recruitment<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm8">Public Roleplay area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm7">OOC area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm16">The Twilight Harvest<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm9">Members forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm10">HoD Events<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm12">HoD Vault<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm15">Harvester Histories<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm13">IC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm14">OOC Officer's Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8>Public Roleplay area</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
