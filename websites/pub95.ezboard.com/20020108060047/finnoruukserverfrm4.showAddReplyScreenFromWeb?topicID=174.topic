From another thread I gather that 18 people is the definition of &quot;FIF&quot; for the planes.  In other words, first raid to show up with 18 people owns the planes and no one else can come in and kill stuff.<br>
<br>
Here's my question.  Say you bring 18 people and clear the entire plane.  Now you want to keep control of the plane, either because you want to see if epic mobs will spawn or because you want to kill the regular mobs when they respawn in 12 hours or whatever.<br>
<br>
Do you need to keep 18 people in the zone at all times in order to have the &quot;rights&quot; to it?  Even when no mobs at all are up?<br>
<br>
And if you have less than 18 in the zone, and someone else shows up with 18, does that mean you have to leave?<br>
<br>
I'm interested if anyone has any thoughts on how this is supposed to work.  Or are these open issues?<br>

On a side note, someone said they could do the Planes with 6 people.  Are 6 people enough to clear the entire zone before respawn?  I mean I know 6 people could easily hold an area after breakin (heck there are much tougher MOB's in some zones then the average MOB in Hate or Fear), but even 6 60's I would think would have trouble say pulling the Temple and such.  Besides 6 60's camping the zone sounds a little greedy to me heh, but intentions and character were not subjects for discussion in the Summit : P<br>
<br>
In all honesty though, if you can't keep 18 people up there, why not give some people who still need Planar gear to come up there?  It might give you some satisfaction to know that your 6th twink is now in full Planar, but I still see a lot of mains walking around in gear that could use an upgrade.  Heck an Indico BP would be an upgrade for the vast majority of the Warrior population.  If all you are after is Epics, it would be polite of you to hang around 2nd Floor Hate or the Golems then and let others get gear they need.<br>
<br>
Back on topic, IMO, if you and your friends clear the Planes in 2 hours and then only 2 of you want to hold the Planes, I don't recall seeing that addressed, I guess we didn't realize twinks needed it so bad, or that you were so bored.  If I zoned in with 18 people and saw one FD Monk claiming he owned the zone, I wouldn't be in too good of a mood about that.  If it takes 18 people to claim sufficient force, I would interpret that as 18 people in zone at all times, or else you would forfeit your &quot;claim&quot;.  Because face it, I think pretty much anyone would want more then 18 to face CT, so I could make the argument that if CT is up it takes 36 people to claim sufficient force.  But if 18 is the agreed number that should be the number present to claim the zone.  That would also imply that if two people are trying to &quot;hold&quot; the zone and 18 people zone in that those two would be forced to leave.  <br>
<br>
Solo, I'm speaking in generalities, please don't interpret this is an attack on you individually, because I in no way mean it to be one.  But I'm just not keen on the idea of 1 Monk or Necro sitting up in the Planes waiting for respawn and &quot;holding&quot; it for people who are off doing other stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uoxxoreducto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oxxo Reducto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 474<br> <font color=#778899>(11/28/01 9:04:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.users.qwest.net/~scaltagirone/orc.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FIF questions</span><hr size=1> I was the one who mentioned 6 people.<br>
<br>
Yes, 6 people can easily hold a camp in Fear long enough for 12 more to arrive.<br>
<br>
6 people imo is plenty of force if they know how to do it, and can clear a bit more than you might realize until we gather 12 more.<br>
<br>
I asked b/c I can just see it now.. groups of 16 or so sitting outside of fear... (or can you even zone in before you have 18 ) , or zone in to find a group of 15 who happens to have &quot;3 LD&quot; people consistantly, etc.<br>
<br>
Or.. spend a few hundred plat to port to hate.. then realize people are already there.. OR.. go up see NO ONE is there, bring the forces in.. then realize that there WAS a group, but they were doing CR. <p><img src=http://www.users.uswest.net/~scaltagirone/sswiftsg.jpg><BR>

<br>
The summit agreed 18 in zone required to be FiF.<br>
<br>
My *personal* feeling is this: if you can do it with 18, then I really doubt you need the gear that drops.  Let a group of lowbies in to loot the stuff that's going to rot.  Just make it clear the drops off the named are yours.<br>
<br>
Having a bunch of armchair lawyers trying to find ways around the rules seems ridiculous.<br>

So I guess I'm a little puzzled how lowbies can come in to loot the drops when there are no mobs to drop anything.<br>
<br>
Let me give another example.  I zone into Fear with my 18 buddies to find a completely empty plane, and only 6 players there - the remnants of a successful raid that cleared the entire zone and now are camping the shissar, hoping he spawns.  Obviously 6 people is more than enough to kill the shissar if he spawns.  So do I have the right to tell them to leave, since I have the required 18, and they only have 6?<br>
<br>
(Hint:  I doubt they'll be leaving no matter what I say, so maybe we ought to have a rule that would reflect that.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#778899>(11/29/01 11:32:26 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FIF questions</span><hr size=1> I actually differ a little with you Wolfy.  Fear or Hate can be broken by 2 groups of 50-55 people if they work well together, 3 groups can do it easily.  And there's an awful lot of Warriors still running around that could use Indico Bracers, legs, or BP in that level range.  Now if you clearing it with 6 or so I would tend to agree with you.  But Hate or Fear are generally boring with 4 groups or more unless you are doing bosses/Gods, 3 parties of low-mid 50's can do everything but the biggest stuff pretty easily.<br>
<br>
As far as your question Sol, it's very easy.  If you have 6 of you that only want the Shissar head, invite 12 people who need the other drops up there and keep them buffed : )<br>
<br>
It is sad though, as soon as we can make an agreement people are already looking for excuses to void the spirit of the summit.  This is a great opportunity for TD or some of the others to back up their words.  Those big Guilds who have had &quot;issues&quot; with the scheduling before and claim they had no interest in anything but Epic drops now have a wonderful opportunity to prove it.   Invite Aldrin or a bunch of other people who don't get to go to the Planes much and take them with you.  You could make friends, they get drops they need, and you get the spawns you want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 634<br> <font color=#778899>(11/29/01 12:04:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FIF questions</span><hr size=1> I rather doubt that the 2 groups of 50-55s are under-equipped.<br>
<br>
I also suspect that with 12 people there, there WILL be stuff rotting.<br>
<br>
As for an empty plane, with a group camping the Shissar -- anyone who would tell them they have to leave is a true butthead.<br>
<br>
And as for making new rules -- again I *personally* don't have an issue with it, and if I moderate the next meeting, anything people want on the agenda will be on the agenda.<br>
<br>
However, my personal opinion is that it's not possible to make rules to reasonably cover every contingency.  As someone said, the spirit of the summit is to provide reasonable access to everyone.<br>
<br>
I would think that the new arrivals would be able to work something out with the people already there.<br>

One of those two got an Indico BP last Hate run, the other has a Treeweave and I only have a Barbed Ringmail.  I had Crafted Boots until I bought my Cobbie ones in L54.  Bracers, BP, and legs are the harder pieces for Warriors to come up with if you aren't in a Guild that can farm KD, or kill the Dragons for stuff.  Or at least a Guild with a ton of cash flow, we aren't set up that way.  I guess under-equipped is a relative term, but lets just say I don't think we have anyone under 55 that couldn't use at least one piece of Planar.  Heck my 52 Nec only has 1 Planar piece and is still wearing woven grass bracers.  They kinda clash with his Ornate Rune Shield, but that's the way it goes.  Even so, we can break Hate with 2 groups fairly safely, it's really just a matter of how well you can work together to avoid mass chaos, everything at zone should be under L50.  Of course it helps that we've been going to the Planes since before there was the Second Floor MOB's in hate and CT was still the 1.0 version, but it's a matter of tactics not necessarily gear.<br>
<br>
You seem to be forgetting that we used to have to break PoF and PoH when the max level was 50, and I don't think break-in to either Plane is any harder now then it used to be, easier when you factor in levelling past 50 and some of the upgraded gear.<br>
<br>
And I've seen Apothic Mage Robes rot when we had 30+ people in zone, so just having many people doesn't mean it won't rot.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 639<br> <font color=#778899>(11/29/01 1:28:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FIF questions</span><hr size=1> Then invite the lowbies but let them know the highbies have first dibbs.

You should redefine FiF as FFA if you're not going to allow those days to be booked.  We're not talking FiF to kill a mob like Ragefire or Venril Sathir, you're trying to over extend the concept to a context in which it doesn't belong.  You can't have &quot;FiF&quot; to &quot;kill a zone.&quot; <p><a href="http://www.eldertribunal.com/">

People have said in the past that if the Planes were FFA the High-level Guilds would camp them for weeks.  Some of you are making it sound like that's exactly what you want to do.  Or at least come in, clear it in an hour, then come back in 7 hours and claim it's still yours.  I guess I just feel that if you've already come in and cleared the Planes once it would be courteous of you to let someone else take the next pop.  But then again, I guess this is Innoruuk not one of the other servers, so I shouldn't assume any courtesies will be shown.<br>
<br>
Isn't that what this is about?  &quot;We can clear the Planes in a couple hours, and we want to do that every time they spawn until we can't anymore because it's time for scheduled runs to start&quot;.  You know, Epic MOB's are not camps with PH's.  They spawn at regular intervals, no matter how many times you clear the common MOB's they won't spawn any faster.  It's pretty funny that some of the people who talked about how they don't want any of that crappy Planar gear because they are so uber are now so concerned with not letting anyone else kill any of the MOB's that drop that armor they don't want.  I'm sure within several weeks when the bigger Guilds have all the Planar armor and Epic drops they need for everyone of their twinks that if you headed into the Planes most of them would either be spawned or have people there that would be glad for your help in Exchange for looting rights to Epic drops.<br>
<br>
Unless you piss them off by camping them 24/3 when they aren't scheduled.  I guess just because one certain Guild mostly /movelogged doesn't mean there aren't several people who have been waiting to do the same thing.  If you want the Planes for 24 hours for just your Guild, schedule the damn thing and wait your turn.  FFA/FiF was touted as a way to give everyone more access to the Planes.  But all I see in this thread are people who want to clear them, leave an FD Monk in there to claim it so they can come farm it again.<br>
<br>
Even though I don't agree with a lot of his tactics and ideas, Aldrin was right in that greed is greed, and these new rules aren't giving people more access, it's just giving people more of a chance to show how greedy they are.  Unfortunately I think most people naively thought that this would allow the bigger guilds who are &quot;only&quot; after Epics more chances to take those MOB's and not interrupt someone's scheduled events, as well as give more people a chance at drops that those &quot;Epic only&quot; raiders don't want.  But now I hear that many of you are planning on hitting them early and claiming them for several spawns or days.  You know, WW armor is many times nearly as good or better, and drops from KD or ToV are better.  But from some of these posts some of you don't seem to know that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uugle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ugle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#778899>(11/29/01 3:46:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ugleduklin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dscn0011s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FIF questions</span><hr size=1> Just out of curiosity, did Amici agree to the current Summit?

<br>
Even if the planes were FIF/FFA 7 days a week, I can't conceive of us ever being the type of guild to camp them for weeks on end.  Nor are we looking to claim a zone with one FD monk.  Really, I promise I'm not a mouthpiece for my guild's evil hidden agenda.  I just wanted to ask some questions, and maybe get people to think about some of the tougher issues this Summit poses.<br>

<br>
Again and again and again, Ugle, you miss the point put forward. We're not talking about 6 people claiming respawn after respawn. We're talking about a few people wanting to hang around AFTER we've cleared the plane to wait on a single, easy to kill mob that just happens to have a weird spawn timer. (talking Shissar in this example)... <br>
<br>
I wouldn't like to think my guildmember's right to wait for that particular mob was negated by some silly ruling that allowed another group to come in and ride on the coattails of our clearing simply because they're able to bring in 16 unnecessary people to A COMPLETELY EMPTY plane.<br>
<br>
Do you get it yet? Seems pretty simple to me... <p><center><img src="http://www.fnurt.net/~buckethead/lhilesig.jpg" align=middle></center>

If other stuff started to respawn, then I'd get more people back in.<br>
<br>
But it's good to think about these things ahead of time.<br>

We don't NEED any armor that drops in Fear or Hate really, with a very few exceptions who would be upgrading to SS armor within weeks anyway. <br>
<br>
      We do need a few epic drops, and if we cleared the plane, we would like to be able to only torture a single group of 6 while awaiting the appearance of said epic mob.  We should not have to make 3 ggroups of people sit around with their collective thumbs up their asses, staring at a spawn point.<br>
<br>
     I for one, would be happy if another guild or group wanted to come in and handle re-spawn, as long as they didn't train me or my group, or come anywhere near the epic mob if it popped.<br>
