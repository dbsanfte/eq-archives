After all it was only her side, for she knew she could not speak for the others. Could she capture the expression on Silenae’s face at the moment she had to tell Kallee of what would have to transpire. Could she properly tell of the rituals she had presided over. The two bonding rituals she took part in, only to have them both be broken…by the same person. Was her life even worth mention to let others learn from the mistakes she had made? Could she mention the names of those who she had hurt, who had hurt her, with out the pain and hurt coming back? Could she show others the pain of her whipping, then years later that memory still fresh whiteness another being whipped, all for a lesson. <br>
<br>
Could she tell them how deeply she had failed. How painfully she had fallen from the heights of power to nothingness. Could she share her inter most desires with out having them come back to slap her in the face? One of which had come true while she lay in the darkness communing with her goddess. Was it now time to share her stories?<br>
 <br>
The past:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
<br>
There was a sudden silence. Moments before the forest hummed with the activity of creatures, wolfs, bears, undead. Now there was nothing, even the wind had silenced itself. Eridok Elsaran Olath’Su’aco glanced around, a chill ran its way down his spine. His wife of many years walked behind him oblivious, as she was pointing out herbs and the like to their young daughter, Ankhami. He was hoping to come to some sort of agreement with the High Priestess, about Ankhami. The initial talks had started. She would need to be put through the rites, and if found worthy, inducted as an Initiate. Smiling at his family, he shrugged off the feeling and looked back up the road. <br>
<br>
They were on their way back from a fair in the East Commonlands. Of course Elsaran was sent for a different purpose. As a rogue, he made an excellent spy. He committed all he heard and seen to memory to tell to the officials of Neriak. <br>
<br>
Some sixth sense warned him but his reactions were slow, having spent the last night of the fair in his cups and bedding his wife. He had seen no sleep, perhaps if he had, none of what happened next would have occurred. <br>
<br>
The forest had a few bands of Halflings, out to make trouble for the Teir’Dal. It was one of these bands that attacked the unwary party returning home. Taking out Elsaran first, using magic to immobilize him then quickly hacking his body to bits. Ankhami too young to understand stood frozen, as she saw the beloved form of her father struck down like a weed. Her mother’s hand was ripped from hers as she too was killed. Tears streamed down Ankhami’s small face as all she held dear was taken from her. <br>
<br>
Tying her hands behind her, the halflings then shoved her in a cart and drove away down the road from whence she had just came. The sight of her parents broken bodies on the path was to be imprinted in her mind for all time, as the cart took her further from her beloved Neriak. <br>
<br>
She could not understand a word they said, but knew from the gestures, and abusive treatment, that she was to be quite. The tears dried up, and her tiny heart hardened. Over the course of the next few weeks, her child like features became gaunt due to slow starvation, as the halflings hardly ever fed her and what they did give her was not fit for the lowliest slave in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak. Her clothing became filthy, and hair ratty and bug filled. <br>
<br>
Every day she put up with pinches and slaps if she was not fast enough with the tasks they made her do. Soon her beautiful indigo skin was cris crossed with black marks and scratches. One night one of the more foul men of the bunch came near her, in a drunken stupor he started jabbering at her, tired from hunger, and being worked like a pack mule every day, she was slow to respond. He reached through the bars and grabbed her shoulder, wrenching her towards him. She cut her head on the crossbeam that held her tiny cage together.<br>
<br>
She cried out, in anger, hurt and surprise. The tiny man did not like this. He let her go quickly and she stumbled back knocking her self out on the floor of her cage. Waking up the next morning she moaned softly. Her back held a few more lash marks, and her head throbbed. Rolling over she saw the filmy water and old bread that had been left for her. Not caring, she drank quickly from thirst and stuffed her mouth full of the hard bread. <br>
<br>
Soon they came to a city, and from the hustle and bustle she knew that it must be Freeport. Chained to the cart all she could do was endure the curses and pinches of those that passed. Her small jaw clenched in defiance. Sold at auction to a high powered High Elf, she was forced to then to travel to the lands of Faydwer. <br>
<br>
Days turned to weeks and weeks to months. Her grasp of the language had not increased and she remained stubborn to the last. Beatings were common and so was starvation. Her treatment, due to her lack of willingness was brutal. <br>
<br>
She was found, at last by the dark knight. Laying on a cot with blood covering her back. Small body shaking violently from fever. The Dark Knight swiftly did away with the house hold. Justice was swift and sure. Ankhami was carried back home, barely alive.<br>
<br>
Ankhami woke up to raw pain emanated from her back and head. She was on her stomach, in a dark room only lit with a single candle. Keeping her eyes closed, she focused on the pain, and slowly she willed the pain to lessen, bit by bit. As her mother had taught her. But before she could will the pain completely away, she passed out again. Drained of all energy. Her dreams were fitful, nightmares really, of small men hacking her parents to pieces. Of constant beatings at the hands of small men. Pale faces leering at her, mocking her. Strange tongues, loudly screaming at her. Lashes honing into her back. Pain. Hate. Fear.<br>
<br>
In the outer room two Teir’dal spoke softly about the young girl, no more than a babe. One was Ssinjin friend to her now dead parents. She had tracked and rescued the young girl in the other room. Had brought her almost lifeless body here to Spires of Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
The other was the High Priestess of Innoruuk. “She has a strong will, that one.” The Priestess spoke softly with a bit of pride.<br>
<br>
“If she lives can you train her? Both her parents were killed by a band of pecks out in the forest.” Ssinjin looked a bit worried. For one she was not used to being this close to the High Priest of her god, for another she remembered the awful ramblings of the small girl child. Damn the children of light. Damn that man.<br>
<br>
“If she can prove herself, it may be possible. Her father had come to me some time back, indicating that he wanted to pledge her to the guild. We had never had the chance to meet again and formalize the verbal agreement.” The Priestess looked expectantly at Ssinjin.<br>
<br>
Ssinjin stated boldly, “It is what he would have wanted. Cryso, her mother, had begun the initial training, for her entry in to the Guild. I know not how far along she was in her studies, as I was seldom home, war keeping me away.” She turned to look at the closed door, hearing a soft moan went to enter the priestess right behind her.<br>
<br>
The young girl on the bed was now sleeping. The nightmares shoved in to the recesses of her mind. The sweat, that had previously poured from her brow gone, as her fever had broke. Quietly the Priestess approached the bed and pulled down the sheet. Her back hours earlier had been bloody, with deep slashes from a whipping.<br>
<br>
Now the skin was all but healed, lighter markings showing where the wounds had been, some still with a scab but for the most part healed.<br>
<br>
Ssinjin exhaled sharply in surprised, the Priestess, looked at her back knowingly.<br>
<br>
“It appears that this girl child, is to be an Initiate, for none of us have yet to lay a healing hand on her.”<br>
<br>
She had prayed to her Father for revenge. And His answer was a gift in the form of healing. But more would come, her life was far from over…. <br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She entered the Conclave of the Damned shortly after she left the Spires of Innoruuk. Quickly she rose through the ranks, she had the power she coveted and yet she was blind to the plotting behind her back. Blind to the risk that even holy rites before the Father could be forsaken. Subtly thrown from power, only to see all she had worked for in the hands of another. All her sweat, her blood, her work - lost. <br>
<br>
She married shortly after, to the Lord Regent Hateborn’s younger brother Cyradus, found asylum with in The League of Shadows and stayed. Watched as Innoruuk took her husband from her, only to return him changed. Felt a change with in her as well, and hid that from the world. Time passed and she slowly grew heavy of heart, her soul longed for release. And in the blackness of the void, between one breath and the next, she found it.<br>
<br>
The goddess showed her that what was done had been for a reason. To show the young Priestess that power, love, hate were nothing if one did not have true direction. <br>
<br>
She stayed in the two rooms, hearing the words of the goddess for what seemed years. Seeing the past for what it was and not for what she thought it was. Now awake once more in the realms, she sought out the Harvesters of Darkness, the small family she knew would accept her as she was, and not as she had been. And she knew they needed her, something that Ankhami also needed, she was after all a priestess. To heal wounds, to help comfort, she had at one time been deemed Suliss or grace, it was her place to offer succor to those in need, and the Scythe with its recent losses were in need.<br>
