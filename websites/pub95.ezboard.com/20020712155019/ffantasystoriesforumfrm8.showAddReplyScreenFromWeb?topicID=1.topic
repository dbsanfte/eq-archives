<br>
It had been a good, long, twelve hour nap. It had to be dark by now...<br>
<br>
His pale, muscled back twisted as he turned to the black curtains that hung over his windows. Speaking a silent prayer to Loki, he drew back the curtains, and the deadly light struck him in the face.<br>
<br>
Soon, Crawf Riddle was blinded by the sun's agony, and his exposed skin smoldered. Vampirism was *not* all it was cracked up to be. Quickly grabbed the latch on his coffin, he half-closed it to block the light from his body. Looking down, he realized the white skin hadn't been burned at all. Crawf looked around the room, and laughed at himself.<br>
<br>
The moon was full.<br>
<br>
Regaining his composure, Crawf threw back his head and erupted in throaty laughter. He bent his wrists and stretched in a feline-like pose. He sagged at the shoulders and saundered out of the plain little room, still half asleep. The light brown floorboards creaked, and the entire apartment smelled of cheap champagne. Crawf remembered quickly the guest he'd brought back the night before; so beautiful, so delicious... so quick to take off her clothes...<br>
<br>
But the whorish habits of one woman didn't concern him, especially not when she was merely a meal. Crawf always attracted an uncountable number of women, and they always seemed all too eager to hop into bed with him. Passing by a mirror, from which no reflection showed, he wondered why. Running a hand through his long, white hair, he remembered the mind-games he played. Pretty simple, really, for one who expands their mind.<br>
<br>
In his white boxer shorts, Crawf walked down the dim halls. There were windows all around, all with curtains pulled back, that lit the hall with the eerie moonlight that Crawf was acustomed to. He smiled at the cross with a naked, thorn-crowned Jesus hanging above the mantle. He kept it as a reminder that no religion, righteous as they think they are, had any power over him. He also kept it because he liked the confusion in his victims' eyes when they were bitten. He always liked to do his dirty work right in front of the eyes of &quot;the Lord&quot;.<br>
<br>
Shuffling his lethargic feet towards the blanching refrigerator, he snorted. Crawf opened the door, and removed a bottle of wine and a fifth of Smirnoff. The wine bottle actually contained his drug-induced blood. He kept a fresh stock, loaded with caffiene, as he had a bit of a problem waking up sometimes. This was one of those days, despite the sun scare.<br>
<br>
He popped open the cork and downed a swig, then chased it down with a chug of vodka. Lolling his tongue out of his mouth and grunting at the intensity, Crawf returned the glass containers to their respectful places.<br>
<br>
The vampire looked out again. Full moon... great. More light, less places to hide. He always hated not being able to slink unseen effortlessly. Just because he had to try, however, did not, by any means, mean that he couldn't do it, and do it well. Crawf returned his thoughts to the present, and lit up a cigarette on the electric stove. White cabinets and walls were all so common in this part of Chicago, and Crawf hadn't really had time (more like motivation) to personalize it. The cedar stand for his record player, cd and dvd player, and the 54&quot; screen tv adorned the brick wall with Jesus so kindly protecting it. Crawf snorted his distaste, not for the man, but for the religion.<br>
<br>
From the kitchen, where stood an island that acted as a table and counter, Crawf flicked his fingers, then resumed to trimming his nails with the razor edges of his pearly whites. The television flickered to life, and the channels started changing simultaneously. It stopped on the news, where an old, white male reporter was talking with a representative from the Roman Catholic Church about the rape scandal. Crawf snickered to himself; 'bout damn TIME people caught on to that. He used the priest get-up to drain quite a few boys, and that's just speaking of the vampiric-hunger. He reminisced about the good old days when he and his fellow clergy men commited some of the most unspeakable acts of sexual indecency he'd ever experienced, even when running with other vampires!<br>
<br>
Crawf walked calmly to a closet. He pulled the light brown canvas trenchcoat, and threw it on the back of a white stool with a light brown seat to match the rest of the apartment. Taking his sweet time, he finally made his way back to his room, and lifted his 250lbs coffin like it was... well, like it was a 25 pound coffin, but you get the idea. The vampire dropped his plain, solid, deep stained oak sleeping place that was adorned with pictures, drawings, sigils, and various other magickal and spiritual workings.......... and autographed pictures of Slipknot, Mudvayne, Slyther, Mindless Self Indulgence, and a trove of other bands. Photographs of himself and dozens of artists and bands surrounded the room. Of all his centuries of life, Crawf was much more appreciative of this new age of technology and rock music. He caressed a bloodless hand over a picture of him and Bob Marley. If he could cry, a tear would have fell on his cold cheeks.<br>
<br>
Pushing the painful memory of the death of the one human he trusted, Crawf tore through dressers and piles of random things; books, magazines, a ritual altar stacked with candles, joints, and album covers, through various bottles of scents, colognes, potions, or chance mixtures, and a few other items of jewelry or perversion.<br>
<br>
Finally, he found it. Breathing a sigh of relief, the plain, chain-linked necklace of pure silver fell around his neck as it had millions of times before; it was almost as if there was a groove on his neck for it. From the chain dangled a golden crecent moon that neared a full circle with a ruby edge, and from small silver pegs that extended from the outer rim of gold sat a ruby drop, expertly cut as if to look like a drop of blood. He smiled as it glowed and warmed his cold body. After all, it's quite hard to seduce when one's body is as cold as the drink you buy her.<br>
<br>
Crawf rummaged through a few more drawers and piles, finally finding the pair of black slacks he'd been looking for. A white, button-down shirt was added, and a black overcoat over that.<br>
<br>
Time for church. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 12:06:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Holy Unholy</span><hr size=1> I love it! ~sniffles~ Mindless Self Indulgence ~sniffles~ Little Jimmy Urine, husband number 5. <br>
