Midnight or so, judging by shadows that crept in from the windows fearlessly. And there, at a desk, sat a rather colorful figure slumped over a keyboard. Every minute or two her hands would find their way to the keyboard and swiftly click away this message or that to a faceless box on her screen. A monitor illuminates her face just enough for her delicate features to glimmer through, not to be out done by her short icy blue hair. All who set eyes on her would have to admit she was a rather strange creature, what with unnatural hair color and odd clothing. Her pants were snug around her hips but by the time they reached the ground it would have fit around her entire body with inches to spare. Silver with baby blue accents here and there and a multitude of pockets for whatever your imagination desired. Phat pants. Raver attire. She wore a matching wife beater with the words &quot;Vitamin E&quot; airbrushed in blue and silver. She was curvy, with a medium sized bust and tiny waste. Attractive to say the least. So why then, is she sitting up late at night, typing away on the Internet? Dum… Dum… Dum… It caught her ear and forced her eyes towards the door. With a glance down at the right corner of her desktop the numbers “2:13 AM” showed idly in a think black font. Her breath was held captive in her lungs, as the beat grew steadily louder. A car door… A rap on the window… A whispered voice…<br>
“Zita… We’ll be out in the car… hurry up”<br>
<br>
She placed her palms down on the desk and pushed herself to a stand. She instinctively froze as a plastic bead bracelet tinkled against its wooden surface. Pressing her lips together, she slowly turned her head towards the wall behind her listening for any noises coming from the room within. Silence. With a noiseless sigh of relief she pressed the power button on the computer tower and then the monitors. Her heart was racing when her fragile hand reached out for her miniature backpack. A few glowing key chains clanked together from the lower pockets zipper. Her lungs tensed and her muscles were stiff. Gently holding onto the dangling key chains, she tiptoed her way to the front door. Her father knew she was going out tonight… so why was she so scared of waking him? Maybe because she knew what happened when you woke up Daddy… Fear brushed the back of her mind as she draped her light blue jacket with feathery trim on the hood over her shoulder and ever so carefully turned the doorknob. Slow… Easy… Quietly… Thank god they had turned down the stereo, she could barely hear the music now. Closing her eyes, she gulped down the terror in her throat. /Things are different now… things aren’t like they were with Mom. I can go, it’s all right… Just… Just do it. They’re waiting for you. Don’t you dare let them drive off. GO! / A gust of wind blew the door close and some how… she was on the other side. Her eyes focused on the ground and she tried to go over it in her head. Inside… Outside… Where’s the in-between?<br>
“Ziiiiitaaaaaaaaaaa! Come ON!” <br>
Crystal iris’s met that of ten others waiting anxiously in an old beat up 88 Buik ‘shaggin wagon’ that had been affectionately given the name “Mr. Wally’s Love bus”. The boy in front looked barely legal and was tall and lanky. The passenger sharing the front seat with him was shorter and had a tad bit of muscle definition in his arms. One girl in the back was a bit plump but tall, while the other was tall and average. The final member of their rave brigade was an all around average boy. All looked to be 16-17 years old with the driver being the oldest. All were brightly dressed and adorned a multitude of flashy bracelets and necklaces to match. <br>
A chorus of thrilled voices called out in less then perfect unison.<br>
“Zita!” <br>
With a giggle and a bounce, Zita rushed to the door, which was promptly opened for her and her things were thrown in. <br>
“Mooooove” was her whiny greeting as she shoved the boy in the backseat out of her way so she could crawl into what was supposed to be the trunk area. She took her pillow and blanket riddled seat very happily and poked her head out from between an auburn hair girl and orange haired boy. A sudden hit of the gas peddle nearly sent Zita to the back window, but her hands were quick to grab onto the seat back so only her torso was jolted backwards. The driver’s cackle was dripping with glee as he backed out of the driveway and began to speed off. <br>
“So where to, Kiddies?” <br>
“Disneyland!” cried the big blonde.<br>
“NO! Six flags!”<br>
“Yea, Six flags” Both of the boys seemed to be in agreement. <br>
“Who cares?”<br>
“Any ideas, Zita?”<br>
“Umm… actually…” <br>
Blue fingernails rifled through a dark pocket in a tiny backpack. Only a few seconds passed before a bright pink paper was produced from the lightless depths. It was handed up to the driver who took a quick glance and handed it to the boy next to him who took the liberty of reading it aloud.<br>
“Dreams of Light… 8th and Cyprus. 9pm-6am. Hey it’s free! Hmm… couple good Dj’s spinning. Hell why not, it’ll blow a few hours n it’s always nice to go to a party”<br>
“8th and Cyprus? That downtown?”<br>
“I think so”<br>
“Alright! Let’s go then!” <br>
In practically no time at all the driver had the car turned in the right direction and merged onto the freeway. It’d be another 45 minutes before they all could get out of the car. Zita didn’t mind though. Hal, the driver, turned up the volume to nearly max and Zita began to feel the reverberations of the bass throughout the car. A deep sigh escaped her nostrils and she laid her head against an unused portion of the seat back so she could get a glimpse past the blonde and out the window. Cars and trees masked in darkness were passed by and a lonely fence stuck to the side of the road. Why did so many metaphors on life have to do with roads? Sure, life was a journey, but what about the coffee houses and java huts just exits away, or the fence that seemed to be the same image repeated over with every foot that flew by. What of the hills that the fence stood in front of that the car never traveled, nor any other car for that matter. Her mind was going to stretch this thought farther, but a heavenly glow captured her attention. Sitting up, she turned herself. A glow stick!<br>
“D…” The orange haired boy was tapped on the shoulder. “D!” He looked at her. She leaned in close to his ear. “D… Would you give me a light show? Pleeeeeease?” <br>
Nothing was said, but he turned himself completely around so his body was facing hers and he began. With glow sticks strategically held in his hands he let the music guide his arms and movements in a display of lights and trails that held Zita in a trance. The rest of the world melted away and for the duration of his show all that existed was her mind, aura, the music, its aura, and the manifestation of those things into the glowing. The two other girls held a shouted conversation of their own, but Zita never even heard their strained voices. She couldn’t hear the tone in their voice or see their hand gestures. All that she was able to comprehend was the light, the music, and her being. The electronic melody encircled her body, slipped through her and took her to heights never known. The bass started first in her fingers and toes and slowly seeped through every pore in her body until it altered the beating of her heart and influenced her thoughts. No one could understand. No one could comprehend the feeling that was born inside her the moment the song peaked. And the moment it did, the show became twenty times as spectacular because D incorporated another light in with the already existing green one. Now four streams danced around before her eyes, feeding her soul along with an enchanting track from one of many cd’s in the changer. Slowly, the song blended into the next and the bass began to fade. It barely became audible but she still felt her heart pounding in her chest and her pulse was drumming through every inch of her body. A moment later the song softened and her ears fought to hear it. The lights mellowed out and their movements were slowed. In an instant the bass was louder then before and the song moved her from her own being and the lights seemed to all collide at that very second in time, and she felt… ecstasy. Just as the music had been regained and the show’s finale finished, she had been released. She was free, she was alive, she was fantastic, life was perfect. Her eyes sat focused on the space that the glow sticks had once occupied with a sublime sort of afterglow. This was what life was all about. Screw roads, screw metaphors. THAT was life, created, ended, lived.<br>
