<br>
Content Will be tested on the test server, and these servers, then we might get a good working version on our servers when it is all said and done.<br>
<br>
Items in our everquest will be named after people on the legends server, guess that's not much different than stuff being named after content_designer_001's daughters stuffed lizard named Sarnak.<br>
<br>
No accomplishment anyone achieves on a &quot;Legends&quot; server will be taken seriously at all. With most of eq at least we are all on even ground in terms of the items we can get and the customer service we endure. Is anyone gonna say <br>

This may have been true with EQ when it was originally released, but the three expansions have much more than doubled the amount of space in the game, which would make 3000 a reasonable number.  However, the general feeling is that Verant removed the server numbers to hide the fact the numbers were starting to decline.  Verant is very happy with 2000-2500 people active per server, and their equipment seems to deal with this very well.  (Dealing with 125-150 in a single zone is a different issue.)<br>
Also, I've seen the CS for Verant get much, much more responsive over time.  I'm not sure it's gotten that much better, since I have alwasy received an appropriate level of CS, it just used to take a lot longer to get a response.<br>

I do not like GM events as they are currently handled, so going to a server that had more of the current events is of little interest to me.<br>
<br>
But what if they actually did a complete and utter reversal of mindset on interacting with GM quests?  What if they ran tons of little one or two group encounters?  I.e. you run across some person asking for help and you do not know if it is a normal person or a GM?<br>
<br>
Going further what if they let it be known that anytime one of these mini quests turned into a huge event that the quest GM would just be scared off and leave?  <br>
<br>
Would it stop the tells to guild and other zones that result in the current mob scenes?<br>
<br>
Would it encourage everyone to be kinder to people asking for help, not knowing if it was a GM quest?<br>
<br>
Could not these same quests be done over and over with different groups of people?<br>

simple.<br>
<br>
The Luclin launch was FUBAR and still has many issues (crashes to desktop, broken quests, etc.)<br>
<br>
Old world quests are still in limbo. Shawls, tomb of ages, CC dwarfs faction, etc.<br>
<br>
A few Old world quests have &quot;just&quot; been fixed. ex; Kelithin-freeport mail.<br>
<br>
the new server will have &quot;expanding features&quot; and &quot;on going GM everns&quot; all promised to... plain old EQ. the $10 a month EQ not the $40 a month EQL.<br>
<br>
So the fact that VI/Sony are releaseing this new and improved version of EQ (and apparently ignoring the old) has left a bitter taste in some peoples mouth.<br>

I think the new service sounds great, and if it wasn't for the cost, I would probably do it.<br>
<br>
To the people who complain that they can't get the support that they want/need/deserve, volunteer and become a Guide. They are constantly looking for Guides. Why? Because the game is always expanding and Guiding can't be easy. I mean, just dealing with the normal problem that can happen, you have to deal with people who train the Guards and Bards to the North Freeport tunnels (When doing a corpse recovery for a friend, I heard one moron state, &quot;But it wouldn't be called a train if everybody liked it.&quot;), people who argue over the kill stealing of an Orc Centurian, and someone insisting that they get a rezz because they were killed when they when LD (because LD is &quot;obviously&quot; caused by Verant). ( see <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://tweety.bowlofmice.com/tweety/try_being_a_guide.html">Try Being a Guide</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> ). If you don't like the current level a service, become a Guide yourself ( <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/">Guide Application</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> ) In my two years (next month) of playing Everquest, I have only met one Guide I didn't much care for (and I saw his point, I just didn't agree with it). <br>
<br>
People complain of the quests (which I personally tend to avoid because of lag) is that if they are part of a story, some people go out of their way to ruin it for those of us that would like to watch. If it is a kill-fest quest, people complain about that too. What kind of quest do you want? How should it be implimented. Instead of complaining, why can't people use the /feedback command?<br>
<br>
From what was said, some of these features may trickle to the normal server. That would be great. Weither it does or doesn't isn't really important to me. Even with any faults with the game, I still like Everquest and I still play five nights a week. <p><BR>

This is the bait and switch to which I refer. Marketing materials from the launch of Everquest and subsequent materials from Velious and SoL expansions have all intimated this premium service level. In reality, it has never existed. Now it will.... but it is going to cost you an extra $30 a month if you want it. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, the legal definition of 'bait and switch' doesn't rely upon common interpretation. <br>

<br>
Let me give you an example.<br>
<br>
You call your local dealer and tell him you want a dimebag of MJ. He tells you it'll cost you $50 and it'll be there in an hour. An hour goes by and no one shows up, another hour goes by and you strat getting impatient soon the withdrawl starts and you get frustrated. Finally after 4 and a half hour the delivery guy shows up, but he tells you there's a new service charge and your weed will cost you $100 now. But you pay it despite the fact taht he was 3 and a half hours late and double the price at the door, because once the weed is flowing in your veins, you don't care anymore.<br>
<br>
Verant knows they have us hooked for life, we've had several chances to jump ship. Asheron's, AO, DAOC, but we stayed. They have a superior product and they know it. Hence people calling the game Evercrack. Once Luclin went live it took me a month to get it working properly and I still have no sound, but I still play, cause I am fully addicted.<br>
<br>
The Legends server is just a way for them to pump their profits even more. I don't think Gart realizes that if they weren't making a profit on this game they would have shut it down 2 years ago. Believe me, they are making a profit. Legends server will cost them twice as much to run, but they will be charinging 4 times as much to play there, hence they have doubled their profits. And people will play there because if EQ is weed, the legends server is weed, laced with heroin.<br>
<br>
I think that sums everything up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uscantilyclad0wnsj00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScantilyClad0wnsj00</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/4/02 4:31:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: EQ Legends servers.</span><hr size=1> Rumenia, dimebag = $10.

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

Its called &quot;the American Dream&quot; and they are working it.<br>
<br>
Everyone saying they need to focus on current bug fixes before they go off and do stuff like this.  Did anyone read the transcripts at the Dallas Fan Faire?  They have people working on those fixes, things like the bazaar, crashes to desktops among other things.  You see at least in my experience if you are programming, its better to keep a one man, or a small team working on each individual problem, which is what it sounds like they are doing.  They (key phrase here) HIRED more people to work on the legends solution.  This means that all those people currently working on the existing problems are STILL working on them.  Throwing more people at the same problem isn't necessarily going to fix the problem.  It would probably just add confussion, as one programmer would know what he has been doing, and what needs to be done, and he can take his time coding it.  There are some problems that they could throw more people at and probably fix faster, but oh well.  We still have GM run events, so they aren't lying about what the box says.  They are still adding new content all the time so the box again states the truth.  Now how frequently those things occur, well if they aren't up to snuff with you.  Then quit the game, go buy DAoC, or go buy some D&amp;D boooks, and create your own campaign.  <br>
<br>
Trying to please 400,000+ people is an impossibility.  And I think so far they have done a great job, at least to me and my friends.  Contrary to what some say, I have found the Customer Service to be great.  I have had items restored, I have gotten GM Rez's, and for the most part speedy responses too all my /petitions.   <p>Bumbaz Tanx <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45646">Profile</a> <br> Dakin Drayklore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46166">Profile</a> <br>Saore <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46017">Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukininiakilmore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KininiaKilmore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/5/02 8:08:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://content.communities.msn.com/isapi/fetch.dll?action=MyPhotos_GetPubPhoto&photoId=nJgAAAP0LUL2YkcQTYiJ5x3AKZQ9Pp3y70cvmoAs3Vj0DB4wRktibmE1FJZUBlo WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: EQ Legends servers.</span><hr size=1> Hmm Arolpin are you sure of this.

<br>
As for the whining issue several of you have stated.  VI/Sony knows you can never please 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time.<br>
<br>
If you have had good customer service then great.  As for me it took me three months of sniffer reports to show them they had a problem on their network.  Fortunately the problem has been fixed.<br>

When I have a mission, it consumes me; I will not be satisfied until the job is done. I have a strong sense of duty, and a strong sense of direction. Changes in the tide don't phase me - I always know which way the wind blows, and I know how to compensate for it.

and as far as cost, compaired to other online game services(which most dont come close to the scale of everquest), most of them only make about a 5 percent profit(money that can be used for things other then what is required to keep the service going) off of the monthly fees.  we might pay 10 dollars a month, but to keep all the networks going, electricity, leasing space(etc. etc. all that stuff we dont know about) they might only get maybe 50 cents, which brings that 4 million figure down to a maybe 200,000.  which seems like a lot, but this money has be be put towards everything they might want to develope.<br>
anyway though, just wasteing time before my next class<br>
