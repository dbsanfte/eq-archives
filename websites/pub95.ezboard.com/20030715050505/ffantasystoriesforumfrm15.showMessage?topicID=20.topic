Chapter 2<br>
<br>
&quot;Mysteries Revealed&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus's Grandfather snorted, even his own son had never been this much trouble, but perhaps that was the price of taking on a youngster like this. Well it was either train the boy himself, or let the only other person capable of using their gifts train him, and at the moment that wasn't exactly to high on his list of things to wish for. The old man simply smiled as he seen Magus was having a nightmare, this would have to be punishment enough until he woke up.<br>
<br>
The nightmare was simple enough for Magus, before him in his acursed dream lay the temple in ruins, blood covering the ground as well as his own hands. He had caused all the destruction and death simply because he had something he never truly wanted. An unimaginable power, the likes of which mortals should never have, soon enough he awoke screaming in horror.<br>
<br>
&quot;And that my dear boy is what could happen if you don't learn what I have to teach.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing ever is private around this place from you is it...&quot;, Magus frowned, his grandather was so watchful sometimes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember, your training is to prepare you for the future, so how did you get hurt this time? Did some damsel catch you spying on her?&quot;, Magus's grandfather chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you stop pestering the boy, besides he has a visitor, some brunette is here to see him, she has the oddest amber eyes though.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus turned as white as a sheet, it couldn't be her, she was probably long gone already, but sure enough to his horror it was her. What lay in store for him was unexpected, let alone even possible. He was about to be surprised far more so than he had ever been in his life.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh is this his room!&quot;<br>
<br>
The young girl rushed into the room and leapt on Magus, feigning her emotions with empty tears of joy. Of course this sent chills down the young mans spine, here was the very woman who tried to kill him last night. Worse yet, he was in no shape to defend himself if she decided to enact her so called threat from the night before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my hero, I can't thank him enough for beating all those scary gnolls for me last night!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I... Eerr... That is... I uh....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh is that how he got hurt, well if thats the case all is forgiven grandson.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you be quiet and shut up... Make one wrong move now and I'll tear you apart.&quot;, the woman whispered into Magus's ear with a smirk.<br>
<br>
The old man smiled at his grandson, and along with his grandmother left the room. He had heard all that the woman had said, he knew the truth all to well, the only thing he really didn't know about was the woman true intentions. She had a eerie calmness about her, and was much stronger than she looked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you here to try and kill me again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that thought did cross my mind, except I know nothing of this world.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So in return for helping you out I suppose I keep my life?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right cutie pie!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus shived, this woman or whatever it was certainly was strange. He simply couldn't figure her out, one minute she was ready to kill him and the next she was asking for his help. Those things didn't matter how as he heard his grandfather calling out for him to come to practice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hurry up boy! It's time for sword practice!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Ka.......&quot;<br>
<br>
In a instant Magus was up and running down the hall, leaving the woman sprawled out across the floor with footprints on her face. He enjoyed nothing more than sword practice, it was the only thing he really felt he was good at. His grandfather knew he had a natural talent for the sword, but also he knew Magus would need a great many skills to survive in life, which is why he insisted on teaching him the hand to hand skills that monks all had to learn.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready grandfather!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus grabbed a hold of his wooden practice sword and took his stance as his grandfather did the same. Both stood there smiling at each other, one waiting for the other to begin the spar. Neither noticed the young woman who stormed into the room with the fresh foot imprints on her face from Magus, that is until she began mocking the young man's stance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your kidding right? I could of sworn you where a better swordsman.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well young lady if you wish why don't you spar against Magus here.&quot;, the old man smiled, he was going to lure her into showing him what she was capable of.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd be glad to, and please, call me Kayla.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla smirked as the old man tossed her his practice sword, she was going to humiliate Magus infront of his grandfather. She made the first move, lunging forward and aiming the tip of the wooden sword at Magus's ribs. The tip only connect with air as Magus moved to the side and brought his own practice down across her extended arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch that hurt, You jerk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well at least we know I'm a better than you at using a sword.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla moved in to attack again, the sound of wood striking wood was heard as Magus countered her attack. All the old man could do was smile as he watched the two launch attack after attack at each other. Neither where gaining much advantage over each other, which pleased the old man greatly. The least he could do was teach his grandson how to become a great fighter.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm surprised, she's a pretty good sword fighter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus grandmother smiled as she came through the door way and watch the two spar. She could tell her grandson had definitely improved since he'd came to stay at the shrine. Right off it was evident he had a skill for the sword, and whether he knew it or not she could tell his unarmed skills where just as good. Still the fact that the young man constantly held back his talent was disturbing to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;This spar would done be over if he would just stop holding back&quot;, Magus's grandfather sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean to tell he's holding back?!&quot;, Kayla narrowed her eyes at Magus.<br>
<br>
The young woman felt insulted, and more so since he was keeping up with her attacks. There also remained the fact that he had definitely managed to hurt her the previous night. That didn't settle well with her at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right you want to play, fine then I'll just play too!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla giggled and disappeared from sight, leaving Magus gawking and dumbfounded at what just happened. All Magus's grandfather could do was laugh, mainly because this was going to be a practice the young man would never forget. It was then that Kayla's form appeared behind Magus, and then she landed a mana charged fist into his jaw just as he began to turn around to face her.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell was that for?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That was for making me look like a pushover!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus's eyes narrowed as they settled on Kayla, he was gingerly rubbing the whelp left behind from her fist. It was then that his grandfather decided to give the young man some advice. It was just what he needed to settle the playing field since Kayla had taken the spar to another level.<br>
<br>
&quot;Magus just keep calm, today's lesson was to teach you how to harness your power.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like thats going to help me now!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, then you can figure it out on your own.&quot;<br>
<br>
It didn't take long before Kayla was on the attack again. It was taking all Magus had to dodge her sword strikes as well as her glowing fists. He was back up against a wall now and knew the only way he would manage to get out this one would be to try and learn what his grandfather was going to teach him this day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay I'm sorry, just tell me what to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's simple, just hold out your hands, relax your muscles and stop holding back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's all?&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus flipped backwards, and hand springed away from Kayla, he knew he was going to need some distance. Kayla just laughed, she couldn't feel him gathering any kind of mana at all, of course she thought he used mana just the same as she did. Though soon her confidence faded as a small glowing orb formed in front of the young mans out stretched hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wouldn't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes I would!&quot;<br>
<br>
The orb exploded into flames and shot forward, landing at the floor in front of Kayla and formed a spiral of flames that engulfed her form. Naturally her wooden practice sword was burnt to a crisp. However, the sight that came next was one that Magus would never forget.<br>
<br>
&quot;You jerk you just burnt all my clothes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla made a feeble attempt at covering herself, the flames had indeed burnt her clothes away and left her standing nude infront of everyone. All Magus could do was stare, and all his grandmother could do was cover his grandfathers eyes. Needless to say the old man was laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you certainly do have a way of messing things up, might I suggest running?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh...&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus wasn't paying any attention at all to what his grandfather said. He did pay attention to the fact that his grandmother had tossed a robe to Kayla, who in a frenzy wrapped the clothing around herself. That was his que to run, which he did as fast as he could out of the room with Kayla in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come back here! I'm gonna make you pay for that one!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm flat broke can you put it on my tab?!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Cain smiled, he had been working many years on this project. He'd gotten the idea from the Exodus sword he had been responsible for creating, and it was astounding. A sentient suit of armor, he had dreamed it and had worked many years to bring it into existence, or rather the crystal that would create it.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, what do you wish to be called?&quot;<br>
<br>
The crystal simply pulsed a few times in the vat of solution infront of Cain. At first glance it just seemed like a pendant, but the material it was made of was like nothing the world has seen before. The old man had no idea just what the armor it could summon was capable of. The ancient text he studied mentioned something of some sort of evil King of the undead having a metal armor of unimaginable power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well my friend, what should I call you?&quot;<br>
<br>
- Cy.......rus..... -<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I got you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AHHHH!&quot;, Magus screamed as he was tackled to the ground.<br>
<br>
Sure enough Kayla had caught him and now he was at her mercy, or would have been had not her robe came open, giving the young man a stunning show. As any man would, all he could was stare. Most of the time he had to catch whatever glimpse he could of women he could while doing services for his great grandfather, this was different though.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep, those are real!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kayla slapped Magus as hard as she could, leaving a red whelp across his cheek as she fumbled to close the robe again. With that Magus shoved her off and scrambled to his feet, dashing for the doorway. Much to his surprise he ran face first into the breastplate of none other than a guard from Qeynos.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm here to take you in Magus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus's grandfather stepped out into view, he wasn't very fond of the Qeynos guards. Of course from past experience they where not fond of the old man either. To this day the new recruits are told stories of just what the old shrine keeper was capable of in a battle. After all, as they liked to say, its not wise to tease a snake that's already given it's enemy a clear warning.<br>
<br>
&quot;This young man was caught in the young lady Bayles room last evening.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that so? Are you certain it was him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We have arrested anyone who fits the description, the young lady intends to pick the one who broke into her room out from the group.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see, well then instead of you taking him why don't you go on about your business and tomorrow we'll come to town. You see he still has chores to do around the temple here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I must insist that he come with me...&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man glared at the guard with an icy stare. Not many guards had the nerve or the guts to come out to the temple. However, the ones that did had a bad tendency of believing themselves to be all superior. It was then that the old man smiled, he had an idea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you remember a story about three fighters who destroyed Crow's Pub many years ago...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I do, but what does that matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It matters because I was one of the three who did that...&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard stared wide eyed at the elder man before him, he couldn't believe what he heard. Surely anyone with that kind of strength could easily handle himself and several other guards still even for being an old man. It was then that guard decided to make his decision.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, come to the city tomorrow...&quot;<br>
<br>
At that the guard rushed out of the temple, scared for his life. The reason being was that the three fighters where said to have been demons. Perhaps some sort of monster, but that was the rumors at least, and today was the day he didn't want to find out if they where true or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Magus, it looks like your in more trouble than you bargained for...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
What does fate have in store for Magus, and more importantly what is this mysterious armor hidden by the power of the crystal calling itself Cyrus? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=20.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=20.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.threadControl?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm15>Stories by:  Shoken</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
