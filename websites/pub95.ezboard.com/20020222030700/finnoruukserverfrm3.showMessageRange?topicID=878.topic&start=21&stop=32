I use the purple all the time, as I get tells for ports, buffs across continents.  Heck.  Had a tell from someone in LGuk if I wanted to buy something from him.  I was in EJ that day.

And the song from which this name was derived shows an example of the type of personality Allyssia has.  She enjoys running around and helping others out and requires lots of attention as she was not given enough as a young child.  She is full of giggles and smiles and has somewhat of an innocent quality to her, though most know she is more mature than most. <br>

Choco Bravehard<br>
Race  Human<br>
Age  55<br>
Alignment  Lawful Good<br>
Home city  Qeynos<br>
Occupation  Paladin<br>
<br>
Family<br>
Born into a modest family of coal miners, he and his younger brother were well loved.  But on one particular day, all the two boys loved and knew would change.  As the family travelled through the vast plains of West Karana, bandits set upon the family, killing their parents.  Fortunately for the boys, they had wandered off, and their lives were spared.  Unfortunately,  at the site of their dead parents, both boys had to grow up before their time.  Choco, being the older of the two, took on the responsbility of guiding his sibling to safety.  For days, the boys wandered, sleeping under trees at night, and resting frequently by day.  The boys soon began to show signs of dehydration and were growing weak.  On the day the boys surely would have perished, a band of men in gleaming armor of silver and blue happened upon them and brought them back to Qeynos.  The clerics nursed the boys to health, and the warriors saw a fire in the older boys eyes, and decided to train him in the ways of a fighter.  But, it would not last.<br>
Choco was a very skilled warrior, probably better than most the warriors had ever seen from such a young man.  But on one of his training sessions, things got a little out of control, and Choco's opponent became too aggressive in their lesson, and Choco had to fight for his life.  His opponent began to weaken and fell to the ground near death.  Before the other warriors could react, Choco did a remarkable thing.  He touched the dying man, and his health returned.  The warriors then knew this man was destined for a higher purpose.<br>
<br>
Religion<br>
Karana<br>
His parents worshiped The Rainmaker, and raised their sons likewise.  When it was discovered by the warriors of this natural ability, they knew he needed more schooling than they could give.  So at the age of 15, his schooling in the ways of a holy crusader began.<br>
<br>
Personality<br>
Choco is very adventurous and daring.  He will often take challenges and dares from people.  He will also charge headlong into situations, just to see what might happen, often putting his life in peril, and he enjoys that thrill of danger.  He has learned to be more cautious after he met the love his life, because he knows that to endanger himself needlessly will make his beautiful wife, Lenore, a widow, and he cherishes her too much to hurt her that way.<br>

Race  Human<br>
Age  50<br>
Alignment  Neutral Good<br>
Home city  Qeynos<br>
Occupation  Cleric<br>
<br>
Family<br>
He and his older brother were orphaned when he was an infant and his brother was five.  When the men who found them brought them to Qeynos, the clerics kept Heili with them, and raised him.  By the time Heili was 10, he showed signs of being a true healer.  He was definately more studious of the two boys, and not nearly as rowdy as his older sibling.  But, both boys were favorites of both the warriors and paladins and clerics and they fondly called them The Children of Thunder.  <br>
<br>
Religion<br>
Karana<br>
Like his older brother, he believed in The Rainmaker, and the clerics reintilled that belief in his teachings.  <br>
<br>
Personalty<br>
Heili is a bit more genteel than his brother, but he isn't passive either.  He has a wicked sense of humor which clashes with people's first impressions about him.  Heili is more cautious and less likely to dive headfirst into danger.  He leaves that job to his wife, Elishia.  He has learned to adjust to Elishia's strong sense of justice, and has adopted her quests as his own, sometimes to the chagrin of his wife, who would rather partake those alone rather than have him endanger his life on one of her sometimes dangerous quests.<br>
<br>
Summary of Heili<br>

Race  Ogre<br>
Age  35<br>
Alignment  Neutral<br>
Home city  Ogguk<br>
Occupation  Shaman<br>
<br>
Family history<br>
His family could almost be categorized as elite.  His mother was an exhaulted warrior, skilled and hailed as the greatest, past or present, in the history of Ogguk.  His father was a highly revered shaman, as most residents sought him out for his infinte wisdom and his magic and renowned potions.  At a young age, he showed promise in the magics of the spirits, and his father taught him all he knows.  Gug's home life could probably be best described as happy and uneventful, with no strife.<br>
<br>
Religion<br>
Rallos Zek<br>
To worship any other God than Rallos Zek could almost be punishable by death.  After all, Rallos Zek is the One, and champion and creator of all Ogres and their kin, though very distantly, giants.  As Gug began to wander away from the safety and comfort of his home, the Ferrott, and explore the outside world, visions of his destiny was revealed to him by Rallos Zek.  He found it strange his god wanted him to seek out a human, also a child of his choosing, and form a union with her.  It was not in vain.  He grew to love his little human, Jolene, and made her his mate for life in the ogre tradition.  He carried her away to his home.<br>
<br>
Personality<br>
Despite his size, and intimidating looks, he is really gentle and fun-loving.  He loves to play, almost like an overgrown child, which endears him to all who meet him.  Even though he cannot travel safely to most cities like his beloved mate can, he did manage to convince the Halflings he was not as bad as they were led to believe. And sometimes, you will find him exchanging jokes with the patrolling guards of Rivervale and guards in the surrounding forests of Misty Thicket.<br>

Fun-loving yet serious about his duties as a mystic of Rallos Zek<br>

Home city  Paineel<br>
Occupation  Heretic (Necromancer)<br>
<br>
Family<br>
Born in Paineel to both parents trained in Necromancy, he was expected to learn the ways of death and its inner mechanics.  Although he secretly despised it, he continued.  And when the opportunity arose to leave Paineel, he did, and seldom looks back.  He will not talk about that part of his life to many people other than his wife, Zianya and his immediate family, consisting of Zianya's sister Elishia, Elishia's husband Heili,  Heili's brother Choco, and Choco's wife, Lenore.<br>
<br>
Religion<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
A reluctant follower of The Faceless, he does as he pleases.  He may not be a practicing Cazic Thulean, but he does have a healthy respect for him.<br>
<br>
Personality<br>
While his whole universe is centered on death and the manipulation of the dead, he has chosen his enemies carefully.  He does not senslessly slaughter innocents to feed his ever insatiable hunger for the life force of said innocents.  And while he may not be overly happy with his forced lifestyle, he cannot walk away from it, as it has been a part of him for so long.  So, he reluctantly accepts his lot in life.<br>

Race: Half Elf<br>
Age: Unknown<br>
Birthplace: Unknown<br>
Alignment: Chaotic, Neutral<br>
Class: Rogue Mercenary<br>
<br>
_______Brief History_______<br>
<br>
Family: Her mother was a woodelf and she herself was being raised in Greater Faydark during the time of the Crushbone raids (prior to them being driven back into Crushbone as they are now). At that time many of the elven families lived under the city of Kelethin and under it's protection (notice the lack of anything residential up in Kelethin itself). During a strong attack upon Kelethin itself almost all of the homes of the citizens of Faydark were destroyed and hundreds of elves perished, including her own mother. Korinna was discovered by a scout, but left them and Kelethin behind disinterested in the war. It was though the first she had heard of Bristlebane, but they weren't the best of words towards him. Korinna also never knew her father.<br>
<br>
Religion: Having endured most harships of her youth by herself, she has never relied upon anyone else, including gods. She does though find some solace in stories of Bristlebane, and has always though that he would consider any of his religious zealots suckers ripe for the picking.<br>
<br>
Personality: Generally unwanted socially in most cities for being a half elf, she found the few places she was accepted in was rough bars, often visited by societies worst. Besides learning about this lifestyle, she also found solace from her rejection in the bottle, which are sad times she hates to remember. Today though, she is a light hearted lass, though one would be delussional to think she risks her neck for the good of man. Even her admirers know she carves personal gains in addition to her desires to thwart danger. She has been known to do great deeds for no to little reward. She does ask politely for them to keep quiet about it; she would hate for other mercenaries to think she's gone soft. She has finally found the aceptance of others, which has helped turn her dour attitude into a much more flirty one-ask anyone who knows her.<br>

Race: Wood Elf<br>
Age: 182, give or take<br>
Birthplace: Kelethin<br>
Alignment: Neutral Good<br>
Class: Druid<br>
<br>
Brief History:<br>
Born in the elven city of Kelethin and dedicated to the service of Tunare at a young age, Samira was happy enough with her lot in life <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> except</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that she truly hated living in the tree city. Unlike her more graceful siblings and friends, little Samira had an unfortunate tendency to... well... fall. Her mother, a druidess of some renown, did her best to keep her daughter safely protected with a levitation spell, but to no avail. Ultimately it was decided that the young elf must leave home for her own protection as well as to follow the destiny that awaited her. While she goes home for the occasional visit (and can and does lev herself the entire time), she has never regretted that decision.<br>
<br>
Religion: <br>
Samira is a devout follower of Tunare, and understands well that her responsibility sometimes requires that she dispatch creatures in order to restore the balance. While this is not her favorite duty she accepts the necessity and derives satisfaction from the resulting restoration of balance.<br>
<br>
Personality:<br>
Samira can find humor in nearly any situation, and is very tolerant of other races. She is generous and kind, slow to anger and quick to forgive. This occasionally lulls others into believing her weak and foolish; but no matter. She well understands that kindness and joy are needed to offset the continuing violence that is sadly required to keep the forces of evil in check in Norrath.<br>
<br>

Race: Half Elf<br>
Age: 208 (Mar. 26, 1999)<br>
Alignment: LG<br>
Home City: Kelethin<br>
Class: Ranger<br>
<br>
Family:<br>
<br>
No one expected that a female, wood elven druid, who was part of a trade mission to Freeport, and a young, human guard of NFP would meet, and fall in love.  When the trade mission returned to Kelethin, the young newlyweds settled down to a life in the tree city.  As their male child Gregar grew, he recieved training in magic from his mother, and weapons training from his father and an old Dwarven battlemaster named Dunarch.  No one blamed Gregar's father for not being on another, later trade mission.  He was sick with a fever.  When the orcs attacked, his strong swordarm was not there to defend the mission.  No one blamed him, but himself.  It was not long after that he and Dunarch left late at night to go into Greater Fay and rid the world of orcs entirely.<br>
<br>
After achieving manhood, Gregar came to know the other founders of the Ridgerunners, who became his family in Norrath.  After meeting and falling deeply in love with Lace the bard, they married and had two children, Jarabani and Grimgrash, named after their godfathers, Jaraxel Arabani and Grashnak Grimbreath.<br>
<br>
Religion:<br>
<br>
A Kelethin ranger and his wife took the young child in, and were aided by the druids of Kelethin in raising him.  It is no surprise he worships Tunare so devoutly.<br>
  <br>
Personality:<br>
<br>
He hates orcs, all orcs, passionately.  His association with the RR's from the birth of the guild fits his intense desire to be fairhanded, pleasant, and a good neighbor to all he meets in Norrath.  His mother often joked that Gregar is short for gregarious.  He enjoys a good discussion, a night of adventure or exploration, or sometimes a night of  fishing.  He tries to be a positive force in Norrath, most especially for the youngest in Norrath.  He believes strongly in the RR mandate to help others, and feels a small kindness will come back to you a thousandfold during your life.<br>
<br>
In A Nutshell:  <br>
<br>
&quot;If we're going to do it simply because it will be FUN, count me in.&quot;<br>

I never ment to ignore you...  but here is what you wanted to know..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Exedeus Dela'Rosa</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Race</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> = Woodelf Ranger<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Age</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 172yrs<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Alignment</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Neutral Good<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Home city</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Born in Kelethin, but the lands of Norrath is his home, forever the wanderer..<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Occupation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Guardian of Nature, a Ranger..<br>
<br>
Family life<br>
Exedeus lost his family since he was small.. little to him is known about his mother, she did not survive childbirth.. His father raised him  and guided him the ways of the Ranger until his age of 15, to whom hence Lanys, daughter of Innoruuk ordered his father slain and soul imprisoned. Exedeus started his epical journey to save what little remained of his father, to whom, after placing revenge upon the General V'deer after a tremendous battle... has released his fathers soul. Tunare, seeing this act, has bestowed his fathers soul within his to heal and strengthen within time. But thus, Innoruuk too has played his cards , and has tainted a dark curse to his fathers spirit, as part of his ultimate plan to plague Norrath with evil spirits. Thus it is upon Exedeus to confront the inner evil and save his fathers will from this curse, as well as his own fate if he fails. <br>
<br>
Religion<br>
Exedeus follows the way of Tunare, and the protector of the lands of Norrath. After his ordeal with the evil of Innoruuk, he journeys a spiritual life to where he must perseveer over his fathers evil curse. He now follows a path of love and compassion.. or suffer the fate of losing himself to the ways of evil. <br>
<br>
Personality<br>
Exedeus has gone through changes in his personality, after his final battle to save what remained of his father, he has turned to a longer, more dificult inner journey to which he will dedicate his life to.. A journey on the strength and spiritualness of love. He is a calm, relaxed and tries to be positive and caring. A good listener and devoted to his true friends. A poet by heart, his passtime is writing poetry.. He is mischevious at times, tries to be content amungst his peers. <br>
<br>
Strengths<br>
Very loving and compassionate, for his undying love for those he cares for will give hims strength and will. He is a listener, and one to hold a friends hand when needed. Able to make the sorrowfull smile, and sacrifice much for those he loves.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses<br>
True unconditional love is a hard sacrifice, for such he can be easily hurt.. and has in the past. For this he is very selective and carefull for whom he trusts. He is a loner.. and at times can be quiet or uncomfortable around too many people. Most dificult step is to love his enemies, even if they have hurt him in the past. So curving his inner hate is becoming a challenge<br>
