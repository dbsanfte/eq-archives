Hitting a Wisp only to find out that a Bronze weapon wouldn't hurt it.  Seeing my first Cyclops die.  Seeing a HG running at you (man they were fast).  Showing a Paladin how a Necromancer can kill a Griffawn.  The boards were full of people talking about new MOB's they had killed.<br>
<br>
Then Kunark came out, and it was neat (at first).  The factions system SUCKS, but new zones, etc., etc.  But the talk now wasn't about new MOB's, it was about new drops.  I didn't hear &quot;We killed this guy, he had this many HP and hit this hard&quot;.  I heard &quot;Wow, look at this L33t I got from some MOB&quot;.<br>
<br>
Velious more or less the same, other then insane MR and insane HP.  So for Luclin?<br>
<br>
Tons of new drops.  New zones, to be sure.  But I don't see people caring about what the new MOB's are like.  I don't see people caring about what the new zones look like.  Almost all I hear is about the new drops.  This is not the game I loved.  My heart belonged to the adventure, and to my friends.  And while many of my friends are still around, they were all I was playing the game for.  And I will no longer play a game I don't enjoy, even though I will miss our time together.<br>
<br>
<br>
/salutes<br>
<br>
The pre-Ebay Pudgie.  From finding out that GSF in BB were the way to make serious cash (almost 5GP apiece!), to tracking Centaurs.  That was when the world was young, and we felt that way as well.<br>
<br>
Kafin/Xambu.  What more can I say my friend?  Not even sure you'll ever read this since you've been gone for a bit.<br>
<br>
Firien the FD Ranger.  The person who led by example to show what selflessness and friendship were all about in the game.  You had fun even though you played a Ranger.  You have my e-mail address B., please don't hesitate to use it.<br>
<br>
Gona/Kat.  Again, the epitomy of selflessness and friendship.  hunting with you will be something I will miss.<br>
<br>
Ulskun.  I am ashamed to tell you I am leaving.  Whenever you have asked, I have been there for you.  I'm sorry, but that time has ended.<br>
<br>
Badjuju.  The Ogre who taught me how a Shaman/Warrior combo kites (generally by the Shammie dotting and sitting on his considerable rear).  I'll always remember the Ogre who jiggles when he giggles : )<br>
<br>
Gorilla.  Yes, at L12 Roror IS that red.  &lt;sigh&gt;, when's the last time we tried something like that?<br>
<br>
Nesstar.  My first EQ love.  You looked GREAT once you took off those leggings in the Feerott.  Too bad them Lizards kept spawning on top of the temples and interrupting us : P<br>
<br>
Xiola.  You will always be my Queen.<br>
<br>
Siphir.  We never ended up getting hitched in DN like we talked about.  I guess me and Dr00ds never work out, do they?<br>
<br>
Flak.  You gave me the inspiration to ask the question: &quot;How many times you gonna CH my corpse?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Koram.  Dang bro, so many EQ lives we've shared together.  I found some prety fun Goth bars downtown last weekend, maybe I'll drag you out there sometime.<br>
<br>
Dourgut.  Someone who's character makes Pigpen from Peanuts look as clean as the head in basic training.<br>
<br>
Dyrlia and Denina.  Yes, I do have you on my blocked senders list for my e-mail.  But I want to thank you for all the times we shared in-game, I miss those days.<br>
<br>
Requem.  Et Tu, Requem?<br>
<br>
So many others from the Dragonguard and other places to add, I don't even know where to start.  So I won't, but know I will miss you all.<br>
<br>
<br>
/waves<br>
<br>
Wolfypaw.  I don't think I would get along with you well in RL.  But I do admire your convictions (misguided as they are), and all of the work you have done for these boards is not unappreciated by me.<br>
<br>
Denross.  I have never seen a Bard played as well as you by any other Paladin.<br>
<br>
Aldrin.  I hope for more wisdom for you, my friend.  My mother gave up her cemetary plot so I could bury my daughter there next to my father who has been there for many years; when I was commenting on your loss, some of it was from perspective.  I hope you can find peace with your loss as I have with the many losses I have had.<br>
<br>
<br>
/salutes with one finger<br>
<br>
Aithne.  I still find it amazing that all you can think about in this game is money and gear.  Not everything in this game is for sale, even now.<br>
<br>
Kaurik.  You know, I can understand different reasons people have for playing this game.  But I will admit I have never gotten anything useful out of any of your IG actions or posts on these boards.  You sux0rs.<br>
<br>
Malcore.  Someday you will understand that you can be L60 with great gear and still be a loser.  It'll come to you someday when you look in a mirror closely.<br>
<br>
There are many I could add to this last column, but most of us know them for who they are.<br>
<br>
Take care all.  I also want to add a special memory for the person behind Chrisiana.  She was a special soul, and even though I knew her for but a brief time I am a better person for it.<br>

This was early this summer, back when Jeisenne was still a level 40ish something unknown, and she looked at all of Norrath with wide-eyed innocence.  Those days are all but gone now, and although there's so much more left for me to see and explore, I don't know if I can do it.<br>

Everytime I ran into you in game, that encounter is what I always thought of.<br>

<br>
Best Wishes my friend, your mouth may not always have said the right things but your heart was always in the right place. The days that you speak of are long gone and EQ will find its place in those that continue to play.<br>
<br>
For myself, the adventures and good times that we shared so many months ago will not be forgotten. Our first Dragonguard raid, my first raid deaths to the Griffon and HG in West Commons. Our first adventure into Befallen and Solusek A or Najena. Those were the times that will always ring true when I think of EQ. The danger of facing new threats and learning to fight as a team and the long and enduring CR's that we had to do. hehe<br>
<br>
I salute you my friend, for you always were a true friend even through the hardest times. Friendship and Family will always be what I will fight for, whether in a game or not.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes for a bright future,<br>

Some of us are still finding ways to make the game more fun through creative problem-solving.  In RL, I don't talk much about the drops -- I talk about how we worked a zone.<br>
<br>
How we broke Fear, how I had fun pulling Hate.  The dungeon crawl in Grieg's, or tri-comping in Seb.  Charming frogs, or putting together a team where krups drop like jins, or juggs drop like krups.<br>
<br>
Yes, I like the drops.  How often do we get to ding in the post-50 game?  Everyone likes a little gratification for the effort invested, and it's often easier to measure progress by counting what dropped.<br>
<br>
But the true fire in people -- the times I've seen someone say, &quot;That's the most EQ fun I've had in a long time&quot; -- those are never about drops.  They come from working the edge.  They come from having such a kick-ass group that the puller has to bring in trains to keep everyone busy.  They come from working your way through a difficult area, managing a tricky pull, or taking down a mini-boss somewhere.  Not for the loot, but so you can say, &quot;We took down Dread with only 18 people.&quot;  Or maybe &quot;We took down Dread with no losses.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for RL -- maybe not.  Read this through before jumping to an impression....  I don't associate with people I think are morons.  Someone says enough stupid things, and I turn on the bozo bit for them and just avoid them after that, as best I can.  Unless I'm forced to deal with them -- like in a work situation -- they don't usually hear me speak out.<br>
<br>
So in RL, we may find ways of better expressing ourselves and understanding each other.  Conversations are more two-way and interactive.  If we had to work together, and I decided you were an incompetent boob -- no, we wouldn't get along.  If it's social, then I'd avoid you.  If I detected you didn't respect me, then I'd also avoid you.  We wouldn't be crossing words.<br>
<br>
Here -- well, we're sorta all forced to work together, after a fashion.  Everyone -- no matter how qualified -- is given their chance to speak.  Conversations can go off into very different directions than intended.  People can talk at length without interruption.<br>
<br>
In other words, it's far easier for people to appear dogmatic when in actuality, they aren't.<br>
<br>
So would we like each other?  No clue.  But I'd just suggest that maybe the reason people sometimes have a hard time getting along on the boards is the medium utilized, not the people involved.<br>
<br>
On the boards, Aldrin and I don't tend to get along.  However, he came on a PoA raid with me, and I thought he was a hoot and an extremely good scout.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm getting dogmatic.  Gotta work on that.<br>

<br>
  Never had a chance to meet you in game, but I have enjoyed reading some of your posts.  Sorry to see you go because of what the game has become to you.  Honestly, I've made it my decision that this will always be a game, and my guild has not presured me to be on more than I am.  I have been playing for 4 months and I'm only level 24.  BUT, I enjoy myself both in RL and online and I'm not after the fastest most uber 1HS but if I get it enjoying myself good for me.  The game can only be what you make it but if I lost all the people who made it fun for me, it would probably be pretty easy for me to walk away too.<br>
<br>
  So regardless, best wishes from this bard to you.  Happy Holidays as well.   <p><img src="http://www.dcgoose.com/terionsignature.jpg" border="0"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uexedeusdelarosa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Exedeus Delarosa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.3dflags.com/assets/3dflags_com/gif/2/d/3dflagsdotcom_domre_2faws.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#778899>(12/20/01 9:18:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=777.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/07/2361207.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ch-ch-ch-changes</span><hr size=1> I know how you feel Ugle.. my days are winded short as it is.. i cant stand much playing Eq anymore.. i only log on for friends... nothing much after that aside to help them. <br>
Things changed.. i will never forget the experiences i had when i was a &quot;true newbie&quot; but those days are long gone.. and long gone the vivid splendour of what Eq was once to me. I only trudge to complete my last lvl and final goal.. to hit lvl 60. To which i will shortly retire. <p><HTML>

I have always enjoyed yer posts and if this is your last venture into EQ, then I /saulte you and wish you well in life.  Remember, the pains suffered in life can make a man or break a man, I think you are of the stuff that will endure tough times and become a better person for it.<br>
<br>
However though in light of your small essay regarding the changing world of EQ, I think its on the mark, and at the minute I am away from the game for a month, but I miss it not.  I feel it is time the Unfetered One chooses the mortaility of his human heritage and shun the immortality of the elvish.. however only time will tell in the ensuing weeks.<br>

<br>
I can never recall being on a guild hunt that you didn't join if you were logged on.  You never hid away in some corner leveling a twink when your mates needed help.  I've seen you run half way across Norath many times just to help on a CR.<br>
<br>
Words can never be enough to describe my appreciation for what you've done for The Dragonguard.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the first time we as a guild did a true west wall break of Fear without the aid of guests.  You said to me in tells that we were going to get slaughtered, and I said yep. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You knew it, I knew it most of our little band knew it, but we did it anyway.  It took 3 attempts (one naked) but we succeeded in breaking the Plane.  It was one of the most exciting times I have ever had in game and there was nothing that either you or I needed there.<br>
<br>
I hope you are just taking a break from the game Ugle, because I will miss you, and this board won't be half as fun to read without you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and who knows, maybe when the loot whores are done with the new zones we'll find something fun to do there.<br>

It's the job of a cleric stand behind a warrior, and it was especially nice to be supporting one as big as you! Until you activated that mask thingie. Then with a graphic glitch you were the biggest damned DE I ever saw! I wish I could have joined you and the Guard more frequently. The few times I have been privileged to work along side you and DG are indeed some of the most memorable of my EQ days.<br>
<br>
EQ will never be the same as it had been, when it was fresh and new. Those new experiences become old, and the next ones are just repetitions of the past. Greed catches the eye of those you've played with before, and the pursuit of adventure becomes mired with lust; not for fun, but for levels, and better loot. Only a few strong souls can play for the thrill of danger and new adventure, and make every login a new experience. It is sad to see another one leave.<br>

I haven't logged on in days and am starting to enjoy other things now.  EQ has lost much of it's fun.  Too many people out for only themselves.  Too many people HAVING to be what they think is #1.  Too many people thinking they are #1.  Too many people who can't take the time to say &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot; to others.  Too many people not willing to work as a team with what they are given.  Too many people in their trapped mindsets thinking you MUST have these classes in your group to do anything at all.  Too many people who want everything handed to them.  Too many people who have had everything handed to them and expect the rest of life to be that way and think they are better than you since you had to work for your stuff.  The list goes on.  Too many people who used to include fun as part of their playing style have left the game.  The golden age of EQ has long since passed us.  I don't think it will die out for a long time yet, but it's not at it's peak any longer as far as the player styles go.  EQ has followed RL history in many ways if you take a step back and look at it. <p>Kilamdar - FoH<BR>

Farewell, brother troll.  My days in EQ are likely numbered as well. Though I haven't really been in much for the past two months anyway.<br>
<br>
Most of my regular group have gone, while my guild (Amici) is primarily eastern &amp; central, so on the few occasions I've popped on, it's difficult to find a group. And as a L57 warrior, there's not a heck of a lot one can do solo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
Counting the hours it'll take, in many of the same places I've hunted over and over (since experience in Luclin was &quot;adjusted&quot;, most folks are hunting in pre-Luclin locations for experience), I don't think I have the energy to slog to L60. Were it not for the friends I made here, I'd have said goodbye ere now.<br>
<br>
For me, it seems that somewhere after I hit L57, it stopped being fun and started being tedious. Personally, I think Verant misjudged people when they seemingly assumed that if it didn't take forever to advance that we'd all leave. If it was still fun, we'd play, pretty much regardless. Heck, 15 years ago, I played an online game called Gemstone2 (the precursor to the one that ended up on AOL and the Internet). You could get to the maximum level, 46, in about 19 hours, if you did nothing but grind. People played until they shut that game down because it was, though simple, fun.  For many of us, it wasn't about racing to Level X, or to accomplish some task, it was having fun doing it, or doing it differently. It was when the fun was gone that we look for the exit. <br>
<br>
Ah well, now I'm rambling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
