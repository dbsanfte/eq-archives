<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The only answer that Mia received was a low rumble of thunder that rolled across the dead sky.  Mia stood, and brushed herself off.  In this world Mia was not the frail thing that had fallen asleep by the Laundromat, suffering from malnutrition and delusions.  In this world Mia was as she thought of herself.  As she was before all of this had started happening.  As she was before she went to Rome and her life started spiraling downward.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mia scanned her surroundings.  All that was left was stone and metal.  Everything that could have burned did burn, leaving nothing behind.  Despite the overwhelming sense of atrocity that this dismal landscape evoked within her, she did not cry.  In fact, the more she thought about it, the less sadness and revulsion she felt, and she became more and more – suspicious.  Perhaps this was not the world as it really was.  Perhaps someone was playing a trick on her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Or – perhaps her mind was employing a self defense mechanism by telling her that it wasn’t real.  For the knowledge that she was responsible for all of this would have surely destroyed her; ripped her apart and left her cold and dead like the landscape around her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She didn’t notice it until she began to walk.  Over the years she had grown accustomed to one sound that followed her everywhere:  the sound of her heavy combat boots on the ground as she walked.  As she walked now she heard absolutely nothing, although it took her a moment to put her finger on exactly what was so strange about the silence.  Thunder ripped across the sky once more, but it was not in the sky.  It was in her head.  But it was much more than just the sound of thunder.  It was thunder itself.  It burned within her as it crackled and roared, making her fall to her knees with her hands pressed against her temples, as if she were trying to keep her head from exploding; such was the ferocity with which the thunder erupted.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a few minutes the searing pain subsided, and the voices returned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mia!  See what you have done?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Because of you . . .”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You @#%$ @#%$!  You’re always thinking only about yourself.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Because of you the world will never live again.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I hope you’re proud of your accomplishment you god damned bitch.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The rest of eternity is yours and yours alone.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ALONE”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “FOREVER”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ALONE”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ALWAYS ALONE!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The voices, alternating male and female, now meshed and blended and became one horrifying scratch of a voice.  The voices came more rapidly and more ferociously, the pitch increasing to a mind numbing screech as if someone had recorded their words and was now playing them back at high speed and full volume in her head.  And then, as suddenly as they had come, they stopped.  A single tone hung on the air, unwavering.  It was the high-pitched tone that one would only hear in a hospital when someone’s heart had stopped beating.  Now it filled the vastness of the world, Mia’s world.  It bore into her brain and with its incessant ringing also came the insanity.  Like the waves at night, it came fast and strong, sweeping Mia up and carrying her out into the sea of madness, further and further away from sanity.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mia’s hands covered her ears and she threw her head up and screamed.  The empty sky was now filled with a giant cursor, blinking brightly in the dark clouds of the storm.  It scrolled across the sky rapidly, leaving a trail of incandescent green letters behind it.  They read:  “TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF  TEAR IT OFF”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And then, like the flash of a screen, the world turned off.  For the moment, the world ceased to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mia awoke to the sound of someone pounding at the door.  She quickly looked around only to find that she was in her own apartment, at her own desk.  She was, physically fine, and the only evidence she found of her dreams was the sole word: off, that was left on her laptop monitor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Rent Mia!  It’s due!”  Mia stayed still and silent and eventually her landlord left.  She restarted her computer and checked its clock:  11:23 am.  But it was the date that confused her the most.  It was exactly three weeks before she had gone to Rome.  And, it appears, nothing that had happened, had happened . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For weeks Mia stayed home, not working, just being.  The only times she would leave the house was to get food, but those occasions were rare and anything but anticipated.  Sometimes she would sit for hours at her window with a cup of tea, staring out into the gray world and thinking thoughts that were everywhere and nowhere at once.  Slowly, painfully slowly, she began to feel normal again.  She had even managed to convince herself that it had all been a dream. . .<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three weeks later, on the third day, she began to work again.  A contact of hers in New York had sent her a contract on some design schematics for the x-35, an experimental aircraft being developed by a U.S. company, Lokheed Martin.  A wealthy, anonymous ruler from an undisclosed 3rd world country was offering a pretty penny for the designs.  And so it was that on the third day of the third week in the third hour, Mia began to work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The curser blinked unfailingly on the blank screen.  Mia had never thought too much about it before, but now she wasn’t sure weather she was controlling it . . . or . . . She didn’t even want to consider the alternative.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But she worked, and, two weeks later, she finished the job and within the hour found a rather large amount of money in a Swiss bank account.  Everything had gone just the way it should have gone, smoothly and without any abnormal happenings to speak of.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Things continued in the manner for another three months and Mia had almost all but forgotten the events of her dream.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One bright day she was walking home from the store, a large brown bag of food tucked in the cradle of each arm.  A young boy was sitting on the street holding a cup that was filled with a collection of change and a few crumpled bills.  He was the typical beggar that you would find in this neighborhood, only a few blocks away from the Centre Pompidou.  His short black hair was greasy and plastered itself to the sides of his heads, his ragged black clothing making him look like a young goth kid whose parents had abandoned him, and for all Mia knew, that was exactly what had happened to him.  Mia glanced at him as she passed.  With one hand he held his collection cup, with the other he was peeling the skin off of his face.  She paused, frozen, not knowing what to do or say.  The boy looked up at her and stared deep into her eyes.  The world seemed to come to a stop as Mia found herself lost in the eyes of this stranger.  He opened his mouth and spoke, “Tear it off.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just as the last sound of the last syllable was spoken time lurched suddenly back to life and Mia found herself standing, staring at an empty sidewalk. . .<br>
