Harvesters and looked down at the young gnome beside her.  &quot;What do you think Babed?  Is this where we should try to find a home?&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyone seeing the two would think them a strange pair.  The human was slight for her race, and in her armor, many mistook her for a wood elf.  Her armor was a mishmash of things she had acquired over her seasons of experience, but she cared nought for fashion, just that they protected her well in battle.  The mace she carried marked her as a cleric and the air of confidence she carried made one think she was probably a good one.  The confidence was a veneer only, though, for she often doubted her own abilities.  She appeared older than her seasons would indicate, and if one looked closely, he would see a fine line of scars on her face.  Most people never asked about the scars twice...<br>
<br>
The young gnome beside her showed the litheness and strength which held her in such good stead as a warrior.  She was an attractive gnome and frequently turned the heads of gentleman around her, not all of them gnomish.  This day she was not dressed in her usual armor, but in a shade silk robe she received as a gift on Tinkerfest.  She wanted to make a good impression, and thought the robe showed off her figure nicely.<br>
<br>
Babed looked up at the woman she thought of as her aunt, and said, &quot;Yes, Aunt Maritzia, I think it's time.  We've both been without a family for too long.  You enjoyed hunting with Gapemaw, and if he is an indication of the caliber of this House, then it is a fine place to belong, indeed.<br>
<br>
After another long searching look at the House, Maritzia finally nodded, then reached out and let the knocker fall against the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiyda>Kiyda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady Death</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(12/31/02 6:47:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A human and a gnome knock at your door</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kiyda relaxing for once and laying in front of the fire on the bear rug, reading a book.

They gazed around at the splendor of the hall, which was much more than the simple lodgings they were used to.  Maritzia paused and swallowed, wondering again if she were making the right decision in coming here.  Surely a family such as this would have better prospects than a simple cleric like herself.  For a moment she wished she had something better to wear than the armor that was her usual garments.  The young gnome saw Maritzia paused and frowned for a moment, then gently nudged the human forward.  She gave Maritzia's hand a warm squeeze of encouragement, knowing that the cleric was never comfortable putting herself forward.<br>
<br>
Maritzia took confidence from the warm hand of her niece, and stepped forward to bow before Kiyda before addressing her:<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Maritzia, my Lady.  I am a priestess of the Father.  This is my...well, I refer to her as my niece, but she is in actuality a distant relative of my husband's.  This is Babed, who is a warrior of Rallos Zek.  After spending some seasons with me, she has decided to follow the dark paths and has been working hard to become accepted in Neriak.  She can currently come and go there at will, and has even convinced the Indigo Brotherhood to allow her to continue her training there.  Likewise, I have put much effort into gaining the trust of the Priests in Neriak and do most of my training there.<br>
<br>
Maritzia pauses and looks down at Babed for a moment, then back at Kiyda.  &quot;There is another thing you should know, and I do not know if this will make us unacceptable to you.  My husband, his brother, and his other two wives are all of a neutral bent.  My husband, his brother, and 1st wife Raura are all gnomes, although his brother does look amazingly like a dwarf, and 2nd wife Trinque is a wood elf.  We do often hunt in their company, and I will understand if this makes us unacceptable to you.  I hope it will not.  It is mainly because of the fact that most of our family is neutral that we seek the company of others such as ourselves.  We seek others who follow the dark path and have the same loathing for it that we do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maritzia looked again at Babed, and said, &quot;Do you have anything you want to add, Babed?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=babed>Babed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(12/31/02 9:03:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A human and a gnome knock at your door</span><hr size=1> Babed had been gazing about the lounge, impressed with what she saw.  Unlike her aunt, she was not uncomfortable in other than simple surroundings.  She liked fine things, and she found the beauty and the warmth of the lounge soothing to her spirit.  Though she could fight with all ferocity when the situation called for hit, she enjoyed hospitable surroundings and good company in her off time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything you want to add, Babed?&quot;<br>
<br>
Babed glanced up at her aunt and laughed.  Maritzia was a dear, but she could be so formal and stuffy sometimes.  It was probably her upbringing in the monastery which caused that, Babed thought.  She turned and smiled at Kiyda and gave a quick bow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, my name's Babed.  That's pronounced like Babette, but my dear mama wasn't very educated and didn't know how to spell it.  The poor dear, she never could read and write too well.&quot;  Babed giggles, and it's easy to see from the sparkling of her eyes that she is a gnome of good humor.  &quot;Maritzia forgot to mention that she is in her 25th season of experience, and I am in my 28th.  While we enjoy hunting with our family, we miss the companionship of others who practice the dark arts.  I tire of those who prattle about balance or who just don't care one way or another.&quot;  She frowns as a resolute look comes over her otherwise pretty face.  Then her face clears and she laughs again.  &quot;Oh, and Aunt Maritzia, don't you think you should tell them about your past?  It might be important.&quot;  Babed nods decisively as she looks up at her aunt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=babed>Babed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(12/31/02 9:15:06 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A human and a gnome knock at your door</span><hr size=1> &gt; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=babed>Babed</A> at: 12/31/02 9:20:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maritzia>Maritzia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(12/31/02 9:21:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A human and a gnome knock at your door</span><hr size=1> Maritzia flushes, causing the scars on her face stand out in relief. She was never comfortable talking about the foolishness of her youth, but she supposed they would find out some time. So she took a deep breath and plunged on with her explanation.<br>
<br>
&quot;You might as well know that in my youth I was a lightbringer.&quot; At this, Maritzia blushed even redder. &quot;I was raised in the Temple of Life my a priest I thought to be my uncle. It was only in my 22nd season that I found out that he was not my uncle, nor were my parents dead as I thought. At my age of majority, I became a Priest of Rodcet Nife, as he was, and struggle for some time in that vocation.&quot; Maritzia paused here a moment, and when she continued speaking, the bitterness she always thought she hid was clear in her voice. &quot;I was a fool...that goes without saying. My only excuse is that I was young, and never knew any other way of life. I struggled for some time with the darkness that was in my soul...struggling to purge myself of it, and failing that, hide it away. It was in my 34th season that I finally understood the Hate that I had always tried to hide from. Things happened...&quot; Maritzia's jaw tightened at the thought of her experiences in that time, and her chin rose, &quot;things I will not discuss. Suffice it to say that they broke through the walls and allowed the Hate in my to flower. When I regained my freedom, I sought out the Priests of Innoruuk, and was reborn as a servant of Hate. That was 25 seasons ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maritzia stops speaking, looking off into the air, and it takes you a moment to realize she is finished.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiyda>Kiyda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady Death</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(1/2/03 7:15:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A human and a gnome knock at your door</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kiyda , standing the whole time looking at the two of them with such intent letting them speak what they needed to say.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
