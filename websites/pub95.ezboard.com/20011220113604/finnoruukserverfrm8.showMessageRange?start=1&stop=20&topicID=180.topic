I was sitting at home minding my own business when the phone rang.<br>
<br>
Me: “Hello”<br>
Lady: “Hello, Mr. Adel. This is Laura with Ameritech and we would like to offer you aDSL!”<br>
Me: “Woot, what do I have to do?”<br>
Lady: “Just lemme know if you want the aDSL to come in through this phone or you fax line.”<br>
Me: “Ok, lets use the fax line. Oh, and I have 3 computers, will I be able to hook them all up to the aDSL?”<br>
Lady: “Yep, all you’ll need to do is go buy a Router from Circuit City and some Ethernet cards. The aDSL will be activated on November 12th and we will be sending you the aDSL modem in the mail shortly.”<br>
Me: “Sounds good, thanks bye.”<br>
<br>
And so it began…<br>
<br>
The thing about this service is that you hook everything up yourself. Ameritech sends you a USB aDSL modem that plugs in right through your phone jack. It’s really easy and that’s not where the problem comes in. <br>
<br>
Before the activation date I went out and bought all the needed items to network my three computers. 3 Ethernet cards, Cat5 Cable, and 1 Router. I hooked it all up and it works fine. Installed Microsoft Internet Connection Sharing on the computer that was going to be the “master” and I was all set to go. <br>
<br>
November 12 hits and the modem comes in the mail, woot! I hook it up to the main computer and of course it doesn’t work. <br>
<br>
So I call Ameritech.<br>
<br>
Me: “Hi, I was just calling to make sure that my aDSL line was activated today”<br>
Guy: “Ok, lemme type your info in here and we’ll wait for the status to pop up”<br>
    --we both wait in awkward silence—<br>
Guy: “Ok, seems your line has been delayed and won’t be activated until November 20.”<br>
Me: “Damn, why the delay?”<br>
Guy: “The report doesn’t say”<br>
Me: “Was anyone going to call me and tell me it was delayed?”<br>
Guy: “We tried to call earlier and no one was home”<br>
<br>
@#%$! I was home all day, not using the phone, and at worst they could have left a message on my voice mail. Oh well.<br>
<br>
November 20th rolls around…hey whadda know the aDSL isn’t working. <br>
<br>
Lets call Ameritech.<br>
<br>
Me: “Hi, I’m checking on the status of my aDSL, it was supposed to be activated today.”<br>
Lady: “It takes 24 hours to update our computers, call back tomorrow sir.”<br>
 <br>
November 21st(I know this is kinda long, but this is where things get good!)<br>
<br>
Call Ameritech…<br>
<br>
Me: “Hi, I’m calling to check the status of my aDSL line.”<br>
Guy:  “It’s not up and running”<br>
Me: “Yeah, I know”<br>
Guy: “Lets see if the engineer typed a reason why.”<br>
        --pause—<br>
Guy: “Ah yes, your aDSL line is not running and it is on hold”<br>
Me: “When will it be activated?”<br>
Guy: “Someday”<br>
Me: “Someday?”<br>
Guy: “Yes, we are not sure when.”<br>
Me: “Ok, um…how will I know when it is working?”<br>
Guy: “Just keep the USB modem plugged in and when the light turns green it’s working.”<br>
Me: “Ok, bye” grrrrrrrr<br>
<br>
I am a bit angry at this point for a few reasons. <br>
  1) Ameritech called me and told me they could give me aDSL. I didn’t go to them and seek this out. <br>
  2) I’ve got a network hooked up and collecting dust and it was not inexpensive to set up. From the Router to the cables to the Ethernet cards. I wouldn’t have made these purchases if I wasn’t going to be getting aDSL. <br>
  3) The phone call and realizations I made today(see below)<br>
<br>
Call Ameritech…<br>
<br>
Me: “Hi, I was supposed to get aDSL activated on November 12th and now it’s the 27th and it’s not working and I was wondering if you guys had a estimated date?”<br>
Lady: “Ah yes, it seems your work service request has been canceled.”<br>
Me: “What?”<br>
Lady: “Your order has been canceled because it was going to take more then 30 days.”<br>
Me: “Why was it going to take 30 days? You called me and talked me into buying this service in the first place!”<br>
Lady: “It seems we do not have the required resources at this time. My screen tells me that we have an estimated date to be ready on December 31st.”<br>
Me: “Ok, so will my aDSL be active on December 31?”<br>
Lady: “No, since it was going to take more then 30 days you will have to re-order the service with us.”<br>
Me: “Ok, hey am I going to be charged the $200 for the modem you guys sent me?”<br>
Lady: “Lemme transfer you to sales”<br>
<br>
Lady2: “Hi, sir. You will need to repackage the USB modem and all it’s parts. Tape it up and take it to your local UPS station and have them send it back to us. There is a return address on the box.”<br>
Me: “But I am going to order the service once December 31st hits, it should be ready by then.”<br>
Lady2: “I know sir, but when you re-order the service you have to buy the modem again.”<br>
Me: “But I already have the modem”<br>
Lady2: “Yes, but you need to return it so we don’t charge you for it. Because when you order the service again on December 31 you will have to buy the modem. You don’t want to buy two modems do you?”<br>
Me: “No…look this is stupid and it’s a hassle. We know that I want your Ameritech aDSL service. I have the equipment and I am just waiting for you guys to activate the phone line. Wouldn’t it make sense for me to keep the modem and wait for the line to be ready?<br>
Lady2: “I’m sorry sir, but there’s nothing I can do”<br>
--click—<br>
<br>
Ok so I have to return this stupid USB modem I have or I get charged $200 dollars for it and then I would have to buy another one on December 31st when I re-ordered my service. Barring all the confusion that went on I don’t think Ameritech ever planned on telling me this! No one informed me that my service was CANCELED and my Modem should be returned! No one told me I’d have to buy another modem if I wanted to order the service again! Jesus they called me, I didn’t ask for this frustration. If someone calls you up and offers you a service and you agree to buy it don’t you think they would be able to fulfill their end of the bargain?!? Ok, sorry this got way too long, lol. I just had to get this outta my system.<br>
<br>
F U Ameritech.<br>
<br>
...it's not all for nought I guess. I used my useless network to print stuff off my other computer one day because this one ran out of ink.<br>

<br>
**WARNING** Again, this is one of those deals where I don't really know what I am talking about but I have read and heard some things that I am going to repeat so if I am wrong and/or a complete idiot, chalk it up to free advice being worth exactyly what you paid for it.<br>
<br>
USB is only an 8-bit connection (i.e. 8 1's or 0's being transfered at a time). A Ethernet card is (generally) a 16-bit connection (16 1's or 0's being transfered at a time).  Why get a high speed interenet connection and use USB that automatically cuts the transfer in half?<br>
<br>
In addition if you are running windows 98 and have an AMD processor there seems to be some USB problems.  There is a patch just for USB and AMD processors on microsoft's site.  Even when I patched I still had probelms that were finally fixed when I got rid of the USB network device and put in a new ethernet card.<br>
<br>
In short, USB is a crappy way to get network or internet connection. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 614<br> <font color=#778899>(11/27/01 2:04:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ameritech (long)</span><hr size=1> I want to address the comments about the modem.  First, I'd agree that a USB modem is not the way to go.  Instead, a stand-alone modem that has a phone jack and a network jack is a better choice.  Just plug it into the hub, and plug all the computers into the hub, and you're all set.  (Note that you'll have to use a &quot;crossover&quot; port on the hub or a crossover cable -- for the modem.  However, the remaining devices are normal connections.)<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, remember that aDSL is still not a &quot;fast&quot; connection, it's just faster than standard modem technology.  Okay, a lot faster, but it's still not fast.  I really doubt there's a performance issue with using an USB modem, because the USB connection is still probably significantly faster than the DSL.<br>
<br>
However, it's just not a clean connection.  You've got one computer that -- if it goes down, the rest of your computers are also off the internet.  That's icky.<br>

My fiance uses this service.  It seems rock solid and just as easy to use.<br>
<br>
Don't tell them you have multiple computers, though.  Instead, you need to use a hub/router designed for cable connections.  The hub will spoof the cable modem into thinking it's the PC, and all the PCs hide behind it.  It's fancy-ass computer stuff, but you don't need to do anything except:<br>
<br>
1. Let AT&amp;T get everything running for you with one of your computers.<br>
<br>
2. Wait for them to leave and pull out the router.  Plug everything in, then fire up your web browser and hit the address as listed in the quick guide.  Tell it to use the MAC address of &quot;this PC&quot; (the directions walk you through this).<br>
<br>
Viola, all computers on the connection, and it's faster than DSL.<br>

I hate Ameritech.  I canceled my Landline LD service and they had the hardest time accepting that fact.  They got real confussed when I told them I didnt need it at the cost they were offering.  They told me I would be able to make Toll or LD calls.  I told them thats not true.  I was covered thank you.  The gal on the other end seemed REALLY perplexed.  She went on to say, No sir, you will only be able to make local calls.  Toll calls and LD calls require LD service.  I said I'm sorry to disagree with you but I can make all the LD call I like without your service.<br>
<br>
Long Pause....<br>
<br>
May I ask how you plan on doing this if you dont have LD service.  I said, I just dial the areacode and the number and I make the call.  She says that I may have a problem with my service there, and that I am getting services I am not paying for.  So she proceeds to set up a service call to &quot;cut off my free service&quot;  I laughed at her and said I need to let you go.  She asked for me to say on long enought to get some info for the service call. I said I didnt have time for that and I didnt need any service call.  She said I have a problem with my line if I am getting free LD service.<br>
<br>
I told her that was what my contract said.<br>
<br>
She said, &quot;Contract?&quot;<br>
<br>
I said yeah, My CELL PHONE CONTRACT!<br>
<br>
Seeya, and hung up on her.<br>

I guess since I wasted about 30mins of her time I was sparing someone else 30 minutes of trouble somewhere in the US.<br>

I have to say that I have found AT&amp;T cable modem to be better than dial-up for sure, but that it goes out almost every morning a few times, which is annoying if I happen to be home for some reason.<br>
<br>
This has been my problem with them though.<br>
<br>
I have AT&amp;T cable television, and I have AT&amp;T cable modem.  These are both owned by the same company, but are &quot;different divisions&quot;.  Both of these services come through the same wiring system though.   <br>
<br>
I get a paper bill in the mail for the TV cable.  I have automatic payment set up for the Cable modem.  <br>
<br>
I don't watch TV really...and I suck at mailing in payment on paper bills on time.  I have the money, I just don't think of actually sending to to them.  (Shouldn't it be enough that I actually do have the money in tha bank?!! LOL j/k)<br>
<br>
So anyway, every once in a while, my cable TV gets turned off until I give them money from my bank.  Now frankly, I could care less about this.  But EVERY SINGLE TIME this happens, my cable modem goes out too.<br>
<br>
So I call AT&amp;T cable and AT&amp;T @home.....and scream at them.....I have PAID for my modem service.  You CANNOT cut off my modem serice.   They always send me back and forth between the two companies...denying that they did anything, or cliaming to not be responsible..blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Usually after a few phone calls and my getting rather hostile, they take my payment by credit card over the phone, and come turn it all back on.  They know they suck.  They know they f**ked up.  But damned if they even bother to fix the GD problem.  (The two lines CAN be separated, so that I can receive data from either one separate of the other)<br>
<br>
It all boils down to incompetence and refusal to hold people accountable for their job responsibilities in my situation, as well as in your situation above.<br>
<br>
Makes ya just want to scream doesn't it?<br>
<br>
***Before you flame me...yes, yes I know I suck for not paying my bill.  I work a lot, play EQ, and have to try to manage all the household finances and keep the damn house clean mostly by myself....Sometime, I get my priorities screwed up or I just plain forget!***  <br>

It works fine now, but was a pain in the neck getting installed.<br>
<br>
a) first I had to wait 3 to 4 months before the servers were installed in the switching station. But by ordering at that time I had a lower monthly rate and one month free.<br>
<br>
b) Over the phone preliminaries detect that my neighborhood has already 99% capacity of the phone lines in use.  No big deal, just have to cap the speed I receive my DSL.<br>
<br>
c) First appointment day, service person a no show. I call their office, it seems they cancelled my appointment! Fine! I had taken a day of from work for the appointment.  They had reset it for a day I couldn't take off.  Nice for informing me about changes!  Finally get a date I could be there, Two weeks later.<br>
<br>
d) Second appointment, again a no show.  Yes, they did forget to tell me again about cancelling it! ARGH!!! Arrange for a third appointment.<br>
<br>
e) Third appointment comes, the technician arrives!  He installs the soft ware and checks the system.  A problem, its after 5pm and he can't work it through the system at that time.  Arrange for fourth appointment.<br>
<br>
f) At the fourth appointment they get it running.  Hooray!<br>
<br>
g) System failure, cannot log on.  Call up service center.  They ask me where the modem is.  Its right on top of the CPU as the technician left it.  That's the problem, move it to ontop of phone books.<br>
<br>
h) Week later another system failure.  Service center baffled they arrange for technician. Modem doesn't want to talk to them.  Technician looks at my system. Its my modem! I have older wiring in the house (2 wire), the modem they gave me was for newer lines (3 wire).  He installs right modem.<br>
<br>
i) Afterwards, system works fine with a couple of minor glitches that the service center handles over the phone.  Over all the service has been decent since then.<br>
<br>
j) Two months ago, I receive a request to join a class action suit against AT&amp;T Braodband.  Only thing is that the time period specified was when I couldn't be connected anyway. That was when the switching station was awaiting equipment.  Basis of Class Action Suit, Cancellation of appointments withour prior notification of customer.  ARRGH!!!!<br>

There are so many other factors involved and so much that can go wrong... Telcos, equipment, blah blah blah....<br>
<br>
I miss my DSL line though (Northpoint Communications went out of business) - once it was installed it was rocksolid. <p><center>

Being that i worked for AOL/Time Warner Cable as a router anaylist, trust me ive seen the ins and outs of the cablemodem industry. <br>
Please guys i will spare you the BS talk and give you the REAL SHMEAL HERE<br>
<br>
1&gt; there are 2 totally different sides of the house here, 1 is a division NOC, and the other is the LOCAL one. the Cablemodem infrastucture is nothing but a GIGANTIC LAN. Each house runs to a COAX line connecting all to a fiberoptic hub. this hub(NODE) then goes to what they call a HEADEND that basically connects a small surburb or potion of a city area. Me living in Orlando, theres a Winter Park headend, Casselberry, Oviedo, etc. all connecting to the local Division of Orlando. the Orlando Division is responsible for the central florida region connecting (Orlando/daytona/Cocoa/Osceola) cities.<br>
<br>
So yes its a gigantic network, and as all my netadmins know.. it requires allot of maintenance. <br>
heres some problems i can tell you off the bat.<br>
<br>
1&gt; See they originally designed the WAN Structure to have 5 fiberoptic lines per NODE (neighborhoods) three where to be used as the regular traffic, and the other 2 where the &quot;peak hours&quot; ones that where activated at peak times to alleviate traffic and bandwith. <br>
Do they overload certain nodes? YES i see it everyday. <br>
They try to jampack as many houses as they can to one NODE. Even tho they limit the amount of bandwith per modem (done on the actual router) theres only so much a line is supposed to hold. You know the saying.. &quot;Sell sell sell! !&quot; Neighboorhood grows business starts booming, EVERYONE wants Roadrunner! Now 3years later, you can forget those 2 extra &quot;peaktime&quot; lines.. those are already used and overflowed! And you think they would expand the lines because of greater business? uhmm think again. Its been a PAINSTAKE of a slow process.<br>
So when peaktimes come.. yep you know it. lag lag lag and more lag. Trust me seen it been there. Seen some go as slow as a 56k modem. <br>
<br>
<br>
2&gt; Maintenance is POOR period. Sometimes getting a tech out to an individual house is PAINFULL. they work on 3 HOUR windows per tech. theres no set appt. its a &quot;he will show within 1pm and 4pm) type deal. Do they show up on time? i can tell you for a fact 70% of them DONT. They are required to call you before show. If you DO NOT answer your phone they will NOT SHOW. So.. if you are out in the lawn gardening, in the bucket taking a dump and you miss that phone call.. guess what  &quot;NO ONE HOME, RESQUEDULE&quot;<br>
<br>
LOCAL PROBLEM -<br>
there are 2 types of techs.. the PC and the COAX technician. When you call with a problem its up the the helpdesk to determine the issue. If its a PC issue.. i will give an A+ to that side as they can get a tech out next day and the crew are very knowledgable. If its a COAX tech. *bows and pray for mercy* Coax techs will do the following. either replace a defective modem, or replace/repair the coax line. from your house to the NODE. This is where the fun starts. theres a certain Signal lvl that must reach your modem.. this lies between neg 12 to pos 5 Db. If you are off this signal.. then they will replace/repair the line, recheck the signal.. if the signal is good.. *AOL VOICE* GOODBYE. Does this fix all the issues? N O   there are other problems that can occure other than a signal issue. NODE/HUB problems, signal degredation, line overflow.. etc. Our these techs fully trained in all this? NO<br>
and why do you ask are they not fully trained? <br>
Simple.. Time Warner Cable work with a large portion of CONTRACT companies that have no real clue on how our netowork is set up, all they now is how to fix/replair/replace a line. They have NO CLUE what else lies yonder. Nor is it their business nor do they care what else lies either. &quot;Its not their job&quot; its Time Warners&quot;<br>
now.. what if it isnt a signal problem? what if its an issue above your line? (this is all too comon) if the hub/Node is bad well this is where the Contract companies imform TWC they need a MAINTENANCE Tech out there..   heres the goody goody part!<br>
<br>
MAINTENANCE - <br>
The Maintenance dept does NOT work on a set apt, they work on a priority scale from standard to severe maintenance. So actually scheduling a Maintenance take takes between 2 weeks to one month! im serious. So if theres an actual node problem affecting your neighborhood.. expect to wait that long before anyone bothers to look at it. after a maintenance teck goes out there. does his thing and goes away. if your issue is still unresovled, guess what, back to sending a regular contracted tech and start the process all over again. This problem/issue will NOT be escalated until you have had a total of 3techs or more to your house.. then it will be dropped to a Field Supervisor whereupon you will have to set up an appt with him. <br>
<br>
REGIONAL PROBLEMS<br>
Yes this really happened. here is a Headend connecting a major suburb and the genius that set it up, surprisingly put the server DIRECTLY connected to the outlet jack, no UPS no nada.. just a straight plug in. So when we had a small powersurge.. WHAM .. all the servers in the Headend got rebooted. Is this a sever issue? not really.. just a matter of sending a tech to go reset the main servers and get them online. But obviously at the time.. we didnt know the deal.. so here comes the call pouring in.. queue's fill up..  this is where my job camed in and i started seeing routers/system that are down.. ok simple enough.. phone in the Central NOC. (procedure) they need to do their own check and balances. see the fun thing is.. everything is done by contract companies. SO is it really a TWC tech ghoing to a headend? who knows? usually is a 3rd party company who set the headend up in the firstplace.. being the same idiot who probably set it up in the firstplace.<br>
<br>
welp hope this gives you a lil insight as to what one of the major Cablemodem industry is doing.. OH a lil FYI.. AOL/Earthlink are now using the TWC infrastructure to generate business as well.. sooo looks like they will be adding MORE CUSTOMERS to an already overcramped system. But who cares.. TWC is just making more money.<br>
<br>
Nope.. i thank God I no longer work for AOL/Time Warner. i am now a Database admin for the Univerity of Central Florida.<br>

You live in America - land of the sue.<br>
<br>
You acted on advice from a verbal contract and are now out of pocket.  They did not keep up their end of the verbal contract.  So sue them for the costs you incurred which you would otherwise not have incurred.  - If proof is a problem go to the civil court where you can sue for damages on the balance of probability.  ie Judge Judy style.<br>
