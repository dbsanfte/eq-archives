What is *she* doing here?</span><hr size=1> A young Teir'dal shadowknight rakes his fingers through his sodden hair. It had been a miserable morning but thankfully his turn as sentry was almost up. He wanted nothing more than to change out of his armor and warm up near the fire.<br>
<br>
In the distance, a figure began to take shape. As it approached he noted the height. Obviously too tall to be a Teir'dal. A few yards more and he ruled out the possibility of a Human. He puzzled a little longer. Too thin to be Vah Shir. It couldn't be...<br>
<br>
She held her head high, concentrating on keeping her pace slow and steady. There were almost a million other places she would rather be at this moment. She had already waited too long, but it had been difficult tracking him down. It had been his right to know first, before the news spread to others. She had lived through telling him, hopefully she would survive this as well.<br>
<br>
The figure drew closer, a Koada'Dal female was approaching the Harvester Halls. He drew his sword. A smile twisted his lips at the thought of spilling her blood.<br>
<br>
She saw his blade glint in the torchlight that marked his post. Just a few more steps and she would be within striking distance of that blade. All she could do was raise her hands a bit higher, hoping that the badge she carried so carefully would make him pause.<br>
<br>
He brought his sword up in a sweeping arc. At the moment he began to bring it down his eyes spied the badge she carried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait.&quot; her voice did not tremble. It did not command, merely a suggestion. It was enough. His sword dropped to his side still gripped in his right hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;This belonged to my cousin, tis my task to return it to your hall.&quot;  Before the shadowknight can think she pushes the badge along with a letter into his hands. &quot;Please see that these are delivered to your Mistresses along with my apologies for not being able to do so in person. I am certain they will understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quickly she steps back, a bottle of some sort in her hands. In one fluid motion she uncorks it and swallows the contents. In a flash of smoke she is gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
the letter<br>
<br>
Mistresses of the Harvesters,<br>
<br>
Tis with a heavy heart that I write these words. My cousin, Jenori, has taken her life. I have already spoken with her fiance, Dalion, and have made arrangements. <br>
<br>
I understand that this must be a great shock to you. For so long Jenori tried to live her life as one of you, but deep within her heart she knew the truth. She became human through some great ritual of the arcane. I believe the strain was more than her mind or heart could stand.<br>
<br>
If you wish to speak on this matter leave word at the Hero Heart Tavern.<br>
<br>
