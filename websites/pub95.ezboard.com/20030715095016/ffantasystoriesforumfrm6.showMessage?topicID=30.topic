Twirling a dagger in her hand she slinks down the night stricken streets. Time to find her first blood… Miriam’s hair was up in a high ponytail, the way she always wore it. From head to toe she was dressed in full black leather that reflected the moonlight. Her long elegant fingernails were each carefully painted a deep red, the red that matched her eyes. Lucky for her the militia was on call tonight and the majority of them were gone, something to do with Teir’Dal interference. Dumb fucks. The sky was clear tonight and a crescent moon gave little light to the always-flooded streets. Rounding the corner Miriam stops in her tracks. It was * her *. That skank that was with Caelestis. The girl looks around a bit before stepping across the street. Her pace was quickened because of the hour and low visibility due to shadows. It wasn’t the shadows that bitch should have been fearing… Miriam walks at a slightly faster pace than the girl and follows her. The undeniable feeling of being stalked rattles the girls mind, and with good reason. She * was * being stalked. Turning back, she notices Miriam with her dark eyes and twisted face. Her heart pounds against her chest and her feet move swifter against the gritty street. Was that woman following her mad? …. Yes. Miriam grips the handle of her dagger and heightens her pace to a jog. Glancing over her shoulder, the girl sees Miriam coming, faster still, toward her. With panic in the chemical form known as adrenaline pumping through her veins she runs as fast as her legs would take her. Not fast enough. Sprinting with much ease, Miriam not only catches up to this hoebag but drops to the floor and swings her leg in front of her feet. Hitting the ground with a high-pitched ‘ur’ and a slushy sort of squish, the girl finds that nearly all hope is lost. It was the end of the road for her. The blade still in hand, Miriam grabs hold of the girl’s shirt and pulls her to her feet. Shoving her against a near by wall, Miriam presses the blade to her neck while fists full of fabric keep her pinned in place. <br>
<br>
“What’s your name”<br>
<br>
“Take anything you want. I have money, I have jewels, I’ll give you anything you want”<br>
<br>
“I want your name”<br>
<br>
“Please… please don’t hurt me” <br>
<br>
Was this slut stupid? NAME. GIVE YOUR NAME. A piece of scrap leather was pinned to the girl’s shirt. A nametag! How convenient! She must have just come from her night job, how fabulous. Unpinning the tag, Miriam reads it carefully out loud.<br>
<br>
“Caru. Hmmm, nice name. Oh wait! I think I know you! Tell me, Caru…” She spoke the name with bitterness and disgust, “You wouldn’t happen to know a guy named, oh lets see, Caelestis? Would you?”<br>
<br>
“Caelestis… He’s my boyfriend. How do you know his name?…” She was very scared, like a timid little rabbit. Her angelic voice was like nails scratching on a blackboard to Miriam. Miriam’s eye twitches and her ear is pressed against her shoulder. Boyfriend… boyfriend… boyfriend… boyfriend… boyfriend… boyfriend… boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend<br>

Miriam closes her eyes a moment and takes the kind of breath one would take while trying to regain a grip on reality. Her mind had been more fragile since Caelestis proved she was nothing more than a side girl. Something to keep his bed warm when no one else would. The image of herself had been right… she * was * disgusting, she * was * weak… she was nothing. There were too many emotions, too many thoughts, too many feelings to shove into a bottle all at once, and her bottle was too small. Her stored memories, hidden emotions, denyed feelings, all explode with in the confines of her mind simultaneously. Her world was nothing more than a sheet of glass shattered into a million tiny grains of sand. Boyfriend…<br>
<br>
Caru’s scream shatters the still of the night. Again again again again again again again again!! The pin was shoved into her right eye again and again and again and again, until it finally got stuck on the pin. Moving it over an inch, Miriam shoves it deep within her left eye. Yanking it from her skull, Miriam now had both of Caru’s eyes on the pin. Blood gushes like two flash flooded rivers of life from the cavities that once held two crystal blue eyes. Caru’s scream was unwavering and quite annoying. Time to fix that. Pulling a finely sharpened sewing needle from her pocket, Miriam threads it with some string that she found in her wrist pouch. Time to end that annoying scream. Caru tries desperately to get her hands to her face, but Miriam puts her forearm against her neck and shoves away any attempt and putting pressure on the bleeding holes. Apparently the girl had some instincts, not enough to notice. Nails scratch blindly at Miriam’s upper torso and arms, her leather made nice whore scratch protection. <br>
<br>
“Stop moving, ya dumb bitch” <br>
<br>
Applying more pressure to her neck, Miriam’s fingers clamp down on her lips. Muffled screams are still heard. Darn, this would not do at all! <br>
<br>
“Say ah!” Miriam lets go and is answered by another scream. How fun. Reaching into Caru’s mouth, Miriam pulls out her tongue. <br>
<br>
“This * should * work. Now just hold still and it’ll all be over, hun” As gruesome as it may seem, Miriam slices off Caru’s tongue in a single motion. <br>
<br>
“Ta-da!” Now, rather than a scream, some odd sounding pain filled noise was being projected from that damned mouth of hers still. Fiddle sticks! Oo, oo! It would work now! Pressing both lips together for a second time, Miriam is able to successfully sew a row of delightful little x’s across Caru’s mouth. The amount of blood that spilled from her eyes alone was amazing. It made quite a nice puddle at her feet. Caru’s struggles came weaker and weaker as each second ticked by.<br>
<br>
“Hold on, sweetheart, almost done” Miriam’s voice was soothing like a Mother telling her child that soon the scrape on the knee would be bound. Well lookie here! The @#%$ dagger was still clean! Tisk tisk, this would not do, not do at all! Clutching onto Caru’s shirt, Miriam hold’s her up just long enough to lop off both ears. <br>
<br>
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Miriam gave her head a quick pat before her body fell over. Skipping happily she makes her way out of the town gates. The small bag she swung in her hand was soaked and dripped something other than water.<br>
