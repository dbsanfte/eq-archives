I don't wanna turn this into a ten-page rant about Vietnam POWs, hostages, tourists, or anyone else that has been treated inhumanely or killed at the hands of someone in a third world country, but why should anyone in the U.S. or the international community give a DAMN what happens to a handful of fanatic terrorist murderers?  <br>
<br>
All this politically-correct ACLU posturing and pansy-whining about how these psychos are being treated makes me wanna barf.  Ask an American ex-POW how he was treated in Vietnam?  Do you figure the VC came to him dressed in suits and wanted to shake hands, all the time worrying about whether his cable TV reception was reasonably clear?  I kinda doubt it.<br>
<br>
America needs to stop trying to be the good guy.  Enough with the liberal immigration policies.  Stop loaning billions of dollars in cash, humanitarian aid, and weapons every time some ingrate country has an earthquake or goes to war with the Communists.  I say @#%$ al Qaeda.  Kill all those ragheads and let God, Allah, or Innoruuk sort em out.  We should send a team of EPA engineers over to Trashcanistan and investigate the global environmental effects of dropping a couple nukes on Kabul, and have em report their findings back to Dubya.  If we did that 3 months ago, we'd have had Bin Laden on the White House front porch on Sept. 12, bent over, with a Swedish maid uniform on, ready to select a pineapple for George to shove up his a$$.<br>
<br>
Seriously, al-Qaeda was able to level two of the tallest buildings in the world not because they've got a knack for mass destruction, but because we've got the ingenuity to build big crazy stuff that will fall down easy if you fly a couple of OUR largest airplanes into it.  They made an impact, not because of Allah or Muhammad Atta, but because of our  technological good graces.  Kinda like how good can't exist without evil, ya know?  If we were employing good ol' eye-for-an-eye revenge, how could we make such a rippling effect on Afganistan as they have on us?  Personally, I think making that shi-thole country uninhabitable for the next 5,000 years or so isn't such a bad idea.  They don't exactly have skyscrapers.  And while you're at it, line those greasebums in Cuba up and pop em in the head 5 at a time...we'll save a few bullets.<br>

<br>
Don't bother comparing how they're treated with how our pows were treated in previous wars (remember the female pilot that was shot down and @#%$ during Desert Storm? Don't have to go back to the Indochinese War, even)<br>
What irks me is that these organizations and the British are concerned about our treatment of them when that treatment is often better than we give our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> criminal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> prisoners. Where was the ACLU and the U.N. et al when Tim McVeigh was shackled hand and foot while being hustled out of the police station? How bout those lovely images of the little old woman survivor of the Waco massacre hobbling along shackled? I'm not suggesting that they were abused, I'm saying that there was no complaint when they were treated the same as the Al Quaida detainees are. These are supposed to be suicidally dangerous prisoners, even a greater threat than murderers and rapists in our prisons. So long as the treatment of them is aimed at keeping them from escaping or doing harm, there should be no complaint... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> even if it inadvertently humiliates them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As for the prisoner who bit the guard... I'd take him in to the base dentist, put him under, and pull all of his teeth. Hey, if he'd made a knife out of a chicken bone, we'd take that from him, and he'd get no more food with bones, right? It would send a powerful, no-nonsense message to the other prisoners, too.<br>

The thing that makes the difference with those 2 examples is there are rules that the majority of the world adheres to, and there are consequences when you break them--EQ has no such thing despite our wishes otherwise.<br>
<br>
The United States is not the be-all, end-all.  We are the strongest nation in the world militarily, economically, politically, whatever way you want to look at it the US is the total package as it stands now.  But that does not give the US license free reign to do as they please without regard to the international community.  The last time someone did that was WW2.  I seriously doubt that if the situations were reversed the Taliban  would not provide for us the way we do for them, there would be no al-Qaida version of the ACLU, etc.  But that is what makes &quot;us&quot; better than &quot;them&quot; if you want to look at it that way.<br>
<br>
If I kill your brother and you retaliate by killing mine, then you are no better than me.  And the U.S. is most definately better than the Taliban and al-Qaida.  It is because we operate on a higher level then they do, and although it is my fervent wish (and I believe most others) to see the people responsible for Sept. 11 feel the same pain and suffering we did, I can sleep better at night and I can hold my head high knowing we treat the al-Qaida prisoners with common human dignity in spite of our desire to the contrary.<br>
<br>
I hate playing devil's advocate, but I would rather see the US lead the world by example than lead the world by force of arms.<br>

The nuke thing was really something that a friend of mine and I were joking about.  Some background: On Sept 11 when the newly-elected Bush gave his state of the union address, nobody really knew what he was capable of, and the whole world was watching--even al Jazeera.  My pal and I bet good money that if Bush's speech had included anything about investigating &quot;the effects of dropping nukes on the Taliban&quot;, we wouldn't still be looking for bin Laden today.  Everyone knows the United States isn't gonna go dropping nukes just for giggles...but damn it'd be a good bluff.  Nuclear poker!  heh<br>

I abhor terrorism, but just because the bad guys fight dirty doesn't mean we have to.  Detaining thousands of muslim-americans and trying suspected in military courts is not what I call democracy.  I firmly believe terrorism has to be rooted out and stopped, but not by illegal holdings and interogation.  What's next, a steady erosion of other rights?<br>

No problem, that's not the issue. It's not the war we don't recognize.. it's the Taliban/Al Quaida. There is no recognized government in Afghanistan; we never recognized the Taliban. This is why the prisoners are detainees rather than PoWs. They are not soldiers, they are criminals. Very dangerous criminals, but criminals nonetheless. They have no Constitutional rights, since they aren't American. So, no Geneva Convention, No Constitution. Yet we're still treating them humanely.<br>
<br>
Because of politics, a long, unpleasant mess is ahead of us. The U.S. doesn't seem able to learn that you can't buy friends, and people aren't your friend just because they make nice noises at you. It's amusing that things are transpiring similiarly to what I predicted in earlier messages. More amusing that more people are starting to sound like I did. <br>
<br>
What's unamusing is that this is just the beginning of WWIII. <br>
Nobody said it had to involve nukes.<br>

<br>
&quot;What we know about Osama bin Laden is this -- he's worth $300 million, he has five wives and 26 kids ... and he hates Americans for their 'excessive' lifestyle.&quot; -- David Letterman<br>
<br>
&quot;The leaders of the Taliban said today that killing bin Laden won't solve the problem. But, you know, it couldn't hurt.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;More and more details coming out now about spoiled rich kid Osama bin Laden. Time reports this week he was one of 52 kids. Mother must be exhausted. This guy inherited $80 million at age 13 and has since expanded it to $300 million through construction, smart investments and gas and oil investments. This way, he can use the money in his war against capitalism.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;You read about all these terrorists, most of them came here legally, but they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you are two days late with a video and these people are all over you. Let's put Blockbuster in charge of immigration.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden. You know, he never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row, just like Clinton.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;This Osama bin Laden guy, spoiled rich kid worth $300M. I have three words for this guy: Anna Nicole Smith. We send her over there, she'll get his money, he'll be dead in a week.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has 50 brothers and sisters. Which absolutely shocked me because I had no idea he was Catholic&quot; -- Conan O'Brien<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the Taliban spokesmen said they have thousands of men who look forward to death like Americans look forward to living, which is great because we can arrange that. We'll set them up with death, we'll continue living.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;CBS News finally received anthrax in the mail. As usual, we're number three.&quot; -- David Letterman<br>
<br>
&quot;Things have really changed here in Hollywood. Used to be people in this town couldn't wait to get an envelope full of white powder.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't mean to harp on this, but it's like the networks are a how-to manual for terrorists. You see them on the news. This reporter is standing outside a water treatment plant, going, 'If they poured the poison here it could wipe out thousands because the guard is off duty from noon until 1 every day!'&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;Postal inspectors have been given advanced warning that Publishers Clearinghouse is sending packets of laundry detergent that could be mistaken for anthrax. Oh, good timing! What genius came up with this promotion? What's next? A ticking alarm clock? Let's put that in a box.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;The FBI is urging all Americans to beware of any letters or packages that have badly misspelled words. Man, this is going to be terrible news for the rap industry.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;In Pakistan anti-American protesters set a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on fire. The protesters mistakenly thought they were attacking high-ranking U.S. military official Colonel Sanders.&quot; -- Jimmy Fallon on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update<br>
<br>
&quot;Tomorrow night on NBC a very special episode of West Wing, it makes a direct reference to what happened in New York City. The exact plot is being kept top secret. We are the only country in the world where we put our battle plans on CNN, but the plots to our TV shows are top secret.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;Pakistan's ruler Pervez Musharraf predicted the Taliban will fall for hiding Osama bin Laden. Ex-king Zahir Shah is standing by to replace Mullah Mohammed Omar. And the most ominous sign of all, President Bush has learned all their names.&quot; -- Comedian Argus Hamilton<br>
<br>
&quot;There was a rumor that Jesse Jackson was going to go over there to talk with the Taliban; apparently they were having trouble rhyming the word Jihad.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;Now this really annoys me: All these people getting on the Internet and saying Nostradamus predicted this. If Nostradamus were alive today his name would be Miss Cleo and he'd be charging $2.99 a minute.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;The U.S. Government has said they are now going to go after the terrorist's electronic banking system. You know what they should do? They should transfer bin Laden's funds to my bank. They'd mess up his deposits, screw up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with service charges.&quot; -- Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;People want to say there isn't racial profiling at the airport, but let's be honest. If you first name is Mohammed, and your last name isn't Ali, arrive at the airport extra early.&quot;-- Jay Leno<br>

The Al Qaeda &quot;detainees&quot; were neither uniformed nor were they soldiers of any government/state.  Al Qaeda is a private army.<br>

So, at least with regard to those detainees they are correct in not granting them POW status.<br>

Well, I wasn't going to bother looking for thanks for not conquering the world *after* we saved it from Hitler (and Mussolini and Tojo) until you reminded me. And yes, we were the only nation since Rome that could have done it, after WWII. But we're so inhuman that we instigated the Marshall Plan instead, to the world's relief and our ruin.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
It wasn't &quot;holding out&quot;. It was minding our own business. Those Europeans and Asians wanna butcher each other, what should we care? If a few more nations in Europe had been &quot;isolationist&quot; in 1913, WWI would have been avoided.<br>

If you go chronologically it was 2 years two months, but that is not reality of the situation.  Even though we did not send troops, the USA was not equipped well to even enter WWII at its onset. In 1939 most of our army and army air corps was pitiful.  Our heaviest tanks were only equal to the German light tanks, our aircraft far from modern standards.  Yes, the P-36/H-75 Hawks held themselves well in France and Finland, but were not truelly up to the Spitfires and Bf-109's then available. The factories were starting to gear up and new designs were starting to take shape in research facilities.<br>
<br>
American Sailors died in the Atlantic prior to war being declared. At least 2 of our destroyers were torpedoed doing convoy duty prior to December 1941. The USS Reuben James went down near Iceland.  An old 4 stacker of WWI vintage, she almost became a rallying point like the Maine and Luistania before her.<br>
<br>
Most Americans thought of the initial parts of WWII as a Eurpoean matter, not wanting of our involvement.  FDR saw the need and started to bootstrap us so that we were more prepared then we were.  It is interesting that both FDR and Churchill worked together pretty much the same in WWI when both representated their respective Naval Departments.<br>
<br>
If you want to get technical, the SS was a private army as well, although armed by the state, its line of command went to the National Socialist Party not the Abwehr.  The paramount thing is that we follow Christian ideals.  Treating kindly those we take in battle.  We have outgrown the racist views we held in the WWII period.  <br>
