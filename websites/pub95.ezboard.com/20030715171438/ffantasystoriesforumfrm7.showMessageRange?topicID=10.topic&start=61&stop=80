He hadn't a clue what he was really doing.  He had to do something!  &quot;HALT!&quot;  His voice came out like a sudden, cold crack of a whip, surprising even Undeen slightly.  He rarely spoke like that.<br>
<br>
Hissing out a quick incantation, he rooted Brutus just out of reach of the undead he had been charging, and gave out a soft sigh of relief.  Brutus, on the other hand, turned to Undeen angrily.  &quot;Wha are ya doin?!&quot;  His wolf turned on Undeen, snarling and about to leap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two simple facts, Brutus.  Being a veteran warrior, and knowing there are at least three times as many Undead between here and the way out then you saw when you came in.  Were we to fight, we would die.  No questions asked.  Secondly, attacking your allies is NEVER prudent.&quot;  Undeen leveled a hard glare at Brutus and the pair stared off for multiple minutes.  Undeen's enstill spell wore off long before Brutus finally turned from Undeen's eyes when Undeen snarled, giving a flash of vampiric fangs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alroigh....  So ya's one's dem, an' they's our allies.&quot;  Brutus sounded in no way pleased, but made a signal, forcing his wolf to calm and come to his side.<br>
<br>
Walking to the ground again, Brutus whispered harshly to Undeen.  &quot;You get us killed, an' oi'll haunt ya all through moi afterlife..&quot;  <br>
<br>
Undeen simply nodded acceptance and turned back to the spirit before him.  &quot;I apologies for his actions.  He did not realize our agreement.  I will speak with him more completely upon what is to happen here shortly.  First, I believe it best, with your permission, we find a place to rest, regroup, and prepare for the attacks to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
The long dead shamaness looked over at Brutus, her eyes somewhere between anger and jealousy.  Jealousy that he is a living shaman, and she isn't, most likely.  The undead are often jealous of the living.  &quot;Ssssee that you do jussst that, Lar'Tesssse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding quickly, Undeen turned back to the group and motions for them to begin walking, seeking out a small house in the city.  Any house would do, really...<br>

I hated to flash my fangs like that.  It always made people think I was an actual vampire, as opposed to just a cursed Teir'dal family line.  It was a long, long story I didn't want to think about now, so instead I turned and entered a half ruined building that might once have been a house.  Then again, it could just as well have been an Iksar whore house.  One could never really tell, when there were few, to no living beings in the city and the buildings fell into ruin...<br>
<br>
I stood silently in the center of the main room for a while, gathering my thoughts, the others going to find places to sit or lay down and relaxe after the long walk.  Finally, when the shuffling of feet and rubbing of moving bodies ended, I turned and looked around at the ragtag group and sighed heavly.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  We're doomed...  We are f*cking doomed...  We're going to die, and I'll finally get to see Achi again..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a slight smile crossed my lips at that thought, then faded nearly instantly as I looked to Tani once more.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  By the gods, where ever the hell you may be hiding your bleach white *sses right now, if any of us are going to live, Tani will.  Even is I have to knock her out myself and translocate her back to Greater Faydark, she's going to make it..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Another sigh escaped my lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay..so what do we do Undeen?&quot; Derren was the first to speak.<br>
<br>
The words hit me like the cold slap of water against my face.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  They look to me like a leader.  They all do.  Even Brutus.  What am I going to tell them?  That they should all run to their perspective corners and hide, and save themselves what is likely to be a very painful, and slow death?  Or lie to them and try and convince them to fight?  Truth...  They'll appreciate the warning in the end.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
a soft swollow, a breath, and finally words slipped from tongue out onto the wind to be heard.  My voice didn't waver.  Brownie point for me.  &quot;Truthfully, it looks like we are going to hold ground at Old Torsis.  the Iksar are marching this way, they've been hearding the battle drums more recently.&quot;<br>
<br>
Derren seemed a little eager.  And even that little eagerness was too much.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Ugh....  I think I'm going to be sick when I see them all go pale after this...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Truthfully, I think the Iksar are going to march on Old Torsis.  They'll take heavy hits in the Jungle, but they will make it.  And I think we will all likely die here, a slow, horrible death.  But then, I tend to be very pesemistic when it comes to if I'll servive a fight or not.  Remember.  It only takes one arrow to kill you, no matter how good you are.&quot;  All their faces dropped and they all god a pale look.  The Erudite looked horrible.  Don't think he had thought he would die when he woke up this morning.  At least I had had that warning from the beginning.  And ya, the looks made me want to be sick right there.  Always did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right now, I'm willing to offer you a choice.  Stand and fight with myself, and the denizens of Old Torsis, or I can translocate out any of you who wish freedom.  I don't blame you, or claim cowardous, any who wish to leave.  I myself would leave, had I not a deathwish.&quot;  It sounded so silly I almost wanted to smile.  Almost.  Ya, to be with Achi again, I really did have a death wish.  She would be worth that couple minutes of pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;So.  Who stays and stares death in the faces with me, and who heads home to hug your families, and be thankful you made the decision that lets you remain with them?&quot;<br>
<br>
(ooc: Sorry about the blanking out on the curse words. (don't know how you guys take to that stuff. =P)  And now, you all get to decide.  Die a horrible death, forgotten in Old Torsis, or flee like cowardly dogs? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

She was a child having to make an adult decision. Stay and die. Or go and die. Either way her life would be ended soon enough. Her envolvment with one of the undergrounds had her playing runner, the next assignment could be her last, but she never saw it that way. She didn't see this that way either. Death didn't exist in the forever kind of way in her thoughts. Death was something that happened to grandma and grandpa when they got too old. Death was something that was forced apon criminals for their crimes. Death was not the thing standing before her, nor the thing that was to come so switfly on the scaled and tainted hands of a lizard. And so, she decided. In looking up at Undeen, over at the head-hung cat-man, the trembling erudite, and solemn barbarian that she knew, she would stay. He was waiting for her at home. He was always waiting. But he could wait just a bit longer, he wouldn't be mad. She was doing the right thing, wasn't she? If she made friends with all these people, maybe they all could be friends with Him. Then there wouldn't be any more fighting back home. Then she wouldn't have to hide in the trees or slip past the gaurds. She could be happy like she wanted, and he would be happy as well. That's all she wanted. She wanted Him to be happy. This would make Him happy. It had to. He would see she was no longer a child. He would see. With a reassuring nod and a stern face, she looks up at Undeen. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will stay. I want to help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes burned with determination as she stared up at the shadow elf. What... What if he didn't let her stay? Wouldn't he let her help? It was her decision. Her decision. Not his. With her little hands balled up in fists at her sides, she looks again from person to person. Why was it, that they all looked so... sad?<br>

Allied with undead... he never thought he'd see the day. Undeen, the shadow elf, the great mage, the commander of armies, the wizard of the Tier'Dal, was now without the Tier'Dal, without armies, without shadow from which to strike... but not without greatness. He'd shown that in unveiling the truth to the greenies.<br>
<br>
The barbarian thunked his spear butt to the ground once. &quot;Tha oak of Faydark,&quot; he thumped again. &quot;Tha frosts of Velious,&quot; **thunk** &quot;Tha wauters of Rathe,&quot; **thunk** &quot;Tha plains of Antonica,&quot; **thunkthunk** &quot;Tha swomps of Innothule...&quot; he let out three, mournful thunks, and hung his head, sweeping blue powder from a belt pouch. &quot;They've all felt my presence. They all feel it again...&quot; the powder swirled with the winds picking up in the abysmal structure. &quot;And now, they feel you as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
A luminescence poured forth from the spiral that weaved around the room, touching and wrapping around the party of five. Chattering sounds of the jungle swept across their ears, and the most vibrant colors stood out to their naked eyes. All senses heightened, all attributes amplified... &quot;The sp'rits deem ye worthy. We foight an' dai for ye. But ye must come outside with me fer a moment.&quot; Brutus put a fist to his heart, saluting the undead shamaness. She seemed indifferent to the gesture, which was better than the threatening look she gave at first...<br>
<br>
Past the stagnant pools and rotting walls, they made their way to the front of Old Torsis. &quot;Open the pow'r of yuir 'art...&quot; he muttered. From his pure, gentle heart, all the spirits that had joined him since his early days poured outwards, flowing freely from his massive body. Bats screeched and flew through the corporeal forms of his comrades, wolves were absorbed into their bodies, streaking lions and blurred bears danced around all about them- the shaman had done his work.<br>
<br>
Brutus himself felt super-charged with the spirits of the wilderness flowing through him most untamed than before; almost as if he could lift the entire Iksar army with one hand. A thought jolted him- &quot;Ayy. Remember that yuir not invincible now; merely strong. This is yuir pow'r unleashed, but ye ain't a god yet. Keep yuir 'ead.&quot; Luminescent animal-figures crowded in around the masses of thirsty undead. Natural and unnatural... who'da guessed?<br>
<br>
The barbarian opened his eyes again; he had amazing clairvoyance now, and could see farther and sharper, with less interferance than before! He wondered what powers the others had unlocked... No matter. He beamed, absolutely ecstatic, as he saw a tree limb bend down and cleave through a pair of Iksar necromancers. &quot;Undeen, ye blimy vampire,&quot; Brutus called. The heat of war made shimmering lines above his body. &quot;First blood is ours.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smirked. &quot;Good. And I'm no more a vampire than you are a wolf or tree.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tree? Brutus chuckled. &quot;Wot koind of tree? And couldja explain the teef deal then, eh?&quot; He tossed a spear to Nallu, and mouthed the words &quot;little brother&quot; at him. Maybe the wee man would be useful...? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uundeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Undeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/16/02 2:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Torsis</span><hr size=1> I absolutely beamed.  We were all going to stay, and the shaman was showing the power his kind was famous for.  A complete harnessing of spirit.  I continued to look over the area.  I couldn't see Iksar, but I knew Iksar.  They were out there.  They had come sooner then I had expected.  I was hoping at least for a horrible night's sleep first...  No matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Family trait.  I'll explain more later, when we have a bit more time..&quot;<br>
<br>
There.  The trees and plants were the only things currently with the Iksar, and they were anchored to the ground.  A gravity flux it was.<br>
<br>
I raised my hands and began to chant out the spell.  I couldn't tell for sure what the others did, but I would suppose they readied themselves to fight, and die.  &quot;Unto rathe thou art brought, atraction hold thee down.  inverse this attraction, and from the home of Rathe thou shalt rise!&quot;<br>
<br>
The spell was triggered, and a small troop of Iksar could be seen, suddenly hurled up, slashed and impaled by branches on the way up, and again on the way down.  I don't think any of them servived.  They hadn't expected that.  They weren't expecting much resistance at all, it seems.  A grim smile came to my lips then.  &quot;First blood indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The drums suddenly flared to life all around us, and the hisses of dieing Iksar were eminating from every tree and bush.  And suddenly.  Finally.  It happened.  All at once, sleek, scaled heads rose, and they charged.<br>
<br>
We were going to die.<br>

The blood splattered against the skewered Iksar monk he'd just yanked one spear from, and a warrior was right behind him afterwards. Before he had a chance to retaliate, a trio of wolves separated the lizard-man's limbs from his torso, and severed its neck. Brutus growled in appreciation, and the gesture was returned in full by blood-smeared muzzles. They howled and moved on to the next.<br>
<br>
The barbarian thrust his spear into the throat of a wizard behind him; she'd not seen the massive man, somehow, and was busy letting her heart magic flow in a steady stream, attempting to slice the heads clean off rows of undead. The more agilitous(sp?) ones ducked, and others kept walking without heads. Either way, her chest burst outwards in a torrent of flames as her life force was expended. Brutus smiled, and realized that the gash on his right arm had already healed. He let his mind go once more, and slipped into clairvoyant perception for a single instant;<br>
<br>
He saw the trees being chopped down. They skewered Iksar of their own volition, and even the elder Iksar spirits of the ancients that inhabited this forest rose up from their graves to steal the souls from the intruders. Wolves tore lizards apart. Leaches smashed whole groups before succumbing to the piercing and slashing. One gorilla crushed three monk skulls before recieving a heart-stopping punch from another. Brutus came back to his body, swelling with pride in his friends. In the instant, an arrow sped towards his face. They'd singled him out as a threat; time to play the defensive... if he could dodge...<br>
<br>
A blue luminescent spirit-form of a wolf snapped it's celestial jaws, cracking the shaft in half. The arrow dropped in mid-flight. &quot;Mayhaps tha sp'rits err MORE helpful than tha gods, eh?&quot; Brutus chuckled to himself as he took a high perch on a rock. He let out a war cry, emanating red waves of energy that pulsated the undead with new blood and vitality; their own charge sped up. Brutus opened his eyes, and the wave faltered.<br>
<br>
There, before him and the rapidly diminishing tide of skeletons and zombies, gorillas and raptors, was a horde of scaled soldiers, stretching even further than his horribley human eyes could see. &quot;Oh bloody fffffffffffffffff.......&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uundeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Undeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/19/02 2:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay now the FUN part!</span><hr size=1> I was running low on energy to use.  It was coming back quickly, thanks to the spirits, but fast, and fast enough, were so different it was sickening to think about.  I saw Brutus slay the &quot;wizardess&quot;, but I could also tell she was using this new, 'heart-magic'.  No wizardess at all.  The gods may have left, but the arcane arts cared not about the gods, or even the spirits.  Only the natural magic weave of Norrath, and that which makes us living, or undead, creatures.<br>
<br>
&quot;life...&quot;  A thought I dreaded to make more, but now....  I saw a flash of the flood of Iksar.  There was no turning back on this one.  I would have to go through with it.  Certain of that, I turned and fled behind the others, then stopped, preparing something I really didn't want to cast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep them off me!  I need-ERk!&quot; an arrow shaft seemed to just APEAR in my arm.  No time to think about it.  With a disgusting sucking sound, and a small whimper of pain, I pulled out the shaft and threw it aside, while ducking down in cover behind my allies.  &quot;I need time to do something!&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't wait for a reply.  I pulled out a cerimonial knife I kept with me, normally used to slaying idiot barons.  Now it would get used for it's true perpous.<br>
<br>
I cast a small spell that took nearly no energy.  a small eyeball was created from the ground, and my vision moved to it.  I had it float up so I could see my target.  The Iksar.<br>
<br>
I closed my real eyes and murmerd quickly &quot;may I be forgiven for this...&quot;  With that, my spell began, a long, intricate incantation, the knife slowly drawing my blood, draining my life, to feed the spell as only death can.<br>

What was Tani supposed to do? Iksar seem to fall all around her. Blood was everywhere... She stands, unable to swallow the grim scene. Her comrades fought, for that is what they knew to do, but she could not. What lay before her eyes kept her from knowing, from remembering anything she had known. Her knees lock tightly, and her arms sway slightly. What was this? War? This was war? No. No, this was not war. This was something different. What could it be?... Tani's mind had all but shut down. Iksar after iksar fell at the hands of the skilled men she should have been fighting beside.<br>
<br>
Not wishing to look any longer, Tani turns to the sky. It was empty just as it had always been. Today the heavens were painted a monotone gray that bled out onto the lands and crawl into your very being to bring it to the same melancholy color as it was. A brief smirk turned a corner of her lips up. Today was a good day for a funeral. Just as the gloomy world above begins to soak into Tani, something pounds against her foot. Slowly, she brings her chin back down. A lizard. It had rolled and it's head landed on her foot, its body sprawled out to her left. It was bleeding heavily and struggling with the last few breaths it would ever take. Tani let their eyes lock. Iksars weren't so bad... She found herself admiring the black orbs that glistened like oil staring back at her. A crystal droplet slipped from those beautiful reptile eyes and cascaded down its smoky gray scales. Iksars... cried? Its eyes leave hers and gaze towards the emptiness above. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cazzzac... for..forgive me&quot;<br>
<br>
Tani knew now, what this was. This was hope. This was the iksar’s attempt at bringing their beloved god back to them. This was not war; there were no enemies here. To them, they symbolized the one thing standing in the way of their god returning to them, the single thing stopping them for attaining their goals. How wrong they were. Tani was too young to know anything of how the world was before the gods, but she knew that her death, and the death of those with her, would not help return them to Norrath. This was the ignorant and blinding hope of the lizards, and this was death. Nothing would be gained today. Much would be lost. This was a good day for a funeral.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Long she stood. Her mind lay still somewhere between consciousness and otherwise. Nothing attacked her. Perhaps because of her size, they did not see her. Or perhaps because all she did was stand. Her undisturbed state allowed her to stay as she was all the more longer. A scream. A cry. A noise of some sort broke the binds on her mind and woke her to reality. Almost frantically her eyes jump from thing to thing. The dead, the blood, the fighting, the incomprehensible amount of iksar marching their way... She had to get out. She had to. Something deep within her soul told her to run, but her body would not budge. If their god was anywhere in sight, he would have been smiling down on the iksar. Tani was paralyzed with fear. A burning, electrifying sensation burst from her shoulder and leaked through her entire arm. Just as quickly as the pain had come, it was gone again. What in Tunare's name... Now a tickle. On the back of her neck. Knowing nothing else to do but turn, Tani does so. Undeen! He was hurt... One of these filthy beasts had shot him with an arrow! Blood... There was blood... It stained his robe and drizzled down his arm. Blood. They drew his blood. She could almost hear her molars grinding against each other and a twinge fluttered her eyebrow. <br>
<br>
<br>
They. <br>
<br>
<br>
Were all. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Going. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To die.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crystal blue eyes pierce the crowd of beasts that steadily increased despite the numbers that fell. Tani's slender fingers reach behind her and pull her daggers from her belt. They were all[/i] going to die... But which one first? Decisions, decisions... Tani heard a loud... 'meow' ? Spinning to her side she sees the feline-ish one sitting on his bum using his sword like a barrier to keep a rather grubby looking iksar from slicing him in two. How easy he made her choice. A devilish grin dances on her lips while she strolls over to the cat-man. She stands there a second, watching the beads of sweat form on his brow and the strain both him and the reptile had on their faces. Her grin diminishes into a snarly sort of grimace. Disgusting creature at her feet, Tani thinks its time for you to bleed. Twirling a dagger, she catches it and grips it firmly. First one should always be quick. After all, if you kill your opponent in a single strike, there is no need for a second. Tani thrusts the platinum blade through the skull of the cat-man's attacker. Pushing what little weight she had into her leg and down her foot, she kicks the brand new fountain she had just made off of the cat-man. She leaves her dagger in the tiny brain of the iksar and looks around. A dagger simply would not do! She needed something... bigger... Like that pretty sharp sword that savage looking iksar was using! Tani felt the great need for upgrade...<br>

   His sticks moved in a frenzied blur as they threw out the rhythm to his march of the battle. Roll after roll he kept his feet marking time in place behind his warrior companion gone blood-thirsty from the duts and clangs of his drum creating a pulse quickening cadence. The warrior let out a roar as he dropped his first opponent and moved to the next whirling to dodge and parry with the little sense he had left in him. Move, strike, move, kill! The bard’s hands grew slick with sweat but he kept his pounding rhythm up. Swing after swing after merciless swing the warrior rolled the heads of the charging Iksars. The bard played louder as a line of invisible drums played with him, the sound of an army of bards. The warrior dogged the blade of an Iksar's and spun to land his blade in it’s lungs then freed it only to land it again in another’s. A devilish grin spread across his face as he moved his blade in time with the roar of the drums. Blocking another sword he rammed the hilt of his own into the attackers face. Turning to kick an on coming opponent then landing a punch under another Iksar’s ribs causing it to keel over. He could feel his blood rushing faster as he let out a crazed battle cry and lunged for the next. The bard fought his own battle, struggling to keep up the pace, beads of sweat formed on his forehead as he twisted his hands into a double stick shift then into another roll keeping his ally in the berserker frenzy that he was now in. The bard let out his own howl as his muscles flexed with his strain as he broke into the hardest lick of the song. The warrior laughed as he tore threw the now retreating line of enemies. He came down with rage upon the death seeking Iksars.<br>
