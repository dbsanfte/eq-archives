The repetitious footfalls echoed off down the circular corridors, which twinkled like caverns of polished crystal. The long narrow fingers of Shigun’s left hand were curled tightly around the wooden scabbard of the shildien-edge, while the fingers of his right hand fidgeted at the blade’s smooth hilt, thumping with the anticipation of drawing it from its sheathe. Doorways, opening up to abandoned rooms that held little in the way of decoration, passed him on each side as he sped by.<br>
<br>
The Gridikkor’s mouth was set into a slight frown. His flat, thin lips worked only to take in quick breaths of air every now and then. After getting accustomed to the cleaner air at a higher altitude, the poisoning blue fog which cloaked the entire lower city was beginning to take its effects on him once again. It felt almost like his lungs were filling with sand, each intake making them heavier and drowsier. If he stayed here much longer it could very well lead to the end of him.<br>
<br>
After dashing past the visible courtyards and back to the main entrance, Shigun paused for a brief moment. He rested his back against a wall, leaning the shildien-edge––which was twice as long as he was tall––alongside himself. His sloping nose came down to a carrot-tip point, beads of perspiration dripped and rolled along its length despite the chilly air around him. Rest would be needed if it came to battling whoever had entered the city, someone he feared was...<br>
but his thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of stone crashing against stone filling his ears. The trap within the statues outside had been sprung. Maybe it had just taken care of the problem for him, but if it was who he thought, that would be doubtful.<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the sound; the silver fibers attached to his sight follicles fanned outward, protruding like long whiskers from his brow. His eyeless face was slightly ruddy, with white being the prime color showing on his moderately wrinkled skin. Long snowy hair flowed down across his ovally ears and rested on his shoulders; a few tendrils of hair in the front stuck out and hung limply down across the folds of his forehead. A brown robe covered his thin frame from the neck down––nearly reaching the heels of his blade-like boots. He was of average height for a Gridikkor, being over two and a half shoulder to arm-lengths tall.<br>
<br>
After hearing the stone swords pulverizing and shaking the ground; Shigun darted swiftly from wall to wall, taking refuge behind open doorways or folds in the glass walls. Stealth would probably do him little good here, since the glossy hall reflected everything like a mirror. He steadily made his way back down the corridor to where he had entered, becoming only a robed streak rushing to meet the double doors at its end. His boots scudded to a halt right before the entrance. Placing his ear against the cold frame of the shiny door, he listened for anything that might betray natural noises.<br>
<br>
Everything seemed normal, and Shigun was about to open the door, until a faint sound persuaded him to hone in on what was happening outside once again. It was a minuscule tapping, or maybe it was something dripping, pitter-pattering onto the stone. Yes, something was steadily trickling on the other side, like the plucking of an icicle melting into a cave floor puddle. <br>
<br>
At last, understanding and realization crossed Shigun’s features. His mouth twisted into a frown as he back-pedaled away from the door. The room around him wasn’t very large––being only a mere box with glittering borders and a few sparse pieces of furniture––but it would be the place where he would have to make his stand. If he tried to run the other way, the glass towers stationed at the other entrance would fire upon him like lightning heads from a storm cloud. He feared what he was about to face...could it be him? Returned from the Faded Dimension? No, if he truly thought that then he was believing in a delusion, but the threat at hand could be just as potent.<br>
<br>
A few quiet moments passed, then slick oily pools began to seep through the cracks at the bottom of each doorway, sliding forward and spreading out as if they had minds of their own. The shadowy liquid contrasted with the glimmering walls all around them, moving ever closer then finally coming to a stop. Lines of steam were almost visible evaporating from the putrid substance, it smelled worse than bile formulated from vomit and bodily waste, almost to the point of gagging. This was a gruesome product of the Crimson Hounds, beasts straight from Tower Vozz––which was once the lair of Dardaroff. The liquid the hounds secreted was known to flood from their mouths, body, and areas where the excreta came from on most animals.<br>
<br>
Shigun squinted his nose up, trying his best to block out the impeccable reek which seemed to be overtaking the entire room. Mixed in with the suffocating mist, there couldn’t be a more foul alliance of sensations. <br>
<br>
In the palm of Shigun’s left hand, he held forward the wooden scabbard of the shildien-edge. With one fluid motion from his right, the blade rang free from its case. The thin steel gripped tightly in his hand was nearly invisible from the angle he was looking at it from, flipping it around, the flat side faced him with the thread-like end menacingly directed toward the black ooze. <br>
<br>
The puddles were like beacons to mark pathways for other spawns of Dardaroff, not only that, but supposedly the one who directed the Crimson Hounds could use the puddles as windows, being able to view the world through any of them. If the Crimson Hounds were loose, then the Unconsecrated Ones must have been unleashed somehow as well...Is this what his dream was warning him of? And what about the words the Kredonicle had spoken? It told him nothing that he didn’t really already know. He recollected the following:<br>
<br>
The First Sire gifted Rumolien to the First Matron, whose hands gently caressed the world.<br>
Master of creation, her breath blessed us in a swirl of bliss, filling us with life’s sweet touch.<br>
Will we ever see her all-knowing face? Our hearts yearn on with unwavering hope.<br>
Be our savior from the ireful touch of the Master’s scorching blood.<br>
Defeated in battle by the hand of the outlander, who journeyed from the lowlands.<br>
By the clemency of death, the outlander was whisked away, sent to the Lands of Benediction.<br>
The Arch Nyriad was slain, by will wrought in the forge of malice, her Dreamer was lost.<br>
Child of hope, your footsteps shine a path for us all, leading up to your inevitable downfall.&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<br>
It was all common knowledge, except for the last line, who was the child spoken of? Shigun supposed it mattered little now, especially if he failed to escape the city with his life.<br>
<br>
The black gunk slowly retracted away, flowing beneath the doorframe and vanishing as quickly as it came, leaving the glimmering floor in its path sullied into a darkened char. Footsteps drummed across the stone from the other side, accompanied by the scuffling of paws, drawing nearer. Shigun knelt down, like a coil ready to spring. He placed his right leg forward and left leg back, preparing to pounce with steel and bladed boots on whoever was approaching. <br>
<br>
The footfalls scratched to a halt right on the other side of the door. A shadow blotched out the dim outer light from passing beneath the slit of the doorframe. A man’s familiar voice called out; it was gentle, quiet, and almost soothing, “Shig? Is that you in there, Shig?”<br>
<br>
With a thunderous clap that could have cracked the sky; the doors were blasted from their hinges. The doors were completely demolished into fist-sized fragments that whizzed by with the force of the blow and perforated the walls with deep gaps, sending parts of the glassy structure spraying everywhere onto the floor like a broken window. Luckily, Shigun had rolled aside and avoided getting hit by all the speeding projectiles. <br>
<br>
From the veil of the blue fog stepped a man garbed in a white robe, his polished black shoes made a slight scuffling as he walked inside. Square silvery tiles––containing the swirly and curvy symbols of Hamotsfu lettering––were embroidered up from the hem of his robe in a straight line that went all the way up to the clothing’s collar. The sleeves of the garment were puffy and baggy, almost concealing the man’s hands. In one hand he clutched a spindly staff, resembling blue and white threads spun tightly together, leading all the way up to a golden crescent shape at its tip. The man’s body looked a little frail and thin, but not to the point where flesh was pulled taut across bone. His young face was smooth and round, without a flaw impeding on any of its features. He stared inquisitively at Shigun, with eyes that were swirls comparable to the greenest mid-summer meadows. They held a serenity of their own, those eyes, a gentleness that Shigun was almost tempted to believe in. Golden locks of hair hung loosely down to the man’s shoulders, tendrils of it dangling across his front and back. Shigun knew this man, he knew him all too well. Larrikous Solwaran; the Excommunicated Priest and an Unconsecrated One.<br>
<br>
Larrikous’s pristine lips folded up into a mirthful smile, he took a few steps forward. “It’s been awhile. I see you haven’t really changed a bit, neither has this city, except for the fog of course. This mist, a nasty thing it is, steals the air right from the lungs and fills them with toxins. How did it come into being?”<br>
<br>
Shigun’s mouth narrowed down as he hoisted up the Shildien-edge with one hand, the long slim blade extended across the room and halfway reached Larrikous. His voice took on a tone of scolding, “I don’t care to answer any of your questions...You are no longer who you once were. Now we are enemies, you and I, by your own choice.” Shigun shook his head dismally. “Your decision to turn away from Hamotsfu, for shame...”<br>
<br>
Larrikous’s body shuddered with a laughter so dry it could have made sand seem like running water. He raised his hands and cupped his head, while his eyes began to dimly glow like fiery green lanterns. The man’s voice became deep and sinister, “For Hamotsfu I live, for Hamotsfu I serve, for Hamotsfu I die!” ––the last words rolled off his tongue in mockery–– “A belief which I once firmly clung to. But no more, I didn’t turn away from Hamotsfu; he turned away from me.” The man’s fair lips curled up even more, into a mad grin––insanely mad. “She was taken from me! My Ferfenthina...” His voice trailed off with sadness, it seemed almost like he was about to burst into a crying fit. “And when I needed it the most...Hamotsfu didn’t shine through...” He continued on in a stronger inflection. “That’s why I went to Dardaroff! A god of substance, not just an invisible hope but something real!”<br>
<br>
Shigun’s lower lip scrunched up over his upper, giving him an almost bulldog expression. He couldn’t bring himself to find pity for the man standing before him. Larrikous was an old friend––or had been rather––until he had sold himself over to Dardaroff. Like so many others during the War of Redemption; greed and desire had drowned out his sense of reason. What Larrikous had done was a selfish act, despite doing it out of love for his counterpart.<br>
<br>
Shigun gruffly regarded the other. The shildien-edge was held motionless at his side. It would take less than a second to close the distance and cut the other man down. “I’ve heard stories like yours in many different shapes, sizes, and forms. From many different tongues, all speaking in the same foul voice. All having one thing in common, selfishness. I don’t pity you or any of them. You chose for yourselves, and now you’ve become hollow unfeeling vassals. Dardaroff didn’t grant you anything, he was an empty soul, full of vacated promises,” replied Shigun dispassionately, lowering his brow and looking at the other. Larrikous’s demented expression didn’t change. Shigun continued on, changing the subject, “Anyway, I’m certain you didn’t come here just to find me. If you’re looking for the Kredonicle, it’s already gone.”<br>
<br>
Larrikous’s mouth rose curiously, he tapped his chin and looked up at the ceiling. “Well, the trip here was all a waste then. The Master will have to be found some other way.” His fingers stopped thrumming and he turned his blazing green eyes back down on Shigun. “Convenient to find you here. We can’t have you running around and disrupting our plans, so I’m afraid we’ll have to send you to Tower Vozz.” The man stroked a straggling lock of blonde hair from his face and placed it behind his ear. “The painful way, of course.”<br>
<br>
Through the crumbled doorframe behind Larrikous; Shigun could see two hunched-over shapes skulking forward on all fours, finally appearing from the obscuring net of blue mist. The Crimson Hounds, their broad sinewy shoulders rolled and rippled with each methodical step. Their sharply deformed paws––which looked more like talons suited for a bird of prey––clicked on the stone, accompanied by the steady drip of an excreted oily substance pouring from their bodies. They were hairless, with the entire frame of their bodies colored dark red, as if they had bathed in blood for centuries. Their eye sockets were empty cavities with orange and red dots flaring up between set intervals like candles flickering behind the grim face of a jack-o-lantern. Their jaws were filled with rows of lean, dagger-like teeth, looking more like they belonged out in the woods serving as bear traps than on the faces of these creatures.<br>
<br>
Shigun was not about to wait for them to strike first. In a blur of deftness and skill honed in from years of practice, he glided forward with the long shildien-edge gripped firmly in each hand. Larrikous’s green eyes dilated into astonished wide saucers as he caught a glimpse of the thin, sharpened end of Shigun’s blade slicing through the air to receive his blood. But the Excommunicated Priest refused to die on this day––stepping into the Faded Dimension quicker than he ever had before––he bounced away from the length of steel that whistled past where he was standing a split second ago. A safe distance away––back outside and cloaked within the blue mist––Larrikous stepped out of the Faded Dimension. It was very dangerous to so boldly step into the Faded Dimension without prior mental preparation. He was fortunate that he hadn’t been absorbed into it––or gored on the end of Shigun’s sword for that matter. The man knelt down in exhaustion, white robe puffing out around him. He smoothed a hand across his neck just to reassure himself that he hadn’t lost his head.<br>
<br>
Before Shigun could give pursuit, the Crimson Hounds stepped forward and barred passage through the crumbled entryway. They reared back on their muscular haunches, ostentatiously baring hooked fangs as their throats emitted low, blood curdling growls. Long black tongues limply sloshed back and forth from their jowls, a bubbling black substance dripping from their tips.<br>
<br>
In response to their taunting growls, Shigun placed both feet together, standing unmoving near the doorway, his blade full of potential energy waiting to be released. Awaiting Shigun’s first move, the beasts grew impatient. They each coiled back then launched themselves forward, elongated jaws spread wide open to dine on gridikkor flesh. Black ooze, which seemed to have no end, trailed out behind them.<br>
<br>
Despite their speed and reflexes, Shigun’s reprisal caught the Crimson Hounds off guard while they were still airborne. The shildien-edge rang out then was interrupted by several fleshy thunks; the blade redressed each of the attackers with a horizontal slash followed by a vertical one. In concordance to Shigun’s counterattack, dismembered body parts and two mangled carcasses thumped to the ground, covered in sleek black coats of their own life fluid. Paws twitched and spasmed from nerves sending them mixed signals. The flaming eyes of the beasts grew bright then dimmed like dying embers, until at last they settled on blackness. The simple brains of the beasts still hadn’t registered that Shigun’s blade had sliced through them yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
After kicking the black-stained corpses aside, Shigun stepped through the entryway and into the city. The blue fog persevered all around him, making the guardian statues and outer wall ahead appear to be shadowy outlines. The air out here was more poisonous than that inside; it now weighed heavily and pierced Shigun’s lungs as if he were breathing in sharp icicles. But on the positive side, at least the stench of the Crimson Hounds had been left behind. <br>
<br>
Larrikous was crouched down in the mist some distance away, preparing to phase stride. Shigun could reach him without phase striding if he was quick enough––he was always reluctant to phase stride if it could be avoided. In a flurry of movement, his boots pounded across the stone walkway as he pulled back his blade and flew toward Larrikous. The priest’s eyes fluttered wide open in trepidation at the sound of Shigun’s footfalls soaring across the ground. Waves of mist parted before the tan-robed figure as he burst through clouds of it, while his sword raked in from the side and shrieked out death’s imminent lament. The blow would have been fatal, had Larrikous not reacted quickly enough to raise his staff and deflect it. The shildien-edge twanged as it rebounded off the slender staff, the blade’s tip scraping across the ground from the recoil. With a muffled grunt, Larrikous fell backwards, tripping over his own feet and landing flat on his back from the force of his opponent’s strike.<br>
<br>
Following his recovery from the previous attack, Shigun raised his blade and prepared to finish off his enemy. “Larrikous, I regret that this will only send you back to Tower Vozz.” But before he could do the deed, three shapes appeared in the mist behind Larrikous, treading with confidence in their steps. More Unconsecrated Ones? It had to be, no one else would venture into this forsaken place besides himself. Shigun coughed hoarsely several times, a reminder that he needed some fresh air soon.<br>
<br>
In front of him, the Unconsecrated Ones came fully into sight, walking out of the blue haze and halting a good distance away. Larrikous, expecting to receive a deathblow, opened his eyes and quickly glanced over his shoulder. Relief inundated his face at the sight of his comrades. He stood up and brushed himself off, running back to hide behind the towering figure standing foremost in the middle, a looming Tanzar. The charcoal-faced Tanzar sneered like an enraged boar at the priest’s brazen cowardice, his muscular fingers fiddled with the haft of his vergrad-blade; a weapon with blades lining the shaft and spiked balls attached to dangling chains on each end. It looked like the Tanzar was debating with himself whether or not to smite the priest where he stood. Finally, he decided it would be best just to let the lesser being continue living. <br>
<br>
Now, the tanzar turned his attention and penetrating stare toward Shigun. His two eyes were giant black egg-shapes, taking up the greater portion of his face. Sunny pupils, the size of a normal man’s eye, dotted the center of each dark bulbous oculus. The tanzar’s thick hair was the same tone of black as his skin, it was twisted into three topknots, which hung halfway down his back. Aside from his eyes, the other dominating feature on his face was a huge nose, coming close to being a snout with its gaping nostrils. His flabby lips grinned a toothy white smile that betrayed his other dark features. Each tooth was blocky and flat on the surface, but they looked powerful enough to grind rock into powder. The tanzar stood taller than anyone else, his muscular build was scrunched into a light-weight armor that looked like it was made of tiny forged bones linked together like chain mail. The armor only covered him across the chest, then from the elbows down to the knees down. Garbitter Macdulen was this creature’s name. He was the undisputed captain of the Unconsecrated Ones, though they seldom obeyed his orders if they could avoid it. Still, none of them seemed to have bravery enough to denounce him openly if they had a quarrel with his leadership. He was a tanzar, a race of purely corrupted men and all that that entailed. They led violent lives, always struggling for more power and wealth, crushing those who stood in their way of it. They were prideful and headstrong, often using forthright means to accomplish their goals of domination. Despite them being cruel and barbaric, some of them were honorable to an extent––Garbitter was one such.<br>
<br>
After sizing his foe up, Garbitter spoke in a huffing bellow that would have made a bull envious, “Salutations Shigun, from one warrior to another.” He glanced back at Larrikous, who was trying to distance himself apart from them as much as possible. Garbitter swung his head back to face Shigun. “You gave him quite a scare, the spineless human. After all, that’s why god created tanzar, because his first version of man was too weak and puny. They should all be purged from this land––the humans. But gridikkor like yourself, I respect you. We are almost equals.”<br>
<br>
Shigun was so focused on Garbitter that he hadn’t really taken notice of the other two Unconsecrated Ones yet. An average-built man, wrapped in a crimson cloak that encircled him from front to back, stepped forth alongside Garbitter. His arms were hidden from view behind the wrinkles of his flowing red cloak. The man’s only other visible frontal feature was a small slit of glittering plate mail, shining down the middle where his cape was slightly parted to the side. The man’s eyes were hidden behind a red triangular visor riddled with holes, attached to a round helmet shaped to fit someone with high cheekbones. The face guard itself protruded like a bloody bird beak, hiding the man’s nose and eyes, but leaving his unshaven brown beard and pale lips exposed to the environment. This figure was imposing enough to draw away Shigun’s attention, it took him only a microsecond to realize who it was. Macbayeth! Now an Unconsecrated One? He should have known...<br>
<br>
Macbayeth’s voice was deep and throaty, a rasping echo which almost seemed to carry throughout the entire city, “Shigun my old friend, a strange place for us to reunite.” Garbitter cast the man an agitated glance, annoyed that he had been interrupted. Macbayeth seemed not to notice though.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shigun lifted the shildien-edge, holding it firmly upright. “You have the nerve to call me ‘friend’? You are the catalyst that started the downfall of our world! I still can’t believe that we once fought together...Now you are just a traitor clinging onto life for as long as you can. If I had an Unseen Sword, I would wipe you out of existence right this moment!”<br>
<br>
Macbayeth’s lips and beard bristles rolled up into a far from friendly smile. “You assume everything, yet you know nothing. I was the one who was betrayed during the War of Redemption! By the one I trusted most, while you were off fighting your own personal battle.” The man’s voice became quieter, almost a whisper. “I was not ready to die then, so I took matters into my own hands.” Macbayeth swung an arm and flung his cloak back across his shoulder. A scabbarded sword was now visible at his right side, not just any sword, but an Unseen Sword! The hilt seemed translucent and wavy, as if it was about to disappear into a puff of white smoke at any moment. It was the ancient weapon of Arch Nyriad Missenadala, a blade which could efface anyone from the Spirit Flow forever. Everything was beginning to make sense to Shigun now. <br>
<br>
Macbayeth slowly began to draw the weapon free of its sheathe. He beamed a sardonic grin at Shigun, “I haven’t been able to test it much yet, perhaps you will volunteer?” The wispy and whimsical looking blade was in actuality much longer than the scabbard it was being pulled from, as if it was somehow compacted inside of it. It would be invisible to most, only phase striders and those under the effects of the palwaa leaf drug would be able to see it.<br>
<br>
Upon seeing the sword, Shigun steadily backed away into the mist. No choice now but to phase stride if he had to go up against all of them. Four against himself, less than favorable odds. The remaining Unconsecrated One was Vallgnar, the Voiceless Minstrel, a man with scarlet hair so long that it seemed to enfold him in a cloak if its locks. He wore a wide-brimmed hat which was tall and not very sturdy, looking more like a crooked steeple on a church. The hat hid most of his dainty facial features, which seemed affixed into a permanent mask of melancholiness. He was garbed in a loose-fitting, ruffled blue vest, buttoned down the middle with golden coins. Also, it was encrusted along the sleeves and collar with pebble-sized rubies. His fingernails were elongated black ovals; nearly half as long as his fingers themselves were, glistening as if they had been polished by an expert beautician. Most likely, he was seeking his voice, which had been cut from his throat during the War of Redemption. <br>
<br>
This was only a portion of the Unconsecrated Ones, the others must still be trapped or perhaps they were causing evil deeds elsewhere. Most notably, Sarakta of Deception was missing, a dangerous foe if left to wander.<br>
<br>
Seeing Shigun on the defensive, Macbayeth prepared to lunge, but a bulky black hand swung in front of him and blocked him off. Garbitter hoisted up his vergrad-blade with his other arm, briefly turning toward Macbayeth. “Stand aside, it wouldn’t be fair if we rushed him all at once now, would it? I will battle him alone.”<br>
<br>
Macbayeth shoved the Unseen Sword back into its scabbard. “As you wish, but if you find you’ve taken on more than you can handle don’t expect me to join the fray,” said Macbayeth, his voice uncaring and indifferent.  <br>
<br>
Garbitter replied with a guttural laugh, he was bred for battle, it’s not like he would ever be defeated. He gripped the shaft of his vergrad-blade and approached Shigun, resounding heavy footfalls across the stone in his wake.<br>
<br>
Already, Shigun was stepping into the Faded Dimension, balancing himself between reality and an irrational world. It was like standing half and half on a line where a scorching desert stopped and a freezing wasteland began. New sensations nearly overwhelmed his old senses, seeming to work against them at first, but then coming to a common median. It took awhile for things to meld together into something discernable. The colors of everything around him were countless, as if all the semblance of autumn and its leaves were thrown into a bubbling cauldron, then stirred into a rainbow mixture and poured down upon the entire world. However vivid it appeared, things were unmoving and quite inanimate between worlds like this. The images of the three Unconsecrated Ones standing off to the side were opaque shadows amidst all the colors, frozen in a still frame. Codo’zenn, Shigun’s teacher, had assumed the reason for this was that phase striders were moving at the speed of light, so everything else appeared as it had last been seen. It made sense to an extent, after all, if you’re running away from an arrow at the exact same speed it is shooting towards you, does the arrow move?<br>
<br>
The Faded Dimension was always trying to draw in more; Shigun could feel it beckoning him to fully submerge himself into it. Maintaining equilibrium between both dimensions was like teetering on the edge of the world on one toe, that’s why phase striding was never done for prolonged periods of time. There were actually beings that lived in the Faded Dimension, though coming across them could have fatal consequences.<br>
<br>
The Faded Dimension had no laws or boundaries, Shigun simply floated up from where he was, hovering through mixed shades of bright and dark colors. This was not a sight seeing venture though, the tanzar would be coming to battle him soon. In response to his thoughts, he heard a ‘shuwee, shuwee, shuwee’ sound approaching from below. As the noise reached its crescendo, Shigun thrust the shildien-edge downward to intercept the attack, it sparked off of a whirlwind of blades, knocking the gridikkor spinning head over heels from the backlash. There was no up or down anymore, just free space. Shigun had to will himself to come to a stop. He heard Garbitter laughing from somewhere distant, as if he had just been toying around. From strands of color behind Shigun, the tanzar appeared from obscurity, flying forward like a black shadow prepared to deal out death. The vergrad-blade was spinning so fast in the hands of his foe that it appeared to be one solid circle, like a shield of cutting blades pressing forward. Shigun spun around and brought his lengthy sword looping into the barrage of blades and flails, which struck back with such force that the shildien-edge was wrenched free of Shigun’s grasp. The gridikkor grimaced and plunged downward to reclaim his sword that was falling away. The tanzar chuckled with amusement and sped after in pursuit, his vergrad-blade still singing out its windy ‘shuwee, shuwee, shuwee,’ all the while.  <br>
<br>
Shigun finally caught up to his blade. Gripping the hilt with both hands, he spun around to face Garbitter once again. At this rate, there was little hope that he could win. The Faded Dimension was starting to weigh down on him, in addition to being weakened from overexposure to the poisonous mist. <br>
<br>
The tanzar was almost on top of him now, being seconds away, his spinning vergrad-blade making an impenetrable wheel of defense. At last, Shigun had an idea, now if he could just put some distance between himself and the other...The gridikkor flew away from the Tanzar as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Garbitter stopped twirling his weapon for a moment, looking a bit confused. Suddenly, he burst out laughing at himself for overestimating his foe this much. How pathetic could one be if they were trying to escape while in the Faded Dimension? Shigun was no more than just a whelp, and it was time to finish him off. Suddenly, the gridikkor whirled around from his retreat, now diving head-first for the tanzar. Garbitter chuckled in spite of himself and began to twirl his weapon once again, what kind of foolishness could Shigun be planning now?<br>
<br>
Colors streamed and swirled all around Shigun as he plummeted forward. Now, if he could do this right...He took a guess at which way his enemy’s weapon was spinning, then thrust his own body into a gyrating projectile to mimic it. The tanzar watched him in bewilderment, never slowing his vergrad-blade for an instant though. Shigun’s perspective rotated and spun as fast as a wheel going downhill, from his view, the vergrad-blade was beginning to slow down, and the body of the tanzar was beginning to speed up, as if the weapon and the wielder were in reversed positions. At last, Shigun’s rotating speed equally matched that of the vergrad-blade, so the entire weapon appeared to not be moving at all, while Garbitter was a spinning blotch behind it.<br>
<br>
Garbitter finally realized what was happening, but it was too late. As Shigun arrived in striking range, a thin line of white slashed through the tanzar multiple times, like a maelstrom of scissors, fleshy squeals following each blow.<br>
<br>
After looking down at his body and realizing that it was now just a jigsaw puzzle of red incisions marks, Garbitter tried to bellow out in agony, but the only thing that came from his lips and tongue was a river of blood. He forced himself out of the Faded Dimension, dying here would damn him forever. The world slowly shaped itself back to normal. The blue mist returned and his enhanced senses fleeted away. <br>
<br>
The tanzar was standing on stone once again, or kneeling rather. Despite red streams cascading from every part of his tattered body, he was still slightly alive. If he could have chuckled he would have, but he soon realized that he was not in the safest of positions––he was right in between the stone guardians. His black eyes found enough strength to look upward, where a stone sword was now crushing down to bequeath death onto him. With a rocky thud followed by a bloody squish, red-stained chunks of Garbitter exploded everywhere. His entrails blew up all around him; decorating the ground, the passive faces of the statues, and nearby trees with scarlet droplets and puddles.<br>
<br>
From the perspective of the three Unconsecrated Ones standing aside, the battle had lasted only for a moment. All that had taken place from their view  were both combatants stepping into the Faded Dimension then a second later Garbitter reemerging bloodied and near death.<br>
<br>
Shigun flickered and reappeared a distance away from where Garbitter had been slain. The gridikkor sheathed his red-coated sword and collapsed to his knees, clutching at his chest. He crouched down in pain, taking deep inhales of the toxic air.<br>
<br>
Macbayeth flung off his red cloak, it sailed and landed on the ground in a crumpled heap a good length away. The Unconsecrated One then brandished the Unseen Sword. “I won’t be missing Garbitter much, but despite Shigun doing us this little favor he must die as well. If he already found the Kredonicle he may know more than he deserves to.” The man walked over to where Shigun lay in his death throes. “Seems you’ve been breathing in this befouled air for a little too long, hm?”<br>
<br>
Shigun’s face contorted into an animalistic sneer as he looked up at Macbayeth looming over him. Speaking between gasps, he forced out the words, “I’ll never...let you...have the pleasure...of killing me.” As soon as he said that, he simply faded away, like light being chased out by a shadow.<br>
<br>
Larrikous dashed over to where the gridikkor had vanished from, his eyebrows were raised quizzically. “What happened to him?”<br>
<br>
Macbayeth sheathed his weapon and thoughtfully scratched at his beard for a moment. Suddenly, he threw back his head and unleashed a boisterous fit of laughter, almost to the point of crying. He regained his posture for an instant. “Shigun allowed himself to be absorbed into the Faded Dimension, ha!” <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=154.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=154.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.threadControl?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1>General Fantasy Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
