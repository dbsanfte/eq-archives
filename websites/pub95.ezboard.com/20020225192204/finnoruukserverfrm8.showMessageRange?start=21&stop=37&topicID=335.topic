I'm highly amused by the current patriotic bandwagon. The rebel without a clue has become the patriot without a clue. Most of the people displaying flags are doing so in an inappropriate manner (it took a small bit of willpower not to demolish a booth at a mall recently that was loaded with t-shirts with the flag stamped on them... )<br>
Before 9/11, I used to stop at shopping center offices, car dealerships and even a firestation or two to inform them that it was past time to turn their tattered and worn flags in for proper disposition. One or two people were idiot enough to try to argue the expense of replacing the flags with me.<br>
<br>
The most amusing aspect of the sheep-mentality I encountered recently was Bill O'Reilly pushing &quot;The Factor&quot; t-shirts and crap. Lemme get this straight.. I'm supposed to be so enamored of your show that I go and spend more money than it's worth for a t-shirt that *advertises* your show?&quot;  Sad part is, the t-shirts are probably selling like hotcakes.<br>
I'm considering sending invoices off to various product manufacturers, charging them for the billboard space my chest provides...<br>

If something is really good (LotR, Queen, Dylan) and people like it, they suck?   Just how does that make any sense at all.<br>
<br>
By the way.   I saw Star Wars when it first came out.   I liked Queen and Dylan since the '70's.   I first read LotR in the '70's.  Are you telling me that when other people notice just how good these things are, then everyone that already liked them should just &quot;jump off the bandwagon&quot; and pretend they didn't?<br>

Taking one of your examples, if'n my 18 year old brother never heard of Queen until Wayne's World, he's not allowed to like Bohemian Rhapsody?  Or are you just better'n him 'cause you heard it first?<br>

These fads sometimes happen because someone advertises an underestimated, good piece of culture.

<br>
Not really what I'm yelling about.  Those who are slower to catch on would probably hold my favor more simply because less people enjoying &lt;cultural phenomenon&gt; means that &lt;cultural phenomenon&gt; doesn't get cheapened as quickly by overcommercialization.  My old roommate used to brag that he saw Pearl Jam in concert before they were big at some oh-so-underground club.  Gratz him.  I don't really care.  But...I think he made the comments in response to the flood of people who became Pearl Jam fans overnight after the release of the &quot;Ten&quot; album.  After that, the experience of seeing them was probably diluted for him in a way.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
To those that are confused:  Like what you wanna like.  Its of no consequence to me, and I don't think you suck because of it.  There's a bumper sticker out there that says &quot;never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.&quot;  I think this is relevant, in that a large group of idiots has the power to ruin something that was otherwise 'cool.'  I don't think that one person sucks....I think that people suck in general.<br>
<br>
In any case, I'm not looking for some &quot;Eureka!&quot; solution to the problem of overcommercialization.  Its not gonna happen.  Just tossing an idea out there that irks me.  Feel free to pick it apart.<br>

<br>
It's as old as the hills.  A few folks discover, or come up with, a great and wonderful idea, thing, movement, vision, etc.   The few faithful enjoy it immensely.  Then someone decides it's selfish to keep it all to themselves.  They put it out there so others might enjoy it as well.  Sometimes it doesn't catch on.  Sometimes it becomes &quot;the IN thing&quot;, or the latest fad.  Perhaps the marketeers get involved.  As more and more people become involved, it's highly likely the original good thing can become diluted, or, worst case, become totally twisted from it's original roots.  The original few faithful can go anywhere from shocked horror to living with what remains good about it.  Sometimes the fadishness(?) dies out, and sometimes the faithful carry on after it's no longer popular.  Sometimes it lives on mutated, with none of the faithful involved.  Sometimes portions of the original can live on.<br>
<br>
This can be applied to almost anything, from personal computers to &quot;political correctness&quot; to Christianity to the American Revolution to the Grand Order of the Impudent Gophers.<br>
<br>
And, yes, it can certainly be applied to EQ.  For example, when the total population of Innoruuk was 200, the MUD's people, Dungeons and Dragon people, and readers of Tolkien/fantasy all seriously roleplayed, evil vs good, noble acts, heroic acts, etc.  It was quite commonplace to hear Skin Like Wood referred to as &quot;Barkskin&quot;.  Forty people in Oasis would join together to kill Lockjaw, and hand the tunic to the poor soul who originally aggroed him, after he ran back for his body. <br>
How many members of older guilds, can say their families currently are exactly the way they were when formed, resemble exactly what the founders of the guild envisioned when it was formed?<br>
<br>
The best the faithful can hope for is to keep the core of the &quot;vision&quot; alive.  They can adapt, try to keep the &quot;core vision&quot; alive, or run away screaming.  Sometimes I am glad I am thick-skinned, stubborn, and pigheaded. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I thought your post smacked of elitism.  I've observed  similar attitudes amongst so many of my friends regarding music, or as someone else earlier mentioned the whole &quot;i liked them when they were cool before they sold out to the masses&quot; kind of attitude.  Personally i'm kind of glad the movie has become so popular.  I don't know about anyone else...but i don't know ANYONE in my social circle-family and friends- who has the least bit of interest in heroic fantasy or fantasy RPG's.  I spend a LOT of time trying to explain some of the archetypes to people who feign an interest.  So if these people happen to see LOTR and kind of understand what this kind of thing is about then i think that is great.  In terms of what you describe as &quot;one-upmanship&quot; i saw those posts as being more about people finding others with similar interests to have discussion.  I guess there was maybe a little bit of &quot;who's the bigger expert?&quot; going on...And in terms of liking LOTR before it became popular and that making one a &quot;nerd&quot;?  LOL im assuming Kagan was being sarcastic.  The prevailing stereotype (at least what ive seen from others) is that anyone interested in this kind of thing is some kind of pencil neck geek with thick glasses and an honorary membership in the rocket club.  But of course that isnt true.  Heh...the guy who taught me to play D&amp;D in college was a 260 lb offensive lineman for his college.<br>

The post about the American flags and all of that though ya I totally agree. Another example of bandwagoning is this:<br>
 <br>
One day there was a little stripper who got a primal zigzag butt tattoo. She ended up in a little rock video on MTV by not knowing who she new, but by who she blew.<br>
With in a month the little stripper primal zigzag butt tattoo grew into a national trend. Every screaming teeny bopper, groupy, soccer mom, and middle aged grandmother had to have one. Don't believe me? Go to a strip joint, and every stripper has a primal zigzag butt tattoo except for the rookies that just stepped off the bus that moved to the city from the farm. Wait until the summer hits and you will see them all over the place. <br>
<br>
Just please don't be dumbasses and run up to some little lady with a primal zigzag butt tattoo and ask her what stripjoint she works at and asking for her stage name. Ya might get a negative response if they are just poser strippers and are trying to look sexy.<br>
