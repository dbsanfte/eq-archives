<br>
Chapter 5<br>
<br>
&quot;Rest and Regeneration.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nearly an hour had past since a band of escaped slaves from Crushbone had been taken to Felwithe for treatment of their wounds. Normally this wouldn't have raised any sort of major commotion, except for that every slave had managed to escape in the event due to a single person. Even more disturbing was the person responsible for it, and even for his acts the guards where going to kill him.<br>
<br>
&quot;That filth doesn't deserve to live!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He deserves to die like the Orcs of Crushbone do!&quot;<br>
<br>
Several guards raised their swords in unison, each preparing to strike a fatal blow to the injured man before them. The people who had came in to be treated couldn't believe this was going to happen, but none could argue against the guards. Even the Seniors of the guard agreed that the young man was going to be killed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guards, its a pity your kind never could forgive...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And who are you to say such things of us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you really intend to stop us from taking this filth's life?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Taunting someone you know nothing about, nor giving someone the benefit of doubt are mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
The figure the guards now glared at was shrouded in a blackened cloak and garments, very much similar to the ones the young man wore. Little did the group of seasoned men know who was in front of them, someone they all should have known better than to invoke anger from. One of the very people who had not only survived the events of the years before, but had also confronted one of their most fierce enemies.<br>
<br>
One of the more eager of the guards decided the conversation was over and drove his sword down towards the heart of the wounded savior. However, just inches from piercing the flesh and blood of its target it was stopped. The concealed man had nearly disappeared from their sight when he made his move, leaving several of the guards confused as to where he really was until they turned to see their fellow guards throat in the hand of what looked like an apparent foe.<br>
<br>
&quot;You dare touch one of my flesh and blood?! Your arrogance will be forgiven though...&quot;<br>
<br>
In a single deft, fluid motion, the guard was flung into a nearby fountain. For a second they could see a smile beneath the hood of the mans cloak. It was as if he knew something special that they all should of known.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll leave you now, I have more pressing matters to attend to...&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the man was gone, though the guards where once again standing over the young man, again ready to take his life in spite of the figures words. This time all the guards drove their blades down, intent on finishing what they had started. This time they met a different kind of obstacle as one of the refugee's ran out and shielded the young man's body with her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't! He did nothing wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of the way stupid girl!&quot;<br>
<br>
The young wood elf found herself kicked away by one of the guards, for his tactless and despicable abuse of power he was dealt a swift blow from an arrow that ran straight through his shoulder. The source of the arrow was a wood elf couple who had just entered the square. The guards where stunned as to why this particular couple would protect this young man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir are you a fool? If you take his life you'll anger one of the two people who have not only held their own against Mayong Mistmoore, but you'll also anger one of the men who defeated him!&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard went pale at those words, or what one might call pale for a high elf as the words had a sobering effect. They all now realized just who the figure had been before. The name of Mayong Mistmoore itself was enough to chill their spine, but the idea that they had nearly taken the life of someone who was more brutal and savage than even that creature simply brought pure terror into their very being.<br>
<br>
Before the guards could once again make another protest the wood elf couple, and the young girl had already lifted the young man off the ground and carried him into the clerics guild along with the other refugee's. Realization had set in by that time as the Senior officer ordered his men to return to their posts, as well as his foolish subordinate to the cleric's guild to receive treatment for his shoulder wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it looks like Janus here kept his word to us about getting our daughter back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know this Janus?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a long story, but myself and your mother traveled with his parents before you where born.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought he was a demon when I first seen him, he looked so angry when...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Both Selena and Daxster where now curious as to what really happened. They had only heard that the slaves had been freed. Other then that most of the people rescued didn't say much else other than they seen a strange person who fought like a devil.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just that he tore a door completely off its hinges to get to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My gods! He's still alive!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before another would could be said one of the clerics attending to Janus screamed in horror. At first they assumed he had died before being brought in and where performing his last rights, that is until they seen his chest still moving. They couldn't believe a person could have such wounds and still be alive.<br>
<br>
&quot;How could someone take so much punishment and still be alive?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He... He fought a wizard and what I think was a Shadow Knight...&quot;<br>
<br>
The clerics turned and looked slack jawed at what Iris had said. They had certainly had their fair share of dealings with the wounds inflicted by both the for mentioned. Never had they seen someone survive while fending them both off at the same time.<br>
<br>
&quot;And before that he kept the Orcs from taking me back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He must of been carrying a weapon smiths prized collect to have survived all that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He was just using his fists...&quot;<br>
<br>
Iris shook her head, it was beyond comprehension, but nevertheless, what all she had said was true. Janus had done everything, but still even most people would have given up after failing to escape right away. All she could wonder about was what driving force made him stand up to all the punishment, that is until she heard the Senior guard bark out orders to increase the number of guards on patrol to find the two responsible for this.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to do that... He killed them both before succumbing to his injuries.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well there is absolutely no question now, he is definitely their child.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your right Daxster, I'd expect the same out of his father.&quot;<br>
<br>
As a young girl, Iris had heard stories about a group of people storming Mistmoore Castle to rescue their friend. The stories also said that only one of the people who went in actually fought against Mayong. She had always heard that her parents where involved but never fully understood how, that is until now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother? Father? Do you mind if I stay here until he wakes up? I want to thank him for everything, and I want to apologize.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We won't mind at all will we?&quot;<br>
<br>
Selena grabbed Daxster by the arm and pulled him out of the room. Besides she knew that they wouldn't be much help to anyone else just sitting in there in the way. Daxster only smiled and then laughed as he heard some of the clerics commenting on Janus.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've never seen anyone built like this before, even for a human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He must be train an awful lot to be like this, just our luck he's a monk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet ladies, there is a young girl present you know!&quot;<br>
<br>
Iris couldn't help but blush as she over heard the women clerics while they tended to Janus. Then after hearing the older woman scold them she giggled. It wasn't very often that she seen humans, or monks for that matter. She had heard they where always the type to travel alone, and never ones to stay in one place for long.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me ma'am, but how can you tell who is a monk and who is not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's very simple child, monk's tend to use staves, or their fists while fighting. They also don't cast spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
This only proved to further confused Iris, she had seen him fight with both his fists and then something else. It certainly wasn't spells she seen used, but it looked to be even more fatal and destructive than any kind of spell she had seen before. She would definitely have to ask Janus when he woke up just what she had seen.<br>
<br>
What would look like a normal sleep was much more than that. Again he was contending with the figure from before. This time there was a startling revelation, the realization that the power he had used at Crushbone could of been much more devastating than he realized.<br>
<br>
- Well I'm quite impressed with the amount of control you had in Crushbone. -<br>
<br>
- Why should you be impressed? -<br>
<br>
- That is simple, you could of easily destroyed everything there and half way into the Greater Faydark, that is if you lost control of course. -<br>
<br>
- Why didn't you warn me... All those innocent people could of been hurt, or worse. -<br>
<br>
- You needed to learn something, having power is one thing, using it the right way is another. -<br>
<br>
- Why me though? Isn't there anyone else this could of been done to? -<br>
<br>
- Certainly, but let's just say your special, and we'll leave it at that. -<br>
<br>
All the while Iris waited patiently for him to wake up, she wanted to make sure he would really be okay. Besides no one else had come for her, or at least even tried to risk saving her. She knew her parents very well couldn't have gotten a party together in time to save her, she was thankful though that she back and safe.<br>
<br>
It took awhile before Janus finally woke up, needless to say he was confused to where he was at. He was certain the last place he had been was Crushbone, but now he was in some strange room with Iris asleep in the chair beside the bed he was on. At least he was relieved to see she was all right, even if it did feel like an entire army marched over his body.<br>
<br>
Now Janus had enough time to get a good look at Iris as she slept, from her looks, she appeared to be the same age he was. He could understand her being tired after all they had been through, and certainly the rest was well deserved. One thing that gnawed at his mind while regaining his senses was why was Iris here in his room by his side.<br>
<br>
Little did anyone realize the serenity that was newly granted to them would be in jeopardy soon. The Orcs of Crushbone had hidden for their lives as several Dark Elves entered their stronghold. None where pleased with the news they had received. In fact the news in question was the fact that two of their people had been killed while visiting the filthy place they now stood in. They where astounded what remained of their comrades.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, from the wounds and the description the Orcs gave that some kind of human did this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I find that highly unlikely, no simple human has this much power.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Sir that's what they...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep your lips sealed about this incident, no one is to know besides us, that is an order!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what if someone from Neriak arrives to investigate?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If they do then we'll say they where attacked by some beast, and that we destroyed it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is despicable! We're going to cover up this incident without avenging our brethren?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly not, we will kill whatever is responsible for this, that part won't be a lie.&quot;<br>
<br>
This elicited a sinister smile from the trio as they departed the Crushbone yards. They had made a fatal mistake as someone had been watching them the entire time. The figure smiled, it would definitely be a good test for the youngster he had left in Felwithe earlier. Besides, he knew the young man was in good hands, some of the finest clerics that he, himself, had been treated by those many years ago.<br>
<br>
The young cleric yawned as she entered the room, she had been appointed the night watch woman so to speak. She didn't like it even if it was just for the one night, being that they had guests in the guild. Worst yet she had a glimpse of the young man they had treated earlier. Sure his wounds had responded to the treatment, but there was something about him that seemed so out of place.<br>
<br>
For the moment she brushed those thoughts aside as she covered up the young wood elf beside the bed. It all seemed to odd to her, this man was part dark elf yet he had risked his life to save people who had already condemned him. Then again, she realized that the girl sitting up and sleeping in the chair probably had more sense than the rest of them, considering she had tried to save him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well your a quiet one aren't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your... Your.... Your awake?&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus smiled for a moment, he had heard the young woman come into the room. Also through his cracked open eyes he had seen her place the blanket over Iris. Still he had to find out just where he was at, and further more find out more about what happened afterwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly where am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well your in the cleric's guild house in Felwithe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see... So do you mind telling me how come I'm here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't know do you? The people who escaped from Crushbone brought you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess I must have made quite an impression with everyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that's an understatement.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you thanking me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For being so kind of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No worries, it was a break from the boredom so I should be thanking you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus smiled as the woman left the room, it wasn't often he had a chance to talk anyone so easily. Naturally though he would not have the luxury of much rest, because when the door finally shut Iris awoke. This put his mind at ease, now he could find out just why she was still here, and more about what happened afterwards at Crushbone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose I have a lot of explaining to do, like just who I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My parent's said your name was Janus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What else did they happen to say about me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well they said they traveled with your parents a long time ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you should know a little more, though I appear mostly human, I am also half dark elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's why I stayed here, I wanted to apologize for calling you a demon, and also to thank you for coming to save me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By now I'm use to being called such names, besides I couldn't exactly let a friend of the family's daughter be kept as a slave.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was glad now that she finally had a chance to apologize, after all her parents had raised to do such. However, there was still something that Iris felt was missing. Something she felt she could do to ease both Janus's mind as well as her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should go now, do you mind if I come to see how your doing in the morning?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before another word could be said Iris leaned over the bed and gave Janus a quick kiss on his cheek. With that done she quickly left the room leaving a dumbfounded Janus wondering just why she had done that. Sometimes he never could understand women, they always seemed to do things for no reason and without warning. The best he could describe it was they where unpredictable, and slightly strange.<br>
<br>
Unbeknownst to all in the great city of Felwithe the dark elf trio had managed to track down just where their victim lay. They had in fact begun to plan their plan of action, either it was to lay in wait for the prey to show itself, or if they would sneak inside Felwithe itself and destroy the beast before their enemies eyes. Needless to say this was causing a slight conflict of choices between them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I say we find a way in and kill who or what it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your a fool, if we do that we risk being captured or killed, and where will that get us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Afraid to say that he's right, the safest course of action is to lay in wait, that way no one will interfere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, but letting our enemy rest is not wise.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wise or not, it's the safest and least suspicious way to act.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that said, the decision was made, who or whatever had killed their fellow dark elves would die by their hand's when it left the city. No matter what it was they where prepared to face it, otherwise they would have a much larger mess to clear up, not just with Neriak, but with someone else.
