<br>
Everyone else -- PLEASE do not try to inflame anyone.  I'm trying to have a mature conversation.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
There's been some concerned that the guilds are trying to hurt the unguilded.  I happen to feel this is inaccurate.<br>
<br>
An unguilded individual has exactly as much opportunity to attend the planes as a guilded individual.<br>
<br>
You are just as welcome to assemble a force for the FiF days.  You can even try to take a single group in on a FFA day.<br>
<br>
There will be one public event on the schedule at a time -- which is just as many events as an individual guild will have.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, many many guilds take guests.  Jilanya is unguilded but has been on every Horizons raid in months -- and we typically have 10-15 guests, some guilded, some not.  Ridgerunners takes guests.  LOTS of guilds take guests.<br>
<br>
If someone feels the unguilded are being hurt by the agreements in place, I'd like them to explain clearly why they feel their access to the planes is less than that of any guilded individual.  Maybe I'm missing something.<br>
<br>
Attacks won't make your case.  But a clear, easy-to-understand case might.<br>

Previous to Summit III unguilded players had 3 options:<br>
1. Ask a guild to attend on their raid.<br>
2. Sign up for a public raid.<br>
3. Don't go.<br>
<br>
Now they have an extra option with FIF/FFA days allowing them to even take a single group up. But more importantly, the ammount of FIF/FFA days gives the unguilded many many more opprotunitys than they had before.<br>

Just my opinions, not being unguilded I could not say if they are completely accurate or not.<br>

<br>
1. First in Force and Free for All days are going to be dominated by zerg guilds like The Defiant and Neo Alliance. It's going to be hard if not impossible to get up a public raid on those days. In fact weekday public raids are practically impossible anyway, so FFA days don't do us any good.<br>
<br>
2. 90% of guilds who invite outside help do NOT allow those players to loot. Most will log in twinks or let those items rot before allowing an unguilded to loot them.<br>
<br>
3. Despite all the problems with public raids it was still our best hope for getting into the planes and getting the things we need, now with extreme limits on public raids it will be nearly impossible to get a public raid for unguildeds together. Especially when you consider that raids will probably have to be scheduled 4-6 months in advance under the new summit rules.<br>
<br>
4. Don't go? Exactly what kind of solution is this? I have been stressing for years that the $10 a month that players like me pay to Verant is exactly as valuable as the $10 paid by Legions of Darkness members, or Defiant members, or Ashen Vendetta members. Why should we be denied the opprotunity to do these things, much less reap the rewards of them?<br>
<br>
It's very simple, Uber-guilds have always ruled the roost by denial of entry to others. But the summit was a step in the right direction. But now Summit III has yielded to Uber-guilds and their deplorable offspiring the Zerg-guild. The unguilded player is as much a part of this community as anyone Large guild player. So why is there such a failure to see that we need stuff from the planes as much as anyone else?<br>
<br>

I'm tired of this reasoning. You have exactly the same opportunity to make alliances and friendships as all the players in those guilds have. If you've squandered those social opportunities in a game that rewards social behavior then honestly you are not a good enough of a  player to warrant getting the loot from those locations. The only people that can even *sort* of make this beef are those casual players who just can not make the time sacrifice.  Honestly, the only people to whom loot is denied are those that fail socially. EQ requires very little skill - just a lot of friends and time to play. Nobody ever said that for $10/month everybody gets the same loot. <br>
<br>
Speaking as someone who until recently was unguilded, I can frankly say that neither Aldrin nor Rumenia represent the unguilded folks of Inny. <br>

<br>
How is FFA different than a public raid?  With the addition of more FFA days per week, won't it be easier to get into the planes?  I'm just not sure how <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> more</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> FFA days is worse than the limited number of public raids before Summit 3.<br>
<br>

<br>
I've been a guest on scores of raids to Hate and Fear.  Each time not only was I allowed to loot before a piece were to rot, but more often than not I was included in the roll with the guild members whose booking the raid belonged to.  Understandably, this is NOT the case with epic loots (and probably BP's), as these would be guild only.  Maybe I just got lucky with the guilds I went up with (Final Cov, Inner Circle, Invictorum, LoE, ..)<br>

<br>
My understanding is that if this compromise did not come to pass, the non-ubers would in fact use the planes at their will, and those without the numbers or forces to compete would be without.  That seemed to be the way things were heading as each of the uber guilds started to lightly step on the summit one after the other in order to meet the planar needs of so many in their guild that were not being met.  The old summit treated a guild with 200ppl the same as one with 18.  This new summit helps ease that non-distinction.  <br>
<br>
I myself am looking forward to the FFA days.  From what I understand, just because an uber guild IS in the planes on a FFA day doesn't mean other people can't go up as well?  The FFA and FiF days aren't ubers only, are they? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usharyldabrat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharyl Dabrat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#778899>(10/29/01 10:36:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Summit Clarification: Unguilded</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can go on FFA days.

<br>
I am not a 'kook' or an 'idiot'. I am a player, just like the rest of you. I have my wants and my needs, just like the rest of you. And I stay unguilded because I have yet to find a guild that truly supports the needs of members outside it's inner clique.<br>
<br>
The payment arguement IS a valid point. I have friends, and I socialize to a degree. However I will not stoop to using people to get what I want, which is what many large guild aristocracies do. (Before you jump to tell me I'm wrong, I've been in several large guilds and heard first hand from former members about how others are run. So I know how they operate.)<br>
<br>
Some of you are using the argument that I can not possibly be representative of what an unguilded player wants. What I find funny about this is that the people saying it are from large guilds. How do you know what unguilded people want? I can tell you that most of us are not interested in padding your crowded bank vault by joining you as a meat shield. Point being, I have yet to hear any unguilded players come out and say that what Aldrin and myself have been campaigning for is not what they want.<br>
<br>
I read the summit log, and it seems to me that the guilds of this server do not have any compassion for what unguilded players must go through. Your support of FiF plans and the vote which originally voted to ban public raids altogether showd just what you think of us. Not even mentioning how you treated Aldrin in the chat room.<br>
<br>
In closing, I am tired of large guilds telling me what I want, what I should have, and how I should get it. (I.E. I shouldn't) You are not representitive of me, Aldrin, or any unguilded player. Nor is your joke of a summit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uxarialongsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaria Longsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://finacovenan.dhs.org/aawakenfairy.gif height=40 width=30" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#778899>(10/29/01 11:42:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Summit Clarification: Unguilded</span><hr size=1> Then..

B) Goto a public event(once per month according to current Summit 3 Plans I believe)<br>

I think I agree with you.<br>
<br>
Rumenia -- I apologized to you in email.  However, a LOT of warning was available, and I really thought everyone who cared at all knew the date and time long before Saturday.  It occured to me that morning that a reminder was probably appropriate anyway.  I'm sorry it didn't occur sooner, but you had exactly the same notice everyone else had.<br>
<br>
As for unguilded access to loot -- RRs is completely random.  Horizons is not.  The best items require that you actually attend a few of our raids -- or be lucky that the people who HAVE attended a few don't want the item, so it's /random.  However, there is no distinction by what guild you're in -- or not in.<br>
<br>
And there's still to be one public event on the calendar.<br>
<br>
To me, that means that the unguilded have every opportunity that the guilded have.<br>
<br>
Horizons should be well-known for open invitations to our raids.  I try to make people feel welcome.  If you had signed up, I would certainly have said, &quot;Great!  Love to have you.&quot;<br>
<br>
You see, I remember a raid you ran in December or so last year.  One of your last raids.  I had a blast.<br>
<br>
So I guess I'm confused.  How are you worse off than I am?  You're invited to every raid I am, after all.<br>
<br>
Now, am I better off now than i was prior to the new summit?  Time will tell.  I think I'm far less likely to be poached.  And I think it might be fun to try out the FFA days.  We'll see.<br>
<br>
Although I don't know how I feel about zoning into Fear.  /ooc 58 chanter LFG.  Kinda strange feeling.  :-)<br>
<br>
Maybe that should be, /ooc 58 chanter looking for temple group.<br>

<br>
1. It takes more than 1 group to break and clear the planes.<br>
2. If the players are not well equiped and high level it takes more than 2 groups. <br>
3. If you cannot muster a sufficient force, all the whining about not getting into the planes is pointless because you would just die on entry to the zone anyhow.<br>
4. If you can muster the force required, then form a guild. They are not difficult to form in eq. Just require 10 players (less than 2 groups to form) and since you probably need 18 to go, find the people and form the guild, do the booking. If you cant muster enough intrested people you couldn't do the planes anyhow.<br>
5. FFA/FIF = anyone can go. So since you only need 12-18 people to go, get a force together and go. You dont even have to get the guild tag. If you cant do that then you REALY have no buisness in the planes.<br>
<br>
The limits set by this new summit are basicaly, what is required to be able to do it. The PURPOSE for these limits is so that the people that were doing a booking, then saying yah you can come to my booking but I get the epic peice, (Read Topogiggio and Kaurik) no longer can do so cause they cant book it, and if they did all people have to do is not show and the plane becomes ffa.<br>
<br>
so YES it does defeat the little guy who was using the booking as leverage to get loot. NO it doesnt hurt the little guy who can get the minimum force together and go do it. It HELPS you. <br>
<br>
Yes the ffa days are  likely to have some &quot;uber&quot; guild campers in them. Probably cause they can get the force together.  Isn't that what this game is all about, organizing a sufficient force of sufficiently skilled players towards a common goal? Is it suprising that those who are &quot;uber&quot; are the ones that do that well? Think about it.<br>
<br>
Anyhow; yes, I'm comming out in favor of this new summit. I think its a pretty good compromize. It would have been better to add one weekend a month ffa in both planse, and make post patch an automatic ffa period ( for 8 or so hours)  but those changes can probably wait to see how this works out.<br>
<br>
Besides it gives those uber guilds something to do mid week when they can't get enough for nToV, HoT, ST, or Vp together, which is realy probably the source of thier poaching problem. <br>
