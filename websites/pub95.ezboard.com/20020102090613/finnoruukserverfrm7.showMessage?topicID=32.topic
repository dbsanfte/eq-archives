<br>
As the sunny warm touch of Tunare slowly creeps across the <br>
land. A group of adventurer’s sits in a small circle, not far off from a ring sacred to druids, in the land known as West Commons. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that all have gathered here&quot; say's Voldorius. &quot;Where should we hunt?&quot;.<br>
&quot;Will there be lots of Gnomes to kill?&quot; Ask's Icewolfe.<br>
&quot;You always ask that question Ice.&quot; Pipes up Leev.<br>
&quot;Well.. I'm not to picky where we go as long as I don get killed.&quot; States Mortious.<br>
&quot;I don’t really care where we go.&quot; Says Doknor.<br>
&quot;Indeed. There are alot of places we can adventure in. The group has grown into a formidable force.&quot; Says Vexnor.<br>
<br>
It would seem that the adventurer’s had indeed grown to some power. Most seeing their 35th Season of Adventure. The idea of this group was, to see new places and keep the challenge for keeping members attention at hand (eg: Barbarians get into less trouble that way).<br>
<br>
The group consisted of the following.<br>
<br>
Voldorius: (Half-Elf) Paladin: The group leader for the most part. Although taking much input(and complaints) from the group as to how things were progressing. A man of much honour, and would never leave the group to hang.  A worthy leader for many aspects not which least of all is having a kind of democracy in his group.<br>
<br>
Icewolfe: (Barbarian) Warrior. A true warrior, falling several times, so that his fellow adventurer’s  may escape to safety. Also he has an unusual hatred toward Gnomes. He also has a particularly loud voice, which sometimes the group members wonder if all the land can indeed hear his shouts.<br>
<br>
Doknor : (High Elf) Cleric. A quiet individual for the most part. Up for almost all adventuring with little or no gripe and is well know by his adventurers as the best healer anywhere outside of Faydwer.<br>
<br>
Mortious: (High Elf) Wizard. The damage dealer and most cautious member of the group, but by no means the most cowardly. He has been seen on occasion to engage a much harder foe with nothing but a dagger to kill it with and his robe to defend himself with!<br>
<br>
Vexnor: (High Elf) Enchanter. For the most part Vexnor is in charge of crowd control and slowing the monsters or speeding up the tanks in order to kill the monsters. For fun or when he gets bored. Vexnor changes his form (as all enchanters can) into a Gnome. And awaits a duel to the death from Icewolfe to which he always declines.<br>
<br>
Leev: (Wood Elf) Druid. A somewhat young but eager learner of adventuring. For the most part Leev provides support for the group in Buffing and such. However, should he start to be attacked, Leev has the uncanny ability to run around in circles and aggro more monsters that will cause him to die. Currently he has the running joke from this weekly episode.<br>
<br>
The group had decided to raid Mistmoore Castle. As there was a rumor of strange beasts and great treasure to be had. As the group moved through the zone and moved from the pools of water past the graveyard and into the canyon, they stopped. There were monsters above that the group was contemplating on how to attack. The decision was made to have Leev harmony the monster above and pull single monsters.  As Leev approached the crest of the hill, and near the gates of Castlte Mistmoore itself, a monster saw through his deception and proceeded to attack him !. Leev was so shocked that he fell of the edge of the cliff!<br>
<br>
&quot;I have fallen off the cliff and there are wolves and lots of dark elves attacking me! What should i do now?.. I am coming back to the group!&quot; say's Leev.<br>
<br>
'Don’t train the group !&quot; says Voldorius<br>
&quot;Get away from the group . I'll Resurrect you later Leev&quot; says Doknor<br>
&quot;Bring it here Treehugger... I like a good fight&quot; chortles Icewolfe.<br>
&quot;Die please&quot; exclaims Mortious.<br>
Vexnor sighs clearly disappointed. <br>
Before Leev can even think of doing anything he is dead.<br>
<br>
This became to be known as the Leev Tactic, or to ‘Pull a Leev’, to run around in circles until you are dead, or the monster attacks or gets attacked by someone else.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*We are a group of indivuduals that wish to see most things that alot of people miss in the game. Look for more exciting adventures!*<br>
<br>
EG: We raided CoM @ 35 and will also raid dungeons above our level and succeed.<br>
<br>
We look forward to your input as to  how you regard our adventures!<br>
<br>
Thnx<br>

The story Chars arent quite true to form (but close) and i'm still working on them. The group is really fun to play with, and for the most part we drive right to the bottom of a dungeon and then hang out for a bit..and then port out, looking for a new dungeon. A couple weeks ago we went to the bottom of Infected Paw lair. It was alot of fun, i hadn't been to the bottom very much, perhaps once or twice. And since its got that xp bonus, i'm not sure why more poeple arent looking into it(for that level range). /shug<br>
