It was not right of them to do so.  By the fact they were able to log you on means they had access to your account and the characters upon it.  So although you were unable to play, your class was avalible to them.  I agree with someone's statement earlier that this certainly was a cowardly move.  It is truely horrible that some of the people you trusted and believed were your friends turn on you due to your play time.<br>
<br>
But Aliya  not all guilds believe you have to be avalible 7 days a week to play.  Other guilds realize that you have a real life and this socially involved game may not always be top priority.  You know that job of yours is definately more important than a game as it allows you to live in the real world.  <br>
<br>
Yes raids are fun and a good part of the higher level game, but the friends I ussualy raid with are the reason that I am there.  EE has a sign up page to handle where we are raiding which helps to determine who will be there and wether we need to adjust our plans.  Feel free to sign up and join us on a raid.  Friends are more important than loot. <p><BR>

<br>
It's unbelievable the way they handled this.<br>
<br>
&quot;We thought it was your sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's BS.  Did you ASK, for crying out loud?  And was Sister removed in a nice fashion?<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with a guild that expects to raid every night and wants their players to be on a certain minimum.  But tossing someone out without talking to them first is a pretty low form of rotten.  It's not like they can actually DO anything just because they have the guild tag on.  Worse they can do is say something nasty in guild say.  Wow, that's really going to hurt...<br>

Life is filled with horrible moments but also has bright beautiful ones too. Someone with your caring and sensitivity would be an asset to any guild and if they don't see that then they don't deserve you or your time (even if it isn't 24/7).

AV's internal business is AV's business.  How they manage their guild is really none of my business.  For me to comment on the why for guildremovals would be foolish and wrong.<br>
<br>
What troubles me is the how.  Having seen Ali's temperment and personality in Norrath, I really, really hope how this was done is a big mistake.  Ali is a good person.  She deserves better than this.  If it helps at all, I would implore the AV leadership to spend a little of your time talking directly to Ali about this.  I would find it impossible to believe you wouldn't care enough about a person like Ali to pay her that kind of respect.  Consider this a plea from a fellow Norrathian to give Ali some closure on this.  No matter what your goals are, I can't believe it requires inflicting a hurt that can't heal.  I'll ask that as a personal favor for a neighbor in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Ali, this thread may become the biggest you've ever seen on Inny.com.  I hope that will show you what you mean to a lot of us on Innoruuk.  Like many, I've only met you a few times in-game, and have come to know a bit more about you here.   But I call you my friend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And there are many, many more like me.  You are not alone.  I already see a lot of really classy Norrathians responding to support you here.  I think you can expect a lot more.<br>
<br>
I'd like to add my voice to Gamiene's offer.  Consider this an outstanding invite as my personal guest any time the Ridgerunners are mucking about in Norrath.  We tend to take ourselves less serious than we could, tend to take our friends and neighbors a lot more serious than we could, and I'll have to explain FUB to you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But, you are most welcome anytime, my friend.<br>

Your post and link sparked my curiosity.  I think they left out the prostrate examination and turning over your firstborn child?  Do they accept Baptists or Democrats?<br>
Do they have timeclocks placed so as to make it easier to punch in?  And is it hourly or salary?<br>
<br>
To each their own, but this seems so sad, it's almost funny.  When EQ degrades into that much work, I think I'll put a resume out, take a second job, and actually get paid for it.<br>

/agreed ... but I will make a general comment.<br>
<br>
67 members at an event = Lag always, for nearly everyone, including those with good connections, makes ya wonder how TD can even move<br>
<br>
Easy way to avoid it?  Uh, keep your active memberbase less then 60 maybe?  Some other guilds manage to do the same and accomplish just as much, if not more.  Although, I see you are taking an active step towards that goal already at Aliya's (and I'm sure others) expense.<br>
<br>
Having the majority of your people show up for an encounter like AoW = Good thing.<br>
Having the majority of your people show up for an enounter like ToV = Normal by anyones standards.  If you want people to show up every night...<br>
<br>
/guildmotd ToV tonight, meet in Kael.<br>
/guildmotd ToV tonight, meet in Ssra Temple.<br>
<br>
You always have &quot;those people&quot; who only seem to show up for ToV.  There's really no way around it.<br>

&gt;Some form of permanent enduring breath item <br>
Resist gear, MINIMUM of 100 fire/cold/disease/poison unbuffed, while simultaneously having 100 unbuffed in magic resist.  We have members that can reach 200/200, 100/100 is bare minimum. <br>
&gt;Jboots <br>
&gt;Shrunken goblin skull earring (5k or less in FP *Edit - price is higher since adding this as a requirement*), and/or velium coldain ring (for warriors and monks, both). <br>
&gt;100  sense heading <br>

&gt;At least one VP (Veeshan's Peak) key piece, perferably the full key. <br>
&gt;Cobalt Scar key (Shrine Key) <br>
