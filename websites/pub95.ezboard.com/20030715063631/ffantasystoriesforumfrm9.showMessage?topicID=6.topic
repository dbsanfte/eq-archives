Someone else was in the woods and was watching out for that girl. Something seemed different about her personality than before, she seemed more self assured and confident about herself and not confused and worried. Nik thought on this hard and passed it off for being her closeness with her friend. She would be fine now, and he would keep sure that she stayed that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sitting in the classroom, Qneil tried to listen to the droning of his two teachers. Exhausted from staying up all night comforting Jess as she cried out in her sleep. The nightmares had plagued her when she was little, but she had outgrown them. Qniel had always been there to hold her hand when she was smaller and so now he was here again. She was only two years younger than he was and her 16th birthday was coming up in a few days. He didn’t have a gift for her yet and he only had a small time left. It was not customary to give gifts, but he felt that she deserved it. She was going to pass through to the spirit roads and claim her place in the world. Turning back to the teachers he thought about what had happened out in the woods. Who were those people and what were they doing to his Jess, or more importantly why?<br>
<br>
Laying on the ground hands and legs tied to stakes in the ground, Jess screamed as the demons licked her and made tiny slices into her skin. They never stopped or slowed down. They showed no mercy to her and bruised her skin and pulled her hair. The Darkness was here to claim her. His demons were raping her as a sign to show she had no power to resist. Closing her eyes and screaming again; she gasped as the shadows lifted from her body and she was uncovered. Before she felt covered in the sense that the shadows were consuming her body. Now she was empty and uncovered. Whimpering she felt a hand gentle and smooth run over her cheek. “Darling Jessica, I was coming to help you before. I will not travel with you everywhere you go with you every step of your journey. The Darkness will take your soul and ravage the goodness in your heart if you do not let me in to help you. My name is Nikoli and I am a sort of spirit guide for you to follow and to aid you when you need it the most. Call on me if you ever need advise or if you need help; I am always there to help you.” Smiling now Jessica felt his hands glide over her body and caressing where she was sore and releasing her from the ground. Kissing her brow and lifting her off the ground Nikoli stared into the black and saw the shadows lick their lips and laugh. Jessica felt her dreams take a different turn and she was in Qneil’s arms and she felt at ease there.<br>
