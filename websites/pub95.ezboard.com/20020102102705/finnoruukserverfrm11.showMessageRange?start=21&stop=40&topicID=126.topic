I think people are right now are hypnotized by the pretty graphics and the fact that it's &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different.&quot;  Those differences are:<br>
<br>
1.) There is no &quot;phat lewtz&quot; in DAoC and people like owning &quot;phat lewtz&quot;.<br>
<br>
2.) The &quot;end game&quot; of DAoC is PvP, the &quot;end game&quot; of EQ is PvE.  Most people (not all) do not care for PvP.  Once they've completed all the PvE aspects of DAoC and realize it's a teams Zek server, they'll come back to EQ. <p><a href="http://www.eldertribunal.com/">

Take time to actually *look* at the game.<br>
<br>
&lt;rant&gt;<br>
<br>
PVE high end is STUPID.  It is the same damn AI you fought back at level 1.  The mobs are harder because they just have a zillion HP and hit for a billion points of dammage.... ooooh fun.  What skill.<br>
<br>
Basically verant has done very well in the phsychology department.  They have you all sitting in front of what amounts to a damn slot machine (drops) in hopes of social acceptance (phat lewtz to impress ur uber friends).  Nice.  You are all Lab rats.  Congratulations.<br>
<br>
And it isn't really PVP [in daoc].  If you were playing it an no  one told you those folks were real players you would have NO idea.  They are just really smart NPCs to you.  I think the fear that the uber d00ds in eq are having to this concept is they lack skill...  and they know it.  [Of course, I too lack skill hehe, working on that I guess<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ]<br>
<br>
And.... there are PHAT lewts just like there are in eq.  I got a phat lewts last night.  I didn't get a chance to check stats until the end of the night because the action was NON STOP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Basically... it is EQ with better class/skill/magic/graphics system with a high end game that actually requires a certain amount of skill.<br>
<br>
Did I mention the mob ai TOTALLY blows eq out of the water? <br>
<br>
Anyhow.... DAOC won't beat eq.  No worries there.  I am actually glad that lots of the weaker minded individuals fear it.... keeps them from ruining it IMHO.<br>
<br>
What DAOC does currently lack is high end PVE content .  So if they add a few high level dungeons (not hard at all) and a few more phat lewts what is there left to make you want to play EQ?  Time invested is a non answer.  I have many hours invested in Mrs PacMan but I moved on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 i played the game forever just like everyone else..i resisted  and made fun of DaoC , like everyone else....I didnt want to leave EQ because &quot; i have so much time invested in it&quot; just like...you guessed it..EVERYONE ELSE .<br>
<br>
but heres my real problem with EQ....i like to play lower lvl chars and go to lower lvl dungeons because it is pretty much the same thing as the basic higher lvl dungeons ,only who gives a crap if your lvl 18 char dies hehe. But alas, try finding someone who :<br>
A. wasn't power lvling with a friend<br>
B. wasnt Power lvling themselves with their higher lvl  druid<br>
C. wasnt Playing 2-3 comps at once and being their own group<br>
D. someone actually IN a dungeon at the appropriate lvl<br>
E. wasnt farming gear for their twink &lt; god forbid the twink char go questing..i mean wheres the fun  in doing that ?&gt; <br>
<br>
My opinion is simply put like this...most people hate the higher end game, yet the low end game is '' broken '' because people arent trying to play it anymore, all the dungeons under lvl 45 are empty. with the exception of the farmers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ'rs  have been complaining about crappy customer service for as long as they game has been live. and good ol' sony just dragged their feet because they had no competition.<br>
<br>
my parting words on this are:  SoL is incapable of fixing what is wrong with EQ. Players selling their accounts to the highest bidder has gone off the chart recently. so now  there is an entire generation of  ''ebay'd '' chars out there to deal with  ( the idea of being able to pay $50 for a server jump just made the problem even worse, but desperate times ..etc. etc.<br>
<br>
food for thought:  how long will it be before you do  /who all beastlord and see a lvl 50  beastlord appear...1 week ? 2 weeks tops..i guarantee it...and that my fellow addicts is precisely the problem.. NOBODY '' PLAYS'' THE GAME ANYMORE ! ...believe it bumms me out and ticks me off when i think about how corrupt the game has become <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I can remember when you were able to get a delay point taken off a tarnished weapon with a stone. We went NUTZ with the thought of having a faster weapon. Now I can walk into a Low level area and /con a ranger fighting in a group and he is green weilding 2 lams and in full twink armor. Kind of makes me sick but then again I am guilty of &quot;helping&quot; out one of my chars &lt;feels embarrased&gt;.<br>
<br>
This game has several &quot;holes&quot; but over all it offers me enough excitement still that I play for a few hours a day, who cares if I stay up with billy bob in levels. I play for fun and will continue to play until that ends. No matter if I have 100 or 100k in the bank I can still find amusement giving the guards joggin lessons in West FP all the while screaming for help and watching the tells coming in from the 'younger&quot; players asking what I did to get all those guards after me. <br>
<br>
With Luclin coming soon I see that the &quot;farmers&quot; who have complete screwed the economy up will move to that place and farm there till they complete destroy the value of those items. Oh well maybe I can get me a Fungi tunic for 100p pretty soon! WOOT!<br>

I have to say that the posts in &quot;whineplay&quot;...erm the &quot;Developers' Corner&quot; matches what you are saying for *SOME* folks.<br>
<br>
Also, of course, the nerfs they are having to make to deal with the abusers:<br>
 - 1 full minute LD timer...I have never gotten back in after less than 2 REAL minutes for example.  I knew the instant-no-aggro-reconnect could not last, but still.  A FULL MINUTE?!!!!!?  hehe &quot;OUCH!&quot;<br>
 - MASSIVELY reducing group experience for the lower level members to stop mad powerleveling...but they nerfed it too hard.  A big selling point for me was to be able to productively group with someone even a several of levels below me.  No can do now.  They are better off killing even-cons solo.<br>
<br>
I love it.  But then I still love EQ.  And this paying for 3 accounts in 2 games is making an owie on my entertainment budget. ;0)~<br>
<br>
I know I enjoyed the beta more than the production game.  There are just tooo many people...same thing that has been the &quot;unpleasant&quot; part of eq.  Like rats in a cage, once the crowding gets bad, the squabbling escalates.<br>
<br>
Then, too, a bunch of folks thought this new game was going to be the be-all-and-end-all computer game.  Bad new flash!  Never going to happen.  The demands will just get higher and higher and higher.<br>
<br>
I remember the very first RPG-graphic-game I saw.  It was on an Apple, with character-block graphics.  It was *BEYOND* cool.  Almost a quarter century ago.  A quarter century from now all these games will be quaint relics too....and there still won't be the ultimate game.<br>

I signed up for Beta 4 of DAoC and thanks to some friends got into the guild testing segment of it. At the same time was when guilds like TD were at their *finest* and showing people what guilds like that are truely about. A few weeks later I managed to nag Cymric into trying, him not one fond of RvR but myself having played on Tallon Zek for quite a while.<br>
<br>
I was sick of the bs from EQ, sick of the spam regarding Innoruuk.com, regarding the summit, the planes, the moderation of the boards, how I played my characters, what equip so-and-so had, the 2 week long camp where people fake sick from work just to get ONE chance that someone doesn't KS/POACH/NINJA LOOT your shot out of gaining something that you worked damn hard on. EQ brought out the best in a lot of people, but in turn, brought out the worst in too many. When I look back at my days of EQ, most of what I can remember is hearing about the greed and the backstabbing that went on. :/<br>
<br>
In DAoC there are no planes, no need for calendars and summits. No ninja looting - if you didn't kill it, you can't loot it. You can KS someone - but it's a bannable offence. You can't purposefully train someone - most mobs even if aggro to you, if run out of their normal spot will saunter back through your group and leave you unscathed. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   *Thinks back to her Sol B days and shudders.*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> It doesn't take 8 hours-2 weeks to get the item you'd like/need.

<br>
I could go on and on comparing the two and no matter what is said people will always agree/disagree pending on their personal preference.<br>

A while back, I made the following post: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showMessage?topicID=67.topic">pub95.ezboard.com/finnoru...D=67.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Some said I'd return to EQ someday, chars won't be gone, etc, etc, etc. I still get emails now and again with people asking if they can have my old gear. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   *Boggle.*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> My account was deleted three months ago and I'm happy to see it finally be &quot;officially&quot; gone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I've seen the new screenshots for Luclin and they look more like porn models then a fantasy character I'd want to play with.

I miss a lot of my friend and try my best to keep in touch via icq/email/boards etc. I'm happy to see so many are still enjoying EQ but it's not for me and many others anymore.<br>

<br>
And you don't really know what DAoC is all about until you're 20+ and have been in RvR and taken over forts. Totally different game, and so exhilirating!<br>
<br>
Actually, playing DAoC and meeting people who talk about EQ in game, it reminds me of all the sore points in the game, and why I left. =)<br>

Just saying hi, enjoying my new game very very very much.<br>

I was hesitant and even eager to bash those that left to go play DAoC.... I then decided to give it a shot and I really enjoy what I see and am very impressed with AI on the mobs. Comparing RVR with EQs PVP ,well there is no comparison. If you havent actually played DaOC long enuff to go RVR then its hard to explain. I hear alot of negative things about DAoC but keep in mind its fairly new, I have seen MANY changes in EQs life and im sure I will in DAoC. You kill something in this game you and only you can loot it ,you set something on ground,only you can pick it up,you aquire an &quot;uber&quot; item in this game and want to show it off? Go ahead ,but if its much higher then your level its gonna faulter much much sooner. <br>
<br>
                         Camping mobs in DAoC? well hands down got to hand it to DAoC. When you 1st run across a mob either solo or in a group and kill it ,you will get the exp for the mob,and also in &quot;    &quot; you will get a bonus example, 20543 exp with (4957)bonus,however the longer you stay there the less the bonus is and eventually its gone and time to move on looooong before you leveled . What you dont see in DAoC is them same people at them same groups at the same time of every day for months and I like that. Another thing I like is how you may be fighting mobs that are right next to mobs that will kill you in one hit ,there is a sense of fear that I didnt get much in EQ anymore,less it was a raid that required the whole night to get going. I have heard and just recently was involved with it,over 100 people together charging a fort and engaging in a battle that looked like something from braveheart and was just a flat out awesome experience. The battle lasted a few minutes and when it was over to see the snow littered with corpses (mine included lol) was well worth my time. Bottom line is I played a warrior to 60 and shaman to 56 on EQ, I seen many changes and met many great people. But after one RVR battle of that magnitude I have no desire to play EQ again at this point. With Luclin I hope the changes bring the solid EQ players what they deserve ( not the ebayers). With that I hope to stop in and chat with some my eq bros. <br>
