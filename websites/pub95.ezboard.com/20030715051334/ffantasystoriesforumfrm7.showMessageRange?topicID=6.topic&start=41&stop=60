She definately wasn't making it to Cyberia in 5 minutes, maybe 10.<br>
<br>
Carmen's sleek pony tail whiped her in the face, rounding the turn onto 54th. The chain from her wallet flying up and back down, the thrill of it all. She found a supplier, but she had to go all the way up to @#%$ Cyberia. Cyberia was cool and all, but the only reason Carmen went was to get more crystals. She'd so rather spend her day at the park. <br>
<br>
Finally, the thumping bass of Cyberia was heard, and Carmen kicked her board up to her. Adjusting it under her arm, she headed in. Instantly her khaki cargo's and baby pink, hooded sweatshirt began to glow with the lights. She so did not fit in here, but she needed the crystals. Was he here? Looking around she cautiously slipped into the club. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uzulik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/6/02 1:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1>  devin looked around and saw mika and nefer dancing<br>

  (Derek, GET OVER HERE NOW!) Cried out Devin's mind. Only one thing scared him this badly. Shadow. Using his mind to boost his board Jash feighned a nose dive and plowed into the man in black. &quot;Oh...I'm sorry, m'bad. Shows how much I like to show off and fail to perform *smirks*&quot;<br>
&quot;You'll pay for that you litte --&quot; he was cut off by Derek.<br>
&quot;Ah-uh, not today. You get outta here, we don' want no trouble. Just came here to party,&quot; came Derek. 'Bout time he got over here. Glaring at Shadow, Derek began to pressure his mind. *&quot;You know you should leave. You have better things to do than mess with these street punks.&quot;* *&quot;Eh, he's right. I got better things to do, and I don't want the attention killing them here woud bring..better go..&quot;* Sliding out from under the board he shoved Jash away. &quot;I got better things to do than mess with you little punks. Laterz.&quot; Glaring at the four &quot;little punks&quot; he strode out of Cyberia. <br>
&quot;Now, let's get back to our party. I think I busted my board landing on his face.&quot;<br>

He was suprised, he had heard Devin's voice in the back of his mind, but he was to preocupied with Lor to notice.  Venomously, he retorted &quot;Yes I know.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't lie to me.  You can't, and therefore, by doing so, you only dig yourself a deeper hole.&quot;  She laughed.  &quot;Wanna sit down, get a drink?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't drink, but I'll sit down.&quot;  He thought to himself, I would like to talk with you.<br>
&quot;Please, I'd rather not talk.  Here, lets go.&quot;  Enticingly, Lor grabbed his collar with her index finger and pulled him off the floor onto the side.  There was a small table, like one of those you find at a cafe with four chairs around it but only room for one to put his coffee.  There was only one chair.  Politely, Jerron pulled it out for her, mentally.  It was more of a strain than it should have been, he WAS preoccupied. Before she sat down, Lor pulled a chair from across the room right out from under a chick.  She fell right on her ass and looked around for the culprit.  Finding no one, she went back to sticking her tongue down a skater punks throat.  Jerron snickered, he DID like this girl.  &quot;Please, sit.&quot;  Both sat down onto the hard metal chairs.  &quot;So, what do you do?&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought you didn't want to talk.&quot;  He said with a smile.<br>
&quot;Amuse me.&quot;<br>
He didn't really understand the question.  There were so many answers, only one of which she was looking for.  He scanned her mind quickly, looking for what she meant as a question.  It took him mere seconds to come to the answer.  She did nothing to stop him!  She flaunted her superiority!  She wanted to know what he did for fun.  &quot;Well, I love to kill people, and if I tire of that, humiliating them also has its perks.  Why do you ask?  You can easily just scan me, find the answer for yourself.&quot;<br>
&quot;I find the human voice....comforting.  But, you lie.  Don't do that.  What have I told you about lying.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't HAVE fun.  Emotions cloud the mind.  How is it that you can manage to have such mastery of your own while you are so full of emotions.  Are you not distracted?&quot;<br>
&quot;Come now.  What we have done has been fun, has it not?  And to answer your question, I have mastery over my self, because I was born with such mental clarity.  Some are, some aren't.  I guess I'm kinda rare, but I do try and keep a clear mind.  But I would sacrifice my own mental clarity in a second if it meant keeping my hapiness.  Here.&quot;  She handed him a card with a number on it.  &quot;I gotta run, but call me.  Its been fun.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Bye&quot;  Jerron stood up.  He felt awkward as her arms embraced him in a hug.  He hadn't been hugged in years.  It filled him with strange emotions.  <br>
As she walked off, she spoke, &quot;You need ta get out more Jerron.  Remember, call me.&quot;  Jerron scanned the room, searching for Jerek.  He felt an urge to...talk, to a friend.&quot;  Finding him, he walked over.<br>

Holding her head, she kept scanning the club. Any sign of him? How did she know what to look for? <br>
<br>
Coming farther into the club she saw a few people having a little spat, and- Okay, not the hottest guy in the world, but he had control of his board. Carmen bit her lip and sat down, she could barely hear what was going on, she just watched HIM and his board. Shaking her head she thought, He's probably a boarder from up north. Carmen sighed and continued her search for Derek. How was she ever going to find him!?<br>

She was in her own world, letting the music be her guiding light.  Completely unaware of all around her she danced until her body told her it was time to stop, several hours later.  she came crashing down to the floor, only barely managing to land on her feet.  sweet rolled off her face, making her makeup run in places.  Grabbing Nefi by the hand again she yelled in her ear over the harsh sounds that filled the room.  &quot;Let's take a break!  I gotta freshen up and get something to drink!&quot;  <br>
<br>
After fixing her makeup and hair in the bathroom, Mika joined Nefi at a small table where she promptly sparked a smoke with her mind and offered one to Nefi. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/6/02 11:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> Nefertiti admired the way Mika was able to light her cigarettes with her mind. The world revolved around things done through the mind. It seemed to her that Nefertiti was the only one who couldn't use her mind like everyone else. Pulling a trusty lighter from her baggy pant pocket she drags her thumb across the metal and watches as a small flame is sparked into existence. Once lighted, she takes a long drag. With her eyes closed she holds the smoke in her lungs for a long moment. She didn't smoke regularly. She found it relaxing when she did, however. Leaning over onto the table she rests her head on her arms lifting her head only to take another drag. Sighing heavily she looks off at a near by table's leg blankly. Why did she come tonight? Why did she agree to this? She wasn't much fun. Burring her eyes in her arms she wonders why they even take her with them. Nefertiti shrugs as she slouches back in her chair. Oh well. Producing a small silver compact from her other pocket, she opens it. Rubbing the pale powder that matched her complexion perfectly over her skin with a puffy pad, she forced a smile. She didn't look as bad as she normally did, or as she normally thought she did. Must be the lighting.

I was out for one day, just *one* day.... The phrase &quot;Zoom *zoom* zoom!&quot; comes to mind here. Either way, it's good that you took control of Derek for a sec there, Sued. Personally, I was going to have Derek burst into a rage &amp; crush the @#%$'s skull (Derek don't like him.) but that was good improv, lol. Dahn, I won't make Carmen do anything bad... ;p))<br>
<br>
Derek scanned the club, and saw the chick again. He'd been staring for a few minutes, trying to decide whether it was her or not. He remembered the board deal, and did a quick mental exertion and was seeing through her eyes for a moment. She was staring at Jash nearly the whole time. Shrugging, he knew this was the skating chick that wanted the crystals.<br>
<br>
Muttering over and over, &quot;Black as midnight, give me sight, Tears of twilight, darkest might,&quot; as he thought about Shadow. That sick @#%$. Derek hated him with a passion; no one, *NO* one, up and hurts his friends. He remembered a time someone beat him with a chair in fifth grade- he did nothing. The same kid then made Nefi cry the next day, and now that cruel bully was braindead. Derek smiled, &quot;Boy, human civilization sure is great, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl stared up at him. Her platinum blonde ponytail swayed in the dim, blue dancing lights. Strobe lights blinked from the DJ's turntables, and lasers and other lights were controlled by programs, zipping back and forth across the dance floor. Derek continued, &quot;Yea, and all we had to do was kill the planet... not that hard, considering. But, well, that's just human nature, so-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you the guy I'm looking for?&quot; She asked impatiently. To his practiced dumbfound expression, she continued, &quot;Derek?? You know him??&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled. Blunt. Jash would like her. &quot;I got it right here, luv. Don't worry bout a thing. Test it out.&quot; Derek plunked a white plastic baggy on the table stacked with crystals. Here eyes went wide as she grabbed her professionally made straw. He poked open the bag, and inhaled a bit. The blonde put a hand on her forehead, and leaned back. &quot;Ooooo, that's good. That's really good. I don't think I got the money for that, but-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is regular strength, honey.&quot; Her eyes went wide. &quot;Yea, up here it is. You must be buying from some cheapass. You got my number- hit me up when you need more, ya digg?&quot; Derek started walking away, and she called out something about a credit chip- after all, it was twice what she asked for. &quot;Don't worry about it. Think of it as sealing the deal- you're *my* customer now. I'm always available.&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek walked into the middle of the dance floor, and let the lights wash over him. Everyone around him was dancing and grooving hard, and he was just standing there. Derek raised an arm. It was time to exert the Willforce again. This time, the blackest of black was gonna knock out this @#%$. Shadow. Moving his arms fluidly, he twirled around on the dance floor. There was nothing anymore, only the lights and sound. After a while, he entered a state of moving trance; gnosis. He thought to himself, 'State reached. Commence operation cold strike...'<br>
<br>
In his mind's eye, he could see the pure, white energy being given off by his own body; after all, he'd done a good deed. One that cost him, but it was without regret or second thoughts. The white energy pulsed with the beats. Then he reached back into his own mind. He reached the vision of Shadow held back there; the people moved and grooved, yet he watched the freak through his mind's eye. He was behind Devin. He was still in here. He resisted the command! Derek's pure white energy turned to black hatred. He fed off the negative vibes coming from the man in all black, from the lethal intent of the blade in his hand. He walked calmly over to where he could see Devin and Kali. &quot;Devin,&quot; Derek said. The cat-man looked over to his friend who was in a dead trance. Derek raised his arms, and released the black energy he gathered. Bull's eye.<br>
<br>
Shadow screamed. He nearly split Derek's ears, and he wasn't as close, or with as good of hearing, as his friend was. Derek smiled to himself, and tightened the leather gloves; mission accomplished. One less bastard to worry about.... unless he could recover.<br>
<br>
Derek smiled at the possibility. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usuedydar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suedydar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Souls</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/7/02 2:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> ((OOoooo, that was cool.

  The scream came. It was loud enough to drone out the sound of the pulsing music. Who cared? The people in Cyberia glanced around for the source of the scream while it lasted, but once it died out so did thier thoughts of it. Someone got murdered. Nothing new. Cops'll take care of it in a few hours. Until then they had time to continue thier party, be it dancing or drinking or just hangin' out. Looking aound Jash found Derek and read his mind while walking over to him. &quot;Nice move. What's the tally up to now, 6? Haha, you're gonna be famous in a few years. *grins* Find your customer yet?&quot;<br>

His meeting with Lor had been...different and had changed him somehow.  Unfortunately, the people he talked to were either too drugged to have an intellegent conversation with, or whores.  After seeing them, he felt blessed to have the friends he did.  Already he missed Lor.  Her sharp wit, intellegence, and affability.  He felt odd feeling such strong emotion, he had always told himself to abstain from such things.  Quickly he did a scan for his friends.  Derek was busy, and for some reason, he felt if he talked to Devin at the moment, he would either kill himself, or Devin.  He didn't relaly know were he stood with Nefer, he feared she hated him.  Mika would be a breath of fresh air, her good nature and happiness were two of the few things that ever made Jerron smile.  He walked over to were he sensed her.  She was sitting at the table Lor and he had sat at, with Nefer.  &quot;Hey, Mika, Nefer.&quot;  Slowly, Jerron walked over to the table.  He cleared his mind of thoughts of Lor.  For some reason, it was easier to banish her from his mind that is was to rid himself of Nefer.  He bent his legs at the knees and moved to sit.  Mentally, he blocked out the pain his legs sent to his brain.

&quot;Jash, what's up, dogg?&quot; Derek grabbed a drink from a passing waiter-bot. The long blue glass was round at the bottom, tapered, then widened at the top. &quot;And actually, that's 5 braindead, 6 including him which is still a bit iffy, and only one dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek took a long drink to cool his searing throat. It felt as if he'd screamed every last bit of life out of his own body to do that. Already, his body and mind were recovering. It usually took a night's rest. He swallowed, and mumbled, &quot;My customer...&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked back to where a sexy blonde was sitting, the one who bought the crystals from him. She was inspecting the merchandise, obviously paranoid about being given one hundred chips worth of the stuff for free. &quot;She's over there.&quot; Jash followed his finger, and let out a low whistle when his eyes settled on her. &quot;Yea.

<br>
Derek smiles. Seems like everyone's hookin up tonight; Derek's got that Kali chick. Jash with his new customer o_$ , and even Jerron was gettin friendly (or moreso that Derek usually sees him) with a true beaut. He shrugged; it's not like his friends were ugly or anything, so why was he surprised? Just the opposite, really. If Nefer saw even *half* the appreciative glances she was getting...<br>
<br>
Derek remembered Mika in her black school girl outfit. The thought of it nearly made his knees weak, but the sight of her made him want to run screaming as if his eyes were on fire. Long made short- Derek was scared. And he had every reason to be; she never really said much to him, and she spent most of her time with Nefi. Not that that was a bad thing; if he could reach her as well as Mika could, he'd do the same thing. Maybe they were in to each other. His eyebrow raised as he stared at them, and he made a mental note to put that possibilty into the little world he escaped to when he was alone. His world just made more sense...<br>

  &quot;Sure,&quot; she said, smiling micheviously. Tossing something in her pocket they stepped into the crowd. *&quot;Better start off casual..ok..got it..&quot;* thought Jash to himself. Beginning to move his body he let the rythm(sp?) flow through his body. After a few more minutes of just dancing it got boring. *&quot;Eh, this is no fun. Time to kick things up a notch! *grins* &quot;* Halting for a second Jash searched aound the room with his mind. *&quot;Where is my board..ah hah. There it is. Come here.&quot;* Waving at his board it floated into the air and stopped at his feet. *&quot;Now, where is hers...that must be it. You come here too.&quot;* Waving at what he thought was her board it began to float and stopped at her feet. &quot;Just hold on to me.&quot; Glaring at him suspiciously she did as she was told. <br>
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; <br>
&quot;You'll see. Now's when the fun begins.&quot; <br>
  Using his willforce Jash lifted both of the boards above the croud. &quot;This will be a lot more fun, don't you think? Aerial dancing, no bumping into other people and getting knocked down, just us, the lights, and the music. Nothing to worry about really -- hey, what's your name? Never caught it.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's Carmen.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, there's nothing to worry about really Carmen. I know what I'm doing, just don't lose your footing. It's easy! I know you can Tryck well, and that's all you need to do! C'mon, what's the worst that can happen?&quot;<br>
&quot;Eh, if you say so. Let's go for it!&quot;<br>
((The fancy tricks left up to you to imagine once again..Now it's around 30 minutes later..))<br>
&quot;Oh my GAWD! That was so FUN!&quot;<br>
&quot;Hehe, told you it was.&quot;<br>
Jash and Carmen continued to talk and float around.<br>
*&quot;He's such a show off..they make a nice couple, heh,&quot;* thought Derek.<br>
