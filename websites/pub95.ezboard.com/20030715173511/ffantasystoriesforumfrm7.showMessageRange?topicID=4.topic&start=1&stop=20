The hills rolled softly and the east ridge loomed in the distance. Those mountains none had crossed for many a year. The mighty river Balereth flowed through the middle of the land and down in the grassy plains of Gremmin stood the city Drogoth. Its mighty walls standing in defiance to the new threat that has come upon them. The forest now grows dark and many evils lurk beyond the shadows of the trees. Many fear the woods as of late and those who do not eventually perish not far past the trees edge. It is rumored that there is a dark lord beyond those parts and that a dark empire has arisin deen in the woods. Many can hear the trees cry out in vain as they are uprooted and the forest is being destroyed deep within its borders. The people of Drogoth have summoned a meeting to decide what they must do about the threat to their fair city. Many brave souls, and some evil ones that lurk on the edge of the meeting place; unoticed, have attended and the fate of the land is being decided.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 7:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Beginnings</span><hr size=1>   Vermifax scurried around on the edge of darkness bordering the light streaming out of the meeting place. His master had ordered him to scout out the area and find out all the information that he could hear. His scaled skin shimmered slightly in the tourch light. Hearing the voices of many people moving towards him; Vermifax Misanthrope quickly started to cover himself in the brush from around him. The people passed and after the footsteps could no longer be heard the pointed teeth clinched into a hard grin. Standing up and shaking off the leaves and dirt from his battle hardened armor, Vermifax popped his knuckles and his neck before walking out onto the worn path. This was proving too easy.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Who goes there?&quot; a stern face peered into the black. Farrio had been out to smoke his pipe in peace when he heard some movement in the brush next to the building. He pulled the branches back to squint into the darkness. &quot;AGGHHHHHH!!!!&quot; the shout came and a thing leapt from the leaves and knocked him over. Screaming Farrio tried to pull his dagger. Still screaming he heard laughter. &quot;Haha! Silence big brother stop screaming or the elders will think that the darkness has come to swallow us up already.&quot; Farrio swore, &quot;Jessica! How many times do I have to tell you to stop following me! You were told to stay back at the house!&quot; Farrio stood back up and straightened his chain mail and adjust the blade at his hip. He stared at the golden eyes of his little sister. She was still laughing slightly and her long braided hair fell over her shoulder; she looked like the two's momma. &quot;Go home and don't let anyone see you. You are not supposed to be out tonight.&quot; Farrio pointed back towards their home. Reluctantly she turned and started to slowly walk back home. Thinking he had enough scare for one night, Farrio composed himself and brushed the leaves from his short hair and walked back into the meeting house.<br>

Anyone at all......?</span><hr size=1> The mayor of Drogoth had long since retired from the podium- there was little use in trying to get these people in order. All around the room, one could hear nothing but a completely chaotic uproar, and more and more shouts of, &quot;Something *must* be done!&quot; &quot;What about the children?&quot; &quot;Who will go?&quot; &quot;Not I! I have many mouths to feed,&quot; &quot;I have a shop to tend,&quot; &quot;WHO WILL GO?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cutting through the crowd like a dull knife through granite, Dreyan struggled his way, finally, from the back of the room to the podium, and addressed the sweat-bathed farmers and shopkeeps and the like. His tousled brown hair framed his young face, but his eyes belayed an age and experience that far outweighed his apparent lifespan. The simple brown travelling robes and black hooded cloak he wore made him less likely to be spotted anywhere, and he blended in to the crowd. People started to shout at him when he reached the dais and attempted to speak; vegetables were thrown at him, curses issued, and the uproar grew.<br>
<br>
Pulling back his hood, he revealed a pair of yellowed eyes, positively feline in appearance. He threw back the robes and cloak, showing the sheen of his green pants and leather straps adorning his body, along with a multitude of scars on his arms between those straps; scars that denoted rank among his people. The tattoo of a lion adorned his left hip, and symobls were either tattooed or carved into his chest as scars. The din died down, but did not stop completely, as there were still a few hushed whispers. Holding his hand high, blue light shone forth, coating everything around him with indigo luminescence; the talking stopped, and tranquillity insued.<br>
<br>
The light stopped as abruptly as it started. Dreyan chuckled to himself, and put his robes back on. &quot;Hehehe... Glad you all quieted down with that; I can only do it once.&quot; A few startled snickers and half-hearted laughs ensued. &quot;As you all know, there's something fishy going on across the Balereth.&quot; People agreed in murmurs and blasphemes toward the forest. &quot;Men have gone missing. The treeline is now our only safe border; Drogoth is no longer the peaceful ruler of these grassy planes. This is our battlefield, and preparations must be made if we are to protect our city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah!&quot; many of the crowd cried in unison.<br>
<br>
&quot;I, myself, would be of little value in this; I suggest you take military matters into your own hands. As for the forests, however...&quot; Dreyan tightened the gauntlets at their straps, and rubbed the mithral knuckles. &quot;I find myself disgusted at the befowlment of Gaea. Let the animals rule, let the trees flourish; it is for this vision of peace that I go to infiltrate whatever stronghold or destroy whatever beast may lurk beyond our borders. I ask now, with open arms and low expectations-&quot;<br>
<br>
Dreyan flipped in the air like a feather, and landed atop the podium with the grace of a cat. Holding a flexing, muscular arm in the air, he shouted, &quot;Who  is  with  me!&quot;  The room stared blankly at him, no one daring to move, lest he call upon them. Sagging a bit, he muttered, &quot;Don't all move at once... Hey, I can sense at least a few shadow-stalkin creatures out there; come to me after the meeting if you wish for the spoils of *this* battle. Anyone? Anyone at all......?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/02 9:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone? Anyone at all......?</span><hr size=1> As the crowd's silence roared louder than the waves of the ocean, Farrio fought the urge to rush up to the front and follow the stranger. His mind told him to stay back and wait until later, but his heart told him differently. Confused and somewhat nervous, he stayed quiet and in the back.<br>
<br>
Sure that he was in the clear, Vermifax slowly walked towards the building. He had seen two children outside earlier and now they had left. Sure that the perimeter was clear he crept towards the building to see inside and find out how much these people truely knew. He saw a man shouting about some strange things happening, but none of the true plot against these people. Smiling, Vermifax listened to the shouts of a man about a military move. Nonsense! These people could not hold a candle to his great lord of darkness. Snickering to himself he started back down the trail he came from. This would be too easy.<br>
<br>
Farrio slowly walked behind a small line of people going to talk to the man. He was unsure if this was the best idea he ever had. His parents would be angry with him and make him stay, but that was the least of his fears, he was afraid that they would let him. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles)

She also knew her size and capability. What could a girl of only fourteen winters do? It's better than nobody... Memories of her sister reel through her mind. <br>
<br>
Perdita had been killed only a year ago after wondering into the forest. She had been placed under her sister's care, but while her sister prepared dinner, Perdita ran into the forest to play. She did not understand why it was no longer safe to venture into the forest she did when she was younger. Expecting to find a playground of branches and friends in animals, Perdita went skipping into the darkness. No one quiet knows what she found, but they do know they never found her.<br>
<br>
Screams break the calm waves of her mind. Almost on their own her legs jump to a stand. She could almost hear the laughter and feel the comforting eyes as she walked to the man on the podium. Everyone knew what had happened to her sister, everyone was willing to lend a hand here or there to help ease her pain. They could never understand her pain. If they wanted to help they could have stopped her sister from running into the forest. If they wanted to help they could bring her sister back! But it was Zita's fault her sister went into the forest that night... if she only kept better watch she'd still be here... And it was too late to bring her back... It was the looks she got that made her hold her head high. She was fine... She was fine... She was broken.<br>
<br>
She wore the simple cloth pants and tunic that every poor family from her town wore. She was nothing special and it was likely she would not be much help. She was there, however, and would help in anyway possible. Whatever lived in that forest would pay... They would pay for taking Perdita, for taking the only family she had left.<br>
<br>
Extending a hand towards the man, she speaks in a stern voice, she had to be brave otherwise he would think her a joke. <br>

The man had said to collect his things and meet him in the square with the few other recruits. Rehersing how he would sneak into the house to get the things that would go with him, he slowly opened his window.<br>
<br>
  Finally having all his things gathered and his father's sword at his hip he started for the window. &quot;Son, never let the ideas of others take away from your goals and hopes.&quot; The words echoed in his mind. The words his father had said to him before he had tried to enter the forest. Remembering the day Farrio felt renewed in his quest to go out and help. He was almost out the window when he felt a tugging at his leg. Turning with a dagger in his hand, Farrio meet the fierce eyes of his sister. &quot;I'm going with you!&quot; she said with her own bags flung over her shoulder. Sighing, Farrio stepped down from the window and hugged his sister. &quot;Darling, you are too young to go where I am going. There is danger and I don't want you to get hurt.&quot; Farrio tried to plead with her to make her understand. Finding no avail to the situation he finally nodded and lifted her up to the window. &quot;Ok I'll let you go, but you stay with me and don't get into any trouble.&quot; feeling very stupid for letting her find him Farrio followed out the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;Master, the objective was carried out without those stupid people even knowing I was among their ranks.&quot; Snickered Vermifax as he knelt before the throne shadowed in darkness. He peered into the black and only found two burning red eyes shining back at him. He heard the growling laughter coming from his master. &quot;You prove more useful everyday young Vermifax. Keep the work up and you might just find yourself the master of your own land, or dead.&quot; Wincing at the last remark, Vermifax could hear the laughter. &quot;Leave me now, the plotting for the end of those pathetic creatures is slowly forming and I must have full concentration to finish with the enchantments that will lead to their demise. Darkness follow you everywhere.&quot; &quot;Darkness follow you everywhere.&quot; Vermifax muttered as he quickly scurried away. &quot;And may the fog of fear always hide you from the eyes of men.&quot; he muttered as he left the room. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles)

There were few men above twenty! And few men, at that. There were even women. This was the most pitiful raiding party he'd ever lead. Was there no one with experience in this land at all, or was there just none that cared to show their cowardly faces? Wiped his face and sighed, &quot;This is going to be a bloodbath. I can't protect this many people!&quot;<br>
<br>
There wasn't a school of magics around anywhere, so he knew there would be no mages among the group. The forest was dark, and there were few, if any, nature spirits left, so there would be no druids. He didn't even see barracks anywhere, just a few pikemen along the wall; oh yes, this was going to be tough.<br>
<br>
He remembered most of the faces that he'd seen that night; only a few of the recruits (children, actually) masked their fear as well as did a select few. He hoped against hope that there would be shady glory-seekers or beastlings or changelings or *some* kind of magical creature would hop along his path when he crossed the fields; anything to help him keep these children safe.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Dreyan. That's enough for now,&quot; He shouted. &quot;I can only take a few with you; we'll not be able to sneak in with a force of so many,&quot; he lied. He pointed to a late-arriving young man with a girl near him, one sneaky looking woman, a brutish man, and the girl earlier that, along with these three, showed him no fear. He hoped it would be enough. &quot;You four, come along. If the rest of you wish to help, build defenses in the plains. We leave now.&quot; He hopped off the rock he'd been standing on, and gathered the people he'd pointed out around him to hear their suggestions on the matter as they walked through the streets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/17/02 8:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Nothing to notice</span><hr size=1> Dreyan... What an odd name. His name did not matter, his ability to teach and guide these selected few did. Following behind the small group, Zita keeps her head down and her opinions silent. What did a small girl like her need to say? She was there, and she would try her hardest, that was all she had to offer. She tried to keep up with the conversations about tactics, but it was all so over her head that she often found herself lost. What * was * 'gorilla warfare' anyway? Zita knew it had nothing to do with apes, but what * was * if not a type of monkey war? Maybe she was not as far from the answer as she thought, but to her it seemed like they had hundreds of life times filled with wisdom, and she had only a handful of years from her single, nearly uneventful life. ~The streets are so dark... It's so gloomy...~ A quiet sigh escapes from her lips and she continues to shuffle along behind Dreyan's group just far enough to be left out, and just close enough to hear everything. Zita feels the chill of night as she hugs herself tightly. ~Even the winds have gotten colder...~ Would they accomplish anything from trying to fight this enemy? Would they even be able to fight?

Her clock hides everything about her except her curvaceous<br>
Figure and a few strands<br>
of her shoulder length burgundy hair. The man she supposed was the leader stepped up “is there a problem?”<br>
 the echo of a deep cold laugh was heard in the dept of her hood a second before she yanked her crystal sword from her side and flung it at him intending to slice his head clean off.<br>
<br>
All Lila heard was the clash of metal, not even a simple breeze when he pulled his sword and counted her attack “what in the-“ the man exclaimed looking at her with wondering eyes.<br>
<br>
Lila smiled and slowly stepped back, she replaced her sword at her side and bowed low “I honorably ask to join yr quest”<br>
The man remained silent for a small period of time then spoke in a deep ton of voice “we all ready have what we need but if  your determined to help u could head back to the group I left behind” and he proceeded to walk away from her “I strongly suggest u reconsider” she spoke softly<br>
“oh really and why would that be?” he asked without looking back at her<br>
<br>
The only thing that finally got his attention was the scream that was let out by the smallest of the group, the young blonde girl. She had been walking along as normal when a huge black hole had appeared before her, if it wasn’t for the one that seemed her older brother hadn’t gapped her by the arm and yanked her back she would have defiantly been lost to the world of light forever<br>
<br>
Lila waved a hand and the hole. was gone “because…..” she faced him her burgundy eyes burning into his “u……<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> may</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need me[/i]<br>

She munched hungrily on a dry loaf of bread as she quickly emptied her pockets of all the jewlry she had just taken from the house and sorted it, and put them in her bag.  <br>
<br>
With a smile on her face, she flicked a small stone at the youngest of the group, which bounced of her head.  Before the girl could look up to see what had happened, she had already jumped behind the chimny stack, giggleing to herself quietly.<br>

Thinking that she was out of the conversation due to her ignorance in the matters of battle and wars, Jessi found she just stayed close to her brother and tried to learn what the words and terms meant and occasionally asked Farrio about them.<br>
<br>
Farrio looked at the small group of people. The leader was full of wise ideas and good tatics. The night had been long and he was feeling more like a student than a new solider for the light. His mind started to wonder to his sister's well being. If the fight grew bad and the odds even worse, he was not prepared to let his sister get hurt or worse killed. Very conflicted on his duties, Farrio just hurried along with the group and made enough contributions to help and to make his precense known.<br>
<br>
Laughing to himself Vermifax lurked in the darkness. He felt the essence of another on the roof tops and was about to pounce when the feeling was diverted to the power of a portal being opened. Startled that power like that existed in this part of the land. He hopped around the roof tops to get a better look at this new comer. Finding it a woman he laughed some more. Opening his own little void of power he sent it masked under the pressense of the other void. Once that ball hit or got close enough it would draw in the victim and launch them to his master. It looked like the target was the smallest girl. Snickering Vermifax knew how much his master loved to have little girls as pets. He would be rewarded for this one!<br>
<br>
The mood was out and the man was utterly confused. He was supposed to be coming across the city now, but there was nothing but darkness. His powers were somehow disturbed. He blinked his white eyes to peer into the darkness. Catching himself he stopped, old habits die hard. He had lost his sight many years ago in a fire and he had just recently grown to use a strength to allow him to see. His face was covered to hide the scar that ran down the right side of his face. he hands were gloved and he was wearing a cloak to hid the rest of his burnt deformed frame. he was not a strong man, nor was he large. scampering into the black he decided to walk until his sight was renewed. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles)

This was going to be hard. All of a sudden, he saw the first man and woman he'd seen, the ones he couldn't remember the names of, disappear into little black holes. He hoisted the smallest girl on his shoulders, grabbed the one who pulled a crystalline sword on him, and took off, shouting, &quot;Follow me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Great. Two men down and not even past the city walls. Resting under a street light about three blocks from the nearest gate. Drawing a quarterstaff from behind his cloak, Dreyan made a circle on the ground. He sprinkled a bit of white dust from a pouch, and the ring glowed. He grabbed a fistful of the newcomer's shirt and screamed, with fire burning through his green eyes, &quot;WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM!!&quot; Blue light glowed from his gauntlets. His eyes calmed, visibly, and he let her go. &quot;No. It doesn't matter. Besides, it probably wasn't you. I didn't feel you cast out your power. There's something out there...&quot; His eyes gazed up, past the lamplight, and up to the roofs.<br>
<br>
Waving a hand in front of his face, Dreyan poked a finger deep into his right temple. His vision increased as he gasped, and he could swear he saw two figures on two different rooftops. He saw the first jump lithely towards the second. He saw a pebble zing towards the girl on his shoulders, and Dreyan raised a hand and caught it. It finally clicked. &quot;WATCH YOUR BACK!&quot; he screamed to the pebble-thrower. Was all this hopeless? What was the point? Two young girls, one young man, a fiery, experienced warrior who needed to be taught her place... Could he trust that one? She could very well kill them all in their sleep... And if she threatened another innocent child... a growl escaped his throat.<br>
<br>
Letting his vision drop, Dreyan sat the girl to the ground. &quot;There you go. Sorry bout that.&quot; He was exhausted; these tricks took a lot of effort. He looked up again to see the same two figures; what was going on up there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/23/02 12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> la</span><hr size=1> Zita watched as two people standing in front of her disappeared into darkness.

Die... they were all going to die for sure... every last one of them was going to die if the enemy was a mere shadow. It was then that her conscious thought left her. Her mind was frozen with fear and her body shaken with terror. Her finger tips touch her cheeks as if to see that she is still alive and actually there, watching *shadows* *eat* *people*, the same shadows she was to fight, the same shadows that took her sister? Her fear confused itself with her own amazement. *shadows* *ate* *people*... God, if she could only control one of those shadows... She would be so powerful... She wouldn't have to be scared... She would never fail again... With eyes as big as saucers she stares at the spot were her new acquaintances had stood moments earlier, a look of awe and respect on her stilled face.<br>

He was angry that he missed his target, but the master had two new slaves and saw the rest of the group. He would most likely summon him soon to request the capture of the smallest girl. His smile returned, Vermifax saw the young men looking up at his direction. One was watching the other on the rooftops and the youngest was watching him. His eyes were unwavering and directly pointed at him. This was fun. With a small wave f his hands the light rose from the roof top and he rose with it. He watched the fear and the anger rise from the young man as Vermifax wove his small spells over the boy's sister. Laughing again he floated off on the breeze. <br>
<br>
Farrio swore and pulled his sister behind himself. This was starting to look like a bad idea after all. Pulling a small dagger from his belt he handed it to his sister who took it. He would die for his sister, and he knew something was not right.<br>
<br>
Jessica started to hear the voice right after the large light flashed. *join us.* she shuddered *Join Us!* it said louder this time, *JOIN US NOW!!* she shouted and covered her ears. She felt her brother grap her up, but the shouting would not stop it hurt her head and ears. Shutting her eyes tightly and trying to cover her ears from the noise, she shouted and cried but to no avail. He tried to plead with the voice to stop, but it kept screaming. finally she let herself fall into the voice and it slowly softened. Opening her eyes she saw she was in a different place. Her brother and no one was around the town was gone and the sky was not dark nor was it light. Following her feet she slowly found her way to a throne that was cloaked in darkness. She could see two dark red eyes glowing back at her. She felt very small compared to this place. Feeling like nothing and very sad the voice came very silky and with a safe ring that made her feel slightly better. &quot;You are beautiful, I had almost forgot the beauty of a child. But for now I must only talk to you secretly. No one else may know about this. I am asking you to trust me Jessica.&quot; Feeling safe as if she were at a house she had known all her life with a man she had always known, she nodded her head. &quot;Good, you must first learn some things. Like the power of friendship. The group you travel with is not your friend. They want to see to my, our destruction. We must not let this happen.&quot; About to agree she felt odd. The building started to crumble and the darkness started to clear. She shouted to the man to stay with her, but he only shouted back that he would see her again. Sitting up straight she saw the group surrounding her. Flinching she found her brother next to her. Feeling safer with Farrio around she stood up. When he asked what had happened she told him it was nothing to worry about and that the light just frightened her. She saw the void floating still on the wind above the walls of the town.  <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles)

She had been getting very strange dreams bordering on nightmares and was terrified. She could not keep her mind off the intentions of the others. Growing more and more paranoid in the night she finally got up and started to walk around above the others. She pulled the small blade from her belt and sat looking at the blade against Dryan's throat. She reached her hand out and stopped just short of touching his forehead. Images flew through her mind and the memories of childhood and everything else was spinning around her. Finding no trace of evil at all in this man she stood and moved to the next in line. <br>
<br>
Zita, Jessica hadn't heard her speak at all that she could remember. Moving her blade over her neck, Jessica did the same ritual with her. Images of death and vengence and many other horrifying things flew past her and without a doubt she was one of the evil ones that the man had spoke about. Standing up, she looked down at the sleeping woman. Jessica had never taken a life before, but now was not the time. She would have to watch her moves and if anything looked like it might hurt her brother or the rest of the good people in the group; Jessica would not hesitate to destory that life as if it were just a bug. Opening the palm of her hand she smiled at the small flame that grew there. She snickered at the shifting moves of the sleeping girl, she must be having nightmares. <br>
<br>
Snapping her fist shut and crushing the flame, she moved to the next person.The new comer Lila, Jessica did not like her, the void that took two of the others was cast by this on. Belting her knife Jessica reopened her fist to create a ball of fire that nearly engulfed her entire hand. Sweat ran down her arm where the flames bite at her but did not burn. She moved her hand over the forehead and withdrew it faster than any of the others, she was the evil one! She must be stopped! Just as the fire was about to leave her hand it dissapated and she turned around to see her brother standing there watching. &quot;Sister, you should know better than to play with fire in the house.&quot; Smirking he let his own hand fall to his side and the mist that surrounded him lift. &quot;Go to sleep, and remember I am watching you, I know you might not like some people here, but I'm always there to watch your back and keep you safe, you remember that.&quot; <br>
<br>
Farrio felt sorry for dragging his sister into this mess. She had not only found the power of fire that burned in her soul, but she seemed different now that it had bubbled to the surface. He would have to teach her how to hide it from the others as he did. He did not want them to think himself or his sister one of the evils that plauged this land because of the elemental powers that the two were given in birth. His sister with fire and himself with water. The two were opposites, and all they had were each other.   <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles) "I am the monkey king" (quickens the dance) "I am the monkey king!"

She was hiding some distance away, watching the group sleep.  She had been watching their dreams, for that was Sine's gift.  She could enter people's minds.  But Jessica intrigued her.  She still had much to learn.<br>
<br>
  A yawn temporaraly deformed Sine's face and she decided that it was time for bed.  Clutching one of her many knives tightly, she curled up and closed one eye. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> On tha road again.....

I'll gather the herbs for an exorsism ritual, but that's going to take time. Quench oak bark, plentiful enough in the forest...<br>
<br>
Dreyan stretched in the morning's light, and smiled as the first rays of dawn renewed his strength. His family was moon-born, and were replenished by the full moon, yet he was a sun-child; the solar rays renewed and enhanced his strength nearly tenfold. His eyes snapped open and dread passed through him; the forest. No sun....<br>
<br>
Scrambling across the others bogged down to camp, Dreyan rushed for his pack. The First Rays were always the most powerful, and easily captured in the glowing transparent-orange octarine sun medallion he kept in his pack. He grabbed it, and it exuded a bright golden aura. That'll last him a day, minimum.<br>
<br>
Soon enough, the group was on the move again. He let Zita and Farrio move ahead of him on the north-bound mission, but Lila seemed to keep her distance from the others; powerful, but distant. That matter would be settled later. He turned to Jessica, and put a comforting arm around her tiny shoulders. &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
<br>
She snapped out of some kind of trance, and gave her hello as well. Dreyan stopped, and put his mouth close to her ear. In a quiet whisper, he said, &quot;I'm very alert at night; you could say I'm afraid of the dark. I know about the knife deal, but would you mind explaining it to me? I'd hate to accidentally hurt you if you do it again, and I can't feel that it's yo- PLAIN HOPPERS!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The massive beasts looked like brown, furless rabbits with small heads and big, beady eyes. The ears were always swept back, as they were always hopping along. Great for steaks! The hind legs were about half of their body, and they stood at least a head taller than a normal man. Dreyan ran, laughing joyously, and jumped atop one as it ran past. The herd was making their traditional clicks, but the squeals of surprise from this one while it tryed to buck him off were ear-splitting. He laughed as if it were nothing. &quot;WOOOOO!! Come on, they're harmless! YEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAH!&quot;<br>
<br>
It took some goading, but Dreyan finally got everyone mounted up; he couldn't tell if they were really enjoying themselves, but he was having the time of his life! &quot;Wooohooo! North, my friends!

Sine, a theif and general mischeif maker, had no regular job, had no family to go back to, had nothing to pass the time.  That is why she followed the party.  Always in the shadows, always listening to their thoughts.  Growing up in the forest, she knew it well, and could slip silently through it faster than any of the great cats.

This would be intersting. She might have to kill the kind hearted aywas. Smirking to herself she looked to the sun and saw the bright star flash with red. The sign of blood, a symbol of death and murder. She would have to watch the moon tonight to find if her beloved brother would be with her or if he would also fall on the cutting board.<br>
<br>
Farrio saw his sister's carefree expression change to one that terrified him. That was the same look their other sister had gotten the day before she was killed for black magic. He would have to keep her under his eye and make sure they did not slip with the powers that were given. He slowly started to think that someone has been following them, more then the usual way, but following them in the mind. Thinking he was insane he looked out over the horizan anyways. Casting a small shield of mist to cover the tracks and another one over his sister's mind to protect her from whatever it was plaguing her.<br>
<br>
Vermifax followed this theif with renewed intrest. At first he had thought she must be a street orchin that was merely playing games, but the power emitted from her made him look twice. He had already seen the powers that little pet controled, maybe without fully grasping the significence of it. The brother also had some sort of ability to block out the unwanted attention the two drew by masking the powers or atleast covering it up. He drew up a mental image of his plan. First was to kill that boy so that the power would be unleashed back into nature, making his master stronger, then he would capture that girl, she would cause great damage freely destroying things in her path for vengence. She might forget what side she is really on. It seems Farrio had not, he played his part perfectly. The two children had been plucked at young ages to be given this great task, although the reason might have been forgotten the requirements were not. Farrio and Jessica, perfect for one another. Vermifax laughed again, the irony of it all. Farrio was playing the older brother role just as he had hundreds of years ago, the two pets were perfect. The memories flooded their way back.<br>
<br>
Long ago Vermifax was standing with his brother at the edge of the cliff. They had a bet that the first one to jump would get to have the other's entire collection of army soldiers. The days when the two were innocent and ignorant. Vermifax had been the younger of the two, his older brother Farrio was always stronger willed and better at everything. Smirking, that was not how it ended up. Jessica had always caught Vermifax's eye, but she was always interested in Farrio. Haha what a trick that was played on them. Over the years after Vermifax gave into the master, Farrio grew weaker and weaker, Jessica was no longer protected by him and they took her. Then came his dear brother. the two were then broken and sent out to play like pawns in the big picture. they were given parents and grew up again only as brother and sister instead of husband and wife. Vermifax's cruel idea. Laughing to himself he saw the mist rise and the fire burn. Perfect, this was way too easy. <br>
<br>
Returning to his plans Vermifax had to somehow figure out a way to dispatch this follower. He decided to plant a nightmare into the dreamreaders path and let it destroy her mind. Laughing again, Vermifax stood drew his black blade and start the chant. The day would be long, but the night, longer. <p>(Dances and dances around in small circles) "I am the monkey king" (quickens the dance) "I am the monkey king!" (Falls on his face but keeps moving in a circle) "I AM THE MONEKY KING!"

Lila smiled, the child’s gaze did not divert till her brother said something and her attention turned elsewhere. But there was something more than brotherly love in his eyes, no not just his eyes, this emotion ran deeper his soul his…….heart<br>
<br>
But what she was seeing couldn’t be they, they were family………were they not? And then there was that feeling, of more than one peer of eyes not leaving there backs ever watching yet not daring to come closer and the greatest evil, the one that scared her most the other travelers were mere dolls she could tell but this, this being this force…they would have to face him, destroy him one way or another<br>
<br>
But it wasn’t going to be easy she knew heck most of them didn’t trust her at all not even there “leader” she had nothing AGAIST him no maybe it was his, care free attitude I mean really, an image of him jumping onto one of the hoppers returned , she remembered the “YEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAH!” most vividly.<br>
<br>
And that child, oh that child the Jessica non of them knew, her “brother” thought he did but non of them really knew the power she contained the possibilities if she were to fall into the hands of the enemy……no, weather her or her brother liked it or not Lila would have to keep an eye on this one, have to train her, have to…..make sure the child was ready, for Lila could tell, Jessica had a great battle ahead of her, greater than they all could ever imagine…<br>
