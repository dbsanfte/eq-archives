She could see herself in the glass; the image was so crisp and clear that it was as if she was looking into the still water of an uncontaminated pool.  The only blemish in the pool however was her.  She did not see the person she had learned to come accustomed to.  The person she saw was the girl from her nightmare, the deathly thin, ghost pale, dirty girl that had died in the street under the exhaust vent of a Laundromat.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then, suddenly, like the first wave of summer crashing against the shore, it all came flooding back to her.  The dream that had faded into less than a memory now echoed through her brain and reminded her of who she really was.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She was the frail thing in the window, she was the creature that had destroyed everything she once was.  She stood, motionless, staring into the window, deep into the soulless void of her own eyes.  She had completely lost her sense of reality and lost control of anything and everything that resided in that realm.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her muscles went limp causing her to drop her bags of groceries on the street and her bladder to empty itself of its burden.  But still she stared.  The voice that was in her head (although she had never determined if it was hers or not) was speaking to her.  As it spoke, Mia’s lips moved and she spoke; for at this moment nothing existed except the words.  “Have you forgotten me?” She said to her reflection, which, disturbingly, did not say it back.  “Why do you resist?”  Mia asked herself.  “What is it that makes you hate me?!”  She screamed at the girl in the window. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sirens echoed in the back of her head but never quite made it to her conscious mind, if such a thing existed anymore.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The window she was looking into now was only a window on the other side.  On her side it was a mirror which reflected nothing but her and the padded walls around her.  Her arms were locked tight in a straight jacket, but she did not need them.  She was still immersed in the dialogue with herself.<br>
<br>
“Do you see?  Do you see what has become of you?”<br>
“That girl out there isn’t me.  What happens to her is irrelivent.”<br>
“Where is the pleasure in that?  Living only inside yourself.”<br>
“The mind is a wonderful thing.”<br>
“Yours is.”<br>
“yes.”<br>
“but why deny yourself the pleasures of the flesh?”<br>
”The body is weak.”<br>
“no . . .”<br>
“you can control it, but in here, I stay myself and you remain outside of who I am.”<br>
“you still haven’t figured it out?”<br>
“I have”<br>
“Then you already know”<br>
”know what?”<br>
”I . . . am . . . You”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the padded room in the St. Michelle psychiatric ward Mia screamed.  It was the first noise she had made in three days.  She continued to scream until the doctors rushed in and sedated her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the dark places that only heavy sedation brings about Mia heard two voices.  One voice she recognized as her own true voice.  The other was the voice that had plagued her for as long as she could now remember.  But now both voices were distant and detached from what she thought of as her consciousness.  And, she found as she listened to their conversation that sometimes they were not two separate and distinct voices, but rather they would mix and melt together and become one.  What they said in those moments was something that Mia would have rather not have heard, but being as though she was the one thinking them, she had no choice but to listen and to learn.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Mia opened her eyes she was temporarily blinded by the harsh white light of the exposed florescent bulb that lined the ceiling high above.  Strangely, despite her current condition, she felt refreshed, new, like the first flower blooming in the springtime.  She quickly learned that her arms and legs were strapped to the bed she was on, but what she didn’t know was why.  Her body was covered with scratches, some small, some large, all deep and now crusted over with dried blood.  Could she had seen them, she would have recognized them as scratches from claws or from finger nails.  In fact, there was still some dead flesh stuck under her nails although she did not know it.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The straps holding her to the table were far to loose for her.  She easily slipped her hands through the cuffs and than unbuckled the straps holding her feet.  Once she imagined, they had fit snuggly around her limbs, but now she was deathly thin and able to free herself from her bonds.  This, she took it, was a sign that she was not being cared for, that she had been tied down, sedated, and left to rot.  When she saw the slashes that covered her body she felt no emotion at all.  It was as if she saw her physical self as separate from her idea of ‘self’.  What happened to it was no longer any of her concern.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She swung her legs off the bed and tried to stand.  Her legs crumpled under her weight.  What muscle her body hadn’t yet consumed had atrophied and it was a struggle to pull herself to her feet.  <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She surveyed the room, seeing nothing but padded walls and a single heavy metal door.  The door was slightly ajar and the floor around it was covered with a red dust, coagulated, dried, blood.  She walked out the door, quietly stepping over the skinned human carcass on the floor . . .<br>
<br>

At first, it seemed she was just a manic depressant, but after reading this, it's apparent she is much more. So when she woke up in the asylum, all the stuff that happened to her before was just a dream? Or was it her past that she was dreaming about? The corpse in the cell and the door opened at the end was interesting, it looks like maybe someone was trying to help her out of there. But I'm just throwing wild guesses around here, anyway good work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/11/03 5:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercy v.2.3</span><hr size=1> Kick ASS!<br>
