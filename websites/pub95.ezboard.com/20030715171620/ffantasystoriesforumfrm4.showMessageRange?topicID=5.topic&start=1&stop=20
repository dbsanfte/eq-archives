Siblings blow.  I got really lucky, mines not coming home this summer, but I feel your pain.  I guess my only rant and rave is my summers gonna blow.  For a month, I may have to rise from bed at 5:00Am, be at the boathouse at 5:30, and start practive at 5:45.  For those of you debating what sport to chose, don't choose crew.  After practive, I'll have to shower, and then go to work by 9:00, until around 5:00, after which, I'll probably shower again.  At 7:00, I have STFFY, a musical production were I'll be working backstage, every night, for the show, Pajama game.  (Selling tickets last year was a nightmare, We went door to door saying, &quot;Hi, I'm from 'Stiffy' and I'm selling tickets for our show, Once Upon a Matress.  Some of the responses we got from the old single people were shocking)  After working on the set, and being under the hot lights until 11-12:00, I'll probably want to take another shower, and then get the four hours of sleep I'm going to be required to live on.  But, the crew thing might fall through and then I only have my art job and STFFY...I'm praying. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A> at: 6/12/02 7:19:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 7:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rillen, I'm soooo sorry, dude, lol!</span><hr size=1> Oh.

But he loves you. And for some reason, he needs money. He aalllllways needs money. He can create the universe, but for some reason, ah... just can't get that money!<br>
<br>
Bah. I hate fuckin Christianity. I'm sorry to any Christ-loving people out there, I've just seen too much hypocracy and stupid people bred from it. Oh, I love God, I'm going to follow in his footsteps because today is Sunday! Saturday rolls around, and I'm back out drinking with my buddies and cheating on my wife. Oh, but I can confess my sins! Wait, I'm getting fuckked hard core for doing bad things. God MUST have a plan for this! There MUSt be a reason the world suck! There MUST be someone watching over us, because I'm too insecure to think that I may, really, be all alone! Pfff. All bullshitt.<br>
<br>
Then there's the opinion that there *is* no God, or anything above us, and that we really are alone. That's an even more fuckked up perception of reality. I can say from experience, there are higher beings. I can say from experience, this world is not all that there is. There is more out there, and we can all tap into the energies. The only problem is that people are afraid to, or are too busy trying to fit in to a normal, moral society. Screw human society!<br>
<br>
&quot;White Magic&quot; religions are just moronic. Ok, sure, we *can* use the energy for something productive. But why? That's suppression of human instinct, yet again. Everything will come back to you, and the deities you invoke will be angry with you if you cause someone harm, eh? Wiccan Rede and Threefold Law? Bullshitt. All of it.<br>
<br>
Let's look at this from a magickal standpoint. You would invoke the power of a powerful deity, and use the energy somehow. Now, let's put this in example, shall we? I invoke the deity Electricity. If we know nothing of these higher beings, and for the most part we don't care, why would that being really care whether I use that energy to power my house or electrocute my neighbor? It knows nothing of human social structure, or why it would be wrong to kill another human. Why does it matter? Does It really care? NO!<br>
<br>
So now I ask you this, all ye with strong stomachs who have attempted the digestion of the rest of this bull;   Why do we all feel the need to conform to the morals of a society that doesn't work? Why do we concern ourselves with trying to fit in with people that we don't really care for? Why do we pretend to care about these pointless morals and beliefs that we didn't come up with ourselves? Why do we not care about so much? Why are we so content to just buy into whatever everyone else says instead of questioning everything, like intelligent &amp; sentient beings SHOULD? Why don't we seek answers to the questions we ask, why don't we try and see what we can do with just our minds? Has technology made us all so incredibley lazy and stupid that we don't even realize what a great gift we have??? FOOK! Sorry for the rant. I'm pissed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 7:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> dang so many unhappy people!!!!</span><hr size=1> <br>

hi everyone I saw the rant and rave section and couldnt help it. Since I am full of competition and I have to try and atleast post on thing on every subject here goes the life of me!<br>
<br>
First thing to address is the sibling thing, Hey I'm guessing all of you guys have sibnlings that are actually related to you. I have a little bro that is not really my brother you think siblings suck try being adopted with a brother and the entire world working for him because lets face facts when the dice fall he is &quot;there son&quot; after all. Although I do have a sister, real sister, and she is one of my best friends. I guess it's cause she lives very far away from me and we both are living in ou rown little hell. while I get blamed for everything that &quot;he&quot; does she doesn't even exist in her parent's eyes. well some attention is better than no attention I think...<br>
<br>
job wise I'm glad to say I too have to work all the time, 4 am to the donout place to work until about 12 when i usually leave for lunch and never show up after... I mean I go to eat and then get lost...  all summer but hey atleast I get to go to class as well, duel credit crap at 11 to 1 2 hours of lecture and then to top it all off when I get home I have to deal with them....<br>
<br>
anyways my life could be worse, hey I could still be in south korea hopeing that the water i was drinking hadn't been poisoned by those damned northerners and hopeing that the classes on saterday were short. <br>
<br>
Well that's about all the ranting that I can muster. After all I am a fun loving guy that doesn't complain alot. but this fourm is perfect to allow me to vent some of my anger which after this post will start to store up in that bottle again. well I'll see you all laterz! have a good day or night<br>

Mindles, I feel sorry for you, for the world you have described is both bleak and mechanical.  The mindless droning and conformity of the human teenage girl and boy will not always reign supreme.  In fact, it is the individual who is most liked and noted both in my own surroundings, and I hope, the rest of the world.  It is unfortunate that you are surrounded by girls that probably say the word 'like' more than the the complete total number of other words that they say, but take heart in the fact that while you are forever growing, they are staying pitifully the same and soon, their similarities and emulations of the 'pop' thing will not be so 'pop.'

<br>
*~Why do we concern ourselves with trying to fit in with people that we don't really care for?~* Because we hate who we are and can't stand the idea of other people hating us as well<br>
<br>
~*Why do we pretend to care about these pointless morals and beliefs that we didn't come up with ourselves?*~ If we care about nothing else, we can care about morals and beliefs that were set before us and before our parents and grandparents and being the people we are, we believe these things to be true, if they weren't, why would they have lasted so long?<br>
<br>
~*Why are we so content to just buy into whatever everyone else says instead of questioning everything, like intelligent &amp; sentient beings SHOULD?*~ Fear of being wrong, fear of being laughed at, fear of being alone in our ideas. It's easier to believe in something others do, if so many people believe in one thing, then it must be true.<br>
<br>
~*Why don't we seek answers to the questions we ask, why don't we try and see what we can do with just our minds?*~ Because abstract thought is difficult for most people. All our lives we are told how to act, how to think, and how to live. To question what we have been programed to do is to question life, not too many people are stable enough to question life, or are just scared of the answers they may find.<br>
<br>
~*Has technology made us all so incredibley lazy and stupid that we don't even realize what a great gift we have?*~ Yes, yes it has. But technology is our creation, this is our own doing and our own will. <br>

Ok well I guess this is the place to rant and rave... wait a minute that's the name of this forum... I think we should all just get along :P <br>
<br>
To all those out there that question things and believe that they should not believe what others do. I wish the best of luck to you and hope that in the afterlife... if there is one... you can sit in a large room with all your friends and family (the ones you like) and party. for the rest of the sad stories in here. I am deeply moved to the edge and am about to fall into the depths. So as I plunge for no other reason than that I am tired of standing, I think that the people, and as I see them friends, of this site are all their own and with minds that I could not hope to or would want to fully understand. for that is the beauty of the world today. The not understanding. I don't understand many things, like how the phone is always in my room and how the remote is somewhere in the couch. These things are the things that just happen and while they are sometimes usless ideas and traditions they are still our own and should be looked at from that point. Anways now that I have no idea what I am talking about I will leave you all, to misunderstand or completly lose your mind in this mess of talk that I call life. <br>

Time to fly a_random_gnome01!! Stupid little Enchanter was ~trying~ to make a mob in Oasis his pet and kill crocs. I, on my Druid, rooted the little snake so he could back up and charm it again and go back to killing. After which, I get spammed with /rudes (THAT'S MY JOB, FOOISH GNOME!!). So I return fire a bit, then walk away and kite around a sand scarab. The Gnome, wanting to become a bigger pain in my spine, charmed the scarab so I couldn't nuke it to pieces. This pissed me off, and when it broke I nuked it with everything I got. So I get experience, go to the docks to sell and med a little, when along comes Gnomie with a train of orcs and dry bones skeletons. A higher level Druid kindly nukes the skeletons to pieces, but there's still one orc to take care of. Me, not being to resist the Paladin uge to help someone that I hate, roots it and nukes it. &quot;Hey you retard, wtf was that for?&quot; I explained to him that I was trying to let him escape and live. &quot;I don't care, you broke the mezz that I finally landed. jackass&quot; So here I am, pissed at this little Gnome that at this moment I was wishing I was on RZ so I could PK him. I told him to shut up, he yelled for help and I helped. Everone at the docks agreed with me and told him to stop being a hipocrit. He dueled me, and being extremly mad I accepted and proceeded to nuke his little ass till it was a pile of ashes. Before I almost killed him though, he had landed Tashani on me. I read &quot;You hear the barking of Tashan.&quot; pondering this, I was charmed by him and started nuking myself. One final nuke and I'm back in EFP. Great. Now, I have to get my corpse. I tell him grats on the win and ask him what is barking of tashan. &quot;Magic resist debuff, duh&quot; Oh yeah. Like I was supposed to know what you read when you had Tashani cast on you. I asked him if he wanted to duel my main, Suedydar, a 47 Paladin. &quot;Laugh. You have to pull at the mains to beat a litte old Gnome. n00b&quot; Now, i'm so pissed I can't take it. The only thing holding my back from cussing this little jerk out was that i didn't want my account marked by a GM. Now, to top everything off, my corpse isn't at the docks. It's at the NRo zone line. So, looking for my corpse, I get killed AGAIN and have to find *2* corpses. I'm pissed. I hate Gnomes. I have no respect for any Gnomes other then that GM that helped me out and Ardamyst, my friend. All Gnomes die please kthx. DIE GNOMES!!<br>
