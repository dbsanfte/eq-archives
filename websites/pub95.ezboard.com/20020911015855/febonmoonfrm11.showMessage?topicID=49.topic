On to the topic, after talking with a good deal of you the other night I think we all would really like to hit as a group the Twilight Sea. There is a lot of very nice items there, and we could really deal out tons of damage on this zone it being 20-40. So the next step is when do we want to hit it.<br>
<br>
Here is what I want from you guys. Please post this information:<br>
<br>
1) Who you are and what level.<br>
2) What is better for you during the week, weekend, or doesn't matter.<br>
3) Usually what time do you play (please mention your time zone as well) during the time of week you mentioned in part 2.<br>
<br>
Please answer these questions better then... &quot;oh any time let's just go.&quot; The more concise you can be the better I will be able to schedule this so that everyone can go. I would like to do this next week at some point, and I want everyone that wants to go to post here. If you do not post here do not expect us to make room or wait for you on the day of the raid. And if I do not get enough interest then I will just close the post and wait for this another time. I will mention this tomorrow night at the meeting so hopefully we will at least get 1 full group to go maybe 2 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

3)  In PST.  I'm typically on 7 to 10pm average on weeknights.  Weekends, usually the evenings, sometimes during the day.

The elementals are all green to me.  So, probably no problem for you all.  (They were blue to Myer when he was 35 and not a hard solo for him).  There is also a secret area to the north with higher level prey.  I actually didn't know about this area.  I may check it out tonight.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lucin here, I play 2 hours in the mornings around 10am-noon, then from 3-5pm and at last somewhere between 7-8 pm to 9-10pm all times MST all also depend on what I have to do as well, this is all just averages too, some times I sleep in, etc...sometimes I have a date so I don't even play at night, sometimes I miss one of the 2hour segements and I'm able to pick it up later on or whatever, but for me the biggest thing is if I get a good group, I usually stick around longer, don't want to abandon it until I have to...but if I got a over cautious boring group, with nothing to do and I'm so bored that I can watch tv and let people die, then I probably won't play as long, (Grin) <br>

Friday is meeting night, and Saturday is Velious night. Friday may work as well, but would have to be after meeting. Now for Wed, Black you said you have that night off so you mean you don't play or you can play? And sorry Fae if we go on Wed, would love it if you can find a way to join, but if not then next time. Out of those that posted here which night would you prefer Wed or Friday? If it's Wed, we would start at 10pm EST (I think that's the earliest that all of you can make it from what it looks like). If Friday then we won't be able to go till close to Midnight if meeting runs long again.<br>
<br>
So that the next question, do you want to go Wed at 10pm or Fri as soon as Meeting ends?<br>
<br>
Please post here as soon as you can so we can do this this coming Wed or Fri.<br>
<br>
Also, on a side note, I'm trying to figure out how to get to this zone. It looks like the travel is:<br>
<br>
Nexus -&gt; Shadow Haven -&gt; Paludal Caverns -&gt; Hollowshade Moor -&gt; Grimling Forest -&gt; Tenebrous Mountains -&gt; Katta Castellum -&gt; then finally Twilight Sea<br>
<br>
Wow I'm out of breath just typing that, there has got to be a better way? Is there a port to any of these zones? Maybe the city Katta Castellum? Any of you that have gone, I will need some input on this otherwise we will have to just meet in Katta Castellum on Wed night otherwise we will waste at least an hour just to get to the Sea.<br>

<br>
At any rate, the route you mention is the safest.  You could go Echo Caverns to Fungus grove to Twilight Sea, but it's much more dangerous as if Invis falls in Fungus Grove, you're fungus food.<br>
<br>
I should be availiable this coming week barring RL issues.  Wednesday or Friday sounds good to me.  Personally Friday is best as I don't have to work Saturday.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Phelsuma here, Exsul around here somewhere (probably checking the spice racks).<br>

Wed or Fri is also good for me, and can meet at the city on that day.<br>

We can just take the NK port after the meeting, and we will all be there anyway. I thought about the Fungus grove route as well, but really don't want to risk it even though it would save a bit of time. Besides, I haven't seen much of the moon yet myself, and a nice run through would be cool. So what does everyone think... Friday after the meeting then?<br>

If I would slow you down I will just have to go back to the Sarnack fort in LOIO and kill more of them. <br>

Mountains they will most likely kill you in one hit, fortunitely Vamps don't wander or roam they stick to their camps and the tower there, I highly recommend a sow though before going through grimling forest and Tenebraus mountains at least for me at lvl 30 everything is red to me in those two zones, and they usually hit for around 60-80 <br>
<br>
As for the time friday night after the meeting, I likely won't be able to make it seeing as how I can't usually play after 12 midnight EST, other than that I could make it on wensday except you already decided on friday, or I will likely be on from 7pm EST to midnight EST that friday <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  oh well so the feather falls can't win them all or in my case can win any at all (chuckles) <br>
<br>
Any more questions feel free to ask I've made that run more than 30 times now with only a handful of deaths the first 5 times or so, I've yet to make the Fungus grove route due to the fact that I haven't found a bard to run through with <br>
