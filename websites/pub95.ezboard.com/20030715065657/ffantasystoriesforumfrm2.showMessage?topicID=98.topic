Chapter 8<br>
<br>
&quot;Blood Frenzy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the past several days the people of Felwithe had managed to catch glimpses of Janus as he would come outside for brief moments of time. The guards by now knew better than to bother him, and most people didn't see him as any sort of threat now. If anything since he had managed to save all the prisoners from Crushbone he was now viewed as a hero. After all if anything he did have a kind nature to him even though he did seem slightly withdrawn.<br>
<br>
Throughout this time Iris had came to visit him each day, and though she tried to her best to learn more about him she simply couldn't get a solid answer out of him. Of course her parents weren't much help either in this matter. Neither of them would mention anything about Janus's father, which is something that was eating away at her curiosity.<br>
<br>
If anything she wanted to learn more of just how Janus could fight so well. She wanted to see what people seemed to revere about people who trained in the fighting styles of monks. Today she had a feeling things would be different and that she'd find the answers to her questions.<br>
<br>
Today of all days she had decided to follow Janus as he left the cleric's guild, and made his way toward the city gates. Everyday since he had been able to walk he had left the city to do something. No one just had a clue just what he was doing, but with each trip out the guards would notice the Orcs would retreat to their stronghold. The creatures held a great fear for this young man, one that could drive away the most fierce of them.<br>
<br>
In the forest things where silent, save for the sound of several birds chirping. It was like this most mornings and today seemed to be no different. Morning dew hung to the blades of grass and a fine mist still covered the forest's floor. This was the perfect setting, Janus had been trained since the day he could walk for battle, and his father had always instructed him it was best to train early in the morning. Today like every other day he was going to follow his fathers words, and go through what he would call his normal routine.<br>
<br>
Iris had followed him today though, in hopes of discovering more about this person she had only recently just met. She wanted to see with her own eyes just what he did each morning, and perhaps some of the things that Janus wouldn't tell her about. Many a time she had asked him just what he did each morning and his only reply was the word &quot;practice&quot;, he simply wouldn't say another word other than that.<br>
<br>
It was this day that Janus had decided to test the full limits of his abilities. He was curious about how he had managed to survive the events at Crushbone, as well as having recovered so quickly.  With a quick leap to the side he had begun the routine, by forcing himself up into the air by the use of a nearby tree. Once in the air time seemed to slow down for him, as he went through his beginning kata.<br>
<br>
This sight mystified Iris as she watched on from her vantage point which was off in the distance hidden within the brush. It was clear to her that Janus could move much faster than anyone she had ever seen before. The only thing that could come close to this speed was the quickness of her father as he set about using his bow.<br>
<br>
All this was done without thought, without having to concentrate. The many years of training had made this more like an instinct rather than anything else to Janus. Once he landed upon the ground he knew that he was ready to continue. If anything he had gotten much faster, which made him thing that perhaps now he could move at close to the same speed as his father.<br>
<br>
It was now time he tried some of the more advanced technique's he had seen his father use. This was something he knew full well that he might not be able to try, since it required a great deal upon bringing out his latent talents as his father would refer to them. Still this didn't mean he couldn't try, if he could do this on his own then he knew his father would teach him more.<br>
<br>
The shadows of the surrounding area appeared to almost retreat for a moment as Janus set into what Iris thought was a strange pose. It was then that all sounds of life stopped in the forest as if everything had now focused its attention of something. The only exception to this where the brownie's who only came here to torment the younger adventurers.<br>
<br>
Before Iris's eyes she seen something that would have stumped even the greatest wizards of Felwithe. The reasoning behind this was that Janus's body would occasionally flicker with a dim crimson aura around it. She could tell the look upon his face was of nothing but pure concentration on something.<br>
<br>
If anything he was dishearten now, he had failed once again to do what his father could. He simply couldn't understand what it was he was doing wrong. A quick look at the sky told him he had spent a great deal of time today, even the mist was gone. Soon he knew that Iris would be on her to the guild house to ask him questions.<br>
<br>
Janus could understand why she was so curious, but he had taken an oath with his father to keep certain matters a secret. There was some reason that his father didn't want people to find out what they could truly do. One thing his father told him was that people would try to destroy what they don't understand, for fear of it.<br>
<br>
This all ran through his mind as he leapt into the tree's and began moving from one to another back towards Felwithe. After all this was the fastest way to get back there, though he was sure the locals would probably be scared witless if they seen him doing this. Though he knew they would be far more accepting of this kind behavior than the people of Freeport would. <br>
<br>
Instead of instantly going to hound Janus with questions Iris decided to instead go back to the place where a band of adventures where suppose to have saved the entire Faydwer continent. The legend was that a great evil appeared and that a single man containing the souls of two sacrificed himself here to delay the evil from spreading. One thing the lore included was the fact that several others fought along side this person until they where forcibly taken away at the wishes of the man who held two souls.<br>
<br>
The area that the battle was said to have taken place still bore great scars in the earth, the kinds that gave druids like Iris chills when they seen them. The trees in the surrounding area had only just begun to recover from the events from the distant past. It was obvious that indeed something had happened here, and that at least some of the legend was true. Iris could still feel the ebbing of an evil presence as well as two others that seemed to be almost intertwined.<br>
<br>
Little had Iris known that she had been followed by someone who seemed to be shrouded in the very shadows themselves. In fact she hadn't even noticed this person step out into the light. It was only when this person finally spoke that she realized that anyone was there at all. <br>
<br>
&quot;So your curiosity has brought you here has it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I just wanted to know more about what happened here, especially since my parents and Janus's where somehow involved here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose that's only natural to want to know those things, but then again it all depends on how much you truly want to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd like to know just who Janus's father is, and why my parents don't want to talk about him. Also I'd like to know what happened here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, very good questions. Janus's father is a man known as Ryo Kataoka. He's not what you could call a very social person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly what does that mean Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He tends to come off as being somewhat hostile, or cruel. In other words he's not very nice to people in general.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That would explain a little about why my parents won't talk about him, but what about what happened here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well a person known as Xernoss sought to control the world, at the time Ryo was sharing a body with a man known as Shoken. The difference between the two is like night and day, hence the legend about a person containing two souls. From what I seen of the battle it was long and fierce, in the end the two destroyed themselves to protect their friends, which included your parents.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If they killed themselves, then how is it that Ryo can still be alive?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would suspect some divine intervention happened, but even such is a mystery to someone like myself. I try to remain as a watcher, interfering as little as possible in events that take place here.&quot;<br>
<br>
For a moment Iris turned to look at the surroundings contemplating just what had occurred here so long ago. When she turned back the strange had disappeared just as easily as he had came. With what she now knew, more questions began to present themselves. These included wanting to know more about Ryo, and this other person called Shoken.<br>
<br>
As the fates would have it, or by some twisted coincidence three figures had been watching this whole ordeal. In truth they had been spying on Iris ever since they found out she was some how connected with Janus. This knowledge was going to make things much easier on them since luring him out by using her as bait was the perfect way to catch him alone.<br>
<br>
Since the incident at Crushbone they had been taking their time to study this person who had killed their brethren. They had all agreed that his death was going to be slow and painful, by the likes of which no person living or deceased had ever experienced. This was going to be something they all knew they would become famous for in later years.<br>
<br>
Not only was all of this going to earn them great respect in the circles they traveled, but after hearing of this young mans lineage they knew they could be greatly rewarded. The bounty that had been put on this young man's father also extended to all of his family. This alone gave them more incentive to go through with their revenge.<br>
<br>
Everything happened so quickly that even the most trained of eyes would have had a hard time telling what went on. The three Teir'Dal felt on her much like buzzards on a carcass, showing no compassion. This was a simple pleasure they would enjoy, having bound and gagged her just as they had done to so many before. <br>
<br>
Excruciating pain was all that Iris felt as her captors pulled her by the hair through the forest towards Felwithe. They showed no remorse for causing her such pain, in fact they enjoyed it. If anything this was making their day much more enjoyable. Not only would they be rewarded handsomely upon returning home, but they where going to have their share of fun tormenting Iris along the way.<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks like taking this assignment here on Faydwer wasn't such a bad choice after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course it wasn't, we're already going to earn enough to buy our own block in Neriak, as well as having a bit of fun in the process.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather much have my fun with that bastard who killed our brethren in Crushbone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take it you want be the first one to torture our prey who's hiding in Felwithe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, you can have all the fun you want with the girl in the meantime, just as long as I get to pulverize her boyfriend.&quot;<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before the trio neared the guards posted just outside the cities gates. This was the kind of situation that no one would ever have been prepared for. The guards had no choice but to hold their positions as several more people came out to see the spectacle before them. Everything for them was going to plan thus far, and they where certain it wouldn't take long for them to get who they where after.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the girl go you Teir'Dal scum.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring us the man who freed our slaves from Crushbone and we might consider it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll let the girl go now or die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I beg to differ, if you so much as move we'll torture her here and now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guards had little choice in this matter, none wanted to see such a young beauty mangled before their eyes. Certainly if they did do something wrong and her parents where to find out then they could most likely expect severe punishment the likes of which no one has ever experienced before. There only option was to stand at this stalemate, and hope that somehow things could be worked out.<br>
<br>
This was the kind of message that no one felt like delivering to Janus. No one had any idea of how her parents would react at hearing this either. When it came to informing loved ones about some drastic situation the words never came easy. It was by luck at both Iris's parents and Janus where having a conversation in his room, which was put to a halt with the words they where about to hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry to inform the three of you that Iris is being held captive outside the gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our little girl is what?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who has her?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus left without hesitation, or for that matter stopping to ask just who had capture Iris. This was something that none of them would have expected. Daxster was surprised since it did indeed seem that this young man hadn't inherited his fathers cold nature. Though it was obvious to Selena just what was going on, she had a good idea of just what Janus could be feeling.<br>
<br>
Everyone who was in the way soon found themselves shoved out of the way as Janus ran towards the gates. He wasn't going to let anyone harm Iris, and he certainly wasn't going to stand by and do nothing. If anything he owed her his life after hearing what she had done in the square, and deep inside he knew it would take the rest of his life to pay that debt back.<br>
<br>
The guards at the gates tried to stop him with all their might, only they found themselves overpowered and shoved to the side as Janus made his way through the crowd. The sight he seen before him revolted him, to see Iris bound and gagged in such a manner. It was giving him the same feeling he felt at Crushbone, which he was now fighting to repress for fear of what it might unleash.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let her go!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We might, once we're finished with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your not going to finish anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Janus went to move forward, only to see the glint of a daggers blade as it was pressed against Iris's throat. He now had no option other than to go along with what they wanted, or else he knew they would slit her throat without a second thought. In all his years of living in Freeport he had learned just how heartless the Teir'Dal could be. This meant he couldn't take anything they said lightly, especially when it came to Iris's life.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just what do you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We want your death. We want you to die an excruciating death like our brethren in Crushbone did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll let you do what you want, as long as she's let go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She'll only be released when your dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence and then once again Janus did something that people would forever remember. He stepped out from the guards with a solemn look upon his face, ready to face death. This went far beyond what anyone had seen anyone do for another, so much so that even the guards knew from that day forward Janus would become a legend that they could tell their children about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do your worst...&quot;<br>
<br>
In a flash two of the Teir'Dal leapt into action, their swords ready to cleave into Janus's flesh. The two dark elves went to work just as they had been trained as blood began to sling from their blades as they repeatedly lashed out with their swords. They intended this to be long and painful as they purposely aimed their swords for just Janus's skin alone.<br>
<br>
This was viewed with horror by the crowd that had gathered at the gates. They knew there was nothing they could do, not in a situation like this. All there hopes lay in that somehow something would happen to stop this atrocity that was happening before their eyes. None of the could of expected what was going to happen though.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's time we finished him, and got on about our business.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two Teir'Dal that where attacking Janus stopped and held their hands out towards him. The onlookers knew this was the end as they seen a thick blackened fog encircle the young mans body, hiding it completely from view. Evil permeated through the air from the fog, they where now sure this was the last time they would see Janus alive.<br>
<br>
All this was passing by slowly for Janus, he withstood the intense pain in hopes that he could think of a way to free Iris. At last the fog surrounded him and enclosed his world in darkness. Though unexplained, he could feel his strength as well as his very life force beginning to drain away. It was then that he began to lose hope, though some voice kept telling him to stay the course, to fight back.<br>
<br>
- I can't believe your thinking of giving up. If only you would stop holding back. -<br>
<br>
- If I fight back and lose control everyone here could be harmed. -<br>
<br>
- How many times have you seen your own father fight? -<br>
<br>
- I've seen him fight to many times to count. -<br>
<br>
- If he didn't lose control, then you won't lose control either. Your his son aren't you?! -<br>
<br>
- I'm not the same person as my father! -<br>
<br>
- For as cold and cruel your father is to outsiders, he's always lent his hand in protecting the innocent. Though he won't admit it with words, he does so with actions. -<br>
<br>
- I can't fight like my father though. -<br>
<br>
- You can't fight like him because your always holding back! -<br>
<br>
- I can't fight, if I do Iris will be killed! -<br>
<br>
- And if you don't fight back Iris will be killed anyway, after she's beaten and abused just as the two others you killed before would have done to her. -<br>
<br>
For a moment the fog thinned before Janus's eyes and he could see the dagger being pressed into Iris's neck. He could see ever scratch and bruise that was on her body from being treated so roughly. Once again his eyes focused on the dagger, and the tip of the blade where he could clearly see blood being drawn.<br>
<br>
Something inside of Janus yearned to be set free at this sight. It was a feeling similar to the one he had felt inside Crushbone, but this was far more intense. He was beginning to instinctively fight against the pain being inflicted on his body. It was then that he decided what he was going to do.<br>
<br>
- Will you fight now? -<br>
<br>
- I can't let this go on. I'm going to stop this right here and now! -<br>
<br>
The earth itself began to shudder as if some great force where being summoned forth. Everyone who stood before the black fog that surrounded Janus began to back away, they could some how feel something beginning to gather strength, but they where uncertain of what it was. Only two could have expected what they where all about to witness.<br>
<br>
Both of Iris's parents had an idea of what was about to happen, they had seen it before from Janus's father. They now knew for certain that their daughter would soon be freed. In their hearts they could feel the power that Janus was about to unleash. Now everyone would see just how come Mayong Mistmoore had defeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let her go now!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The ground beneath the fog shattered as a bright crimson glow began to break through in various spots. Then everyone heard the enraged scream of a man pushed far beyond his limits, of one who even the masters of hell themselves would think twice about angering. There was a flash of red light and then the fog was gone, leaving only Janus standing.<br>
<br>
It was clear that something had happened to Janus while inside the fog. Everyone could clearly see that the whites of his eyes had taken on a crimson glow. Most notable was his hair, then ends of his hairs had taken on a deep bloody red ton to them. If anything he looked somewhat like what most people would have called a demon.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said let her go now...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill him!&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark elf would never utter another order in its life, Janus was certain on that. He had slipped by the other two Teir'Dal and had locked his hands into the sides of Iris's captor. There was a splash of blood followed by bone fragments and gray brain matter as the dark elf's head practically exploded between Janus's hands.<br>
<br>
The two remaining Teir'Dal where in shock at the sight before them. Their once living comrade was now nothing but a head corpse which was twitching on the ground. Blood began to stain the ground beneath Janus's feet, turning the once lush green foliage a dark gruesome red. There was a cold, steely gaze from his eyes as he once again turned to his would be tormentors.<br>
<br>
It was then the two made a  mistake they would never get a chance to correct. They both rushed at Janus with their swords ready to cut down this man who had now managed to murder three of their own kind. Now they where about to experience something that would be reserved for only the most cruel of people.<br>
<br>
In a single deft move Janus tore the swords from his foes grasp and then went about putting them to a grizzly use. What the crowd seen before them was both shocking and yet they felt this was justice being done as the Teir'Dal before them where systematically separated from every other part of themselves.<br>
<br>
Now what stood before them was a scene that would have even made the executioners cringe with terror. Blood and bone fragments along with various body parts where strewn across the ground, and Janus stood before them. He was scanning the area for yet another who would attack him.<br>
<br>
Janus's eyes turned down to Iris, who had long since passed out from witnessing all the gore. This was all that he wanted now, for her to be safe, and in turn this sated his anger.
