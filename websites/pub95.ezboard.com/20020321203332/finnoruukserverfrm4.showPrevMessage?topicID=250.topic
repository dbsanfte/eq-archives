<br>
Two were family oriented, one seemed to be more raid oriented somewhat (all small/medium size guilds 20-40 people on-line prime times).<br>
<br>
Never saw an officer voted in in any of them, always appointed.<br>
<br>
Unique titles and duties in only one of the three.<br>
<br>
Decisions were made generally by the leaders.  Some topics were posted for comment on Guild Boards, but the decision rested in the leadership.  One of the things Dragonguard does is to have Class Loot Leaders who determined policies for Planes drops, etc., who was not necessarily an officer.  Raids can also be set up and run by any member.  While Guild policy would generally be enforced, raid leaders were the ultimate authority for their event and had the final say on any loot.<br>
<br>
Guild message boards were widely used in all three and were an excellent way of keeping in touch with people with varied play times all over Norrath.<br>

<br>
I can't speak to how officers are chosen since, well, it's not very often and I've not been around to see it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
None of the officers have unique duties that I am aware of, Kelandria is the nominal guild leader but exerts no more influence (that I've felt) outside of the other officers that I have seen.  None has a title of any kind and in fact there is never really any talk of &quot;the officers&quot; on the mailing list or in /gu.<br>
<br>
I would consider Amici a fairly small guild, actually, or mid-sized, but certainly not a large one by any stretch of the imagination.  Yet dispite this, we're able to regularly kill mobs like Gorenaire, Trakanon, Severilius (when the bastage is up) and just accomplished our first Derakor the Vindicator kill.  We also regularly clear Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan with as little as 18 (normally have more than this) people (and have raided there successfully with as few as 11).<br>
<br>
This is a tough one, really.  As a whole, the goals of everyone in Amici are so amazingly in line that the guild has a whole seems to move in the same direction regardless of the actions of the officers.  In my opinion (and my guildmates may or may not agree with me), the &quot;guild leadership&quot; are not so much the officers, but rather those members with the initiative to plan and organize events.  The officers facilitate that by making those decsions that are politically sensitive and that none of the rest of us want to deal with anyway.  The members as a whole vote on the admission of new members to the ranks.<br>
<br>
Amici does not have a guild message board such as EZBoard, but relies on a private mailing list to communicate with the other members while not in game.  This is a big switch from the last guild I was in where EZboard was used.  The mailing list is quite popular and an enjoyable forum in which to communicate when not otherwise able to do so (read: when not actually able to be in game).<br>
<br>
I'd like to emphasize that the above are my feelings and observations based on having been associated with Amici in some form for the last couple of months and a member for the last month or so.  The &quot;guild leadership&quot; may choose to disagree with these observations (but I don't think they will). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

No unique titles, but definitely different duties. <br>

Small - Medium<br>

Officers make the bulk of decisions deferring to the guild to get opinions on some items. <br>

Family Guild.  NK started out 5 years ago as a bunch of family members and couples, and has slowly included RL and in-game friends over the last few years.<br>

Everybody has always had a fair say, so we do the voting system.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Do all of your officers have unique titles and duties?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Officers are responsible for different areas, and we don't usually appoint formal titles... however, the three main officers are informally known as:<br>
<br>
Nomerc(y) - Big Daddy Guild Founder/Leader<br>
Jeisenne - Guild Mistress...rawr!<br>
Bashedo/Raptor - King of Floppyland<br>

Yes, our titles are all inside jokes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  How many active members do you have approximately? (or just say big/small guild).</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
SMALL guild.  We've retained the majority of our members throughout all the games we have formally entered as a guild over our last 5 years.  We currently have around 15 active members, majority of which are level 50+.  We would like to start looking into recruiting, but because of our history of being family/friend oriented, we are taking our sweet time about it.  Bjornn/Dollaine is a perfect example to us of why we don't like to open recruit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Do your officers make all guild decisions amongst themselves or do you put everything up to a guild vote?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We put everything to a guild vote, however on the rare occasions that there is indecision, the 3 senior officers will decide.  Majority of us have the same vision and goal in mind when it comes to guild matters, and that's why we've been able to stay together as long as we have no matter what game we move to.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  How important is your guild message board?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We recently moved to a guild message board, and so far it's not so bad.  We used to maintain an internal mailing list, but then I would get (on a daily basis) 50 emails from NKs in one game, 40 from NKs in another game, etc.  Sometimes the responses were &quot;Sure that sounds good to me&quot; in relation to a question that was asked about 30 emails ago and it got really out of hand.  Trying to maintain an email list for about 30 people between 2 or 3 games (some of us were playing all 3 games we marked our guild presence in) got so tiresome that we finally went to a message board system.<br>

<br>
1.) Family oriented guild. Dark Retribution has always been a fairly small, close nit guild. <br>
2.) Officers are appointed by the guild leader or by majority vote from the officer corps.<br>
3.) Not currently, I think it's better that everyone learn the ropes of all the duties and share the work so that no one ever feels like things are always dumped on them.<br>
4.) Small guild, but growing again. Maybe some day we will consider ourselves medium. We never want to get so big that we lose that familiarity between members.<br>
5.) In general -  minor policy, direction and maintenance decisions are handled by a vote among the officers, major guild changes are brought to the membership for voting.<br>
6.) Pretty damn important. It's usually once you see a member making his or her home on the boards that we know they're in it for the long haul. Just wish I could get more of them to check it more often <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><P><EMBED src="http://darkretribution.homestead.com/files/arkus3.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000 WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=120 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED>

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> o all of your officers have unique titles and duties?<br>
<br>
Some do.  We have an officer of recruitment and some other thing.  And no, we don't have titles but our current guildleader, is called  &quot;Maztor&quot; (tm) by the rank and file. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;How many active members do you have approximately? (or just say big/small guild).<br>
<br>
We are a small guild with about, I say, around 25 or so (we have may have more, but I don't really know) level 60 main characters and assorted alternates.  I'm still amazed that we as a guild can kill with such small of a force.  (I know, it's tactics!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> o your officers make all guild decisions amongst themselves or do you put everything up to a guild vote?<br>
<br>
Being invited into Legends is a decided by all members with a long probation period.  Loot and what not are decided by the officers.<br>
<br>
&gt;How important is your guild message board?<br>
<br>
Very important.<br>
<br>
Other Legends can feel free to post additions and corrections. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulunadar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunadar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/5/02 9:16:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild structure ???</span><hr size=1> These are great answers so far, THANKS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The &quot;guild across multiple games&quot; is something I was hoping for, but it's very difficult.<br>
<br>
The mailing list is interesting but my e-mail skills are pretty weak (or so I'm told by companies and vendors that try to get ahold of me via e-mail <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugallaindryleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallain Dryleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/5/02 9:46:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Guild Structure of the Ridgerunners</span><hr size=1> Do you consider your guild a &quot;Family Guild&quot;, a Raid Guild, a what? &gt;&gt; Family.  Pretty simple, we are in Norrath for FUB (ask an RR to explain it to you).<br>
<br>
How did/does your guild choose it's officers?(vote, appoint, volunteer...) &gt;&gt; The Ridgerunners vote as a whole for the Guildleader, and nominate the officers that the remaining officers approve.<br>
<br>
Do all of your officers have unique titles and duties?<br>
&gt;&gt; Not officially, but several of the officers have staked out duties (raidleader, asst. raidleader, loot coord., raid coord.), mostly to streamline guild-sponsered events.  Some titles have been 'assigned' based on events and attributes of particular characters ('Graceless-on-Ice, 'War-n-Peace').<br>
<br>
How many active members do you have approximately? (or just say big/small guild). &gt;&gt; Small to medium sized family - the Ridgerunners recently adopted members from Patronas Veritas and Flying Platinum Dragons when DAoC was sucking their members away from Everquest.  Just started to get the 'list cut short-too many' from doing /who Ridgerunners *smiles*.<br>
<br>
Do your officers make all guild decisions amongst themselves or do you put everything up to a guild vote? &gt;&gt; Most decisions are handled by the officers - matter of practicality;  the officers are the members that are most often online, so decisions can be made without waiting for a weekend (when all the short-time players get online).  Major decisions are moved out of the 'Council' to be voted upon by the whole guild.<br>
<br>
How important is your guild message board? &gt;&gt; Very important.  The message board can be a place for officers can leave messages about issues that pop up without waiting for the rest to get online.  It also holds the calendar for planning guild events.  Sometimes, the message board is also a powderkeg, because typing skills/styles plus non-verbal communcations can lead to misunderstandings that bruise feelings.<br>

<br>
Raid guild definately, we do raids with Eclipsing Sojourn and Neverwinter Dragonlords a LOT.<br>
<br>
Fatty basically appoints officers just for the sake of having people to invite whoever to guild because he's the last say on any new recruits<br>
<br>
Heh, not really.<br>
<br>
Somewhere between big and small, we average about 15 - 20 people on during peek hours.<br>
<br>
Pretty much its wherever A: Fatty wants to go or B: The guild wants to go.<br>
<br>
Not very important, it would be more important if more people went to it, too bad Ghaleon/Bajyra made the page exclusively for people with l33t cable / dsl connections and no one wants to spend 3 hours loading the page just so they can click on the boards link. <p><img src="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/affliction/rickets.gif" title="I am Rickets.
