<br>
History on the world: 500 years ago the entire world was involved in a world war. The Dwarves and Elves sought to keep their forest and mountain homes while the Humans and Gnomes sought steel , wood , gold and everything else need to create empires. After a hundred years of war , after great battles and deeds were done , the races were so exhausted that they hardly fought. Then the evil races returned , they were thought to have been killed in the first coalition when the four races allied themselves and eradicated them a milenia before. Now the races reunited to vanquish the Trolls , Orcs , Ogres , goblins , Drow , and whatever demons or dragons they brought with them from the abyss. four hundred years later the war is still being fought and so is an artifact that could win it. The Evil races leader is a demi demon. The Light races bicker continuously and must govern themselves with a counsel.<br>
<br>
Story<br>
<br>
&quot; Lord Balyn your grace the counsel members have all sent word that they cannot attend the meeting , everyones homelands are being waylaid twofold my lord. They have however sent their sons and daughters to hear what you have to say.&quot;  said a servant in a red and white tunic displaying Duke Balyns  lion and crown personal symbol.<br>
<br>
&quot; Thank you Okus , bring the brandy back here to the counsel room and then be gone. Lose lips sink ships , as father used to say. &quot; ordered Duke Balyn while he stood by the podium. It was the Dukes turn to be the speachmaster. The speachmaster kept order during the meetings although things always got out of hand. The duke was a tall man , with dark black hair the ended at his shoulders with a flare of curls at the ends. When he was angry his bright green eyes could pierce steel it seemed , he could definetly quiet the counsel with his eyes.<br>
<br>
Okus the servant came in with hardly a noise and set down two small casks of Brandy and poured them into the glasses for all the nobles. When he was done he left with hardly a noise as well.<br>
<br>
The counsel room was well actually a old but beautiful courtyard. The podium was raised to the height of two and a half men high in the center of a clearing surrounded all sorts of different seats. The elves sat on a tree that grew horizontally for two lengths of a man , the dwarves sat upon smooth boulders that sparkled with silver and gold dust , the humans who were mostly greedy sat upon lavishly decorated chairs decorated with gold silks , the gnomes who somewhat shared human ambitions but they sat in chairs that could rise lower and swivel.<br>
<br>
Duke Balyn grabbed his glass cup of brandy , the glass was made by the gnomes who learned how to produce large quantities. The Brandy was made by the dwarves who aged the brandy to a honey sweet perfection before they shipped the brandy away. The Duke swallowed his whole drink and poured himself another before he took the podium. The courtyard had four entrances , one for every race and the halls to the courtyard were very long , Duke Balyn knew every heelstrike that came and could place the sound to their race.<br>
<br>
The dwarves were coming from the west hall , he could tell because of the clang that their boots of steel made , but only two sets of footbeats came instead of four. That was a bad thing. from the south hall came nothing which meant the elves were coming. From the west came the little pitter-patter of gnomish boots. From the north came the sound of riding boots with spurs , other humans.<br>
<br>
It took a while for the races to settle down , it appeared many of these &quot;younger sons and daughters&quot; were friends or at least well aquainted. <br>
<br>
&quot; Take your seats &quot; Duke Balyn said in a commanding tone that echoed in the courtyard. <br>
&quot; The Counsel is now in session , Isithranil of the Authofe Elves , My king and his kingdom thanks you for the aid of your bowmen which kept the river city of Papua free. Next I have heard of all the redoubled attacks on our lands , but especially to the north and west. The Human lands have not shrunk thanks to the aid of the Authofe elves but why are there only two dwarven representatives instead of four. Would Lords Koisur and Dorin please take the demi-stands.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two stout dwarves left from their seats and walked to the podiums , Lord Koisur was actually a Earl and ruled a third of a dwarven kingdom , Lord Dorin was a Kern ( = a count ) and ruled the Blue Metal Mountains which produced the largest quantities of mithril arms and armor.<br>
<br>
The two dwarves took the stands. Lord Koisur spoke first &quot; As you all know my Uncle King Durin Holds the Clouded Mountain range , what we all did not know is the magnitude of the enemy strength in that area , for months now King Durin held the Mountain valiantly with little lose of his own mens lives and he cause great casualties to the enemy , but when I visited the Clouded mountains with nearly a thousand of my vassals we saw that we arrived two days after a mighty battle , King Durins army was nearly one hundred thousand strong , well every that one of those hundred thousand were dead , along with many times that number of orcs , goblins , trolls , ogres , and nearly two dozen giants.&quot; <br>
<br>
The counsel began to murmur , giants were thought to have been totally eradicated . If they are back then the coalition is in dire trouble. <br>
<br>
&quot; I wanted to fight but many of my more loyal vassals knocked the sense back into me ( dwarves are not afraid to hit superiors ). Before we could leave nearly three thousand orcish pony riders I believe the count was waylaid us , the result was a 1 one month running battle covering nearly eight hundred miles. the orcs had many reinforcements but we had none , I returned with seventy-two men.&quot; Stated Earl Koisur without exageration or exhuberance. Lord Koisur then nodded to Kern Dorin.<br>
<br>
&quot; It appears that there was treachery afoot , we think someone opened the gates because King Durins land was a giant impregnable citadel of booby traps and death. The second reason that there are only two dwarves here is because King Krazic had sent ten thousand dwarves to help , he led them and when they got to the Clouded mountains old dwarves , women , and children were running from the accursed hellspawn.  King Krazic waylaid them and he pushed the enemy back into the once glorious halls of the Clouded Mountains and there he and his men died to the man. However nearly half a million craftsmen , women and children survived , sad remenants of a glorious kingdom but some still fled to King Krazics realm where his young son Krazac rules now. the rest have come to King Ungars realm , King Ungar has the largest Kingdom of Dwarfkind and he must recall his troops from all your kingdoms he has fifty thousand professional men to defend an area nearly twice the size of the Clouded mountains so he needs everything he can get. We think that the enemy seeks dwarvish steel to outfit their armies , as you know the enemies armies are so large that only their best units are equipped , if even half or a quarter of their armies were armored and we lost all the dwarf kingdoms then sadly the fight would be up to all of you and your situation would be very bleak. Aid us as we have aided you&quot; Kern Dorin bellowed in a firm tone until the end when emotion touched his grizzled face.<br>
<br>
Duke Balyn gulped at his brandy as did everyone else. After clearing his throat Duke Balyn spoke &quot; Will anyone aid the dwarves??? rise and speak your pledge&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Grandmaster Inventors Aethodoc and Dyra &quot; Squeaked a smart looking little gnome who fiddled with his tunic as he spoke . &quot; We pledge each pledge one hundred faster firing catapults and three hundred porcupines to guard your gates , we also each pledge ten thousand gnomes to use them. The gnomes have not been hit hard and shall fare well in our border fights.&quot; Shouted Grandmaster Aethodoc.<br>
<br>
The gnomes sat and a Half elf sitting with the Humans stood. &quot; I am the master of the stables and Commander of ten thousand for King Joshua , unless we are pushed from our hills and forests we will have no need of ten thousand heavy cavalry which might be better used pursuing fleeing enemy. &quot; <br>
<br>
Next a voluptious and beautiful red haired woman stood and then floated. &quot; I am Gwelanna and I will meet with the magocracy of Delfi and ask for one thousand spellcaster to aid you master dwarves. &quot;<br>
<br>
The Dwarves grinned , spell casters were very hard to find independantly  but now they might have a thousand. <br>
<br>
&quot; I Isithranil am eight hundred and thirty years old , I haven't fought in nearly twenty years because I rule the only elf kingdom not being attacked , I pledge thrity-five thousand bowmen and skirmishers to your cause.&quot; with that the wizened elf sat and grinned at the thought of getting some action.<br>
<br>
&quot; Before we go any further , I Duke Balyn am winning great victories on the plains with my cavalry my bowmen and my heavy infantry , however I do have twenty thousand very bored pikemen that I pledge to you.&quot; Bellowed the duke from well over a story in the air.<br>
<br>
Next Sir Garalad , Isith-Gawiel , Belil-Galinde, Sadriendir all pldeged a sum of fightting men and elves that equaled around  ninety thousand men , add that to the previous pledges and eighty-six thousand men and you have one hundred and seventy-six thousand men headed to dwarven lands.<br>
<br>
this is pretty much a prologue , hope it sounds good guys. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=171.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=171.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.threadControl?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1>General Fantasy Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
