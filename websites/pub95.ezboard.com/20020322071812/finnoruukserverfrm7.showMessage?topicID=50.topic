He felt both pleased and anxious. At last he would be wed to the lovely Lady Vexxa.<br><br>He walked over to the designated altar space. As he drew closer, his consternation grew. He looked about him, bewildered. No one was there! Through the particular magic of guild membership, he called out to his friends.<br><br>&quot;Where is everyone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We are at the wedding site, the old Wizard platform in West Karana,&quot; replied Starlene Antares. &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh! Oh, damn. Didn't Temene tell you? My bride, the beautiful Lady Vexxa, asked that we move it to Butcherblock. I am at the site now, on the beach just south of the port.&quot;<br><br>Starlene seemed taken aback. &quot;Oh? Are you sure this is the right thing to do? It seems that this Lady Vexxa has made several demands.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yes, Starlene,&quot; Andrayas replied. &quot;I will do anything for her. Please, if it is not too inconvenient, could you teleport the wedding party here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Andrayas, as you wish. We will be there shortly.&quot;<br><br>Andrayas ignored the discussion among his guildmates that followed. He was pleased that Starlene is so kind, and willing to help with this wedding. I really need to get her a gift, he thought to himself.<br><br>Quite suddenly Andrayas was filled with the familiar bliss that had been a part of his life since meeting Vexxa. &quot;How are you my darling?&quot; Vexxa's voice floated in his mind. &quot;Are your friends coming?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my love, they are coming. As you told me, I shall wait until all are assembled and then signal you to come forward and present your dazzling beauty to them.&quot; Andrayas' eyes rolled into his head as he sank into the waves of pleasure provided by Vexxa's magic.<br><br>In time, the wedding party arrived and met with Andrayas. They found him standing with his back to the Ocean of Tears. He had quickly composed himself upon their approach.<br><br>&quot;Please, can everyone array themselves in front of me, facing the ocean? Starlene, please stand to my left, facing the group,&quot; Andrayas said as he took charge of the group. &quot;A wedding march, if you please.&quot; Keats began to play.<br><br>Vexxa strolled calmly forward from behind the guests. Andrayas said, &quot;Here she comes!!!&quot;<br><br>Smiles were exchanged all around as all saw that Andrayas did not exaggerate the Lady Vexxa's beauty. Vexxa curtsied before the crowd then bowed before Starlene.<br><br>Starlene gasped at Vexxa in astonishment and said, &quot;G-Greetings Vexxa.&quot;<br><br>Vexxa looked deep into Andrayas's eyes. Andrayas looked deep into Vexxa's eyes and was lost in her lovely stare.<br><br>&quot;Hello, Starlene.  I have heard so much about you,&quot; Vexxa said.<br><br>Starlene replied, &quot;Well... I wish I could say the same. Besides Andrayas raving about your beauty, of course.&quot;<br><br>Vexxa blushed at Andrayas. A long pause ensued as all marveled at the happy couple.<br><br>Anxious to begin, Andrayas said, &quot;Whenever you are ready, Starlene.&quot;<br><br>Startled out of her revery, Starlene said, &quot;Ah ok let's begin then. Starlene took a deep breath. My Sigil family and friends, we are gathered here today to join Andrayas, Sigil of the Seed, with Lady Vexxa in marriage.&quot;<br><br>Vexxa looked around, as if someone she expected was not in the crowd.<br><br>&quot;Marriage is a sacred union and not one to be taken lightly,&quot; Starlene continued. Vexxa nodded at her. &quot;There will be difficult roads for both of you to cross, but if the two of you never forget the bond you share on this day nothing will prevent you two from finding happiness.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Many thousands of years ago my people the elves left Antonica and landed on these shores... the remains of a fallen Empire they sought to rebuild what they had lost. They thought of Faydwer as a place for new beginnings. And now thousands of years later as we stand upon these same shores... we will witness another new beginning. The beginning of a new life for Andrayas and Vexxa.&quot;<br><br>Starlene then turned to Andrayas and said, &quot;Andrayas, do you have anything special you would like to say to Lady Vexxa?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Andrayas replied. &quot;Before I met the Lady Vexxa, my life was a chaos. A chaos of voices, images, memories. Since we have been together, my mind has been at peace. This is a peace I never thought possible. I love her. I love her for having brought me this freedom and peace.&quot; Starlene smiled. &quot;I look forward to spending the rest of my life with her.&quot; Andrayas beamed a smile at Vexxa.<br><br>Starlene turned to Lady Vexxa and said,  &quot;Lady Vexxa do you have anything you wish to say to Andrayas Sigil of the Seed?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I certainly do,&quot;  Vexxa replied. &quot;When I first met Andrayas I knew that he was the one. His thoughts so disordered... his mind so malleable.&quot;<br><br>Starlene raised an eyebrow at Vexxa. Caeandil did not like the sound of this either.<br><br>&quot;I have given you clarity of mind, and a fresh view of the world. And I ask only one thing in return. The power you hold to become the essence of purity! The essence of pure evil!&quot;<br><br>Vexxa moaned as her skin peeled away. In moments she was revealed as a Tier'Dal! Gasps of astonishment rose up from the guests.<br><br>Andrayas stared blankly at Vexxa and said, &quot;What do you mean, my love? My love?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now, Andrayas, the ring!&quot; demanded Vexxa.<br><br>&quot;I, um, I have this for you.&quot; After searching his robe, Andrayas handed a wedding ring to Vexxa.<br><br>Vexxa said, &quot;Bah, not THAT ring!  The Signet ring!&quot;<br><br>“Signet ring??”  asked Andrayas. “What Signet ring?? Andrayas looked dumb-founded and completely lost. He was obviously as surprised as the rest of the wedding party at Vexxa's revelation.”<br><br>Vexxa screamed in frustration, “Never mind!  I will pluck the secrets from your mind!” She casted a spell, enthralling Andrayas. Unable to face this betrayal, Andrayas' hid within the dark recesses of his.<br><br>Just as the others in the wedding party began to react, to intervene on Andrayas behalf, Vexxa said, “Away to our... honeymoon, where I will tear the secrets from you!”<br><br>The last words anyone heard from Andrayas was a whispered,  “Yes, Mother Vexxa,” as the two of them teleported away.<br><br><br>Chapter 2: The Search<br><br>A pallid silence fell over the wedding party. Each was struck with horror over Vexxa's revelation and the kidnapping of Andrayas. The silence was short-lived as a strong, malevolent voice rang out, &quot;I am the Defender.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Behind you!&quot; Starlene cried out. &quot;Who are you? What is going on here?&quot;<br><br>The wedding guests stood and turned to see a Tier'Dal wearing warrior garb. He said, &quot;Your Andrayas is with us. Andrayas not for you Children of Order.&quot;<br><br>Caeandil stepped forward to confront the warrior. &quot;What have you done with Andrayas, Yanafel, Defender of Mother?&quot; asked Caeandil. &quot;I know who you are, I wish to know what you plan to do. Your foul deeds are well known to the Four Walkers.&quot; Caeandil threw off his robe, preparing for battle.<br><br>Yanafel smiled wanly. &quot;I am not here to fight, just to let you know that doom is awaiting.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, the Sigils and other wedding guests prepared themselves to battle this demon-spawn. Their anger transformed into resolve as Caeandil continued to confront Yanafel.<br><br>&quot;You plan is obvious. This is but a part of a greater whole. Something within Andrayas, or something he knows of, is what you seek. What do you seek?&quot; asked Caeandil.<br><br>&quot;Innoruuk is the Master of all,&quot; replied Yanafel. &quot;You will see more of us. You must await Mother's pleasure. Forsake Order, embrace Discord and know Truth.&quot; Yanafel cackled gleefully and disappeared.<br><br>&quot;Your demise is in my hands, little one,&quot; murmured Kierya. &quot;And my grip is tight. If any harm shall come to Andrayas, you will pay. All of you. By the Father's name, I swear this.&quot;<br><br>Another silence ensued as Kierya's words sank home. Quickly, the experienced adventurers shook off or swallowed their feelings. A cacophony arose as each spoke offering clues, deductions, or suggestions for action.<br><br>When Andrayas said &quot;Yes, Mother Vexxa,&quot; he provided an important clue to Vexxa's true identity. Rumors had circulated of a group of discordant Tier'Dal who had recently terrorized West Karana. It was quickly decided that a search of the Karana Plains would ensue.<br><br>Two groups were formed, led by the druids Starlene and Thoern. Starlene's group was to teleport to Surefall Glade and search from there to South Karana. Thoern's group would start their search in East Karana and meet the first group in South Karana.<br><br>With Shalkai in Thoern's group and Keats in Starlene's, it did not take long to cover the entire northern plains. The two groups met at the tower on the stone bridge leading to South Karana. Together they began to cross the bridge. At the end of the bridge stood a lone skeleton.<br><br>&quot;You seek the one called Andrayas?&quot; asked the skeleton.<br><br>Kierya raised an eyebrow it and replied, &quot;Aye... that we do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have a message for you from Mother,&quot; said the skeleton. &quot;Cease this search or he will be returned to you in very small pieces, baked into a pie.&quot;<br><br>Kierya left the bridge and walked under it. There she found a gaunt, sickly Tier'Dal woman dressed in black.<br><br>&quot;Pay no attention to the woman in the black robe. She is my puppet,&quot; said the skeleton.<br><br>&quot;Are you such a coward that you would send your minion to face us rather than yourself?&quot; asked Kierya of the necromancer. &quot;Please. I am wise in the ways of necromancy, own up to your cowardice.&quot;<br><br>The necromancer cackled gleefully at Kierya. &quot;You have no idea,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;I know more than you think, little one,&quot; Kierya replied.<br><br>&quot;You do not know the beginning of evil,&quot; the necromancer said with a cold smile.<br><br>&quot;I have known evil long before you were a twinkle in your father’s eye,&quot; said Kierya, returning the cold smile. A moment of panic crossed the necromancer's face at the sight of that smile.<br><br>Hearing the confrontation, the rest of the Sigils and their friends joined Kierya and the necromancer under the bridge.<br><br>&quot;Cease this search,&quot; cried the necromancer. &quot;You cannot hurt us. But we will rain Discord down upon you and your kind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We won't give up searching for Andrayas and I call your buff! You need him for something,&quot; said Starlene. &quot;Therefore I doubt you will kill him.&quot;<br><br>Caeandil whispers to Starlene, &quot;But, Starlene, they may kill him when they learn what it is they seek. And I do not know if he has the self-discipline to resist their torture for long.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mother has sent me to deliver a message to you,&quot; said the necromancer, ignoring everyone but Kierya. &quot;Mother Vexxa says that you will learn nothing tonight. She will send another messenger to you soon. So rest your ‘pretty’ heads on your warm pillows. You will get him back when she is through with him. And not before.&quot; The necromancer looked directly into Kierya's eyes and said a few words in the language of the Tier'Dal. Then cackling maniacly, she muttered a spell and disappeared in a flash of light.<br><br>&quot;What did she say, Kierya?&quot; asked Starlene.<br><br>Turning to her friends, Kierya translated, &quot;Forsake Order, embrace Discord and know Truth. The bloody arms of Innoruuk will set you free.&quot;<br><br>Several gasps were heard. Starlene swooned. The eyes of the more seasoned Sigils hardened at the words. But underlying all their reactions was the knowledge that they were indeed powerless, for the moment.<br><br><br>Chapter 3: The Clue<br><br>Temene sat comfortably between Keats and Keyji as she listened to the meeting progress. She was so glad to be able to attend. This particular meeting was quite good. Four adventurers were presented as Candidates for Sigil’s membership. They all looked quite promising, welcome additions to her extended family.<br><br>While Vaerun was providing details on upcoming raids, a loud brutish voice was heard bellowing about Mother and Andrayas. Instantly, the guild members jumped up and ran to the shore of the river. Starlene, Thoern, and Keyji all began to track the source of the bellowing, Swompting.<br><br>By some foul magic, Swompting could not be tracked. So, the guild broke into small groups and began to search East Karana. Thanks to the swift feet of the bards, the search did not take long. A particulary brutish and dull-witted troll was found on the shore of the river, north of the guild meeting.<br><br>&quot;Uh, they found me...&quot; said Swompting. &quot;Lots o' them. Umm have something for you. Cause mother makes me come here and give to you. Who take?&quot;<br><br>Starlene said, &quot;Temene?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. I cannot,&quot; Temene said. &quot;This is getting unbearable for me.&quot; Temene sat down heavily and began to sob. &quot;Someone take the thing from Swompting.&quot;<br><br>After looking at what Swompting was trying to give someone, Starlene screamed and fainted. Thoern rushed to her and comforted her with his healing magic.<br><br>&quot;Okay, you not take,&quot; said Swompting.<br><br>&quot;May I suggest Kierya?&quot; asked Vaerun.<br><br>Kierya replied, &quot;Your word is my will.&quot;<br><br>Crouching down and peering about, Swompting asked, &quot;Who Kierya?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am,&quot; Kierya replied. Swompting reached forward and handed a bloody package to Kierya.<br><br>&quot;Mother in head, makes Swompting do things like that,&quot; muttered Swompting.<br><br>Kierya gasped at Swompting in astonishment. &quot;It's... It's... Oh my! It's... a torn limb!&quot; she exclaimed. Kierya sighed... her stomach dropping to her feet.<br><br>Temene gasped. Shalkai reached over and offered her a comforting hand. She begins to sob in despair.<br><br>&quot;Swompting, if you've hurt Andrayas in any way...&quot; growled Vaerun menacingly.<br><br>Swompting backed up, saying, &quot;Mother said, Mother said it prove she have Andrayas. Swompting not hurt Andrayas. Like said, messenger.&quot;<br><br>Kierya raised an eyebrow at Swompting. She asked, &quot;Who has done this to him?&quot;<br><br>Shalkai asked, &quot;Is there more of this message?&quot;<br><br>Vaerun asked, &quot;Hmm. When did Mother give you this grisly message?&quot;<br><br>Seeming to ignore the barrage of questions, Swompting smiled and said, &quot;Mother happy now, left my head.&quot;<br><br>Looking at Kierya, Swompting answered her question. &quot;Umm, could be Defender. Yafanal or someting like that. Him like that kind stuff.&quot;<br><br>Starlene moaned and started to come to. With Thoern's help, she struggled to her feet.<br><br>&quot;Yanafel,&quot; Kierya said curtly and spat on the ground.<br><br>&quot;That's it,&quot; said Swompting, nodding.<br><br>&quot;The weak little pawn,&quot; Kierya muttered.<br><br>Restored to her usual fire, Starlene exclaimed, &quot;HOW DARE YOU!?! How dare ALL of you?&quot;<br><br>Daunted by Starlene's anger, Swompting muttered, &quot;Umm, no. Me not all. Me slave.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excuses! Resist, resist her will!&quot; Unable to contain her anger and frustration, Starlene began to pace. &quot;I would rather kill myself then be used in such a fashion.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ha! Nobody can,&quot; said Swompting. &quot;Once she have you, you hers. Well...&quot; His brow furrowed as though deep in thought. &quot;Was one. One got way.&quot;<br><br>Swompting paused. Speaking at the same time, Vaerun asked, &quot;Well?&quot; and Keyji exclaimed, &quot;Where is this Mother!?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In Swompting's head mostly. Not know where is really,&quot; replied Swompting.<br><br>Thoern quietly prompted, &quot;Tell us about the one that got away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If Swompting help you, Vexxa do much worse to Swompting than done to human,&quot; he said.<br><br>Unable to contain her frustration any longer, Kierya said, &quot;Swompting.. that little trollop will do nothing compared to what I will do to her. I will protect you if you help us.&quot;<br><br>Nodding at Kierya, Shalkai said, &quot;Swompting, we can protect you if you help us. Kierya can restore life and limb.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye,&quot; Kierya said, nodding. &quot;That I can. This limb is a minor abrasion to what I am used to.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You no can help 'less you get mother out of my head,&quot; Swompting said.<br><br>&quot;She can't control all of your minds at once can she? She said she was happy and left your mind right?&quot; asked Starlene.<br><br>Softly, Thoern explained, &quot;You are not helping us, you are just relating a little minor history.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will you help us if we free you from Mother?&quot; asked Shalkai.<br><br>&quot;I can give you atonement,&quot; said Kierya. &quot;I can set you free from her grip.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can protect you, Swompting,&quot; offered Vaerun. &quot;We can make her stop hurting you, we can make her stop using you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ummm...&quot; replied Swompting. &quot;How I know you not just kill me if I help?&quot;<br><br>In a flash of anger Kierya said, &quot;How do you know we won't kill you if you don't help? It seems the odds are in your favor now.&quot;<br><br>Swompting continued to hesitate and merely said, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's a matter of trust, Swompting,&quot; Vaerun said quietly. &quot;You have everything to gain and nothing to lose.&quot;<br><br>Starlene implored, &quot;Do you REALLY want to be a puppet of Mother for the rest of your life?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would you like to be Mother’s tool, or not a slave and under our protection?&quot; asked Shalkai. &quot;Which path sounds better?&quot;<br><br>Swompting considered a moment longer. Appearing to have made a decision, he said, &quot;She left Swompting to die here. You prove you friend, I tell who escape Vexxa. Swompting want go home. Swompting not know how to get home. Know way, not know if will survive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Swompting,&quot; said Keyji. &quot;So who was it?&quot;<br><br>Shaking his head, Swompting replied tersely, &quot;No, you help Swompting get to swomp first! Then tell you who.&quot;<br><br>Kierya turned to her friends and said, &quot;We need to take him home.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can teleport him to the swamp,&quot; said Starlene. &quot;Who will join me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have another task I must do,&quot; Thoern said. With a quick chant, he gated away.<br><br>Vaerun, Keirya, Mordraeth, and Xith stepped forward to be teleported with Swompting and Starlene. Starlene began the incantation, gathering the magical forces needed to open a portal. In a flash, all disappeared except Swompting. <br><br>&quot;It is as I expected,&quot; said Shalkai. &quot;Swompting is a Child of Discord. Spells cast by Children of Order have no affect on him. Come Swompting, Temene, Keyji. Let's meet the others on the road.&quot;<br><br>The journey to Swompting's home was perilous. Due to his lack of experience, Swompting had to be closely protected. Just one attack could easily have killed him. Shalkai's group met with Starlene's at the Stone Bridge. Thoern returned with Pinash close behind. From there they all journeyed through South Karana, Lake Rathe, and the Rathe Mountains. Due to the overwhelming strength of his companions, Swompting arrived in Feerott safely. He stopped the group, saying that he was home now and would relate what he knew.<br><br>&quot;Okay, there was this halfling I ate. Um, not good way to start... Try again. There this halfling Mother slaved, Pelley. Merchant he was. Her do all sorts stuff to Pelley, and make him do all sorts stuff. When mother grew tired, made me eat halfling. But halfling had son... An' this one would, and still tracks 'em close, the Discord, Mother and the rest. Umm. That made no sense. Okay, the son of the halfling slave, Pelley, kept track of them. Yeah, thats it. But Mother caught him. Slaved his mind. Sent him out to do her work. But he got free. Swompting not know how, Mother not know how. So son of halfling I ate knows how, but we don't. If I know how, I get free, help you find Mother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you know his name?&quot; asked Shalkai. &quot;We will find him, and ask him how we can free you forever.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not know name, but him ummm, very happy all time,&quot; replied Swompting. &quot;Talk non-stop. Find him funny, others get annoyed. Oh, his name sound like father's name, ummm what you call that...? Bards like 'em lots... In songs an stuff... Rime! Dat's it! Son's name rimes with Pelley.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You find this halfing. Free me from Mother. Then me tell you more,&quot; concluded Swompting.<br><br><br>Chapter 4: The Locket<br><br>Starlene talked with Stelley, the halfling that Swompting helped to identify. At first he believed she was Mother in one of her many diguises. However, he agreed to meet with her in the safety of his hometown, Rivervale. Starlene traveled there and met with him. He cast various spells on her; seeing that they worked as they would not on a Child of Discord, he believed Starlene was sincere.<br><br>The monk and Sigil's Candidate, Caeandil, met them in Rivervale. After he arrived, Stelley told them how he broke free of Vexxa's control. He had had a shaman make a special locket called the Escape Locket. Anyone who wears the Locket is freed from Mother's control. The shaman who made it for him has since died, and unfortunately the Locket itself was lost. Stelley was exploring the Frontier Mountains when goblins attacked him and the Locket was destroyed. He then explained that it had been created of two pieces: a goblin whip of strangulation for the cord about the neck, to choke any who would invade the body; and the icy eye of a shardwurm, to be vigilant against those who would slip into the mind of the wearer.<br><br>Starlene reported this information to the guild. It was decided that the shardwurm eye would be sought as part of a dragon hunt that had already been planned. In addition, Lord Parserus, Grand Sigil of the Mighty, planned an expedition to secure the whip.<br><br>The shardwurm eye was not found in the dragon hunt. However, there was hope that one or more Sigils had already acquired this item and had it in the bank. Parserus decided that his hunt for the whip would go ahead as planned.<br><br>At the designated date and time, Bahz and Linelin joined Parserus. Together they dared the lair of Dorga and sought the whip. From all accounts a grand battle ensued. Many goblins fell to the strength and wile of this mighty trio. The whip was acquired. Thoern was able to meet them at the exit from Dorga and teleport them away.<br><br>Members of the guild began to discuss strategies. They had one piece of the Locket, but not the other. Overhearing, Gomphe said that he had one. He agreed to meet Lord Parserus and company in Thurgadin.<br><br>Upon meeting, Gomphe revealed that he was reluctant to release it. He did not want to aid in any cause against another Tier'Dal. He said he had made a deal with Vexxa, &quot;Although I cannot give or sell the eye to you... she never stipulated that you cannot earn the eye from me.&quot; He then posed a riddle which Linelin was able to solve.<br><br>That done, the four then traveled to South Ro to meet Swompting. Temene had already met the troll there and did her best to entertain him with her music.<br><br>Linelin handed the Locket components to Swompting saying, &quot;We've brought the items you seek  for the necklace, the Locket to free you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Swompting replied, looking at the gem and the whip in his hands in confusion. &quot;This not work, mother rip Swompting's heart out. Never made one before. Umm, not sure good enough.... Not know about amulet, only know of Halfling that got away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps there is another,&quot; said Temene. &quot;I have shaman friend. He is rich in ancient lore. He may know how to fashion the amulet. He is on the way. Our friend Alduran has gone to retrieve him.&quot;<br><br>Swompting nodded and mumbled, &quot;Yah, where, me pretty poor in ancient lore stuff.&quot;<br><br>Linelin looked at Swompting threateningly and said &quot;You do not move Swompting, you go nowhere. I will join Discord to hunt you down, Swompting, if that is what it takes.<br><br>&quot;Hmph,&quot; said Swompting, &quot;you still no understand Order an' Discord. Swompting jus' try help, you as evil as mother. Only difference, mother CAN affect me.&quot;<br><br>“Nay, I know of you not,&quot; said Linelin. “I know you are of Discord, and Discord is distrustful and deceitful.&quot;<br><br>Swompting shook his head and said, &quot;Distrust, yes. But evil an' Discord not same thing. One can be evil an' be Order or Discord, and good, same thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You ask for trust,&quot; replied Linelin, &quot;but it must be earned, dear Swompting. I will trust you when I can see you've helped; until then I must watch out for my family, you must realize that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Swompting not ask for trust. Swompting only ask for freedom from Mother in exchange for telling you her plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The shaman is almost here Swompting,&quot; said Linelin.<br><br>Swompting asked, &quot;This shaman know how to make stuff?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, he is very knowledgable in ancient lore,&quot; answered Linelin.<br><br>Alduran arrived with Shalkai and the ogre shaman Gogak. Swompting looked at them and said, &quot;Ugh, more. Nothing that look like ancient lore shaman.&quot; Swompting peered at Gogak, looking him up and down. Gogak turned an icy glare upon Swompting.<br><br>&quot;Troll,&quot; Gogak said.<br><br>&quot;Yah?&quot; responded Swompting. Swompting hands Gogak the eye and the cord and said, &quot;Umm, okay. Here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gogak, please make an Escape Locket,” implored Temene. “The troll could not. He does not have the knowledge. Then return it to Swompting. It will release him from Vexxa's control.&quot;<br><br>Gogak nodded and said, &quot;Gogak got much old learnin.... Gogak make dis necky tingy fur yoo.  Ogre Wunch mostust powerful on wurld.  Much lost... much wee stil kno.&quot;<br><br>Gogak pulled a book out of his backpack and bent over the his work. Time passed slowly as he muttered. Occasionally he would pull something out of his shamanic pouch and chant a quick incantation.<br><br>Impatiently, Linelin asked, &quot;How goes the amulet, Gogak?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Am serching ancient book ub mojo...be payshunt hoomie!&quot; grumbled Gogak. He frantically searched the worn pages of his books. &quot;AH!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Got it! I finds Loket mojo!&quot;<br><br>Gogak closed his eyes and began to chant. &quot;Almost der...,&quot; he said as sweat broke out on his brow. &quot;DER!&quot; he cried. &quot;YES!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes what?&quot; asked Swompting.<br><br>&quot;Troll, me has lokut now,&quot; said Gogak. &quot;Me give to dis Troll?&quot;<br><br>Temene nodded and replied, &quot;Yes, Gogak.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay! Gimmie!&quot; insisted Swompting. Gogak handed the Locket to Swompting. Swompting examined it and said, &quot;Yes, this one! Ohhhh....&quot; Swompting put the Locket on. “It quiet. In my head.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mother is gone, Swompting?&quot; Temene asked.<br><br>Swompting took the Locket off, nodding. &quot;No more magic here, but it work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now you will tell us what we need to know,&quot; said Temene sternly.<br><br>&quot;Umm, okay,&quot; said Swompting. &quot;Swompting not know where Mother is now, but.... Know she will sacrifice Andrayas in two days, at the place where Discord Reigns Within. Midday, so all gods of light can see her evil work. She kinda dramatic like that.&quot;<br><br>Gogak growled, &quot;We sacrifice dis Troll now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Gogak,&quot; said Temene, smiling and shaking her head. &quot;Swompting has fulfilled his part of the bargain. He is free to live as he will.&quot;<br><br>Temene turned to Swompting with a smile on her lips, and was startled to find he had left. &quot;Quiet for a troll! No matter, we have the information we need. Thank you all for helping with this. We are that much closer to freeing Andrayas.&quot; Temene looked about her with a tears running down her face.<br><br><br>Chapter 5: The Rescue<br><br>Caraleena walked with Keyji into The Arena. She had not been there since the ceremonies that merged Aven du Sora with the Sigils. She had thought it odd, that such a wonderful occasion would be held in such a grim location. This time she knew the occasion was anything but wonderful. She had come to join the other Sigils in the rescue of Andrayas.<br><br>With grim resolve Caraleena made herself invisible and scouted the area as she waited for the other Sigils to arrive. On the platform within the Arena proper she was surprised to see only 3 people. There was the one she knew as the Defender Yanafel, the necromancer Milinu, and a troll she had neither heard nor read of. There also stood two skeletons. But, there was no sign of Andrayas.<br><br>Not wanting to press her luck, Caraleena quickly retreated, returning to the tunnel to Lake Rathetear. There she and Keyji met with Sebbal, Caeandil, Torinoka, and Xith. &quot;It is a trap,&quot; she told them. &quot;Andrayas is not here.&quot;<br><br>Xith shrugged. &quot;It does not matter,&quot; he said. &quot;We must defeat them. Otherwise they have won. They must not win.&quot;<br><br>The six entered the arena and a mighty battle ensued. The discordant Tier'Dal, the Vla'Dal, were formidable. There were six of them as well: Vexxa, Yanafel, Milinu, the Assassin, the Priest, and the troll Slave. The battle lasted much longer than any could have imagined. The Vla'Dal were quite crafty. The enchantress Vexxa and the Assassin were the last to fall. But, fall they did.<br><br>&quot;They are defeated,&quot; said Xith. &quot;Now what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let me see if the witch Vexxa holds any clues on her person,&quot; Keyji said as he walked over to her battered corpse. He rummaged through her belongings until he found a parchment. On it was written the details of their diabolical plan to trap the Sigils. Rather than sacrificing Andrayas the Mad, they planned to enslave him and turn him to Discord. He had been left bound and gagged in the Catacombs of Qeynos.<br><br>The six champions arranged a teleport to Surefall Glade and quickly ran to Qeynos. They entered the sewers and split up, searching for Andrayas. Torinoka was the first to find him. He was wandering the lowest level, babbling and muttering about Vexxa. Dressed in rags, his left arm was missing, an empty sleave hung at his side. Periodically he would stop, scream in pain, and faint. Torinoka stayed close to him, trying to get him to stop his wandering. He did not appear to see her. In time, the rest of the champions found them. They brought along a few more Sigils who had come to Qeynos to help Andrayas<br><br>They all followed him throughout the catacombs. They tried cajoling, caresssing, and coercing him into following them, but nothing worked. He ignored them completely. It was not until Xith tried deception that they were able to get his attention. He told Andrayas that Vexxa had sent them, and that they would lead him to her. Andrayas then fixated on Xith, and followed him through the sewers and out of the catacombs.<br><br>Andrayas looked around, his eyes wide and disbelieving. &quot;Xith? Sebbal? Starlene? Caraleena? What am I doing here? What is this place?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are in Qeynos, Andrayas,&quot; said Torinoka.<br><br>Seani reached over and held Andrayas. &quot;Andrayas, do you know where you are?&quot; she asked.<br><br>Looking about blankly, he responded, &quot;I think I need a nap. Then maybe someone can tell me why I am in Qeynos.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We will tell you in time, Andrayas,&quot; said Sebbal.<br><br>Torinoka asked, &quot;Andrayas... does the name Vexxa mean anything to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My bride?&quot; Andrayas responded, nodding.<br><br>Torinoka frowned, shaking her head. &quot;Not exactly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let's take him to an inn in Qeynos,&quot; suggested Keyji. &quot;He will be safe there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, take him to lay down,&quot; Seani said.<br><br>Xith frowned and said, &quot;We should tell him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let him rest first,&quot; Seani insisted.<br><br>Ignoring the others, Xith said, &quot;Andrayas this is for your own good.... Vexxa is dead.&quot;<br><br>Startled, Andrayas asked, &quot;Dead? She is dead?&quot; Tears streamed down his face as he began to cry. &quot;My love...,&quot; he moaned.<br><br>Her hand on his shoulder, Starlene comforted Andrayas, &quot;Andrayas.... Oh, Andrayas....&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should take him to the monks or paladins to sleep,&quot; Caeandil said softy, &quot;While most of the city guard is trustworthy, some are not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Temple of Life,&quot; Nendiane suggested.<br><br>&quot;She was not the love you think, my dear... let us go to the temple,&quot; Seani said softly. To the assembled group Seani said, &quot;I shall take him there... whoever can may follow.&quot;<br><br>Pulling away from the comforting arms of Seani and Starlene, Andrayas turned to the others and said, &quot;Thank you all, although I am not sure why.&quot;<br><br>Most of the group then followed as Seani and Starlene led Andrayas to the Temple of Life.<br><br>Once there Caeandil walked up to Andrayas and said, &quot;Andrayas, I with to ask you to contemplate your feelings for her carefully and deeply over the next several days. You may be surprised at what you find. The sleeping arrangements are spartan, Andrayas, but you will be safe here.&quot;<br><br>Andrayas nodded at Caeandil. &quot;I shall rest here,&quot; he said. &quot;And I shall do as you said, Caeandil.&quot;<br><br>The champions and healers of the Sigils left Andrayas to the ministrations of the priests. They all felt a combination of relief and sadness. They were glad that Andrayas was freed from the clutches of the Vla'Dal. At the same time, the poor man had been through a hideous ordeal. His left arm was still missing. His mental state was never very good, and there was no knowing what recovery from the ordeal would mean for him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukierya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kierya</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/12/02 12:32:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Andrayas' Kidnapping</span><hr size=1> OOC: Temene, this event was better than anything I have experienced in EQ.
