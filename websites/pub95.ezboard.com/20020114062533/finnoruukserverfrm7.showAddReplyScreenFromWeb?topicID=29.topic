Foraging</span><hr size=1> It was certainly getting chilly in the northern reaches of Norrath, but in the southern Karana Plaines, it was still warm enough to go about in leathers and a light cape.  Though at night, the chill did creep into your blanket if you didn't have a nice fur piled on.  Laurelai however, being a Freeport native and accustomed to the desert heat, took no chances when it came to cold preparations, and a heavy polar bear fur was rolled up in her backpack.  Ever on the move to support her cooking and brewing hobby, she walked the plains.  This was prime foraging time in the Karanas.  There were carrots now- sweet at the end of a season of warm and wet to be dug up, ripe berries were abundant in the low growing shrubs of the plains, and the Karana tea leaves were always good to brew up a pot of warm tea.  <br>
<br>
She found that she was thirsty, so she plucked up a plant pod full of water and sucked it dry.  The weather was drying out- even here in the plains in preparation for winter.   Then the bard headed east.  There was something in particular she was searching for.  She looked for pine trees because they grew at the foot of old pines nestled in a blanket of fallen pine needles.  But even more so, she looked for the village of the centaurs.  She was looking for Thunderhoof mushrooms, and they tended to grow more profusely near the centaurs because of the...........fertilizer.  Thunderhoof mushrooms were simply THE best for cooking.  When she was brewing, she went to Kaladim for the rich brown Underfoot mushrooms or the mysterious dark fungus.  When she was mixing dyes to sell, she crept past the brownies into the Lesser Faydark and sought the tiny glowing Jack-O-Lantern mushrooms.  For cooking though, nothing beat a nice big meaty Thunderhoof.... no matter <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   where</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it grew.  Laurelai was especially looking forward to making mushroom soup- a personal favorite.<br>
<br>
She spotted a tell-tale ring at the foot of a pine stand.  Almost giddy with her discovery, the bard picked every one and carefully placed it in her bag.  While she was near the pine trees, she found several more and picked them as well.  When no more were to be found, she decided to move on.  She walked through tall grasses with heavy golden seed heads that drooped and nodded in the breeze.  She heard the occasional squeak of a startled plaines mouse as it scurried to get seeds and berries for its winter larder.  She walked humming to herself and thinking about the upcoming winter.  She would most likely be traveling then, but she would try to stick to the southern areas if she had that option.  Laurelai hated the cold and avoided it whenever she..... then the figure caught her eye.<br>
<br>
Not very far (she would have seen him sooner had she not been so distracted confound it) ahead on the dusky horizon was a figure- obviously male- and very tall.  Laurelai was cautious now, but not overly worried.  It would certainly take more than a bandit to worry her.  Besides; the bandits generally did not travel far from their rocky cover.  This person was likely a traveler like herself- but she never made assumptions.  It appeared that their paths would converge, so she readied herself for a meeting- whatever the nature.  As he neared, she began to take notice of his features as they came into view.  A barbarian it seemed- brown hair- bearded- woad markings on the face.  She decided to try to tip the situation in her favor by speaking in perfect unaccented barbarian tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings!  It isn't common to cross paths in the Karanas.  You are traveling?&quot;<br>
<br>
The man nodded at her- he didn't even appear to be surprised that she spoke his tongue.  Now that he was closer however, Laurelai was able to look closer at him.  He did not have a devious face, and she noted then, that he had a very plesant face to look upon in fact.  Laurelai inwardly grinned at herself for her foible.  Ah well she thought- it hasn't killed me yet to like the way a man looks.  She then noted that he wore many bits of bone and had several powerful talismans on him.  She had met up with a shaman- which she found relief in because shamans were generally a very selfless and kind sort.  As she continued her observation, she noted a spear tied to his back that was decorated with scarlet feathers and eminated a pearly glow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes lady bard- I am traveling to my home in Halas&quot;<br>
<br>
Bard??  She hadn't told him she was a bard and she looked puzzledly at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What makes you so sure I am a bard?<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh- maybe it was your constant humming as you were looking me up and down&quot;  And he smiled a friendly and very disarming smile<br>
<br>
Laurelai blushed a fine fine shade of red.  Gah!  Bad enough she was so obvious in her tally of him, but she didn't even pay attention that she was humming the whole time.  Mentally she smacked herself on the forehead.  Her guild master had often told her that he could tell when she was nervous.  She hummed.  Well, maybe she could salvage some dignity yet.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could just be a musically inclined druid no?&quot;<br>
<br>
He said nothing, but smirked and looked down at her right hand..... where she carried a very fine bone flute.  Laurelai follwed his gaze, saw the flute, and winced.  Well- no dignity salvaged there!  So she laughed at herself- in a manner that showed she was accustomed to doing so and decided to give it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes friend shaman, you have through stealthy and magical means determined my nature.  I am not traveling to get anywhere though- I am simply looking for mushrooms.  Truthfully, I am meandering aimlessly until my sacks are full then I will return home.  You would like some company on your way?&quot;<br>
<br>
The shaman made as if it was a matter of great importance- and he made a great show of pondering it.  Laurelai crossed her arms and tapped her foot at him in mock impatience.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well half-elf, I suppose I can tolerate that incessant humming for a short while&quot;<br>
&quot;bah&quot; was all she could muster.<br>
<br>
They walked together towards the north.  While they walked, they both talked and it seemed as they had been old friends reunited.  Laurelai would stop occasionally and pull out her old rusty dagger and dig up a carrot when she saw the deep green frilly leaves.  The shaman would look on in bemusement as she continued to talk as she did so.  The dusk turned to night and they decided it would be a good time to set up a camp for the evening.  The barbarian kindled a fire as Laurelai cut up carrots, portioned a rabbit and even gave up some of her precious mushrooms to the pot and placed it on the fire.  Then she pulled out some tea leaves, and a couple of tin mugs and added water so they could have hot tea to drink with the stew.  Once dinner was finished, the shaman summoned a wolf spirit to watch over them as they slept.<br>
<br>
They broke camp and continued north.  Sometimes they would chatter amongst themselves, and sometimes they were silent.  For two days, they walked northward, the whole time Laurelai kept a sharp eye out for anything she could put in a cooking pot.  On the second day, they spotted a white stone bridge that crossed the Snake river.  It divided the karanas south from north.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Friend- this is where I need to stop.  The weather gets colder yet, and I haven't filled my bags.  The weather has shriveled all but the hardiest plants, and if I want to finish my foraging, I need to go back south.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shaman nodded and cast a protective ward on the bard.<br>
&quot;Safe journey to you my friend- hopefully we will meet again when I come south again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he put a finger under her chin, and tilted her face up to his.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be careful half-elf....&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurelai watched as he backed away.  His figure became dark and began to ripple.  She watched in fascination as where her friend the shaman stood now was a mass of writhing black that transformed into ravens.  They flew quickly away leaving a whisper of wings in his place.  She could have sworn that there were words in that whisper.<br>
