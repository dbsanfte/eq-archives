<br>
All i was saying is that i spent 150k+ on the guild and the gems i did have that i didnt give to people i gave to diona this supposed 6 gems total i gave her is outright bs. <br>
<br>
Diona disbanded guild 3 days after zigmund guildremoved everyone that was online and didnt remove themselvs. Zig removed paghk it wasnt paghk removing himself. <br>
<br>
As for you camping gems yes DoW did camp some gems that is correct. Did the Nephrites Flawed topaz emeralds and other minor gems add up to any the gems i bought? no. All the Cfe's that i purchased and gave to guild were gone in a week to everyone that needed them. Yes Some people did donate items or plat Swall did give me items to obtain his Flawless diamonds and i did so. the 20k that i was givin total from sellable items and random plat did in fact get used on the 15 Cfe's that i purchased together i did have to add my own plat tho. As for the number of gems total i obtained i know for sure it was 7 flawless diamonds &lt;not including Swalls 2&gt; 2 Pristine emeralds and 1 black marble. As for the total of diamonds left when i obtained them was 3 I know 2 were un accounted for and i know that Devis had 3 of them. Now as for any gems that were obtained in a raid Before the fall of dow and the Leaving of Bolthog and Zatharas I dont know where those gems went to. I reterned a total of 34 or so gems to diona all were minor gems and i kept 3 flawless diamonds. Small payback if ya ask me but it wasnt my concern. When i agreed to donate my hard earned cash to the guild Gems i made a deal with K For the next DROPPED Plate bp from thurg because it was all i needed to complete my suit. Well the deal never went thru so unfortunatly I was unable to collect. Anyway my post was a rant and just in wrong place eim sorry for that but all i ment in the start was to say i dont have and didnt have the gems that some people claim i did/do. I dont know where they went to and had no reason to keep any gems but those K and i Agreed i should keep. (mostly because K understood i wasnt going to return the three diamonds i had because i felt it was a small Compensation for my efforts) Some people will think that when you join a guild you donate yer time and sometimes resources just like everyone else and things you obtain thru raids that are givin/won &lt;givin by the grace of K in dow&gt; That THATS your payment for what you put into the guild. I can understand and agree with this statement to some degree. I went outta my way to give MORE then required to the guild by CHOICE and new i may not collect any sorta fair compensation in return and was willing to make that sacrifice if it came to that because i felt good about helping others. <br>
<br>
Bottom line is When zigmund removed me from the guild anything i had in my possetion was basically MINE. I chose to return the gems i had minus the Flawless diamonds Because for 1 they werent worth the bank space and 2 because Even tho DoW/RW was gone i was still loyal to my old friends that i knew for over a year and a half. <br>
<br>
So the point is over if you Dont like me for some reason you can i cant force you to love me and if you still are my friend then im happy that you will still speak with me. At the time i posted i was in shock and angered by the false information people were basing there opinions off of and it was upsetting. Now ive come to accept that people will believe whatever they want. Since I cant and Wont change the past or seek out any gems to give to DoW to pay for wrongs i never did im afraid some people will never like me now. And as for K not knowing Orphius or im sure tencor That is easily attributed to there relluctance to speak in guildchat and K's Lack of large play time. Either way i see people posting arguments that seem valid from both sides and i offer this.<br>
<br>
<br>
We're both right in our own views and unless each of us can accept the others recollection of events Nothing will get solved. I had spoken with K and believed we had come to an understanding and had resolved this and i had assumed that he Realized he was in error and informed others. I found out i was wrong in my belief and so /shrug I was wrong and will move on and just dis associate with those that feel im a lier and a thief. And simply deal with people that know me better then that. So if you dont wish to speak with me thats fine if i send you atell assuming your a friend simply say your not and i will move on and if you are my friend and wish to tell me so please just /tell me on poghk or paghk and ill be happy to chat with you and continue to have a good time. <br>
<br>
So with all that said im going to say ill see you all again in eq weather your trainin me With a North Temple of Veeshan Mob to Hall of Testings or joinin my group for good old fashend random acts of violence.<br>
<br>
