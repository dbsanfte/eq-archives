I approve of his handling of the direct issues related to Sept 11 -- what's happening in Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
I pretty much completely disapprove of everything else he's doing.<br>
<br>
The solution to dwindling oil reserves: drill more wells.  That's right, let's dig it out of the ground FASTER so it runs out FASTER.  Let's keep energy cheap (for now) so that it's not economical to pursue alternative sources.  Let's make sure that when the oil really gets scarce it's that much harder to handle.  And let's make sure that we BURN the oil instead of saving it for manufacturing.  After all, we don't need plastics and other synthetics, do we?<br>
<br>
Gawd, I shouldn't let myself get started, or we'd have the rant of all ages.<br>
<br>
GWB == DemonSpawn.<br>
<br>
And in case you're wondering, YES, I know what I'm talking about on this issue.  I am wrapping up my MBA and then starting a doctorate degree in energy management, and have started doing the groundwork.  Just takes time while also running a company :-)<br>
<br>
In 1957, a man named Hubbard (who worked for Shell at the time) predicted that U.S. oil production would peak in the early 70s.  The actual peak was 1970 -- highlighted by the discovery of Prudhoe bay.<br>
<br>
Using the same techniques, it is estimated that worldwide oil production will peak sometime in 2004-2009.  The number varies strictly because they don't know exactly what the total world's oil supply is.  Using the range of possible numbers agreed upon by the oil industry results in this estimate.<br>
<br>
It would take *multiple* discoveries of oil fields on a par with Kuwait to scew this estimate, and it wouldn't be scewed very far.  No one believes we're going to make discoveries of this nature.<br>
<br>
GWB: I'll be dead before we run out, so why do I care?<br>
<br>
Yes, the oil industry will get better at extracting oil.  It is believed that as much as 50% of the oil is left in the ground when a field is considered used up -- the rest of the oil just can't be extracted using known (economical) techniques.  Remember, it's 7,000 to 15,000 feet deep, and the oil isn't usually found in big pools, it's found in porous rock.<br>
<br>
Getting better just postpones the inevitable.  GWB wants to speed up the inevitable.<br>
<br>

Oh and GWB Ownz.<br>
<br>
I would expect any fuel source we come up with will have repercussions.  People say Solar is the future.. humm yeah its nice. But that and wind power are used for electrical power.  And if you look around there are already tons of people complaining that we depend too much on electricity.  Heck, the magnetic field generated by electricity running through ours homes are being blamed for many forms of cancer already.<br>
<br>
Lets face it, if you want to move things with mechanical force, you need an engine.  The physics of efficiency does not allow for &quot;energy in&quot; to = &quot;energy out&quot;.  So there will always be waste. that waste will get SOMEONE's panties in a bunch.  Whether it is Water, Co, Co2, Magnetic waves, or Fruitloops.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, people are the problem, for those who put the Earth first.  The only way to SAVE the earth is to get rid of its people.  There is no way people will ever live in harmony with the Earth because we require the Earth to live.  Its one or the other until the Earth finally cant go on any more.  And by that time, there wont be any people anyway so it wont matter.<br>
<br>
My biggest problem with the argument that the Oil Industry doesn't care about the Oil supply is the argument flawed to begin with.  In order for that to be accurate, we would have to believe the Oil Industry is, someday, expecting to be out of business forever.  Its the same with the wood industry.  People would have you believe that the wood industry is TRYING to cut down all the trees.  Thats just silly.  Both industries are in business to make money, they can not sell Oil and Trees if there isnt any more.<br>
<br>
Some people actually believe that the world will run out of energy and just plain stop.  The world, man, and progress began WITHOUT an energy source.  It will continue with out energy if need be.  Life would change but the world will not end.  New Sources exist, the end of Oil will only me the birth of another form of energy.  I dont think the Earth will stop turning because we used up all the oil.<br>
<br>
Give it another billion years and we will be the next oil source for the next stage of this planets natural resource evolution.<br>

Drill away.<br>

You have destroyed the environment by your selfish greed, and I damn you for it.  Ted Kacyznski can complain about our environmental policies, pretty much the rest of you are just hypocrites.  Oh yeah, Jimmy Carter was such a role model as a leader.  He's a good man, but was a terrible leader.  I guess it's too bad GWB is making decisions rather then dropping his drawers in the Oval Office for an intern.  If you want to meet some daemonspawn I can put you in touch with some people, calling someone that just because you disagree with his policies just shows the utter lack of reason that GWB's detractors always use.  If the Demos had had a real platform other then to attack any ideas for moving this country ahead proposed by the Reps, the Demo's might not be the minority party in 2/3 of the legislature.  And they only have the Senate because someone who claimed to run as a Rep. just to get the votes switched sides.  But I guess you just claim he was &quot;following his conscience&quot;, rather then facing the truth that he just did it to get elected. <br>
<br>
Actually I wouldn't consider talking monkeys (humans) as viruses, we are actually parasites.  Besides, humans suck at real destruction.  Take the Ozone layer.  The explosion of Krakatoa emitted more ozone destroyers in one bang then the entire industrial world can emit in decades.  You do know that volcanoes destroy more ozone then man does currently?  Heck, I think even cows come pretty close.  Earthquakes, landslides, tornados, floods, man is just petty compared to the forces of Nature.  We could compare say, deaths from Nuclear Weapons versus the Bubonic Plague.  Compare how many people died because of our environmental policies versus how many died from smallpox.<br>
<br>
I also love the anti-hunting crowd.  Man has infringed on many animals hunting areas.  That is not going to change.  So hunting is a way of restoring some balance.  Have you ever seen pictures of areas where hunting was banned for years?  All of the starving animals out there really turns my stomach.  But it's more about denying people rights then it is about the animals.  <br>
<br>
It's just like NOW.  Here we take women who aren't allowed to work, can't leave the house without a male relative and only when covered head to toe.  If you commit adultery the man in the situation is let off while you can be stoned to death.  It's a crime to teach you to read or let you work.  So because of the current situation in Afghanistan, women are being allowed to actively return to society.  Are the Women's rights groups praising our country at all?  Hell no, because they only fight for people's rights in order to get more power for themselves, that is an easy claim to defend.  And the political party which claims to represent Women's rights isn't in power, therefore there will be no praise.<br>
<br>
Walknot, tell me more about using fruitloops as an energy source though, you caught my interest.  The comparison between the Oil and Wood companies isn't a great one though, because trees are renewable in a reasonable time-frame (20-30 years), in fact a lot of the wood the bigger companies are delivering now is from stock they planted.  Besides, Nature used to have huge natural fires that would clear forests, now we tend to put them out, so we are actually counterventing Nature even as we try to claim we are saving it.<br>
<br>
I wear Leather clothing, I eat Red Meat, and I drive a Cobra which does not get great gas mileage.  So bite me.  In fact I think I'm going to crank my heat up and open all my windows.  Then I'm going to burn a big pile of plastic and rubber stuff and throw the ashes into the groundwater system, along with 2 gallons of anti-freeze.  That'll give some of you a reason to get your panties up in a twist, which is all most of you live for anyways.<br>

If I can get 8 habitiable (aka, &quot;beautiful&quot;) planets, you darn right let's destroy this one.<br>
A lot better than the tree huggers who run screaming from &quot;Ice Age!&quot; to &quot;Global Warming&quot; and expect us to panic and start messing with the climate every time they get a bug up their butts.<br>

That's right, let's dig it out of the ground FASTER so it runs out FASTER. Let's keep energy cheap (for now) so that it's not economical to pursue alternative sources. Let's make sure that when the oil really gets scarce it's that much harder to handle. And let's make sure that we BURN the oil instead of saving it for manufacturing. After all, we don't need plastics and other synthetics, do we?<br>

It's not going to run out, unless we take counsel from our fears. We've already stalled the space program far to long.  As for plastics and other synthetics.. the vast majority of them are now made with plant-based materials... like Soy beans. 20 years ago Iowa State came up with a way to make plastic corn... nobody did anything with it, though.<br>
Good news for you, Wolfy.. it's *raining* petroleum on Titan, and one of the moons of Jupiter. We're not going to run out of petroleum products.<br>
And the answer, of course, is to use what we have to now, and in the meantime really work to A) discover a way to manufacture petroleum, B) get our arses into space, and C) discover alternative sources of fuel. This means accepting Nuclear power plants, trashing that godawful ABM treaty so we can get some real, nuclear powered spacecraft in production, and drilling for the oil we'll need for the energy to solve these problems. It's like being trapped in a mine cave-in with only so much food. you can either starve yourselve trying to make the food go as long as possible, knowing it will run out anyway, and in the meantime not ever really having the strength to dig yourself out (while hoping somebody else solves your problem for you,) or you can eat the damn sammiches and dig your ass off.<br>
Use the oil. We'll find more. We'll make more.<br>
<br>
Yes, and in the 1970s the club of rome predicted that by now there'd be massive starvation, all our fossil fuels would be gone, pollution would be rampant, and we'd be in another ice age. Doomcrying gets old fast. I don't believe this brand of BS any more than I believe the old brand. We can predict the likelyhood of finding oil in a given place, but until we go and *look*, we don't know. Until we pump it out, we don't know.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It would take *multiple* discoveries of oil fields on a par with Kuwait to scew this estimate, and it wouldn't be scewed very far. No one believes we're going to make discoveries of this nature<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You mean the same oil fields that the Iraqis torched? Why not call *them* the antichrist, rather than GWB? He may not be conserving the oil as you insist he must, but he's not setting the oil fields on fire! Oh, no.. there's not a chance in hell you'd convince Hussein to conserve, so go after GWB, since you might convince him to stop thinking.<br>
His job, btw, is not to protect the planet, but to do what's best for the U.S. And that right now is getting us more oil and less dependant on OPEC (btw, if we get our oil from alaska instead of arabia or venezuela.. then we won't be using the arabian or venezuelan oil up.. so the oil will still be there. So what's the big deal?)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes, the oil industry will get better at extracting oil. It is believed that as much as 50% of the oil is left in the ground when a field is considered used up -- the rest of the oil just can't be extracted using known (economical) techniques. Remember, it's 7,000 to 15,000 feet deep, and the oil isn't usually found in big pools, it's found in porous rock.<br>
<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Getting better just postpones the inevitable; getting more eliminates the issue. Right, GWB is a complete ogre who, like me, gets a kick out of the idea of using up all of our oil. Nonsense. Like me he knows that if we keep listening to the cowards and pretending that there's no solution, we *will* run out and be stuck. And if the U.S. goes under because we won't drill... who's going to listen to the tree huggers then? Hussein? <br>
Look up; there's 50% of the universe. The other 50% is behind you, just as large, and equally grand. THAT'S where our future lies. Now, write your congresscritter to start giving NASA and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas *real* funding to start building the future oil tankers that'll be scaling oil in from Titan... and hurry, because the longer you wait, the more oil Mommy Earth loses.<br>

We can't stay on Earth, period. Not unless you want to kill off 5 billion of us, and sterilize all but about a thousand of the rest with controlled breeding programs. There is no other way to keep us from breeding. And in doing that you eliminate any hope of a future as free as the past we've known. Freedom is not created by words, or by principles, or by compassion; it's created by wealth. I don't mean dollars in the bank, though that counts too.. If you have to scrounge every minute of every day like most animals do, just to feed yourself, you're not free. Likewise if your life is really just a preset dance, dictated by the powers that be, even if it's for your own good, you're not free. <br>
Two things helped convince me of the inevitability of our expansion into space; one, the realisation that the natural social form for humans is the tribe, not the state. We ruined that in the U.S. when we didn't let the Confederacy secede and thereby made a mockery of some of the wording of the Constitution. Better to let the people in Minnesota live they way they want than to have people in Washington dictate how to live to them, even if it's to conserve Mommy Earth's precious resources. The second thing was the realisation that we have no future here: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  imagine a boot stamping a human face... forever</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that's Orwell's vision of the future and it is an inevitable future; Either we employ horrific measures now to reduce population and conflict and KEEP them suppressed, or we will do so in the future when there's no choice... *if* we're still trapped on this ball of rock. <br>
But look up.. y'know what's up there? Fortunes. Money to be made and spent. Adventures for the young. Room and isolation for crazy philosophies that can't be tolerated in a closed society (such as the Earth would become if we remain solely on the Earth.) Places so far away that Washington would never be able to dictate *anything* to them. And if we do destroy the Earth, it won't mean the end of the species, or maybe even of life. And in making the other planets and moons habitable, we will *inevitably* learn techniques and processes and an understanding of how a planet works to fix whatever has gone wrong with the Earth; Terraforming Terra itself. <br>
I hate Star Trek. It makes it look too easy and boring. <br>
And what hammered it home to me was Tom Hanks. If a liberal movie comedian like that can become *such* a strong believer, and have such an influence that for a brief moment people in the space program became heroes again, then there's hope that we can overcome the cringing tree huggers, amd get on with our future.<br>

<br>
The fact is -- there ARE alternatives to burning oil.  Hydrogen fuel cells look VERY promising.<br>
<br>
The oil IS going to run out.  And I really think it's going to happen a heck of a lot sooner than we get interstellar space travel to happen.<br>
<br>
So do all the other experts in the oil industry.<br>
<br>
As for the oil companies themselves -- they don't care about profits 40 years from now, they care about the bottom line this quarter.<br>
<br>
World oil production is going to peak in THIS DECADE.  Not when we're old and gray.  THIS DECADE.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, written history is roughly 15,000 years old.  Yet we're going to go through ALL the available oil on this planet in the course of less than 200 years.  Something is wrong with that.<br>
<br>
But go ahead and bury your heads in the sand.  That's a much more comfortable position than to face the truth and decide to do something about it.<br>
