align=left class=m><span class=title> Nagy raid cancelled-Shards of Chaos killed him 1-11</span><hr size=1> Evil only raid on Nagafen on Sunday, January 12th, 10am PST, Noon CST, and 1pm EST <br>
This is my first time running a raid of this sort so bear with me. My thanks to Medite for his Nagy raid rules which I used as the basis for mine. If I have anything here messed up, feel free to drop me  a tell in game or a message on the Kith’Dring boards. Please reply below if you will be attending.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only thing that I ask is that you (a) stay behind the Main Assist, Secondary Assist, and Pullers and keep that area clear (this saves a considerable amount of time and typing), (b) wait until word is given before you attempt to pull any monster (this saves both time and lives), and (c) review the information below concerning the strategy to be employed and the loot policies (this saves us from a flame war). <br>
<br>
<br>
Ideally we will have 5 balanced groups (see bottom of post) composed of toons level 46-52. I realize this isn't very likely to happen, and I'll state these exceptions up front:<br>
<br>
Clerics as low as 44 (preferably with Celestial Healing)<br>
Bards as low as 44<br>
1 cleric above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>
1 enchanter above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>
1 shaman above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>
1 magician above 52 for summoning items &amp; debuff attempt<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyone over 52 will not be able to fight the dragon, but can help kill giants in addition to buffing, etc. If we really want to get ambitious, any 53+ people can try to land one debuff on Naggy.<br>
<br>
Everyone coming on the raid should have unbuffed (meaning no buffs, no summoned items, no disciplines) fire and magic resist at least 60, preferably 100+. I recommend Netherbian Chitin (plate chest - 10 FR), emerald jewelry, Earrings of Fire Reflection (5 FR - gypsies in Lava), Fireclaw cloak (10 FR). Remember - resists are MUCH more important than AC. Also bear in mind the summoned gear we will likely have - blankets (shoulder or back - 15 fire/magic), defenders (secondary or back - 5 cold/magic), mystical dagger (held,range or ammo? - 5 magic). It would suck to go through a bunch of effort to obtain something that you will replace with summoned gear. I've heard there are other mage summoned fire/magic resist items, but I'm not sure what. Perhaps a high level mage can post the options... (hint, hint)<br>
<br>
We will be gathering at the top of the ramp leading down to the Sol B entrance . Don't be late! I will be putting groups together at the stated time. Sign-ups get priority, but expect to have final groups announced at about 10 minutes after the stated start time and us entering SolB at about 15 minutes after the stated start time. Possibly earlier if everyone who signs up gets there on time. It is possible that people who sign up won't get in because they aren't there on time. Sorry, but that's how it works. I put final groups together at the stated time, and am actually working on them well before then. Be on time or lose your spot.<br>
<br>
I will be suppling peridot for buffs. If you want a TL out at the end, make sure your destination doesn't require a TL stone, or have one to give to the wizzy.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend everyone take measures to reduce lag - nothing sucks worse than going LD right as everyone charges the dragon (possibly the highest lag moment of the raid).<br>
<br>
There will be NO GATING during the raid. If anyone gates out of SolB at any time, for any reason they are booted from the raid. Don't even have the spell memorized. If you fall in the lava, get massive aggro, whatever - you die. You will get rez'd (almost guaranteed 90% or better), and the raid will continue. If you gate out, you WILL train the raid when you come back. That is why I do not allow gating.<br>
<br>
********** Chat Channels ********** <br>
<br>
Please use the following chat channels:<br>
<br>
NAGRAID - raid wide chat<br>
NAGLISTEN - important announcements only. This is where I talk, MA posts messages, snarers announce when snares land, etc. NO CHAT HERE.<br>
NAGLEAD - all group leaders (first character listed for each group) and raid leaders will communicate here. Please use chain of command whenever possible (toons -&gt; group leaders -&gt; raid leaders)<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Giants ********** <br>
<br>
Giants will be killed in groups that are essentially the dragon groups, except the melee groups will have a cleric instead of a bard - all depends on the class composition of those who sign up. Everyone be patient, as pulling the giants from Naggy's lair is not easy and may take a while. Killing them is easy, getting them away from Naggy is hard.<br>
<br>
Go to www.eqatlas.com and familiarize yourself with the layout. MEMORIZE THE MAP.<br>
<br>
Our path will be (from the entrance to SolB from LS, using the eqatlas map for reference): [9] Block Crusher Trap, [12] Nox Corridor, [13] Stone Spider Room, Prep for giant killing, [15] Entrance to Fire Giant Castle (kill 2 giants), move up to the area next to the lava and pull giants. When fighting giants here (loc -1180, -220) all MELEES NEED TO PUSH THE GIANTS INTO THE CORNER OF THE WALL (BEHIND THE CANDELABRA). If the giants get into the lava it is very, very bad. When the throne room [16] is cleared of giants, we will move up to it. All but the last few giant will be pulled to the throne room or the little room just before the drawbridge. We will then cross the drawbridge [18] and pull the remaining giants to the hallway before Naggy's antechamber. When all the giants are killed we move up to the antechamber for buffing.<br>
<br>
MA = ???<br>
SA = ???<br>
Puller = ???<br>
Backup puller = ???<br>
Loot mistress = ???<br>
Traffic control = ???<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Buffing ********** <br>
<br>
Remember, buffing is the longest most boring part of raids. It is also the trickiest and most important. Please be patient, pay attention and execute your duties in this phase quickly - whether it is casting a single junk buff, singing a mana song or moving and camping at the right time. Things will get done much faster if we all do this.<br>
<br>
Buffing will be done in Naggy's antechamber.<br>
<br>
Buffing will done in groups. Each group will step up to the buffing area (the center of the antechamber) and get the following buffs, in order:<br>
<br>
#01 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold) <br>
#02 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison) <br>
#03 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease) <br>
#04 shaman stamina <br>
#05 shaman Harnessing of spirit <br>
#06 cleric shield of words <br>
#07 cleric Heroic Bond <br>
#08 cleric symbol of naltron (reagent: peridot)<br>
#09 enchanter rune IV / V (reagent: peridot)<br>
#10 enchanter group resist magic <br>
#11 enchanter haste / clarity <br>
#12  Damage Shield, or open for Celestial Healing, etc.<br>
#13-15 open for bard resist songs <br>
<br>
Buffers will announce when they start and finish each buff ( buffers should make hotkeys). When the 'final' groups are posted a caster will be assigned to each buff, so check back before the raid.<br>
<br>
Fully buffed groups will camp out to the FV chatroom immediately upon getting 11 buffs (12 for casters - clarity). Haste will be reapplied just before the charge. Relog every 20 minutes to refresh summoned items.<br>
<br>
After all the melee groups and nuker groups have camped the buffers will med to full and buff themselves. When the buffers are back up to 80 mana from these final buffs everyone from the chatroom will be told to reenter the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Dragon ********** <br>
<br>
General notes: <br>
1) Everyone should have hotkeys setup to announce significant actions. Group leaders should announce when their group has engaged, casters should announce attempts to debuff, etc.<br>
<br>
2) To land spells you need to be within Naggy's melee/AoE range. Best place is right by his butt. This is why EVERYONE needs good resists, full buffs, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Healing. If we have dragon groups setup with no clerics in the melee groups, each group will have an assigned cleric (or two). When tanks need a heal they should 1) send a tell to their designated cleric (have a hotkey for this), 2) turn off attack and 3) back away from Naggy &amp; towards their cleric once they no longer have aggro. Clerics should have hotkeys to target all of their designated tanks, as well as an /rtarget hotkey. If we get 3-4 clerics each tank group will have a cleric and this will be easier.<br>
<br>
4) Pushing. 20 tanks beating on Naggy will push him around. It is imperative that Naggy NOT get pushed into the lava. Naggy gets healed by being in the lava. If Naggy starts to get close to the lava MOVE YOUSELF so that you don't make it worse. If necessary, melees should stop attacking and back away to get Naggy back into the center of his room. Same goes for pushing Naggy into walls.<br>
<br>
When all groups have reformed the MA group will enter Naggy's chamber and engage. Tanks remember to activate disciplines. Bard's priorties are 1) Elemental Rhythms, 2) Guardian Rhythms - have your best drum out. Haven't figured out what would be the best 3rd song to twist (if possible), but it needs to be low aggro. Also, bards should NOT be attacking Naggy. 1) puts you up the aggro list, 2) minimal damage output when you have a drum going, 3) Ripostes will kill you quick. We need the bards alive to keep our resists up.<br>
<br>
As soon as the MA group has engaged Naggy and has him positioned in the middle of his lair all remaining melee groups will enter and position themselves behind Naggy. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT PUSHING NAGGY TOWARDS THE LAVA NOR INTO A WALL. The casters can move up from the antechamber to the landing at the north end of the bridge (I will have a hotkey to announce such).<br>
<br>
Healing the MT . It is imperative that clerics announce heals in NAGLISTEN.<br>
<br>
At 60-70 debuffing will be attempted. Shaman/magician will attempt Malosi, shaman will attempt slow, one enchanter can attempt tash, bards can twist in a debuff (magic or cold resist). This is where 53+ toons can attempt a debuff and get kicked out (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br>
<br>
At 50 nukers charge, get under Naggy and blast away. Melee's with nukes go at it as well. Remember that fire based spells have essentially zero chance of sticking (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Naggy targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
Hopefully enough of us live to take him down.<br>
<br>
<br>
********* LOOT ********* <br>
<br>
- Loot will be called by group leaders in channel NAGLISTEN and given to me (Draugluin). Only group leaders should be looting. Everything will be rolled on at the end only. A person can only win 1 item but can give it back if they win a second item (first item will be rerolled). Roll will be done on a 0-1000 random. <br>
<br>
- CAN AND WILL USE (aka Need Before Greed) - DON'T ROLL UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE ITEM. IF NOBODY IS GOING TO USE THE ITEM, ALL WILL ROLL.<br>
<br>
With respect to those that will be allowed to roll on items, if your class/race can use it, AND ONLY IF YOU CAN AND WILL USE IT, you will be allowed to roll and will be awarded the item if you have the highest roll.<br>
