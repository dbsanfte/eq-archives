That may well be true. But Mia had come to realize that none of her dreams from her youth had happened, let alone become regrets. Instead she found herself feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole. Her world was changing so rapidly that she thought she was loosing her mind. She clung onto anything that seemed familiar, that seemed real, that made her think, if only for a little while, that everything was going to be okay.<br>
<br>
“I brought your briefcase.” Johnny explained as he helped Mia to his car. “It was the only luggage of yours I could find and I didn’t know how long you would be in the hospital. The doctors thought it would be no less than a week. You’ve recovered marvelously they tell me.”<br>
“Where is it?” Mia questioned gruffly, her throat still soar from whatever the doctors had shoved down it.<br>
        “Where’s what m’dear?”<br>
        “The briefcase!” Mia shouted as she fell back into the large brown leather seat of Johnny’s car.<br>
        “Here.” Johnny replied in a tone a little too sweet than Mia deserved. He handed her the briefcase from the backseat, than climbed into the drivers seat and started the car. “I don’t know what you carry around in that thing, but you sure have it locked tighter than a . . .” Just then Johnny looked over to see Mia stabbing a large syringe into her eye. He yelled and quickly reached over and knocked the syringe from her hand, letting it fall out of her eye and into the open briefcase on her lap. Mia stared at him crossly, a tiny drop of blood forming in the center of her eye. “That’s the stuff that put you in the hospital to begin with. We’ll have no more of that unless you’re planning on spending the rest of your days six feet under.”<br>
        “MY life,” Mia shouted in Johnny’s face, her eyes never leaving his, her gaze one of hatred and anger, “is none of your concern. I will do with it what I please.” Johnny had come to a stop and Mia took this opportunity to close her briefcase and jump out of the car, running into the night, enshrouded by the rain and by the fog and by the darkness, her feet padding softly on the wet cobblestones. Johnny watched her go, a look of sadness crested his aged brow. Then, realizing there was nothing he could do, he continued his way home.<br>
<br>
<br>
        It was wandering through the dark streets of Rome, alone and wet, that Mia found a sign telling her what to do. Signs come in all different forms, in the end anything can be a sign if you want it to be. This sign however was no trick of the mind, and there was no misinterpreting it. Pasted in the window of a post office was a piece of paper that had a photo of Mia on it, surrounded by bold letters that read: &quot;Ricercato per omicidio&quot; (Wanted for Murder). It turns out that there was a security camera installed in the hallway right outside Michael’s apartment. Several neighbors had also seen Mia enter and exit the building. For the first time in quite some time Mia knew exactly what she had to do: run. By this time, the heat had probably cooled somewhat in Paris, so she decided to return. She also wanted to get back to her old life, where everything made sense, where nothing strange ever happened to her, where she could live the same boring life she had always lived.<br>
        As she walked to the train station she thought about old Johnny. He had been so sweet to her always, and she had yelled at him. Why did she do that? She couldn’t remember. All she knew now was that she regretted it. She also regretted that she did not have more time, so that she could go and say goodbye.<br>
        When Mia finally arrived at the train station, the sun was beginning to break upon the ancient city. The next train to Paris would leave very soon, forcing her to run from the ticket counter to the train in order to catch it on time. Mia was both physically and mentally exhausted, but she would not sleep until she got to Paris. Like waking up from a nightmare she thought, soon she would be in Paris and away from all this madness. As the train gathered speed and left the station, Mia pushed off with the last bit of blood she had left; just enough to keep her awake for the trip.<br>
<br>
        Mia watched the green landscape go shooting by through her transparent reflection in the glass window of her cabin. She shifted her focus to her reflection. She was a mess. Her makeup was running down her face from both tears and rain, while her hair reminded her of a large knot. Her physical appearance however, did not concern her at this time. What concerned her at this moment was that her reflection seemed to be mouthing words that Mia herself was not. Mia watched her lips form the words slowly and tried herself to sound them out. Just as she thought she had the first word, the train went through a tunnel and her reflection disappeared in the blackness. When they emerged out the other side, her reflection was simply that, a reflection, nothing more, and nothing less. Nothing strange or unusual happened the entire rest of the trip, save for the fact that Mia managed to sleep a little.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        The sun shown bright as the train came to a stop in Paris. The sunlight passing through the green glass of the ceiling gave the air inside the station a strange quality, like something out of a fantasy novel. Mia’s heart smiled as she stepped off the train and looked around. “This is home” she thought. She walked outside into the brilliant morning air and hailed the first cab she saw. As the cab drove her home she thought about all the things she was going to do now that she was back. She would go to the park and to the café and maybe even start taking on clients again. In any case, life would return to normal and Rome would seem nothing more than a bad dream.<br>
