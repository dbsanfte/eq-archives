He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his handkerchief with which he proceeded to wipe his brow. The sun glittered off the silver helmet that served as a makeshift tombstone. Titurous leaned on his shovel and stared at the helmet, trying to imagine who it’s owner was, tried to imagine what kind of eyes once glared out from behind the beaver. He figured out by the design on the armor that it was the remains of a Holy Knight, someone who had earned the respect and honor of his peers because of his brave actions, for he found metals of honor inside the breastplate. He was once a noble knight; quite contrary to the condition that Titurous had found him in. Titurous had found a monster. The knight’s skin was paper thin and rapped tightly about his bones. He had a full head of hair, but was missing both eyes. The lower jawbone he later found hooked around the branch of a tree. The bones of the neck were exposed, and looked as though they had been eaten away by acid. No internal organs, or remnants of internal organs were found. The bones of both legs were shattered. <br>
        A cool breeze shook through the trees of the forest and brought Titurous back to reality. He rubbed his eyes and through down the shovel. It was still early, he would travel some more before he made camp. He had to make it to Freeport before she did, and the thought of sleeping near this cursed grave gave him shivers. He said a few words over the grave, and left. He walked on for many hours, and did not stop till he had reached the prairies on the far side of the dark forest. There he made his camp, and fell asleep.<br>
        Titurous was plagued with nightmares that night. He saw a young knight with a giant sword. The knight walked slowly towards Titurous and when he had gotten within two feet he slowly removed his helmet. His hair was black, his eyes a deep blue, and his skin was fair. “Who are you?” Titurous found himself asking. The knight smiled and then his flesh began to shrink and stretch and shrivel. His eyes sunk back into his head and his hair grew long. He threw his head back and blood poured from tiny cuts all over his neck. Titurous screamed and closed his eyes.<br>
        When he opened his eyes he was standing in a long hall. The walls towered above him and they looked as if they had been carved from solid rock. On either side of him were lined cloaked figured, each one looking down so that he could not see their faces. Even though people surrounded him, he felt a terrible sense of loneliness. The figures around him he could see but at the same time they had no presence. The room was dead silent save a slow dripping noise coming from behind him. He turned and moved forward, obsessed with finding out the source of this noise. As he walked it grew louder and louder. It filled his entire being with its presence. It was drilling into his mind. He found himself looking into a mirror. Blood was dripping from the tip of the middle finger on his right hand. He watched it drip from his finger to the floor, and could see the drops of blood trailing off behind him. He scanned his image in the mirror frantically, trying to discover the source of the blood. He tipped his head back a bit and as he did so blood ran down from his neck over his chest. He reached his right hand up to his neck and found many tiny incisions. His eyes grew wide and he had trouble breathing. As he stared into the mirror his image faded away and he saw the knight once again. An invisible force was tearing him apart. He watched as the knight was thrown around, blood was flying everywhere. Blood splattered on the mirror, obstructing his view. The blood oozed and formed words. The words were in a language that he didn’t speak, and yet he understood what they said. “Les vrais paradis sont les pardis qu’on a perdu.” (The true paradises are the paradises we have lost.). A voice was screaming at him, pleading for help. The voice was the voice of his youngest son.<br>
        Titurous woke with tears in his eyes and a horrible headache. The sun was just peaking above the distant hills. The sky was cloudy and dark. Rain drizzled and a cold wind blew from the west. He shivered as he packed up his gear and hoisted his bag over his shoulder. He walked toward the rising sun, knowing that he would reach Freeport today, and that he would be done with this horrible business. As he walked he thought about his dream. Unlike all other dreams he’s had he remembered this dream very clearly, as if it had actually happened to him. His neck was tender and sore. He hurried on as the storm clouds grew darker and the sun disappeared behind them. He was being assaulted by raindrops but he did not stop to take shelter. He thought about his family. He thought about his son who had called out for him. He didn’t stop for either food or drink.<br>
        When he reached Freeport that evening, the storm had not let up in the slightest. He went directly to the temple of the Holy Knights where he was offered food and dry clothes. After he had regained his strength and dried himself he reported to the council. He informed them of the knight he had found and buried along the way. As he described the condition of the corpse, the council listened carefully and asked him to explain anything that he hadn’t mentioned; they wanted to know every detail. When he had finished they whispered amongst themselves. <br>
        “It is good that you buried him properly. We will have the strange circumstances of his death investigated. Surely you bring some news though, what is the purpose of your journey from Qeynos?”<br>
        “Gladly will I dispense this news to thee, and relieve to you my burden that I have longed to be done with.” Titurous handed a scroll to the council. “This scroll, made with bone, flesh, and blood, was intercepted in the hills surrounding Qeynos. It is a letter to the Heretic Opal who is rumored to live within this city.”<br>
        “Yes, we too have heard that rumor, although we are unable to prove or disprove it.” <br>
        “Perhaps you have also heard the rumor of a Necromancer that plagues Qeynos.”<br>
        “I do not believe I know of any such person.”<br>
        “It is said that her name is Paradise Perdu.” The spokesperson of the council laughed.<br>
        “But surely she is not real. She is a work of fiction, a campfire story, a modern myth. No one alive could possess the kind of power she is rumored to have.”<br>
        “In Qeynos we take the stories a bit more seriously. We have to bury the corpses which makes her a little more real to us. We believe that the letter in your hand was written by her. The blood was fresh when we found it, but the language it is written in hasn’t been spoken for thousands of years.” The spokesperson’s face went white. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing, the implications!<br>
        “Do you have any evidence of this?”<br>
        “The messenger was questioned and tortured. He died rather then reveal who wrote it or to what location he was to deliver it. We had our scholars translate the ancient text and decided it most appropriate to bring it to you as it lays out the plans for an attack upon your city, the Knights in particular. You may translate it yourself, or you may trust the translation that we have given you, either way I wash my hands of the business, knowing that nothing but evil surrounds that scroll.”<br>
        “You have done a good thing brother Titurous. I extend to you all the hospitality that we Knights can offer, please stay as long as you like. I will have a room made up for you.”<br>
        “I humbly thank you sir, but if it is all the same to you, I would like to return to my wife and family as soon as possible.”<br>
        “Good, but you shall leave in the morning, stay in our warm beds one night and let your strength return.”<br>
        “Thank you Milord.” Titurous turned and exited the hall; his whole body filling with joy as his business was done and he could go back to his family.<br>
<br>
        The council of Knights shut the doors of the hall and did not come out until morning. They had discovered that an attack was to take place on the Knights in two days time. They had to prepare. Lead by a ghost or not, the attack was real.<br>
        Any attack upon the city from Qeynos would have to move through the plains surrounding the city. It was there that the Holy Knights prepared their defenses. They built an additional wall surrounding the city and built catapults and other devices of destruction. In two days time, they were ready, for anything. <br>
<br>
<br>
        When the time had come, the mood around the fortress was tense. No one knew exactly what to expect. Most hoped that their show of force and foreknowledge would be enough to dissuade any attack. Surrounding the new walls protecting Freeport were the bravest and best Knights Norrath had to offer. Each one had spent hours polishing their armor, and sharpening their swords. The sunlight glittered off of one particular knight’s armor and cast a beam of light out into the field. If one were to trace that beam one would find it coming to an abrupt end in Paradise’s eye. If it were not such a paradox for light and Paradise to be in harmony, one might think that it was emitting from her eye. Paradise had the expression that a young girl might have at a ball if no one is asking her to dance. She smiled and tried her best not to look shy or embarrassed. She looked up at the sky, and watched as the storm clouds blotted out the sun. Paradise stepped out of the shadows and into plain sight of the enemy. She stood there, motionless, watching the knights struggle to figure out what was going on.<br>
        “What should we do milord? She’s alone.”<br>
        “Trust me young knight, she is not alone.”<br>
        “The archers are standing by, and all posts have checked in as ready for battle.”<br>
        “Good, tell the archers to release their shafts. Kill the girl.”<br>
        “Yes milord.” The knight gave the signal, and the four best archers released their four best arrows and they went whizzing toward the girl. Paradise watched silently, amused by their attempt at her life. She waved her hand and the wooden arrow shafts decayed and deteriorated, sending the arrowheads into the ground in front of her. Paradise started to mouth words, although no sound came from her.<br>
        “You’re all going to die.” The wind kicked up and swept over the field. Each knight guarding the city understood what the strange girl had said, but none had heard it. The girl lifted her right hand slowly. As she did so the earth shook and trembled. This was not a quake however; the dead were rising from the earth. Hundreds of corpses, in varying stages of decay, rose from the ground and marched slowly toward the walls. For every corpse that rose, there was a Necromancer to command it. They were coming out of the shadows now, the entire field had been filled with them, and the knights had not seen them. The war cries of the knights could be heard now as the dead approached the walls. The catapult was hurtling firebombs at the mass of undead as they marched. When they were knocked down, they got back up. When they were set afire, they walked on. When the corpses got to the wall, they were met with arrows and swords. Those corpses that had been on fire pressed their bodies to the wooden walls and soon there was an inferno. <br>
Paradise slit her wrists and let a pool of her blood collect on the ground in front of her. Hey eyes clouded over black and she spoke a few ancient words. She reached down and touched her finger to the pool of blood. The blood shot up in a great pillar into the heavens and the sky quickly turned red. Within a few minutes it was raining the diseased blood. As it fell onto the knights it burned into their skin and spread throughout their bodies, diseasing the organs and rotting the flesh. The corpses kept advancing.<br>
The Holy Knights fought valiantly. But in the end, they were slaughtered. The citizens in the city were fearful and many fled as the outcome of the battle became apparent. However when the last knight was slain, all trace of the Necromancers was gone. They had disappeared as quickly as they had appeared. Some say that they had political reasons for not destroying the city, as within the city they had many supporters. Others say they simply didn’t care about the city; the blood of the knights was enough to satisfy them. But everyone agrees that no one who witnessed the battle will ever be able to forget it. The sky remained red for six days. The corpses made the entire city stink, and those hired to dispose of them soon fell ill and died themselves. Etched in the stone above the true city wall were the words: “Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que’on a perdu.” (The true paradises are the paradises we have lost.) No one in the city ever doubted the existence of Paradise anymore. They had seen what she was capable of. <br>
Later that year, the city’s council received a scroll. It was short and to the point. It read: “Paradise wanted to destroy the city and everyone in it. I persuaded her not to. Now I want my payment for my good deed. Sinfully Yours, Opal.” Quickly after this letter was received, people began to notice a change in the guard of Freeport. The militia was growing increasing more corrupt. Crimes were going unpunished, and the militia committed most of them themselves.<br>
<br>
        It was just about this time of year that Titurous returned to his home in Qeynos. He had heard stories of the battle from other travelers. It had been five months since he had last seen his family, and he beamed with anticipation. He had endured many hardships along the way, only managing to survive by thinking of his family. He burst into the front door of his house with perhaps what was the biggest smile he had ever worn. <br>
No one appeared to be home. He walked through the kitchen and set his bag down. He looked around the empty room slowly. It looked like it hadn’t been used for months. Flies were everywhere and the air was stale. Death was in the air. Titurous panicked and ran upstairs, screaming the names of his wife and children. He found them at the top of the stairs. Each one was naked. Their skin was blue and bloated, as if they had been underwater for a long while. They stared at him with empty eye sockets. His daughter clutched a stone dagger in her stiff hand. They were hanging from the rafter in the ceiling. His wife had a scrap of paper sticking out of her mouth. As he grabbed it he noticed that her lips had been cut off, and most of her teeth were missing. Tears poured from his eyes and dropped on the paper as he read it. “Gone to fight in the battle at Freeport. Bet you can’t guess on which side!!” <br>
Titurous screamed then louder then he had ever screamed before. His heart was broken, his entire life ripped to shreds. He sank to the floor and cried into his hands. Thunder rumbled across the sky and he stopped crying. He looked up at his wife, his son, and his eyes came to rest upon his daughter. He reached out and grabbed her hand in his. Her joints were stiff and her arm would not bend, nor would she let go of the knife. He was forced to break every bone in her hand in order to loosen her grip on the knife. He kissed each corpse once and slit his throat very unceremoniously. As he fell to the ground, lifeless and limp, he realized that the only constant in this world is death, and that no force can defeat it, one can only yield to it and let it take you.<br>
He hit the floor, never to rise again. Paradise giggled to herself in the darkness of her bedchamber. “You served your purpose. Now you may rest.”<br>
