Belana appeared in mid stride and fell to the ground.  Inien walked over and helped her to her feet.<br>
<br>
Belana: “We have to go back.  Cendarien’s in trouble!”<br>
<br>
Inien: “We can’t go back.  He will have to fend for himself for the moment.”<br>
<br>
Belana: “What?”<br>
<br>
Inien: “I can’t just port to that spot Belana.  You know that.  The closest we could go would be the Dreadlands.”<br>
<br>
Belana: “What are you waiting for then, lets go!”<br>
<br>
Inien turned away from her and began to walk away from the spires.<br>
<br>
Belana: “What are you doing?”<br>
<br>
Inien stopped and turned around.  He opened his mouth as if to say anything but he didn’t.  He looked up into the sky through the mighty branches of the trees of the Faydark.  He could sense Belana’s urgency, and he understood it.  The pulsing of the spires echoed in his ears.  A sound only Inien or any other master wizard could here.  Its sound drowned out most of the surrounding noise around him.<br>
<br>
Belana stood there.  She was breathing heavy still from her yelling at Inien.  Her drive to save her husband was to strong for her to make any kind of rational decision.<br>
<br>
Inien: “I’m sorry Belana.”  And with that one phrase Inien disappeared.<br>
<br>
Belana ran forward to catch him but it was to late.  He was gone.  She searched the grounds around her to see if he might have somehow just moved to a different spot.  She called out his name but her only reply was the rustling of the leaves around her.  The sky was beginning to turn to dusk.  Crickets and other nightly creatures were beginning to sing their nocturne of the night.  She could feel her breathing steady, but with every breath she began to lose hope, but anger quickly filled that void.  Belana sat down.  She thumbed the hilts on her daggers nervously and steadily.  Her thoughts were clouded with somehow saving Cendarien but also of running Inien through.  Belana’s anger began to bubble over to the point where rage sat in.  An emotion she rarely used, and she couldn’t bare it.  She screamed at the top of her voice sending some of the animals around her to flee.<br>
<br>
The remaining light slowly disappeared leaving Belana alone.  The thoughts of many ideas passed to quickly through her head for her to act on any of them.<br>
<br>
She fell backwards, letting the long grass absorb her body.  Hiding her from the events that surrounded her.  She only wished she could disappear like Inien  had just done.  Disappearing from the events around her.<br>
<br>
Then a thought hit her.  She cursed herself for not thinking of it sooner.  She had lost Inien’s guidance and Cendarien’s protection, but she hadn’t lost one thing that she had once held most dear to her.<br>
<br>
She picked herself up from the ground and began to walk towards Felwithe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aaeon looked towards the horizon and watched the sun set behind the hills of Qeynos.  She had been on her watch now for almost four hours and without any incident.  Zaboxx or Phelsuma never said a word to her the whole time and she almost wondered if they were still there.  They made no evidence of walking behind her or even being in the same vicinity of her.<br>
<br>
Aaeon whispered: “Zaboxx?”<br>
<br>
There was no reply.<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “Phelsuma, are you guys there?”<br>
<br>
Again, there was no reply.  She moved her hand down towards her sword and grabbed the hilt.  She felt more confident knowing that if foul play was involved she wouldn’t be caught with her guard down.  She was a paladin, a proud and strong warrior.  She gained more strength in thinking of her training.  The skills and exercises she had to learn in order for her to gain this position in the paladin guild.<br>
<br>
The guard tower in Qeynos Hills was just noticeable in the distance.  Her thirst was beginning to creep up on her.  She withdrew her water flask but noticed she had forgot to fill it before she left.  She hadn’t planned on marching over to the tower but she hadn’t planned on having a pair of invisible shadows follow her around, and ignore her on top of it.<br>
<br>
The darkness began to roll across the hills and Aaeon’s sight began to lessen as the darkness passed her by.  She quickly casted her Infravision spell and soon the night became day in her eyes.<br>
<br>
She glanced in the direction of the tower and could see the torches were beginning to be lit one by one around the base.  Aaeon thought back on the first time she actually manned the guard tower in Qeynos Hills and spilled the fluid they dipped the torches into to keep them lit all night.  She had to keep manually wrapping the torches with the cloth they used so that other travelers could see it and come within the safe confines of the tower.  She laughed at herself.<br>
<br>
“What’s so funny?”<br>
<br>
Aaeon jumped: “I thought you left me.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “We did.  There was something Phel and I had to take care of real quick.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “And what was that?”<br>
<br>
Phelsuma: “Don’t worry about it.  Was something very,” Phelsuma searched for a word, “unimportant.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon sensed that they weren’t being honest with her, “What was this unimportant feet then?”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx raised his voice: “It was nothing Aaeon.  It is best you don’t ask again.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon didn’t reply.  She became ever more suspicious of her comrades.<br>
<br>
They had finally made it to the guard tower where two guards were standing in front of the front door.<br>
<br>
Guard: “Hail Aaeon!”<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “Hail.  I come to replenish my water supply.”<br>
<br>
Guard: “It is behind us inside.  Feel free to help yourself young paladin.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “Thank you.”  Aaeon walked between the two guards and inside to the ration of water resting against the wall.  She removed her flask and submerged it into the tub of water.  Aaeon watched her flask fill with water.<br>
<br>
Then a scream shot from behind her.  She turned around to see one of the guards clutching a sword that had been run through his abdomen.  She quickly withdrew her sword and ran forward only to be met by Phelsuma.<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “Out of my way.  Were under attack.”<br>
<br>
Phelsuma: “I know.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx appeared behind Aaeon and bashed the back of Aaeon’s head with his steel gauntlets knocking her to the ground.  Aaeon’s vision became groggy.  Zaboxx reached down and withdrew the long sword that Aaeon had brought with her.<br>
<br>
The other guard appeared from the doorway clutching a wound on his chest.  He withdrew his steel.  Zaboxx stood up with Aaeon’s weapon.  Phelsuma approached the guard.  The guard attempted to strike Phelsuma but his wound had weakened him.  Phelsuma easily countered it and pushed the guard to the ground.  Zaboxx walked over tossing the sword up into the air and grabbing it with the point facing towards the guard.  With a quick stroke the broad side of the blade struck the guard on the head laying him motionless on the ground.  Zaboxx walked over towards Aaeon who was still laying on the ground.<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “It’s a pity.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon mumbled: “What are you doing?”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “You had such good potential Aaeon.  You looked as if you had such great potential.  But, Lord Innorruk deems you a threat.”<br>
<br>
Aaeon: “I don’t understand.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “It’s quite simple really.  We were sent hear to get rid of you.  And that’s what were doing.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx brought the sword down and the scream of metal piercing armor echoed inside the tower.<br>

He looked down at the floor then back towards Phelsuma and motioned her to exit.  The two met at the tower entrance door.  Zaboxx looked back towards the bodies of the three paladin's and left.  A bright flash of light followed and two were gone, absorbed in a mystical portal.<br>
<br>
All three bodies lay in their wake.  The night echoed inside the tower with the regular noises of the hills again.  Then a sound of movement echoed on the floor inside the tower.  The remaining guard who had been knocked unconscious awoke, groggy.<br>
<br>
He looked over at his partner and could see that life had allready left him.  Closing his eyes he glanced over at Aaeon's body.  He crawled towards her, slowly.  The guard removed his gauntlets from his hands exposing his hands to the brisk cold that haunted the tower.  He got side by side with her and placed his hand over her mouth checking for life.  Seconds seemed like days but a sudden cold breath encased his hand.<br>
<br>
Guard: &quot;Hold on Aaeon.  Just a bit longer.&quot;  He picked himself up into a sitting position and glanced over her body to find her mortal wound.  He placed his hands over her chest clotting the wound with both his hands.  &quot;May your faith in Rodcet Nife heal you.&quot;<br>
<br>
A dim blue aura encased his hands.  Blue strands of magic encased Aaeon and slowly fell inside her body through her wound.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Belana found herself at the gates to Felwithe.  She motioned to the two guards outside.  The guards dressed in the golden armor removed their weapons from her path and let her pass through.<br>
<br>
She came to the bridge in the city and looked across a figure across the bridge staring back at her.  The figure slowly walked across the bridge and found his cover lost by the light of the moon up in the sky.  It was Kelwin.<br>
<br>
Belana walked forward and met him.  The both glanced at each other quickly and it was Belana first to break the silence.<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;It has been a long time Kelwin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;Yes, it has.&quot;  He found her clothes dirty and tattered.  &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;I am okay.  It is Cendarien that is in trouble.  We need to get to Kunark to save him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin frowned and shook his head: &quot;I told him this would happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;Belana, you have been, pardon the reference, but rogue from us from some time.  It seems you have had matters greater than what this guild might have to offer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;My needs are not great.  I'm asking that we gather some of the Shadows to come to Kunark to rescue him.  That is indeed in our power.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;No.  You don't understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana stared wild eyed into Kelwin.  Kelwin met her stare with his own sterness.  She could see and allready knew what he was going to tell her before he told her.<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;Don't say you can't help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;With you and Inien both coming and going at will it is hard to keep order amongst the Shadows of the Ebon Moon.  You, took an oath when you became an elder to forgo any dealings outside the Shadows.  It has been more than time for you to deal with the death of your sister.  Your need is requested.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;I don't understand.  We need to save Cendarien and you repeating the pledge I took.  I am not a fool Kelwin.  I swore to you and to the other Shadows that I would carry the burden of the Shadows and fight to keep those that would hurt it at bay.&quot;  Belana could barely keep her temper down, &quot;You speak of my sister as if it would be comparable to loosing a carriage or a home do to an attack or fire.  She is something I can't replace ever.  Bartel's magic couldn't bring her back.  Her faith in this guild was just as great.  She died for me and I can't let that go.  If giving up my eldership to somebody else is what you want then damnit Kelwin ... &quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;Stop!&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana stopped with her rant.  She was breathing heavy and steaming with rage.  Her control was gone.<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;You took the oath and you agreed.  I am not using your sister as a way of getting rid of you or having you hand down your eldership.  This guild means just as much to me as it does to you but I, not you, not Inien, nor anyone in this guild can possibly fathom what I have to do to keep this guild in running order.  I burden a responsibility that weighs upon me greatly and when I ask for simple favors they are never heeded.  I told Cendarien that he would fall into trouble if he tailed you and he did.  I warned him, yet he did not listen.  What is a guild without a leader.  Let me ask you that.  I ask that you come back for a simple meeting and I'm answered with your empty chair.  I am the one that has to explain to everyone if you'll ever be back.  Sorine has asked countless times if you'll be returning and Bartel is still guilt ridden by not being able to bring your sister back to life.  I haven't heard from him since you left.  You see Blackpoint Sorrowblade, we need you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana interrupted: &quot;You need me!  I need you!  I ask you for a simple favor of saving one of our own.  Cendarien is your likeness, a brother to the guild, and my soul mate to myself.  Pardon if he or my sister gives you the impression that there more important the Shadows but believe me, I have longed for the day to return, but these extenuating circumstances are making it impossible for me to do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin and Belana both stood in the center of the bridge.  Their expressions were placid.  Then a smile came across Belana's face.  Kelwin followed.<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;Ha! I can't belive I just yelled at you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;Nor I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;So, now what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelwin: &quot;Well, either we can make peace or we part our separate ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belana: &quot;The answer is obvious.&quot;  <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/29/02 2:04:07 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>349</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Part VI - Lost Hope</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 5/1/02 8:07:24 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> ( In another part of the realm )<br>
<br>
<br>
Zaboxx and Phelsuma appeared out of the portal.  Zaboxx looked around at his surroundings, he yawned.<br>
<br>
Phelsuma: “I take it you need a break from all that destruction you just caused.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “Well, you try killing three paladins and see how peppy you feel.”  Zaboxx scowled at Phelsuma.  He removed his two handed sword from his back and planted it straight into the ground.  He stretched as the burden of the sword was released from his back.  He crouched down and sniffed the air.<br>
<br>
Phelsuma walked over and stood in front of him, “I don’t sense him around us.  When did he say he would meet us.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx stood back up, “He told me to meet him here at this spot at this time.  We were lucky that those paladins were push overs.”  Zaboxx grinned.<br>
<br>
Phelsuma: “Wait!  I feel something.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx: “Where is he coming from?”<br>
<br>
A figure appeared in front of the two.  It was dressed in a long black cloak.  The figure’s face was hidden along with the rest of his body.  The cloak seemed to shroud its whole frame giving its whole body a disguise from what its physical frame looks like.  The figure motioned for the two to stand up.  In the sudden appearance of the mysterious figure Zaboxx and Phelsuma fell to the ground and they both kneeled.<br>
<br>
Zaboxx spoke first, “Hello exalted one.  We have served your bidding and killed the paladin known as Aaeon.  Your deception worked.  She gave us her unsuspecting trust and we used it against her.”<br>
<br>
The figure nodded in approval.<br>
<br>
Phelsuma spoke next, “I have found also where the other two are.  Using the powers you have given me I have found the wizard residing back in his home with the Erudites and I also have located the rogue.  She is in Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The figure nodded in approval once more.  Then he spoke, “What of her husband?”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx answered, “It seems that the ranger has eluded us for the time being.  We will find him, I promise you that.”<br>
<br>
The figure hung its head down in disapproval, and removed its arms showing the off color white of its hands.  A spark suddenly appeared and jumped from one hand to the other forming an arc.  Raising its hands, the figure pointed down at Zaboxx and released the ball of electricity.  Zaboxx recoiled back from his knees.  His body lay on the ground with slight spasm’s vibrating his limbs.  A thin stream of smoke smoldered from his chestplate.<br>
<br>
The figure finally spoke, “I did not recruit you two for failure.  You will do as I say.  You will obey my every command and if I hear that you have failed me again, I will not be as lenient towards you.”  The figure walked up towards Phelsuma and cupped her chin with one of the figures free hands.  Phelsuma could feel the heat that had just been discharged.  She looked up and met the eyes of the figure.  “ I pray Phelsuma, that you and this shadowknight find a way to appease me.  It would be a pity to remove you from this planet.”  The figure let go of her face and turned around facing away from them.  The figure removed his hood releasing its long dark black hair.  Turning around, the figure made it known who he was, “Lord Innorrukk does not take failure well.  I expect on our next encounter that you bring better news.”  Lord Innorrukk disappeared in a ball of dark fire.<br>
<br>
Phelsuma breathed hard.  She looked over at Zaboxx who was laying unconscious still.  Looking up at the sky she caught her breath again and stood up.<br>
<br>
<br>
( In a hut far from civilization )<br>
<br>
“I really don’t get it Muffin?  Why would Belana’s sister be undead?  I can’t seem to figure it out.”  Inien paced in his study.  The books of many pages of Lore were stacked all over the room.  A couple were open on a desk and some on the floor.  His happy imp companion Muffin, was flapping in his footsteps following his every move.  “I can’t believe that Whitepoint would do anything that would harm Belana or myself.  The only way I can see her ever doing something like this is if. . .”  Inien stopped thinking out loud.  A knock at his door stopped him.  He stopped pacing.  “Now who could be knocking at my door.”<br>
<br>
Inien walked over towards the door, “Who is it?”<br>
<br>
“It is I, Phelsuma.”<br>
<br>
Inien thought in his head, “How does she know I’m out here.  No one knows of this place.”  He grabbed the handle to the door and opened it.  His next vision was of a great fire radiating towards him.<br>
<br>
<br>
( Back in Felwithe )<br>
<br>
Kelwin and Belana stood in front of each other.<br>
<br>
“The answer is obvious Kelwin,” Belana answered.<br>
<br>
“And that would be,” Kelwin became placid to absorb the next words Belana would say, but he never heard them.  A sudden pain in his back rang loud in his body.  He felt himself pushed forward by the blow and fell against Belana.  Belana stepped back to catch Kelwin in her arms.  She looked behind him and could see a single arrow that had pierced his lower back.  Belana slowly lowered Kelwin to the ground.  Another arrow shot through the air and stuck into the dirt path just to the left of Belana.<br>
<br>
Kelwin gasped in pain, “Get, get out of here.”<br>
<br>
“That’s impossible,” Belana returned.<br>
<br>
Kelwin grimaced in pain as he tried to grab the shaft of the arrow.  Belana looked in the direction of where the second arrow came from and could see a dark figure on top of a building with a bow drawn up again.  Belana pushed Kelwin out of the way as she dived to her right.  The arrow pierced the ground where they had just sat.  Kelwin rolled over onto the arrow breaking the shaft in half.  The arrow dug itself deeper into his body.<br>
<br>
“Go!  Leave me,” Kelwin screamed.<br>
<br>
A guard fully armed in plate armor with spear and shield drawn saw Kelwin on the ground and began to run towards the two.  He arrived at the spot and looked down at Kelwin and Belana.  He opened his mouth to speak but no words were spoken.  An arrow sung out again and struck the guard between the chestplate and his helmet sending him the ground.<br>
<br>
Belana danced to her feet and grabbed the shield that the dead guard had been carrying.  She crawled over quickly and shielded Kelwin from their attacker.<br>
<br>
“You don’t listen very well do you?” Kelwin tried to hide the pain but it was becoming impossible.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what it is with you elves.  Your always willing to die for the greater cause,” Belana felt the impact of another arrow hit the shield and reflect off.  “While I’m willing to live just to see tomorrow.”  Belana smiled down at Kelwin.<br>
<br>
“If that was a joke, that was a poor one,” Kelwin replied.<br>
<br>
Belana felt another arrow jolt the shield.  She was beginning to wonder if their assailant would ever come down and face them in person.  Another arrow struck the shield sending a shutter through Belana’s body.<br>
<br>
Their assailant finally walked down from the roof.  It threw the bow to the ground below and jumped down to ground level.  Belana peeked out and could see their attacker dressed in full plate, but it wasn’t like most.  It was made of a darker metal.  A metal that she had seen many times, the metal of a full suit of Dark Elven armor.<br>
<br>
“Blackpoint!  Come out from behind that shield!”<br>
<br>
Belana looked down at Kelwin who had passed out from the pain of the arrow.  She checked his breathing quickly and could feel shallow breaths.  She poked her head out once more and could see the figure drawing its weapon.  A single edged sword.   A sword she had seen many times.  She stood up from behind the mighty kite shield and revealed herself.<br>
<br>
She pulled her trusty daggers from inside her boots and walked forward towards her assailant.  Belana recognized who it was.<br>
<br>
“There, that’s a good girl.  Come, let us see who the better of us is at last.”<br>
<br>
Belana stopped, both of her blades were drawn, “Zaboxx, I have no idea what your doing but I can’t stand for this.”<br>
<br>
Zaboxx answered, “Its okay Blackpoint, you won’t be standing for much longer.”<br>
