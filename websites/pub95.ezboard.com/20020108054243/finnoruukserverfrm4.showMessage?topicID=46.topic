Booking missing?</span><hr size=1> Steffin -- ever tried to organize a planar event?  Ever done it without a 50+ person guild involved?<br>
<br>
It's a lot of work.<br>
<br>
Having a summit is only work for the people who try to organize it.  You don't have to be involved in the process if you don't want to be.<br>
<br>
Beamish -- I'm tired of you.  I'm tired of raidmastergeneral.  I'm tired of a vocal minority telling the rest of us how great life would be if we did something we clearly don't want to do.  I'm tired of people who just don't get it.  I'm tired of people who insist on being part of the problem instead of trying to find a solution that works for everyone.<br>
<br>
I understand why people say, &quot;if there were no summit, you wouldn't get poached.&quot;  However, if there were no summit, I wouldn't get poached because I couldn't go to the planes at all.<br>
<br>
Until you have tried organizing planar raids using the resources that most of us have, you don't know what it's like.  I know how hard it is to get the right resources the way things are now.  It'll be a LOT harder in a FFA system, and I am thoroughly opposed to one.<br>
<br>
From what I have seen, that's the majority opinion.<br>
<br>
So why don't you think about ways that we can work out a system that works for everyone, instead of just telling us how horrible the world is?<br>
<br>
If that's all you can do, yes, I have no respect for you.  And I don't consider it an insult to speak the truth.<br>

I honestly do not think my small guild is best served by following the Summit and I have never thought it was really fair to big guilds.<br>
<br>
However, I have worked exhaustively to try to get it going.  I have pushed, shoved, encouraged and demanded a date be set...all to no avail.  I have warned that delaying would lead to more guilds giving up in frustration at the delay.  This is happening now.  I do not belive the Defient will be the only guild to join NA &amp; NK in abandoning the Summit...especially since there is no evidence that there will ever be another meeting scheduled.<br>

Yes Wolfy, you have only had the ball for about 2 weeks.  I understand you have been busy, but what have you actually done to advance the Summit in that time?<br>
<br>
You can say all you want that the majority wants the Summit, but this is not what I see.  I guess we talk to different people.  I personnally would love to see a Summit be put in place that will work for everyone.  Unfortunately, from where I am sitting, I do not see either extreme willing to make a real compromise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubeamishwilly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BeamishWilly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#778899>(10/3/01 9:09:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What happened?

Yes people DO have to follow the laws.  If they choose not to, the punishment is VERY real.  The faux punishment by breaking the summit doesn't concern anyone really.<br>
<br>
Wolfy..<br>
<br>
You are fighting very hard for this because you see the possibility that you won't make it to the planes again.  You keep talking about not being part of the solution.  You also keep talking about all these people who want a summit.  I have talked to in game, as well as read in this posts, alot of support for FFA.<br>
<br>
You say that you are tired of being told to do something you don't want to do.  How do you think WE feel?  Being told that it's pretty much going to be your way or no way.<br>
<br>
I am not saying how bad it is.  You have your opionion and we ave ours.  You, and you alone are one of the biggest voices against FFA.  <br>
<br>
You are tired of people arguing for FFA.  Well I am tired of people arguing over making another summit.<br>

Booking missing?</span><hr size=1> Wolfpaw - I have planned/run many raids.  That is why I don't want a summit.  Nothing like taking 20 hours to plan an 8 hour raid to zone up to an empty plane.  Trust me, that sucks.  I have planned two raids where this has happened.<br>
<br>
Being poached is bad enough, but not being able to go again for another month just adds to the frustration.  With no summit I could reschedule for the next day or the day after that.  There is no way to keep the same groups, times, etc if the next raid is a month off.<br>
<br>
BUT, most important, if the zones are FIF/FFA I won't have the same expectations.  If it is taken it will be /shrug and do something else (just like PoS, ToV, etc).  I wont have to feel the emotional drain that comes from being poached.<br>
<br>
In short, I think the summit detracts from the fun of the game.  That in a nut shell is why I don't like it.<br>
<br>
As for a vocal minority not wanting the summit, I have to disagree.  There were a few polls on the old boards that showed the opposite.  The question whether or not PoF/PoH should even be covered by a summit was ommitted from the summit pole.  <br>
<br>
Legend's official position is that we want to see all the planes go FFA/FIF.  Understand, we are not out to poach.  We will not enter the planes except under our own bookings.  We just think the summit is a waste of time, unless 100% of the guilds follow it, and we all know that won't happen.<br>

So Steffin, your problem isn't in having a schedule, it's in being poached.  So why not work for a solution where poaching is less likely?<br>

Booking missing?</span><hr size=1> Wolfpaw, just let me caviot this by saying that I take none of this personally.  I think there are very good (and passionate) arguements on both sides. <br>

The way I see it there are only 2 solutions that will stop poaching.<br>
<br>
1.  Convince VI that they should inforce the Summit.  As EQ's player base starts leaving maybe they (VI) will agree to do this in hopes of keeping the server happy/alive.  It might be a long shot but it can't hurt to ask, because until someone gets banned you will not see the end of poaching.<br>
<br>
2.  Go completely FFA/FIF.  No summit = no poaching.<br>
<br>
The problem is that the planes are all about epic items.  The problem with epic quests is that they make some people go crazy.  Crazy people do crazy things.  Things they might not otherwise do.<br>
<br>
What really sucks is that we have to have these debates in the first place.  I have played (make that lived) this game for the last two years.  I think I will go play Battletech3025 now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table border="0" width="111">
