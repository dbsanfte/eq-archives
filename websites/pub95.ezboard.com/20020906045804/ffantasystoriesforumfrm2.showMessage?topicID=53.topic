There was a slight breeze in the air which seemed to put everyone in a jolly mood , ( little did we know it would carry the stench of battle ) and when that jolly mood came around so did duty shifts. My squad was sent to take over for a other squad from the 21st company. Two weeks ago I didn't know anyone in my squad other then my Sergeant and my good buddy Bero well now I knew the other seven. There was Tagnus the dwarf who had been to the Barbarians home of Halas , he said he would live there forever were it not for the temperature being soo frequently below zero.<br><br>Next Up was Vash the quite Tough guy that had a aura of strength and power around him , This guy had already fought Orcs twice for the elves when he was ordered to do so by King Kazon. He had been to freeport , Rivervale , Highkeep , Kelethin and Felwithe.<br><br>Then there was Somli, he was huge even for a dwarf, he must have been 5 , 2 and nearly 200 pounds. He says he comes from a big family , Let me tell you he ain't shitting ya , his mom is the smallest person their and I can barely look her in the eye , ( and i thought I was a big boy at 4 , 9 175 pounds ).<br><br>Soli is my kinda crazy guy , he to is a veteran and rumor has it he killed 21 orcs when him and his previous squad were nearly overrun.<br><br>Horin is a Kingsman , True to his king to the end , not even the end , probably past the end. Don't get me wrong every dwarf loves there King but this guy was really patriotic. He has a painted picture of the Kings coat of arms on his helmet.<br><br>Heres Sagnus , he my as well be our supply officer cause this guy can get anything , he has even gotten our whole platoon each a case of dwarven ale!<br><br>Anyway we were heading to the post about three miles away from the Brigades main camp area. When we got there we were horrified a whole squad had been slaughtered there were four men tied upside down by their entrails. Big Somli retched up his morning breakfast , which you could tell consisted of bacon and eggs.<br><br>&quot; Sarge , theres more in their barracks &quot; yelled Vash<br><br>&quot; Take Tumpy Soli and Horin and get them cleaned up, I'm not leaving them for the carrion eaters &quot; Bellowed Sergeant Halig<br><br>The other four of my kinsmen had been ripped apart and thrown around is if they were light as a feather. Sangnus fell and screamed a piercing scream. When we got there he had fallen in the slippery blood and gore face first but thats not what did it, Sangnus found a head with a Look of horror on its face , and there was a eyeball hanging out of the socket.<br><br>We had gathered the men from the inside and layed them down outside and started to cut down the hung bodies when we heard a low whisper.<br><br>&quot; Kill meeee , * struggling to inhale * please &quot; SARGE WE GOT A LIVE ONE someone said &quot; Ogres , so many huge camp , must be 40,000 at least &quot; whispered the soon to be corpse. By now I was on the ground after cutting him loose , I was cupping his face in my hands when he reached into a pocket somewhere on him I cannot recall, and pressed a locket into my hands , it was silver with a diamond head that had been cut in half to create a totally diamond locket with a silver chain. &quot; My wife.... give her it...it...... tell kids... bbe...bwave and stong....den tell wife and kids I love them very mich. The Soldier had the glaze of death on his eyes and before I died I gave him his last rights. May the Holy father Embrace you and may you bathe in his radiance and glory.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=strabo>Strabo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/02 12:20:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Irontoe Brigade Prt3</span><hr size=1> nice...i been readin ur posts, and they're pretty good. c;ean up the grammer and punctuation, if you can, and it'll be better. what i mean is:in some places i saw there needed to be a comma or a period, but there wasnt one. its no big deal, tho. keep it up, General. <br>____________________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&quot;Good work?&quot; Someone asked.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Aye, good work,&quot; another answered.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Good work, indeed, my friends!&quot; I said in a voice a little louder than I intended...[(What's the moral of this little dialogue?
