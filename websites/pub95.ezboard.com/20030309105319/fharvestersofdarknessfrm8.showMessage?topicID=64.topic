The Sleep of madness.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Vazelle walked alone through ruined streets, a wind of her own creation, howled at her back, the wind of a thousand screams of terror.  She struggled to gather her thoughts, thoughts crippled at times by the taint of her madness, by the blessings of her lord.<br>
<br>
He had been so close, almost within her grasp.  She had watched as he brought the terror of the Faceless to the kobold clans, observed with maddening laughter as their very king fell at his feet.  The gates of Paineel had opened for him, and within the city, she knew that he could never resist her, could never escape her touch.<br>
<br>
But he had not entered the walls, he had resisted, perhaps unknowingly, but he had resisted.  And now, he was far from her, walking the streets paved on the lunar surface.  &quot;No matter,&quot; she thought as she walked with the wind, &quot;he will be mine soon enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wind changed itself, the mindless screams forming a coherant voice, a howling whisper that echoed all around her.<br>
<br>
&quot;He is not yours to have....&quot; spoke the wind, in the screams of tortured souls.<br>
<br>
&quot;But of course he is, he has felt the touch of madness.&quot; She replied to the wind, slightly amused at this new facet of her insanity.<br>
<br>
The wind, in the fearful whine of the wrongly accused, whispered back.  &quot;The touch of madness?  Yes, but the madness that grips him now is not of your doing.  You have lost him...&quot;<br>
<br>
No longer amused, a brief caress of fear washed over her.  &quot;We shall see about that.  He is mine.  Whether he goes mad at my hand, or at the hand of another, his mind will be given to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The answer came in the pitiful voice of a thousand abused children, cowering in closets, hiding from the horrors they knew were to come.  &quot;His madness will keep him sane...&quot;<br>
<br>
Vazelle dropped to her knees as the wind ceased, the voice echoing off every surface, gaining volume with every reflection, ringing endlessly in her ears, she shot her hands to her head, covering them, attempting to stop the pain that it carried, the fear that it visited upon her, as tears welled in her deranged eyes. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vazelle laughed.<br>
<br>
Ssakas dreamed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas slowly got to his feet, eyes widening, observing his surroundings.  He was no longer in the Echo Caverns, the walls here were bearing in, claustrphobic.  He looked down at his chest, scales covered only in a white sleeping tunic, dyed crimson from the collar.  His hand went to his neck, where blood trickled from two small wounds.  He smiled at the feel of the blood, his mind conjuring memories of the caverns, of the rock, of comfort, of warmth.<br>
<br>
His thoughts were broken by a loud &quot;Froaaakk.&quot;  A froglok stood infront of him, impatiently tapping his foot.  With no means of defense, Ssakas quickly looked around, searching for a means of escape, but he found only more frogs.<br>
<br>
The one in front of him did a backflip, and then spoke in a deep throaty voice.  &quot;Come on, no time to waste, they have been waiting for you all evening, and you know how it is when the two of them get together it's a wonder they haven't already killed each other we really try to keep them apart but....Froaaakkk.  Follow me, come now, follow.&quot;<br>
<br>
The froglok turned then and hopped away.  Ssakas stood motionless until he felt the point of a spear at his back.   A voice behind him croaked long and deep.  &quot;he said, follow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Through the maze like halls he ran, struggling to keep up with the figure hopping in front of him.  Confusion mixed with fear held him tightly in its arms.  They entered a large room that appeared to be a pub, empty excepting two frogloks engaged in a heated discussion seated at the bar.  <br>
<br>
A long throaty croak alerted the two to their presence, and then Ssakas' guide turned and hopped away.  They turned and faced him, eyes drinking in the sight of the Iksar, hand wrapped lightly in gauze, blood dripping from twin wounds on his neck, tunic flowering in crimson.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have kept us waiting, Ssakas. Now come, sit and have a drink with us.  We have much to talk about,&quot;  one of the frogloks said, his voice filled with hopes and dreams.<br>
<br>
&quot;A drink with followers of the Liebringer?  You delude yourself, fool.  We have nothing to talk about or to drink to, other than your death,&quot; hissed Ssakas.<br>
<br>
The other frog spoke with a voice that dripped with the cold truth of wishes unfullfilled, desires never realised.  &quot;I told you that is what he would say.&quot; And then to Ssakas, &quot;And although indeed my friend here does delude himself, much too often for my tastes, you should watch who you call a fool.  Now come and drink with us, for if you have not already realised it, you are dreaming, and for now, we mean you no harm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm dreaming?&quot;  The realisation hit him hard, and he cautiously approached the bar, taking a seat a stool between the two frogloks.  A goblet of pepper-wine sat there, untouched before him.<br>
<br>
The first voice spoke warmly, &quot;There, that's better.  Now, drink, it will bring you warmth, the warmth that you seek so diligently....&quot;<br>
<br>
The second voice coldly cut it off, &quot;The warmth you will never find.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't you be quiet for one second?  Ignore him for now, Ssakas.  He has no vision.  It is hard to believe we are related...Now, allow me to introduce myself.  My true name is not yours to know, but you may call me the Idealist.  My brother beside you, you will know him as the pessimis..&quot;<br>
<br>
The cold voice cut him off curtly, correcting, &quot;The realist, thank you.  Always with your head in the clouds.  Perhaps when he called you a fool, Ssakas spoke more truth than you would care to admit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas' head was swimming, the realisation of the dream and now the endless bickering of the frogs.  He shook his head slowly from side to side.<br>
<br>
&quot;So I'm dreaming...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes, we've already covered that.&quot; spoke the realist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then, if I'm dreaming,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which you are..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then neither of you are real.  You are dream things I have somehow created....None of this is...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, it is real enough.&quot; the Idealist said, &quot;we exist, as certainly as you yourself exist, both in your dream, and out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For once I agree with him.  Although here in this world, we are not our actual selves.  We are rather..&quot;  said the Realist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Constructs.  Symbols.  We are allegorical, emblematic, figurative, tokens of the two factions battling valiantly inside you, we are...&quot; the Idealist said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grossly extreme parodies of ourselves, is what my wordy brother is trying to say.  Just ignore him, as I always do, and listen to me.  Listen to the cold hard truth.&quot;  The Realist paused, waiting for his brothers interruption, and when it did not come, continued.  &quot;What you seek you will never find.  You will quest for it, foolishly, hopelessly, until the scent of it, so close, almost within your reach, almost realised, yet never to be had, drives you insane.  It may take years, or it may take mere days.  But your fate is sealed.  And deep inside you know it to be true.  You are an outcast.  Your own race wants you dead.  They call you traitor, and that you are.  And now, blinded by what you believe to be the truth,&quot; the realist paused, watching with some satisfaction as his words drove Ssakas' gaze to the floor.  &quot;And now, you further delude yourself that you can taste the fruit of Erollisi?  That you can find love?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Realist had miscalculated.  Ssakas lifted his gaze until it met the frogloks, his cold black eyes burning deep into the Realist's mind.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Love?&quot;  Ssakas began to laugh.  &quot;You think I quest for love?  How ironic, the Realist himself is deluded.  I am a childer of Fear, I am a Cazicite.  I have been taught the pleasures of War, and I have found the taste of hatred to be satisfying, but love?  The rotten fruit of the sister whore, who spread herself wide for her brother the deceiver?  You are the fool!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Idealist, clearly taken aback, interrupted him softly.  &quot;Yes..Yes he is a fool, but must you speak of my lord that way?  Listen.  Forget my brother.  Forget my god.  You do not seek love, although...I wish that you did.  Love is...the foundation, the makings of hopes and dreams.  And it is beautiful.  But you seek warmth, comfort, acceptance.  You hope that one day, you will prove the truth to your race, that they will honor you, join with you as ...Fear overtakes the world.&quot;  The Idealist shuddered slightly.  &quot;That they will know their mistakes, that your rebellion will be vindicated.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But it never will be.  Even you know that, deep inside, and it tears at your dark soul.  Whether you speak truth or lies, the drones of the Empire will always count you among their enemies.  You will die, cold and alone, your final death will come at their hands.  It is your destiny.&quot;  The Realist said softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Destinys can be changed, however.&quot;  The Idealist said forcefully, glaring at his brother.  &quot;It is up to the one they have been written for.  Your desires are within your reach.  You have found acceptance with the Harvesters.  You have found the comfort of stone.  You have felt the warmth of the blood kiss.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And still you will die, cold and ....&quot; The realists words were quickly cut off.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will die, for it will be the fate of us all.  But the circumstances of it are still up to you.  Do not let go of your dreams, your desires.  Reach for them.  Strive for them.  Do not give up.&quot;  The Idealist stood up then.  &quot;I wish I had more time to talk to you.  You must hold on.  Vindication by the Empire may be but a pipe dream.  But all your other wishes can be fulfilled.  Drink from the cup of warmth.  Let its heat spread through you.  Now my presence is required else where.  Do not forget my words.&quot;  With that, the Idealist hopped from the room.  <br>
<br>
Ssakas and the Realist sat for hour long moments in an uncomfortable silence.  Ssakas' hand gripped the goblet in front of him tightly.  The cup of warmth.  The Realist's cold voice broke the silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can drink from it until you drown in it, and it will never bring you warmth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas ignored the voice, and stared deep into the cup, into the reflection of his own dark eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know you are going insane, don't you?&quot;  The voice of the Realist croaked.  &quot;It really is true.  I do not lie.  Madness has gripped you, and it will not let go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas sat motionless.  His mind tripped over each thread of the conversation, each throaty word echoing in his head.  Was he going mad?  He shook his head quickly, as if attempting to dislodge a thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your brother, the Idealist.  He left, so why do you still torment me?  Why do you not also leave?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He had a....prior engagement, shall we say.  I will be with you 'til you awaken, and even then I will haunt your thoughts.  No, Ssakas.  You will never be rid of me.&quot;  The froglok contorted his face into a mockery of a grin.  &quot;Come.  Follow me, I have something to show you.  It should be done by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Realist hopped off of the barstool, and then out of the room.  Ssakas hesitated for a moment, and then followed behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we going now?&quot; Ssakas said inquisitively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just down this hall a bit, and then to the left.  We are going to see my brother, one last time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Idealist?  He said that his presence was required elsewhere.  Why do we..&quot;<br>
<br>
The hideious grin returned to the Realists face as he turned towards Ssakas.  &quot;He went to die, Ssakas.  He went to die of your own hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
From the end of the hall, Ssakas could hear the sounds of battle being waged, violently, visciously.  And then the sound ceased.  He ran forward, passing the Realist, turned the corner and recoiled in horror at the sight before him.<br>
<br>
Ssakas stood wounded, in full armor, blood covered mace in his hand, shield strapped to his wrist.  The Idealist laid on the stairs, motionless, skull crushed, the blood of life pouring from his shattered head.  On the ground, at Ssakas' feet, she rested, lifeless, her blood pouring from her, soaking her robes, blossoming across the dusty earth.  His mace dropped from his hand, as simultanously, both visions of Ssakas fell to their knees, hands covering their face, tears hidden.  The Realist began to laugh behind him, a strange throaty laugh, a laugh touched by madness, a laugh that, if not for his state of mind, would have been all too familiar to Ssakas.<br>
<br>
He looked upwards, him and his twin, for they were indeed the same entity.  In their throats a rumble began, a long drawn out roar, filled with lose, filled with pain, the two voices became one mournful bellow, echoing through out the halls and passageways of Guk.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Mordrae!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
He snapped awake on the stone, the name still echoing off the high walls of the cavern, in a familiar voice.  He had screamed in his sleep.  He looked down, out over the tents pitched through out the cavern, at those who stood in the camp, searching for the source of the voice, location hidden by the echos from which this place took it's name.<br>
<br>
Ssakas gathered himself, cringing from the pain in his left hand.  He looked at the gauze covering it, and slowly began to remember how he had come to awaken here, away from his bed at the Hall.  And as the memories returned, the dream left his mind, now just broken wisps of thought, never to form a coherant whole.  <br>
<br>
He walked slowly back to Harvester Hall, his fingers feeling the dried and crusted blood on his neck.  Paineel would have to wait, he thought to himself.  Two snippets, two glimpes remained from his dream, and his mind locked onto them, turned them over and over, trying to make sense out of the insanity.<br>
<br>
He knew that laugh, that maddening laugh.<br>
<br>
And for some reason, for a purpose he could not pin down, he knew, deep inside, that the Realist had to die.<br>
<br>
