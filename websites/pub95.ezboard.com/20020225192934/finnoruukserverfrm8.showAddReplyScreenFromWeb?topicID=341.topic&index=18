I know you guy's did kinda reform later as RW  but I had already left the first time as had most of the members you can ask quirk or kaginos or  zatharas even if I was in but your kinda stupid if you dont member me. <br>
I guess all those drugs you take  that make you think your better then everyone else have finaly caught up with you  /shrugs I joined cause geuuber wanted me to. <br>

<br>
&quot;The gear belongs to the person that spent the hours to get it regardless if it was a guild raid or not peopls make upa guild not just you.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I suppose that means if you are ML on a Planes Raid, or SG Raid, or wherever, that everything looted belongs to you?  I hope people read that and never ever let you ML in a party, because that means if you loot it, it's yours.  It sounds to me like this account was used to hold a bunch of gear for the Guild, I think it's pretty crappy to tell a Guild you will hold it's gear, what would have been more honest would have been to say &quot;Hey, I wouldn't mind taking everything you guys have been working for for myself&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kaurik>Kaurik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/20/02 2:17:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heh</span><hr size=1> once again Orphius opens his mouth and displays his ignorance.<br>
<br>
here's what happened since it's being dragged out , i know nobody but those involved care but whatever , it got brought up here so here we finish it.<br>
<br>
we were in ToV with FoH.  FoH brought 12oN as guests.  it was a mutual thing that DoW/FoH were doing it together and we had no idea 12oN was going to be there.  we said we'd play by FoH rules and random on everything that dropped but we didnt know the 5 12oN with an average of level 30 were going to be there to win the only 2 plate bps and the only silk robe to drop.  it was still pretty early in velious when that @#%$ wasnt on everyone and their twink.<br>
<br>
enter 12oN <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> dumb</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> warrior to NToV.....<br>
<br>
Belric asked Felonian to drag Ghalaan's (i think this was the Ogre Warrior's name) corpse from WToV.  anyone hunting in HoT is going to be ally to CoV so we were all laughing at the fact that dumbshit was dead in WToV.  turns out he trained the corpse camper NToV wyvern to WToV.  anyway Felonian is trying to drag Ghalaan's corpse and Belric and some FoH cleric are close by.  Belric gets too close and the wyvern aggros and kills him.  i defend my guild like a dragon watches it's nest , @#%$ up and you die.  anyway , Belric proceeds to bitch at Felonian because Belric is a stupid @#%$ , so being the naturally mature nice person i am i told Belric to go eat a @#%$.  Belric didnt like this and asked me to leave.  i said &quot;sure thing @#%$ sucker~!&quot;  &quot;/gu we're leaving&quot;<br>
<br>
Belric asked Baaz to stay and help them CR from under the corpse camping wyvern , which was pointless seeing how it was a corpse camper and he was going to have to summon corpse 5 hours later anyway.  Baaz thought since he'd won a leather bracer he owed FoH.  there were like 20+ DoW in the zone and about as many FoH.  we'd all put in the same effort and took our randoms with everyone else.  i thought this was horse @#%$ and he was turning his back on his guild because he wanted ToV loot.  being as pissed as i was and having said we were leaving i explained to Baaz why it was pointless for him to stay and that we needed him in PoG.  he refused to leave.  i told him if he didnt leave he was to never ask the guild with help on anything again (my maturity kicking in again) so Baaz got pissed and /guildremoved.  i was under the impression that helping the guild that got him his epic and basically full thurg armor (monk armor is ass anyway , you get it for the procs not the stats) he at least owed it to us by his own reasoning to leave when we left because nobody @#%$ at my gimps but me , which i had already explained to Belric once before on this very same raid.<br>
<br>
enter Quirk...<br>
<br>
Quirk is the one that set this up with FoH and they'd planned to be there til i think like 10 PM.  that's what Quirk said when he logged on.  anyway when he got on we were in PoG and i was like &quot;gnome get to PoG need another tank here&quot; cuz Zath has to log at 10 PM (hahahah) and he's like &quot;what?  @#%$ that we're supposed to be in ToV.  FoH is still here , why are we in PoG?&quot;  i explained the story and he was like &quot;dude i plan on being here til at least 10 PM&quot; and i was like &quot;hey @#%$ for brains it's 11 PM now&quot; (me and gnome live in the same time zone) to which he replied &quot;they asked you to leave but said the rest of DoW can stay...&quot;<br>
<br>
You tell the guild, &quot;you have 10 minutes to be in Plane of Growth.&quot;<br>
Quirk tells the guild, &quot;i'm not leaving&quot;<br>
<br>
then me and Luldaas/Sonice and Quirk got into it.<br>
<br>
i quit the guild.  yes grown men cry.  i cried like a baby for the first time in a LONG while when Golen /guildinvited me and /pleaded and i hit &quot;no&quot; , it made me feel like @#%$.  (yeah even i got feelings , alert the media)  we sat in PoG for a good 40 minutes without killing anything but the Protectors that spawned.  i finally accept guild invite and asked Quirk and Luldaas to leave the guild if they werent going to come back to PoG.  they were invited to FoH within the minute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
as pathetic as it sounds i love this guild , hell some days it seems it's the only reason for me to wake up.  go ahead , laugh , judge me , flame away but nothing will ever make me quit enjoying leading my guild into whatever battle the new day brings and nobody will ever take what we have here away , nobody.  i dont care how many times we die to moss snakes or how many stupid flame wars we get into in guild chat , we're still better than you because we have pride in who we are and there's a lot of guilds on this server that cant say 100% of their members are proud to be in their guild.  i can honestly say that.  who'd stay with a guild with a rep as bad as ours through , @#%$ , 4 disbandings now? unless they loved being here as much as me and unless they had full faith in me to get us to where we want to go and unless they had pride in who they were?  that means something to me , that's why i log on.  so to ever say i would drive away members to make my guild go to @#%$ is like saying i'd cut my own <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &lt;insert something round here&gt;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> off.  i love playing with my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &lt;insert something round here&gt;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> too much to ever get rid of them.  =(<br>

<br>
I never held any of the gems or any of the gear just to clarify There is a diff when being a ML an being awarded a drop in PoH the guildleader/officers feel that you have put enough time an work into the guild to get it or its gonna rot an you get it by default. /shrugs <br>
<br>
 an when a  guild breaks up as RW/dow has done many times they do not have the right to demand the gear people got in that guild be given back each time they reform. That it what I meant. <br>
<br>
next time I'll try to be more clear. But the  this is about gems not gear this rant is about peeps thinking paghk made off with tons of gems not gear. I just got tired of seeing the one nice stand up guy that I had met in RW geting drug through the dirt.<br>
The rest was just me going off the deep end cause I was angry an I prob should not have posted it but  to late now eh ?<br>

<br>
What he's saying, Ugle, is basically this, in a somewhat cleaned up fashion:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
When Dead of Winter went on raids and the various members worked hard on those raids and won items, those items won belong to those members who won them and not to you, Kaurik.  A guild is made up of many individuals, it's not just one man show like you make it out to be.  You don't own the loot, the people that won it own it and it's not yours to take back or redistribute at your whim.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I saw nothing in there that would lead me to believe he was talking about the person that actually looted foo item, rather, the final recipient of that item is the owner, not the guild.<br>
<br>
Frankly, this is a policy I agree with.  I feel that if a member of a guild wins something on a raid, regardless of it being droppable or not, it belongs to that member to do with as they see fit.  Allow me to qualify that by saying that I do not feel one should be eligible to win an item they do not intend to use so when I say &quot;as they see fit&quot; I mean to use that item until they are able to upgrade it.  And once that upgrade is obtained, the person should be free to give it to the guild, twink with it, sell it, hand it to the first random newbie they see, or let it rot in their bank.<br>
<br>
My feelings in this matter are based in the assumption that the members of the guild on a given raid aren't there to farm loot for profit or to get that one uber item to then /guildremove.  If loyal members are the norm, then there should be no hard feelings when one leaves the guild and takes all their loot with them.  They worked just as hard, with the guild, to earn it as you did your loot. <p>Dalynia Aziz<br>

You tell a good story Kaurik, it certainly made me laugh.  I love how you try to make everyone who isnt on your side of the coin seem to be an ass.  Your nothing but a bully Kaurik, well.. you pretend to be a bully anyway. <p><p><TABLE STYLE=filter:GLOW(color="red",strength=#+9)><FONT COLOR="white">The Unfetered One, a lone crusader in a dangerous world...

<br>
the gems on Tewen werent camped by one person or one group of people , Tewen was a mule because he could port and have guild gems where we needed them in like 5 minutes tops and so all gems anyone got were given to Tewen.  Tewen is NOT Paghk's character.  Tewen is Tewen(in game name) / Sergio's(RL name) character.  Tewen quit the game for this chick he fell in love with and wasnt going to play anymore but he kept the account paid for in case he ever wanted to come back.  with it in mind that he might not be back for a long ass time he gave me the PW and i gave it to people that had my PW at the time too , so i knew they were stand up people.  how Paghk got the info i have no clue because i never gave it to him.  oh and DoW never was a democracy when i was leader.  i said who got what loot and who got what gems and when.  not Paghk.  not Swall.  not Devis.  not Zigmund.  not anyone but me.  THIS WAS TO INSPIRE ASS KISSING FROM ZATHARAS~!  actually it was to inspire participation in guild events because i knew i wasnt going to do anything stupid like start passing out gems to people that never went on raids or people that werent ready to turn in quest armor yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: blah post got cut short again.<br>
<br>
this brings me back to one of my last points here , this is guild business and shouldnt have been aired in public , which Paghk obviously didnt understand at the time he hit &quot;Post New Topic&quot; but hey we all @#%$ up some time or another right? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kaurik>Kaurik</A> at: 1/23/02 3:25:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uchargron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chargron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://chargron.freeservers.com/images/greenbayflag2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/23/02 3:44:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://chargron.freeservers.com/images/monica[1].jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heh</span><hr size=1> yea , I was wondering, AGAIN, PLEASE TELL ME.  Why are we discussing how we choose to distribute items within our guild in a public forum?  Its common knowledge in Dead of Winter that 1. We don't random 2. Fatty (Kaurik) calls out who gets what 3. If you have item &quot;x&quot; and receive item &quot;y&quot; to replace it, then &quot;usually&quot; item &quot;x&quot; should be handed to another guild member who could use it. 4. Gems won at guild events belong to THE GUILD...NOT INDIVIDUALS. 5. MAKE FUN OF ZATHAN00B.<br>
The guilds loot policy is well known by its members, and generally supported.  Thanks for the outside concern, but this wasn't a topic IMHO that should have been pursued here. <p>Chargron <BR>
