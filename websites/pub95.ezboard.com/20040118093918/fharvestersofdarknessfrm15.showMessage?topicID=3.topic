<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The door opened to reveal a hunched figure, covered in a long flowing dark robe. The hood was so deep, that not even the figures facial features could be seen. The robe was glistening with moisture, the rain having fully soaked the material. The figure floated in through the doorway with barely a ripple of movement showing. The patrons near the door felt an un-natural wave of cold wash over them as the figure passed. A scullery maid looked to the floor with a frown expecting to see a trail of water from the soaking robes, but instead saw only worms and insects scurrying on the floor behind the figure. Reaching the far wall where public notices were pinned over one another in organized confusion, the figure raised a skeletal hand, and placed a piece of parchament upon the board. It read..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Creatures of Norrath,<br>

<br>
Plague Seeker of Eurydice</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As the dark figure lowered its hand, the robe simply fell to the floor. Within seconds the robe too was gone, leaving only a mound of maggots, insects and worms, which quickly found their way into the nooks and crannies of the floor boards. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn strolled through the bar, stopping to grab a bottle of wine from the barkeep. This was her first visit to this place, and she was curious as to the goings-on. She paused at the far wall to read the notices.<br>
<br>
As she read, her eyebrows shot up, and a look of recognition crossed her face. Turning, she tossed a couple of plat at the barkeep and took off out the door, for Harvester Hall. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A pair of pale grey eyes hover outside the walls of the Harvesters of Darkness. For days, the commings and goings have been closely watched, unknown to those inside. There is no movement or emotion in the eyes for what seems like an eternity. Then, on the fifth day, the eyes whirl and narrow, to see a gnome approaching the Harvesters hall. Spectral eyelids close, and when they open the twin orbs are behind the gnome, studying him intently, seeing through him, commiting every detail to memory. The small bonedancer reaches the doors to the hall and enters, seemingly oblivious to the presence. For the second time the eyelids close, and the presence is gone from the world<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Mistress Escron, it is true. The blood line lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me everything.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She said<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;The son of Binuven hid the flesh in Ak'Anon as we suspected, but it appears to have matured much sooner than anticipated. It resides now among the Teir' Dal, and follows our Lord. Perhaps we underestimated...?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A wave of agony that only those of the planes could see, washed over the incorpreal body of Avhi Escron's servant.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Bring the flesh here&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She hissed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;And the companions of the flesh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If they knew, they would have destroyed it by now. Leave them be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you command&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The spectral eyes closed, and were gone, back to Neriak.<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn strides into Harvester Hall, walking purposefully towards the small closet the gnome bonedancer has claimed as his own. She pauses briefly, knocking on the door. As soon as she hears the sleepy gnome answer her knock, she pulls open the door.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Flacon, I've recently come from the Hero Heart Tavern, a place I've never been, but that's beside the point. I was most interested to see a notice upon their wall, asking for information on any bearing the name of Vex.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn studies the gnome, her eyes glowing in the semi-darkness.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Anything you wish the share with me?&quot; <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The sickly gnome slumps his shoulders as he lets out a sigh.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Forgive me M'lady. I have never discussed my past for two reasons. First, I don't really know that much myself, and secondly, nobody ever asked. All I can say is this...<br>
<br>
The only record of my past is a torn piece of parchment written in the hand of someone named Llaorn Vex. It is nearly destroyed with time, but some remains. I believe this person to be my birth father, but as I never knew my parents I cannot be sure. Most of what I know comes from my companions in the Dark Reflection, where I was raised, and from my own research. I will gladly fetch the charge and my notes for you if you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn nods.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I think you'd better bring everything you have to my office. Someone is very interested in you, and perhaps we need to figure out why, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn turns towards the stairs, stopping a servant.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Bring some bottles and glasses up to my chambers, you know what I prefer to drink, and I'm sure you know Master Flacon's preferences as well. I want to see it all in my office before he reaches my threshold, understood?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The servant bows slightly and rushes off. Kerridwynn turns back to Flacon.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Please, meet with me in my office shortly. I would take a look at this information of yours. Something stalks Harvester Hall, I can feel it. We need to be prepared.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn nods to Flacon, and disappears up the stairs to her office. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Flacon returns to his closet and shuts the door. Standing rock still, he simply stares at the small mat upon the floor. Nodding to himself, his right foot strikes out and kicks the mat away. Falling to his knees, he gently removes the loose floor stone, and retrieves a bone scroll case. Replacing the stone, Flacon starts to pack his things. Only the essentials. He knows that this day is the start of a long journey, with an unknown destination. After several minutes of securing provisions and supplies, the Sickly gnome bonedancer stands ready. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Whatever happens next, Bertoxxulous guide me.&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
Resolute in his determination to solve this mystery, he turns and opens the door. He heads straight for Kerridwynn's office. Standing outside her door, he hesitates for only a second before knocking<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Tis me M'lady..&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn opens the door, stepping aside to let the sickly necromancer in. The fire in the hearth is blazing with indigo flames, casting somewhat eerie lighting about the office. Kerridwynn motions to a chair before her desk, and then walks around the desk and seats herself. She clasps her hands together and rests her chin upon them, looking at Flacon.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Let's see what you have.&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The sickly gnome took a seat, placing his pack and travelling supplies near the door. In his hand he held a bone scroll case. There were no markings of any kind on the case. Flacon took a deep breath as Kerridwynn sat down, and began to speak..<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;As I'm sure you are aware, Eonis Mournunder is the head of my order in the Mines of Malfunction. Soon after I decided on my path, I asked Eonis about my parents, and how I came to live in the Mines. He refused to speak to me at that time, saying only that my surname was Vex, and that I should keep that closer to me than any other secret I held dear. I spent months trying to discover what he meant by that, and my investigation lead me to the great library of Neriak. It was here that I was able to find a reference regarding this surname. It mentions a Gnome Shadowknight named Binuven Vex, who studied the ancient evils created by Avhi Escron. It seems Binuven was sacrificed by the spirt of Avhi herself in a dark ritual to Bertoxxulous, but not before he had a son, named Llaorn. I believe that this Llaorn is my actual birth father.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Flacon pauses a moment and takes a sip of the brandy before him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Inside this scroll case, is a charge written by this Llaorn Vex, to Eonis Mournunder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Flacon picks up the case and begins to unscrew the cap. Without warning, a spectral hand reaches out of nothingness behind him and rests upon the gnomes shoulder. In an instant, both the hand and the sickly gnome are gone. Left behind on the chair and floor are Flacon's personal items and robes. The scroll case clatters to the floor where it comes to rest at Kerridwynn's feet<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Almost immediately after the eyes closed, they opened again, this time inside a small closet in the Hall of the ones called the Harvesters. It took a mere split second for the eyes to see that it wasn't here. Slowly rotating, it sensed the flesh was nearby. Locking on to it's location, the eyes closed. The flesh was in the presence of a Teir' Dal female. Keeping it's eyes closed it reached out of the spectral vortex with a clawed, bony hand and placed it upon the shoulder of the gnome. Instantly the gnomes corporal body was transported into the vortex, along with the eyes. The Teir' Dal Female watched in amazement as the gnome appeared to simply vanish, personal affects and clothing falling to the floor.<br>
<br>
Inside the vortex, the eyes bore into its captives' with hatred. All the while, Flacon merely screamed in absolute agony.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Our destinies await Flacon&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn's eyes widen as the gnome disappears from right before her. She blinks, then her eyes narrow. She bends down to pick up the scrollcase.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;What in the name of the seven hells is in this?&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
Kerridwynn moves towards the doorway, studying to floor and the air about the place where Flacon disappeared, leery of any sudden movements or appearances. The words of a blessing against the undead rest on her lips.<br>
<br>
Nothing moves, or stops her, and she reaches the door. Opening it, she moves purposefully towards the main hall. She was going to need some help.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Never before had the sickly gnome imagined such pain, such anguish, let <br>
alone felt it. Wave after relentless wave, like a winter storm upon a rocky <br>
beach, the agony washed over him again, and again, and again. Rising and <br>
falling, swelling and cresting, wave after wave. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Stop!..... enough!.......... &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
Flacon's Captor, now visable as a spectral Gnome in phantom plate laughed <br>
at the bonedancer.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;It never stops. It's never enough. Soon you will know.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Waves crashing against a stone beach. Agony assaulting the very fiber of <br>
his existence. Rising and falling, and always the screaming. Flacon could <br>
feel his soul tear from the screaming, as if a wolf were eating at him from <br>
the inside. The taste of blood at the back of his throat as it began to <br>
well from his erupted vocal cords. And yet he screamed. Unconciousness, it <br>
seemed, would not come. It would not come and take the pain away. And <br>
still his captor laughed.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Enough.&quot; Came a voice from nowhere.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
The spectral gnome reached out a hand and parted the very existance of <br>
shadow. Flacon was pulled through and fell to the cold stone floor, curled <br>
into a fetal postion, twitching.<br>
<br>
Avhi regarded Flacon with eyes colder than the bottom of Iceclad ocean, and <br>
just as deep.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Ah yes, I can smell the rot within him. It has been so long, has it not <br>
Binuven?&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her eyes turned to the spectral gnome, whos body was already <br>
fading, only the eyes remaining.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Yes, Mistress&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>said Binuven, the hatred in his voice clear as day.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Begin the preparations at once!&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>she commanded.<br>
<br>
Binuven bowed, slowly backing away.<br>
<br>
For what seemed like an enternity, Flacon floated in an ocean of black blood. There was no sound or sight, just the numbness and fatigue of his ordeal. It was bliss. There was no more pain, just.. floating.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The sickly gnome was floating. Floating in an endless black. It suddenly occured to the Necromancer that his lungs were not drawing breath. He had no idea how long he had gone without air. Seconds perhaps? minutes? Eons? He had no idea, but knew at the most basic levels of consciousness that he had to breath, so he drew a breath. Instantly the warm ocean of black was gone, replaced by the searing hot light of pain. His eyelids, fluttered open ever so slowly revealing the whites of his eyes. Slowly, the pupils sank down and he became more and more aware of his surroundings. He was lying on his back, strapped to a large block of wood. The block itself was a red stain of dried blood, rust colored seepage all along the sides from centuries of exposure to blood from all the races. Even the heart of the block, some eighteen inches deep, was moist with blood.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Do you know why you have been sick your whole life bonedancer?&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Avhi chided<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;You have within your blood my greatest gift to the world. Your blood is tainted with the most potent of my dark plagues. The Darkness that I gave to the world, the darkness that brought me here to our Lord Bertoxxulous' realm, you have in your flesh....<br>
<br>
And I want it back.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Avhi, dressed in what appeared to be a gown of bleeding human flesh, walked over to Flacon. The sickly gnome watched, helpless, and she raised her hand over his chest, palm down. Slowly, her bony fingers curled, as if gripping an orange. Pale yellow light began to colligate between her fingers as the words of the ancients sprang from her lips. Tendrils of what looked like yellowish green smoke were drawn from the gnome's flesh, drawn into the growing ball of sickly yellow light. Flacon's back arched so quickly and so violetly that both his lungs collapsed. He tried to scream, but with no breath all that came out was a sickening gurgle of black blood. Avhi's hand, now fully encompassed in the essence she took from flacon, trembled with the power and energy that it contained. Avhi's eyes gleamed with resolute satisfaction as she moved her hand towards her stomach. Without hesitaion or reaction, she plunged the hand into her flesh, moaning softly as her skin took on a sickly hue. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Your destiny is now one step closer to being complete bonedancer. Your grandfather will take you back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not believe he survived&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>said Binuven, as he looked to the lifeless body on the wood block.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;My Lord is not finished with this one yet, even if I am. The Teir' Dal female has the ability to revive him. Dispose of it. There is much to do, now that I am complete once more.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Avhi turned and was gone, leaving the spectral eyes and the now lifeless Flacon alone.<br>
<br>
Flaoting over to the block, Binuven opened another rift and reached out to the bonedancers lifeless body. Seconds later, the lump of dead meat was dropped on the road outside of the harvesters hall. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;I'm not finished with you, either&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Said Binuven, before disappearing back into the void<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
There was a soft tearing sound outside the main doors of the hall. It sounded like a piece of the finest silk slowly being torn in two. It was followed almost immediately by a hard packing Slap, as the lifeless body of Flacon fell to the gutter. The only other sound was a faint spectral voice.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;I'm not finished with you, either&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
The gnome's body was naked with black blood crusted around his mouth and chest. His sightless eyes were wide open, eyeballs protruding, his face a rictus of primal agony. In the center of his chest were five small cresent shaped wounds that weeped a foul smelling and putrid liquid. Nothing in the streets would go near the lump of meat, not even the rats.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn stepped out of the front door of Harvester Hall on her way to the nightly hunt. Her nose wrinkled at an undescribable stench, and she quickly looked about for the origin of the offending odour. <br>
<br>
Peering into the darkness, she walked down the steps, scanning the ground. Ahead, she saw a pale shape marred by bits of blackness. As she walked towards it, the smell grew stronger until she had to hold a hand over her nose and breath shallowly through her mouth.<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn drew close enough to recognize the body as that of Flacon, the gnome necromancer. Turning abruptly, Kerridwynn fell to her knees, her stomach rebelling. Her eyes shut tightly, she retched into the gutter until her stomach was empty.<br>
<br>
Composing herself, she turned back to the body. She could tell by looking at it that the sickly little gnome was dead. The question was...could he be resurrected?<br>
<br>
Kerrdiwynn stood, and began to chant the words of renewal and rebirth her kind was known for.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Innoruuk, grant me strength that I may raise this servant of the dark gods...&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
For what seemed like an eternity, the Gnome sat in darkness. Oblivion was his only reality. He was aware of his minds thoughts, and nothing more. His did not know if his senses had failed him, or if there was nothing around him to sense. In reality, he had been cut off from the tie to his corporal body. The ordeal in the Ruins of Lxanvom had severed the link between mind and body. Now, as his Mistress Kerridwynn began her prayers to Innoruuk, Flacon sensed a slight movement in the nothingness around him. Like a tidal wave, his senses came flooding back, pain being the first, but even that was short lived under the prayers of his mistress. Within moments his body and mind where whole, his pain and sickly hue, gone. All that remained to show testament to his ordeal where the five cresent shaped wounds on his chest. Those would never fully heal.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;M'lady...&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Flacon croaked.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn smiled with relief at hearing Flacon's voice, and she quickly knelt down next to him. Laying her hands upon him, she allowed a bit of power to channel through her into him, healing his wounds. She eyed the wounds on his chest with a bit of alarm, but pushed that aside after a moment's thought. Those wounds looked like the kind that would stay around as a reminder...like her hands.<br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;Flacon...thank the Fates. Let's get you inside the hall.&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
Kerridwynn helped the gnome to rise, and together they walked slowly back into Harvester Hall.<br>
<br>

<br>
For several days, Flacon rested in silence inside his closet. He refused to take the meals that were sent to him, and either ignored or did not hear the knocks on his door. The gnome reflected upon everything that had happened, and tried to put the pieces together. <br>
<br>
Avhi, one of the most powerful necromancers of all time, had returned to Norrath and destroyed the gnome Shadowknight know as Binuven when he successfully duplicated some of her forbidden research. She in turn enslaved his spirit and together they now serve in the realm of Bertoxxulous himself. Before Binuven was destroyed however he passed along the plague to someone known as Llaorn Vex. <br>
<br>
That sickness, Avhi's &quot;greatest gift to the world&quot; had somehow been passed on to Flacon. Now, as he sat upon his bedroll, he realized that the sickness he had all his life was no longer there. The sickly gnome, was sickly no longer. In its place where five small cresent shaped wounds upon his chest. To anyone observing the wounds, it appeared as if someone with exceptional long and sharp finger nails had driven them into the gnomes chest. In fact, this wasn't far from the truth. Avhi had plunged her incorporal hand into Flacon's flesh and had siphoned her &quot;gift&quot; from his flesh. The wounds would never fully heal, a weeping reminder years from now of his time in the ruins. <br>
<br>
The ordeal had killed the gnome, and had actually severed the link between his body and mind for a brief period of time. The effect of which was very dramatic. The gnome now saw the corporeal world with new eyes, and new understanding. Now, he realized that death truly was only the beginning, and that in order to make others understand, he must send them to thier deaths. It was his duty, his responsiblity to Bertoxxulous, to make the world understand. There would no longer be any division. Good, evil, neutral... all must die, as he had. <br>
<br>
Flacon rose to his feet, and retrived his vault notes. He would need to retrive his savings. A new prespective on life, and death, required a dramatic change at every possible level.<br>

<br>
Half naked, the gnome headed out to buy new supplies. Today was the first day, of the rest of his life.<br>
