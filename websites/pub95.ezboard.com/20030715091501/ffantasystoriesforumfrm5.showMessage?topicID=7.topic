For twelve nights he had been having horrible nightmares. During the hours when light plagued Norrath he did his best to forget the dreams, to focus on his work. Despite his best efforts however, he was visibly distracted. He looked as if he had not slept in days (which in fact, he had not). His hair was constantly disheveled and there was something in his eyes that screamed. Today is a day like no other he thought to himself, everything is normal, everything. He believed the words floating around in his head just as much as he believed that rats could fly, or that cats actually had nine lives. <br>
        “Honey, what’s wrong?”<br>
        “Huh?” He tried to remember what he was thinking about. “Nothing, I’m fine.” Two soft lips found his. <br>
        “I’m going to start on dinner, you want to help?” His wife smiled at him seductively, knowing he would say yes. He watched as she bustled around the kitchen. For a brief moment the thoughts of his nightmares left him, and he found himself smiling. His eyes scanned her perfect figure, from her thin ankles to her beautiful red hair. He could hear his two children playing in the garden outside. He realized that life was good, and that his nightmares would pass. “What’re you looking at?” asked his wife, playfully fluttering her eyelashes. You whore, he smiled as he thought and began to open his mouth to say so, but stopped just before he was to speak. His mouth hung open as he came to a realization of what was going on. He didn’t think that she…his wife, the mother of his children…it just wasn’t possible. “Honey . . . what’s the matter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” I have, because you’re a dead woman. Thoughts of murder ran through his head, he clutched his temples in anguish. They were not his thoughts, and the fact that he was thinking them was driving him mad. He began to leave, but when he reached the door, stopped and turned to his wife. He wanted to tell her what was happening, he wanted to tell her not to worry, that everything was going to be ok. But he was afraid of what words might come out if he were to open his mouth. He shook his head and ran out the door, tears welling up in his eyes. <br>
        The city guards brought him home later that night. They had found him sitting on the dock, talking to himself in a tongue that they could not recognize. His wife thanked them, and assured them that she would take care of him. She put him in bad and put a warm rag on his forehead, and tried to convince him to sleep. Sleep came, but not easily.<br>
        On the thirteenth day since the dreams had started, he dreamt that he was walking through a labyrinth of stone halls. The walls were covered with blood, and he carried a torch and nothing more. Someone was calling his name, he did not know from where, but he frantically walked through the halls, trying to identify the speaker. The voice was his voice. It was the same voice that had been inside his head that had called his whore his wife . . . he slammed his palm against his forehead . . . he meant his wife a whore; the voice was getting inside him again. He began to run now, the voice getting louder and louder, he knew he was on the right path. He saw a light at the end of the corridor, as he ran he reached out his hands toward the light, dropping his torch. <br>
        With the next step he fell. He was falling through a void. As he fell he looked up at where he had come from. He saw a reflection of himself, as if he was underwater, looking up at the glassy surface. The he realized what was happening. He was loosing himself.<br>
        Lightning flashed and briefly illuminated the small bedroom. As the thunder roared he sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes. He was drenched with sweat from his intense dream. He stared out into the darkness. Lightning flashed again. He gasped as for the brief second that the room was light, he could have sworn he had seen a girl standing at the far end of the room, staring at him. She had long black hair and pale, pale white skin. Her lips were dark and they matched her eyes. In a word, she was beautiful. The lightning flashed again and this time instead of illuminating the room for only the briefest of moments, the room stayed light as if frozen in time. The intense white light filled the room completely, casting no shadows. The girl was still there, staring. He felt like a schoolboy in love for the first time. His open mouth curled into a smile and he motioned as if to speak. The girl smiled and revealed twin rows of pointed teeth. The light flashed and when it returned she was gone.<br>
        He put his hand down on the mattress to get out of bed. The sweat-drenched sheets were warm and sticky to the touch. He looked down and discovered that what he thought to be sweat was not sweat at all. It was blood. His eyes raced to the side of the bed that his wife usually occupies.<br>
        She wasn’t there. Well, parts of her were there, but not enough to consider it her. There was a hand, what appeared to be a bit of leg, and many many unidentifiable bloody lumps of flesh. Before he had time to react to this grizzly sight he heard his children screaming from the other room. He jumped out of bed and ran as quickly as he could to their room. When he got there he was relieved to see that they were still in one piece. He was dismayed however when he discovered that they had both had their wrists and throats cut. All their teeth had been knocked out and their mouths were overflowing with blood. He had gotten there just in time to watch them drown in it. He crumpled into a pile in the open doorway and rested his head in his hands and began to cry.<br>
        There came a knock on the door. He looked in the direction of the door as it began to open. The head of his late wife rolled toward him from the open door. She had a smile on her face, and her eyes were the color of blood.<br>
        The neighbors said that as the city guard carried him away (charged with three counts of murder) he had a strange look in his eyes. They said he was whispering a strange phrase to himself, over and over. “Les vrais paradis sont les paradis qu’on a perdu.” (“The true paradises are the paradises we have lost.”) He smiled as he said it, the only one knowing its full meaning.<br>
        Somewhere in Norrath a girl giggled and whispered to the wind, “Welcome to Paradise.”<br>
