Yes, it is very real, and very immersive, unfortunately, it's also a video game.  The people are just pixels, and nothing more.  It makes it easier to make friends, to lose friends, and just to act like a general jackass, all because it's just a game, man.  Personally, this game is a God-send.  I've always had trouble meeting people, and if forced to introduce myself, I become downright hostile and like a porcupine, hurting all who come close.  This game helped me come out, and be a better person, all because these people really weren't there.  Unfortunately, on the other side of the same coin, it's easy to &quot;hack&quot; your friend's account and jack him of all his stuff, or cuss at someone and utterly ruin their reputation and In Game Life, all because they aren't there. <p><img src="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/giantrobot/abcwarrior.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><a href="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/giantrobot/">Which Colossal Death Robot Are <i>You</i>?</a>

I'm sure some use their online personas to act out what they like to be like in real life...  or even to go the extreme opposite of their real life to achieve some sort of balance.<br>

As much as people bring their real life problems into this game they can also bring false intentions into this game like *playing* the role as a weak bird with broken wings that needs tender carring. It usually takes a bloody long time and a bloody mess before something like this is discovered and it hurts a lot of people especially the one that picked up what appeared to be a weak little bird and instead got the devil in disguise. All in all this game can be screwed up in many ways and there s many persons out there that gives the impression whether intentionally or not that they are something in RL that they really are not. I have always wished that people would come play EQ to forget RL and play the game to have fun killing UBAH 0½ Mobs and roleplay their characters..... But I have come to the conclusions that this is probably impossible since 75% of the time all I hear is people moaning about what a @#%$ week they just had in RL and quite frankly it makes me want to quit..... People that knows me well, would know that I dont care about other people RL situations, I m here to have fun playing a roleplaying game, I m not here to be someones *shrink* tho I can be quite good at that taken my RL background into consideration.... People that know me well would also know that I put other people over myself and try to help out in any way that I can, so what I am saying is basically to go out and help eachother in the game, but try to keep your RL problems non-public. I still enjoy hunting in Kael and to see other people smile when I help them achieve something and you know what ?<br>
<br>
That is because I bring my own happiness into the game.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you sit down at your screen and turn on EQ feeling mad and/or frustrated then my best advice to you is to turn off your comp and go read a book or watch a good movie. Cause its all about Karma, if you enter the game mad you will prolly leave the game mad and chances are that you will have hurt someone on your way.... <br>

EDITED : to make Lakos understand that I agree completely with him that you can talk to people about RL in tells, groups, chatforums and other private areas, but the very minute you take your frustrations out in a public forum like guildchat or /ooc, you're holding other people hostage to listen to you whether that was your intention or not.....Try to understand that as good as it is to talk to people that actually wants to listen to you (good friends and so on), as bad can it be to shout out your frustrations among people that didnt ask to hear you.....  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhalbred2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>halbred2</A> at: 4/16/02 1:18:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulakos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lakos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(4/16/02 10:36:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Getting Along</span><hr size=1> Halbred, that last paragraph makes you sound like an idiot.

Point (hooray) - if you're in a bad mood, and playing EQ makes you feel better, please log on and look me up.  If you've had a bad day, and you feel like pissing in my cornflakes online, please don't log on.  Go read, watch tv, slap the clown.. anything to make you feel better, cause I'm not gonna help your day if you're already @#%$ with me. <p>Cilak Froman<br>The Sausage King of Cabilis<br> <br>

<br>
It is a game.  That is all<br>
<br>
It amazes me that there are so many formalities and legalities, and procedures to even group and hunt with some people.<br>
<br>
You live, you live, you die, you die.  It's still a game.<br>
<br>
But, before I get flamed, I will go a bit further.<br>
<br>
To keep in mind that it is a game, you need not bring personal life into the game.   You need to not worry so much about making friends, etc.  But, what you do need to do is simply respect the fact that there are other humans playing characters in the same game you are playing, trying to have fun just as you are.  Once that is realized then one must try honor the privilege that other people have to play the game and have fun as well.<br>
<br>
This is not a dating service, this is not a chatroom to dump your wordly problems into.  Reguardless of what people &quot;think&quot; they have turned this game into.....bottom line is that it is a game and it needs to either stay that way, or return to that status or your in for a world of trouble. <br>
<br>
I have seen too many people get wrapped up in a game.  When a game is affecting your health habits, then it is time to walk away.  Call your mom, your best friend, your counselor, SOMETHING!  No need to lose sleep, stop eating, and get suicidal over a game.<br>
<br>
 Have fun, or don't play at all.  After all, YOU ultimately control whether you have fun or not.  If your not having fun, then turn off the game.  You can't blame anyone else but yourself if you don't do this.  If someone in the game is bugging you, then log out.  If you don't then it is not their fault you are getting your feelings hurt...or whatever. <p><p><table width="95%" border="2">
