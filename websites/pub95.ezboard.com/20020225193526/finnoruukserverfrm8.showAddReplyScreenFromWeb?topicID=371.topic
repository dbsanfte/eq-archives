</td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Figure this will...</span><hr size=1> ...devolve into a rant, so I'll save the moderators a bit of time and start it here. <br>
<br>
Someone asked me the other night why I never try to fix the broken perspective some have of me. That really was interesting to me because from where I sit, I've tried and have come to the conclusion that these people do not wish to change a label once they've stuck it on ya. <br>
<br>
Doesn't much matter what good deeds I do, they only remember the bad. Doesn't much matter the effort I make, they're too ready to throw mud on it and set it aside. Not a whine, just a statement of fact... these people prefer to gnaw the marrow of a mistake to discovering anything better in me.<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to me -- the notion of 'fixing' it implies it needs fixing... And that assumes the person/people in question is somehow worthy of considering. All of which would be true... but for the reality the ones who insist they are worth spending the time and effort on go rather far out of their way to be as horrid as they can whenever the chance presents itself. So I asked myself, 'Why would you bother to try and correct an opinion founded on gossip or heresay, or given by someone who takes every chance they get to increase their a-s-s-hole rating with you?' Big shock, I couldn't find a good answer. I can't believe I would be alone in reaching that impasse.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter, these insults made by people whose best clue on me is something they heard from someone who heard it from someone else who had a friend who heard it from their best friend's boyfriend. <br>
<br>
The way I have it figured, the assumption that it *should* matter to is revealing on the part of those who hold it... since its pretty much a 'no-brainer' that the only people who matter to any of us are those with whom we hold some degree of friendship or mutual respect. The only thing funnier than the notion it should matter is the notion that anyone could say they dislike you, have no respect for you, yada, yada, yada and think for a moment that it *would* matter.<br>
<br>
All of which is a rather long way of saying that I don't play this game to garner respect. Or to receive acceptance. I play it for a dozen different reasons, in no particular order, but which sum to 'enjoying myself'. Sometimes, that enjoyment comes in a triumph shared with a team... sometimes, in a moment of satisfaction at having solved a particularly annoying quest... sometimes, in saving a young player's life and hoofing away before they can do more than sigh in relief. And yes, sometimes... in showing a_pompous_ass_01 that their opinion is little more than a skittering of letters... soon gone and rarely as prolific or lasting in impact as they wish. There is a rather perverse sense of fun having someone, in the midst of their annoyance, throw open their personality and point to a shiny red button that reads, 'Don't press this or I will explode!' and then seem so very surprised when it gets pressed.<br>
<br>
So what prompted me to write all this silliness? Of all things, a bit of email I received tonight. Typical goofiness from a friend... some supposedly funny item that makes the email rounds, you know the type -- you get spammed all to hell and back with it because everyone who sees it just *knows* you haven't seen it yet. Anyway, I got to reading it and as I did, I recognized some of the behavior I see here. <br>
<br>
For the curious, here it is:<br>
<br>
Start with a cage containing five monkeys. Inside the<br>
cage, hang a banana on a string and place a set of<br>
stairs under it. Before long, a monkey will go to the<br>
stairs and start to climb towards the banana.<br>
<br>
As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the<br>
other monkeys with cold water. After a while, another<br>
monkey makes an attempt with the same result - all the<br>
other monkeys are sprayed with cold water. Pretty<br>
soon, when another monkey tries to climb the stairs,<br>
the other monkeys will try to prevent it.<br>
<br>
Now, put away the cold water. Remove one monkey from<br>
the cage and replace it with a new one. The new monkey<br>
sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his<br>
surprise and horror, all of the other monkeys attack<br>
him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that<br>
if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted.<br>
<br>
Next, remove another of the original five monkeys and<br>
replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the<br>
stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes<br>
part in the punishment with enthusiasm!<br>
<br>
Likewise, replace a third original monkey with a new<br>
one, then a fourth, and then the fifth. Every time the<br>
newest monkey takes to the stairs, he is attacked.<br>
<br>
Most of the monkeys that are beating him have no idea<br>
why they were not permitted to climb the stairs or why<br>
they are participating in the beating of the newest<br>
monkey.<br>
<br>
After replacing all the original monkeys, none of the<br>
remaining monkeys have ever been sprayed with cold<br>
water. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approaches<br>
the stairs to try for the banana. Why not? Because as<br>
far as they know that's the way it's always been done<br>
around here.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
You see.... the monkeys may change -- but the behavior rarely does. 'This is just the way it goes' is the excuse of those who don't care to take the time to know more than what they hear. <br>

troll: a person who posts a deliberately false or inflammatory message in order to draw responses, or in worse cases, to provoke a flame war. Usually considered almost as low as form of life as a spammer. The term is believed to come from the action of drawing a bait through an expanse of water, rather than being a reference to under-bridge dwellers. In some forums some forms of trolling are accepted, but the typical troll is an attention seeking nuisance, whilst the worst cases are hooligans and vandals.<br>

When I say &quot;You all should care more&quot;, it's gonna rub people wrong.  And when YOU imply that everyone is an idiot and would never be able to understand you because you exist on such a higher plane of knowledge, you're gonna rub people wrong.

With that being said, I've found most of your recent posts ones meant to contribute to threads, and far less to inflame then in the past.  However, just like Kaurik or Rumenia or myself or Aithne or Aldrin, I would guess that the majority of the people are going to respond to any comments we make based on their feelings to us for how we've posted in the past, and the content of our posts will be lost.<br>

Nothing against Amici, but come on, I heard you failed twice on Vindicator as did several other guilds that consider themself uber.<br>
<br>
Let's be honest here, LoD and AV are the only uber guilds on the server. <br>
<br>
Uber is being able to take out AoW, Tunare, NToV etc. <br>
<br>
Being able to farm Halls of Testing / West Wing is not uber, neither is completing epics.<br>
<br>
Doing Veeshans Peak is uber, failing on Vindicator is not.<br>

Anon me more, I'm excited.   Was it worth 10 minutes of your time to create your ezboard account this morning JUST TO REPLY TO THIS POST?<br>
Yes it was, because it made me giggle...<br>

But anyway, let us read the paragraph again...<br>
&quot;Stop calling me &quot;uber guild zerg KSing trash,&quot; stop saying I'm &quot;one of the many idiots on this server who ...,&quot; and stop saying I'm, &quot;another one of the narrowminded blind idiot lemmings who hop on the hate Gamiene badwagon&quot; all the time and yeah, I'll like you more.&quot;<br>

There's a big difference between what I've said and what you've read. That difference is not of my making, but yours. Why should I be responsible for your interpretation? Especially when you make no effort to get clarification before making it?<br>
<br>
The point of my post was that it doesn't matter. That people will always choose the fastest, easiest conclusion. Not because they're stupid... but because its fastest and easiest. You can assign whatever implication to that you wish. <br>

I thought it was reasonable.  I can remember people flaming her, just not the reason for it.  <br>
<br>
I thought the monkey behaviour interesting, and it also describes what happens when a person walks into a new culture.  This is called culture shock and happens around the end of 3 months in a new culture.  Any digressing.<br>
<br>
To the practice of generalising.  There can be many reasons for this.  A real observation that - in general - x is happening.  <br>
Another reason a person might make an inflammatory generalisation is to incite people to show that they are different.  Making people think perhaps about there behaviour and maybe even change it a little.  <br>
<br>
Just an idea.  <br>
<br>
One thing I do remember someone saying about you Gamiene - if I get the right person LOL is that shintou said you were kind to him when he needed kindness.  That to me is more telling on who you are than any rants by people who simply disagree with your opinion.  So, dont worry about any of the negative stuff, unless it is true and it bothers you.  There will always be negative stuff.  'Cause we are all different and none of us perfect.  <br>
