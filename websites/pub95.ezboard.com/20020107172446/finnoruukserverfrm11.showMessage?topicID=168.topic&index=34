<br>
The word &quot;feminazi&quot; (feminist Nazi), it does nothing for your arguments, aside from flagging you as a dyed-in-the-wool Rush Limbaugh automoton who was exposed heavily to his ramblings in your (continuing) emotional adolescence.  People who survive politically on granting equal pay, better scholarships, or more political freedom to women bear next to no resemblance to the Nazi party, who were bent on annihilating (yes, that's with death involved,) all the &quot;unpleasant&quot; facets of society. <br>
<br>
Your words about women make it sound as if you've never known a real woman in your life; you have this mythical image in your mind of a snide, sexy, ambitious, condescending, wheedling, power-hungry female legal intern or something, just out of college, consciously and maliciously using her sexuality and the public sentiment for gender equality in the workplace to gain an unfair advantage over men in the workplace.  And you know, most people, that's most of America, just want to get an honest job and work for a living, and earn enough to pay rent, bills, and buy enough food.<br>
<br>
You call yourself a redneck, which to me smacks of low-income, back-woods living in a too-small abode with 4 generations of immediate family, or maybe that's 'hillbilly,' I can't keep them straight.  I bet you've never known a day of hardship in your life.  I'll bet your mother never had to work two jobs and support three children because your father was dead since your age 3.  <br>
<br>
You keep insisting on referring to women by their sex organs.  Every single sentence you type about women adds to the impression that you consider yourself, personally, to be better than, smarter than, more capable than every single woman ever born.  For all your feigned political shrewdness and social awareness, you don't have any idea about the nature of healthy human interaction, aside from what you see in the media.<br>
<br>
You talk about annexing Afghanistan, because we spent so much money on the war there.  You talk about death and domination so casually, I wonder if you'd feel so lofty and in control, if you had to point an M-16 at someone and squeeze the trigger.  Even when they're pointing firearms right back at you, and you must do it, I imagine it's not an easy thing.<br>
<br>
I'll bet you think that women and queers fighting in the military is a horrible, silly idea, inspired by romantic notions of equality and feeling left-out?  Tell me why an average, healthy, straight, patriotic 18 year old male would volunteer for active infantry duty?  Love of country?  Desire to prove oneself?  Who really cares why he wants to, but he won't be told no, that's for certain.  Consider that a young woman wants the same thing, for the same reasons, do you believe it?  Do you assume she's just trying to make a political statement, to prove 'you have to let me on your team, teacher says...'  What you pretend to know about the motivations of such a woman speaks volumes about your politics.<br>
<br>
Go ahead and respond to each word of each phrase above with all your cunning.  Debunk everything I've said and implied.  Use the word 'ridiculous' and 'bleeding-heart' lots too, by all means.  Fact remains, you're out of touch with everything you claim to have neatly sewn-up answers to.<br>

<br>
Rush Limbaugh is a loud-mouthed liberal. He's close to center, I suppose, but from my vantage point a liberal nonetheless. His term &quot;feminazi&quot; is appropriate in that it defines &quot;feminist Nazis&quot; without implying that they are necessarily female. <br>
Exactly... feminazis wish to annihilate all the unpleasant facets of society.. ie, men. Even the male feminazis wish this (possibly more than the female ones; they must have an incredible inferiority complex.) <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your words about women make it sound as if you've never known a real woman in your life; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> and what would a &quot;fake woman&quot; be? Again, woman is a specific and superior form of female human, just as man is a specific and superior form of male human. I've known lots of women. They are becoming scarcer as the &quot;fake women&quot; become more populous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you have this mythical image in your mind of a snide, sexy, ambitious, condescending, wheedling, power-hungry female legal intern or something, just out of college, consciously and maliciously using her sexuality and the public sentiment for gender equality in the workplace to gain an unfair advantage over men in the workplace<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Oh no, I wouldn't limit it to legal interns or college grads. Other than that, that's a pretty fair assessment. Except you left out conciously attempting to get out of the responsibilities associated with childbearing.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You call yourself a redneck, which to me smacks of low-income, back-woods living in a too-small abode with 4 generations of immediate family, or maybe that's 'hillbilly,' I can't keep them straight. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I think the multi-generations makes the stereotype hillbilly. But other than that, I believe you give a fair assessment of the redneck *stereotype*. Of course this stereotype is okay, but as your comments and others make clear, no expressing of stereotypes of other groups of people, no matter how deserving or accurate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I bet you've never known a day of hardship in your life. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You lose. Pay up.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> However,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> while I have had hardships in my life, none of them were caused by my father not accepting his responsibility as a man or my mother accepting her responsibility as a woman. No, I was never in day care. No, I never ate fast food unless I wanted to.<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> . I'll bet your mother never had to work two jobs and support three children because your father was dead since your age 3. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Now that's a safe bet for you. And that's a tragedy, truly. I have sympathy for such a family. But don't even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> try</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to equate that tragedy with the reality of a gal pursuing her career and a guy pursuing his career while the kids are raised by strangers. Don't even try equating it with the reality of a &quot;single mother&quot; working two jobs because she got *divorced* and the alimony just isn't enough to live on.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You keep insisting on referring to women by their sex organs<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I DO NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I have repeatedly stated that a woman is something more than a creature with the female sex organs. It is my opposition that presumes to equate a creature with a va gina with a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> woman</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
Womanhood and Manhood are both things human females and males should aspire to. The respect and rewards of having achieved them should not be handed out to a creature merely because it fits the general shape of either of these.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Every single sentence you type about women adds to the impression that you consider yourself, personally, to be better than, smarter than, more capable than every single woman ever born. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nope, again... I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> different</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from every woman ever born. In some ways I am far more capable, in some ways I'm clearly less capable. This is why I don't have a problem with women, while I'm at war with females and feminazis.<br>
I am superior to every feminazi ever born in the same way I'm superior to the general population of your average insane asylum. In the quest for &quot;equality&quot; that doesn't exist, the feminazis (which means females and balless wonders alike) deny positive male qualities; deny positive male instincts, promote false male stereotypes, deny negative female qualities... scratch that.. to them, female qualities don't exist... except the mother instinct, which to them is part of anything with a va gina... which is utterly untrue. They deny the existence of the father instinct, those who have even been exposed to the concept, that is.<br>
You raise a kid; you keep telling him he can't, even when he can; you keep telling hiim he's naturally rotten, even when he isn't. Expose him to these ideas every day in every way. When he grows up, he'll be incompetent and rotten. You raise a kid; you keep telling her she can, even when she can't; you keep telling her she should, even when she shouldn't;  you keep telling her she's naturally good, even when she isn't...and you'll raise an idiot who has no idea who she is or what she's about. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For all your feigned political shrewdness and social awareness, you don't have any idea about the nature of healthy human interaction, aside from what you see in the media.<br>

I haven't been living on Mars, either. Could it be that human interaction in the U.S. is becoming less and less healthy? Naah.. the emperor is fully clothed, it must be my eyes.<br>

Keep in mind that my editorial comment was intended for a newspaper publication. If you've been following my Afghanistan comments in this message board, you'd be aware that I'm not in favor of conquering Afghanistan with M16s so much as I am in favor of exterminating the human population there. I'm not particularly bloodthirsty, but the Afghans have been this way for over a century, they're not likely to change. They have a fanatical belief system, which in part is opposed to both the U.S. directly and the interests and values of the U.S. They have attacked Americans and American interests. Extermination would make an unambiguous message to the world not to crash airliners into our buildings anymore. It might also spark the rest of the Islamic nations into jihad, which would give us the opportunity to eliminate future and ongoing problems, as well as sieze control of the oil fields. The media whine and moan about India and Pakistan having &quot;the bomb&quot;.. we have a few thousand of them, and can make more. But as this war has demonstrated, we don't need nukes to wipe out a city. And we don't need to risk boys with M16s if we're going to commit genocide. <br>
But you're right. It's not an easy thing to do.<br>
And I state it without hesitation or sarcasm when I state that the Green Beret Sergeant (Chapman I believe his name was) was a far far better man than I am, and the nation would be better off if I had been killed in that ambush rather than him.<br>

At 18 I couldn't have told you any better than you describe. Now I know more. The main reason is the father instinct.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Consider that a young woman wants the same thing, for the same reasons, do you believe it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It can't be true, since females don't have a father instinct.<br>
If she wants the same things for the same reasons, it is because of indoctrination. She can't feel worth for herself as a female, she must measure herself by the male yardstick. It's sad, and a crime against humanity, but it's popular.<br>
<br>
Btw, there are two women columnists I read regularly. I don't agree with everything they say, but I always look forward to reading them. Kathleen Parker and Linda Bowles. Both seem to have figured out, &quot;hey, we're not men; we don't have to measure ourselves on the same scale as men.&quot;<br>

So, as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  more positive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> response, I'm going to use this message to talk about a woman I do respect (obviously, since I called her &quot;woman&quot;.)<br>
<br>
Lessee... a list of her capabilities:<br>
High school graduate.<br>
chef.<br>
upholsterer.<br>
painter (both house and art)<br>
interior designer<br>
landscaper/gardener.<br>
medic.<br>
seamstress.<br>
teacher.<br>
political activist.<br>
wallpaper hanger.<br>
accountant.<br>
writer.<br>
computer operator.<br>
office manager.<br>
I'd add mother, but that would be redundant. In short, she was a Renaissance Woman.<br>
She was married to the same man for 50 years. Bore 4 children and raised them to adulthood, and still gets quiet at certain times of the year mourning the loss of her 2nd child, in the womb.<br>
She made do with the income provided by her construction-working husband (read: not a hell of a lot most of the time.) When she was married, she could not cook or sew, period. By the time her youngest was born, she was a competent chef, and has never felt challenged by any recipe she's encountered. (except, I think, divinity...) She learned to sew to help provide her children with sufficient clothes of superior quality. The culmination of this, years later, was the wedding dress that was the (literal) envy of the town she made for her daughter. Oh, yes, and due to her and her husband's diligent efforts and instilled values, the daughter was able to legitimately wear white at her wedding.<br>
In order to provide a sufficiently clean environment for her family in the early days of her marriage, she learned to paint, wallpaper and decorate on a budget. (Later in life she would amuse herself by watching craft and design shows and chuckling at the &quot;new&quot; ideas she had done decades earlier.)<br>
She would also apply the home-remedy skills she learned in raising her own children to save the life of her infant grandson when he was dying of dehydration (sadly, his mother, her daughter-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  in-law</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was an avowed feminazi... )<br>
<br>
If you look on a voting chart for the 1980 election primary for the State of Iowa, you'll find a curious anomaly. You'll see districts which went for Bush surrounding a district which went for Reagan; her efforts. Later she would be informed by party higher ups that her district had been one of the ones the Reagan campaign had written-off. Her reward for this, other than the admiration of her husband, was a signed letter from President Reagan. <br>
After 40-odd years of marriage, of learning to do things she never dreamed of doing as a girl, her successful daughter (gasp) offered her employment as a secretary in her office; a job intended to be an excuse to provide medical benefits to her parents, and a retirement income, but require no real effort... supposedly. She instead became the office manager, with the responsibility of running the office, balancing the books, creating documents, and a host of other duties. For the first time in her life, she learned to operate a computer. Basically, her reformed daughter (now a feminazi herself, on her 2nd husband) worked her into the ground, while constantly reminding her how much of a burden she and her husband were, how incompetent and inadequate she was in all ways. Fortunately, her husband had not retired, so she had the option of quitting (actually she didn't; once her husband became aware of the abuse he put his foot down and wouldn't have let her go back had she wanted to.)<br>
Oddly, the entire staff viewed her differently, including the computer expert they brought in to revamp their entire system, and a receptionist who years later would call and exchange greetings cards, even though neither worked at the office any more. They all believed that she did a phenominal job under the circumstances. <br>
<br>
Now, I've talked about my father a lot in these message threads, but have seldom, if ever before talked about my mother. Partly because, being recently deceased he's on my mind, but also out of a sense of protectiveness toward her. <br>
But she was entirely competent in anything she tried; she never felt she had to compete with men. The idea is alien to her; one would as soon compete with an artichoke. It was she who first noticed the male-bashing taking place in the media and brought it to my attention. Make no mistake; she's as disgusted with modern males as she is with modern females. On occassion I'll relate the discussions I get into on the internet, and I'm certain the next messages I post are heavily influenced by her expressed opinions. <br>
<br>
One of the primary philosophies I learned as a youngster can be summed up in an oft heard phrase: &quot;just do what you can do&quot;. Usually this was stated to me as I struggled with a wheelbarrow of mortar that weighed 4 times what I did, or attempted to otherwise do the work of larger and more experienced men. It's easy to see this as a put-down out of context, but what I could do at that time, for example, was spread mortar and hand my father brick; I became good at it. Later he would teach me that spreading mortar is the key to laying brick, and laying them fast. He didn't lay brick because it was fun, or because he could strut around like a bigshot impressing the ladies; he did it because people would give him money for it, and the better he did it, the more money he got, the faster he did it, the farther the money would go. So the bottom line became to do what was necessary to get the brick in the wall fast and well. And that's what &quot;just do what you can do&quot; means. F uck ego. Get the job done. <br>
I've seen and heard so many examples of females being more interested in the ego boost and attention rather than getting the job done that it's embittered me in that regard. One example, specific to construction: a gal is working as a laborer on a commercial jobsite (because they had to hire her...) Her job today is to shovel mortar from the wheelbarrow onto the boards, and to move brick down the scaffold. Except, Ms ego has to be equal; when the other laborers line up to refill their wheelbarrows at the mixer, she gets in line too. Meanwhile the boards get empty. After shooing her back to work 2 or 3 times, they fill her wheelbarrow (actually about 3/4 full), she takes two steps pushing it, and it falls over, taking her with it, wasting the mortar in the barrow, and requiring another batch to be made. This costs time and it costs money. For her ego. She was doing a useful and productive job, but had to do what the boys were doing.<br>
I don't suppose now would be a good time to go into the physiological differences in men and women which explain why a male can lift a wheelbarrow more easily than a female, and why a female can put her head against the wall and lift a chair while a male can't?<br>
I put this in bold so it's sure to be seen...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  this egoboo attitude drives me nuts with some males as well as females</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> but the current argument is over females.<br>
The society that fosters this nonsense also aggrevates me. Another anecdote: a female walks up to the job site, her eyes casting around... shortly after an OSHA visit in which the inspector had his ears pinned back... her boots are new, her pants clean... she wants a job as a laborer. My brother, without hesitating, says, &quot;Sure, but you have work the same as everyone else.&quot; He then picked up two (85lb?) 12-inch block and set them on the 6 ft scaffold in front of him... just as all the other laborers were doing. She steps between two block... tries to lift... stands up and walks off. It's sometime later confirmed that she was sent out as a test of our hiring practices. <br>
So I don't have any animosity toward women who do what they can do, or do what they have to do, but I have a helluva lot of animosity for females who a) blame men for their situation and/or b) elevate the schoolyard &quot;girls can do what boys can do&quot; to a status of civil rights. <br>
Females are not built like males, they don't think like males, they have different wants, needs, values and priorities than males.  Creating a society that accounts for these differences yet still allows everyone to achieve his or her potential isn't done by changing words from &quot;chairman&quot; to &quot;chairperson&quot; or making sure females and males can be equally irresponsible, stupid, and miserable.<br>
<br>
Suggesting that an enchanter shouldn't fight a hill giant like a warrior doesn't mean that enchanters can't or shouldn't fight hill giants, or that they aren't equal to warriors. Nor is it blasphemy to suggest that maybe that enchanter should kite spectres in oasis (something the warrior can't do, at least not easily and certainly not worth the cost and time) rather than tanking hill giants in Rathe Mtns. And that's the best EQ analogy I can give.<br>
Sure, I get angry in these arguments. I also get angry when someone comes up to me, breathes in my face and shouts, &quot;Blue is 165 miles per hour!&quot; or &quot;Hotdogs shrink leather chariot races!&quot;  That's just my natural reaction to nonsense, no matter how fervently believed.<br>

<br>
Barbera Olsen (R.I.P.)<br>
Anne Coulter. Writer, lawyer, editorial personality, conservative, fiesty, cute, married..<br>
<br>
I think Kate Mulgrew, whom I bashed in an earlier message, is a pretty nifty person. She's just got a screwed-up value system, IMO. <br>
<br>
Angelika Lleopardbait. This is a weird one, I know. But I always look foreward to talking to her. I'm fairly confident she's a woman in real life, and she's about the only female character in the game I bother watching my manners with. Much.<br>
<br>
Nancy Reagan; I like her mostly for her almost obssessive devotion to the President. Beyond that... eh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Gillian Anderson has the world's best figure and a smile that lights up the world... and we'd get along for about 37 seconds... <br>
<br>
Peggy Noonan... some of the words behind Reagan's speeches.<br>
<br>
Mel Gibson's wife. I've never seen her, don't even know her name, but any woman that can stay married to one of the most wanted men on the planet, and keep him fidelitous, has my respect. <br>
<br>
There are more women I know personally and like, but their names would mean nothing, so there's not much point in listing them.<br>
There are also other celebrity/well-known females on the list but I'm tired and have things I've been neglecting that I need to do now.<br>
