<br>
Bah...I'm currently two items from finishing my epic...and all but one or two of the 18 epic items that I currently possess were dropped by mobs killed by random pickup groups that I put together. Sure, I'm in a guild, but we're hardly Zergling status. It doesn't take a guild, it just takes patience and a bit of negotiating power.  Saying that its part of the EQ installation requirements is just plain dumb.<br>
<br>
I gotta admit Aldrin...at first I was going along with some of your logic and opinions in this post and others. Then I read a bit of the summit log and realized after your first few piping hot lines of text that you weren't the Great White Hope of the Unguilded...you were, in fact, just being a whining tool. <br>
<br>
I'll admit, its basically a drag having to be an unguilded dog begging for epic scraps from the tables of the unmerciful uberguilded masters of the Innoruuk server. Sometimes the drool gets crusty on my chin and I have to wipe it off. Sometimes I feel like tearing a bloody chunk out of someones ass just to remind them that mongrels like me still exist, and that we're hungry too. As a mutt on our server, I walked around for a while with that proverbial chip on my shoulder...feeling that it was a damn travesty that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> did not have my epic, could not loot that super item, could not get into that particular camp, and it was all because of the big guilds holding me back. <br>
<br>
At some point however, I woke up and came to the realization that this world that Verant and Friends have been so gracious to create for us is limited by some of the same rules as the real one. The first and foremost of these is survival of the fittest. Like it or not, in EQ reality and in the real one, dogs sometimes eat dogs. Weak dogs usually get the shiznit kicked out of them by the strong dogs. This is not a higher brain function...its just instinct. You will never reason with the big dogs no matter how many Wimp Dog Summit meetings you choose to have. Whining wont help...the big dogs will just eat all your kibbles n bitz and then proceed to whiz in your bowl. They have the power to act on impulse, and overall they think its pretty damn funny.<br>
<br>
Another rule of thumb is that power perceived is power achieved. Just put on some cool looking armor in the EC tunnel and you'll see what I mean. The converse also holds true...weakness perceived is weakness achieved. If you run around crying and whining all the time about what a terrible world it is and how helpless and downtrodden you feel, then thats all you'll ever feel. For example, zoning into Sebilis and shouting &quot;Dear god sebilis sucks how can you people stand to sit here for hours LFG?&quot; is not going to get you a group in Sebilis. Similarly, whining about the summit meeting not going your way will most likely get you kicked out of the chat room.<br>
<br>
Your posts bring to mind a particular scene in The Godfather, where Johnny Fontane goes to see Vito Corleone on his daughter's wedding day....he begins to cry and whine to the Don that the big shot Hollywood director won't give him that part in the new war movie. Don Corleone, under no uncertain terms, tells Johnny what a big pansy he is. &quot;Godfather, what can I do? &lt;whine&gt;&quot;, he said. &quot;You can act like a MAN!!&quot; roared the Don.<br>
<br>
My advice to you...stop blubbering on the boards and go make a planes group. Stop being a whining begging mongrel. Stop bitching about how the summit sucks, and go out and DO something about it. Grab some of those &quot;friends&quot; that you claim to have all over Norrath, for crying out loud. Sooner or later, the mobs you're looking to kill will spawn. If you're friends are really friends, they might just put a horse's head in between the sheets of anyone who denies you what is rightfully yours.<br>

I've gotten far more invites to raids than I've ever had to ask to attend. Though, I'm a very lucky bastard, grew up in the early days of eq and made friends with newbs who went on to lead guilds, heh. either way though, as long as you know enough people, and they like you, there's no problem picking and choosing the raids you want to go on. (With the exception of Naggy and Vox, all my friends are too high to raid them, lol) I've never considered joining a guild, and I've got a decent set of planar gear started. I'd have some Thurg gear too, but I've lost 5 rolls in a row /cry<br>

You want raids, and don't want a guild? Make friends. I'm heading to PoG this weekend, could see if there's any spots left open for some of ya unguilded.<br>

In all the times I have known you, you have been fun, witty and charismatic. I had thought you would make a great member of sotm. That is why I had invited you to come to our meetings to become a candidate. Only through candidacy can anyone join our guild. Our candidacy process weeds out people with bad reps, bad attitudes, and bad eq play or dont have a real interest in joining a guild family and being loyal to its goals. Our guild is about respect for each and every member, and a desire to have fun in the game of everquest, as I am passionate about this game, and know that the people in sotm are as well. I am not going to say if you would have become a member of sotm or not, as only a candidate's actions and history can let them become part of our great family. I cannot simply invite anyone to join our guild Aldrin, Our officer structure has rules that must be followed as I had told you previously when you did ask me for a guild invite. I was saddened by your private tell to me at the summit that you would no longer have an interest in joining our family. During the summit, I made sure that the unguilded had a legitamate shot at the planes as the small guilds, and the uber guilds do.

<br>
When I ported you to Tox, you invited me to *join* your guild. Not be a candidate, nor anything else. *You* stated, after I commented on previous rigamaorle involved in joining SotM, that a quest was unlikely and my membership was certain to be approved, since you were the GM. It was 3 days later that I sent you a /tell informing you that I was interested in becoming a member.<br>
<br>
You can make it look like I came to you, you can make it look like you merely offered candidacy, but we both know the content of our conversations. <br>
I had hoped that to inform you of my change of heart regarding membership in SotM would not damage the friendly relations I've had with you or SotM. But if you choose to mischaractarise the events surrounding the invitation you offered, I wish no further contact with you whatsoever. I feel no hostility, just disappointment.<br>

Do the unguilded get more opprotunitys at the planes?<br>
If they have friends enough to put together a group for FFA/FIF, yes. <br>
If they do not have friends, no. (But of course if they do not have friends, no solution except forced grouping on a schedule would get them into the planes *shivver*).<br>
<br>
Is it the perfect solution to everybody's problems?<br>
No.<br>
But can anything meet everybody's desires for 'fairness' as they define the word? No. People are going to have to compromise, just as they had to with the last summit, and just as they will with the next summit. You can't please all of the people all of the time.<br>

<br>
Aldrin is so amazingly judgmental, nothing could ever satisfy him - especially since his opinions would begin to morph if he actually got people to agree with him on anything (assuming they could survive the journey to understanding his posts), and he'd end up arguing passionately *against* the position he formally supported.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I haven't had the patience to parse his lengthy posts to figure what the heck he's actually getting at:  except that he opposes &quot;The Man&quot; and always supports the &quot;Underdog&quot;.  Persumably, if the &quot;Underdog&quot; prevailed in his epic struggle with &quot;The Man&quot;, he'd move and support &quot;The Man Who Used To Be The Man&quot; against the &quot;Underdog Who Is Now The Man.&quot;  <br>
<br>
A classic, non-productive contrarian.  <br>
<br>
These contrarians are certainly a problem in guilds, as they inevitably grouse, bitch, whine, and otherwise indulge in grand displays of their moral superiority by ranting on your message boards or dominating /gu say.  Typically they deguild themselves or are booted, depending on the tolerance of the guild officers.  Either way, they last about 2 months or so.  <br>
<br>
At least, that's my judgment of it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
