*****<br>
A natural shadow was soon to sweep across the floating island of Falax’mertenya. Before long, the celestial bodies in the sky would overlap the outlines of each other, forming a perfect linear alignment in their orbits. No one was aware of the threat this portended to, in fact, celebrations of the upcoming astronomical phenomenon were already in their preparation stages behind the borders of the Albanon Kingdom. The Fotenburg Plain spanned between Albanon and Retazzon––the abandoned Gridikkor kingdom. The plain was lush with long blades of green grass that bristled beneath the wind’s steady whisper, its length was unperturbed by any shapes moving astray from their conventional routine; save for a few blue-speckled birds, striped with black from their beaks to tail feathers, that broke free from their cubbies and rode into the skies upon spread wings of the creamiest white.<br>
<br>
The clouds were distant wisps of white swirls, sparse and meager in their placement, doing little in the way of displacing the cerulean roof of the sky above them. The eastern sun, which was now the western sun; since Rumolien was at the eastern apogee in its figure eight orbit;  burned with a radiance so bright that it would have been payed obeisance by the First Sire himself had he laid eyes on it. Both suns were now in the west, with Telios, currently the nearest sun, almost blotching out Selios, the smaller sun behind it. Resuna, the silvery moon littered with crags and pot holes, was visible slowly traveling across the eastern horizon, rising up to meet the two conjoined suns. Perhaps on another island, somewhere in a different part of Rumolien, Elsuna, the gray moon, would be visible. If one was to look from the edge of the world it could probably be seen, but there were few brave enough to go that far. Elsewhere, below the island of Falax’mertenya, there was supposedly a vast world that went on forever––some went so far as to call it the Promised Lands––but such notions were usually thought of as inconceivable given the immensity of Falax’mertenya’s land mass itself.<br>
<br>
Like always, the World Spire, interwoven with giant threads of gold and silver, overlooked the entirety of the lands all around it. It was majestic and mysterious, coming from a base held firmly somewhere far below. The spire reached into the sky and beyond the clouds, to where no eye could ever dream of gazing. A hawk could likely spend a lifetime soaring up its length and still never live to see its peak.<br>
<br>
In the distance, a few rigid shapes weaving their own path through the grass disturbed the plain’s lucid placidity. The central creature was a tall outline in comparison to the two others. If it was just little bit shorter, one might mistake it as a beautiful woman when viewed from afar. It wore a long black conical hat, a black ribbon dangling down from its tip.  The short, oval brim of the creature’s hat seemed to do little in the way of hampering daylight from touching its cloudy gray eyes. Notches in the hat’s brim allowed two pompous rabbit-like ears to stick out to either side; as the creature walked, they seemed to perk and flutter like the wings of an impatient butterfly.  The creature’s body was a slim trunk of all hills and curves. It was pressed tightly yet snugly into a midnight-tinted greatcoat, buttoned with silver fastenings from the right side of its chest over to the left side. The two small lumps of its bosom would be almost unnoticeable had the greatcoat not been pulled so taut across them. Silver thread-like streamers of hair, that hung down to its shoulders, danced on the breeze behind it, tickling the air with its flashiness and splendor. A smooth, horn-shaped muzzle, protruding a hand length from its face, was almost flawless in every aspect. No wrinkles or imperfections lined the muzzle’s form, which fit together into an embellished surface of white scales, glistening like interconnected rows of minuscule pearls beaded together by a master jeweler. A few whisker-like tendrils, resembling the extrusions on a catfish’s face, dangled from the tip of its fine-tuned snout, curling down from either side of its two tiny nostril slits. Slender shoulders, following the sinuous shape of the rest of the creature’s body, were embroidered with silver patches on each side of the greatcoat. They led to thin arms, which looked like they could easily be snapped in half by one violent twist. Elongated hands, as delicate and tender as a baby’s, hung from each sleeve. Tiny veins slightly jutted out upon their surface then disappeared beneath the rolled-back cuffs of the greatcoat. The creature’s legs were lean but powerful looking, bulging with rounded packs of muscle at the calves and thighs. Due to the creature’s light-weight and lithe form; the mighty legs could likely propel it for miles without tiring, or send it vaulting high into the air from a crouching position. This creature’s name was Sarakta; a draconeer and an Unconsecrated One. <br>
<br>
*****<br>
Sarakta’s muzzle opened up into a bright smile of pleasure, revealing rows of petite incisors flashing white in the beams of the sun. Such a good feeling to be back into the world of the living, away from Tower Vozz at last––What a retched place that was!––Shi would rather be completely eradicated from the spirit flow forever then to be sent back there. Despite shir treachery a long time ago, shi somehow found a desire to return to shir homeland, the Albanon Kingdom. Shi yearned to beg for forgiveness. Of course, shi would never act on such a foolish notion. If shi was recognized as an Unconsecrated One by any of shir kind, they would likely string shir insides out and lay them as a pathway from here to Kingdom Algaroy. <br>
<br>
<br>
While in Tower Vozz, shi had deeply regretted what shi had done. After the loss of Dardaroff, it seemed most who switched sides forcibly or otherwise had felt the same. Shi laughed in spite of shirself, a chiming melody that almost made the grass beneath the steps of shir wooden clogs quiver––Oh, how quickly things changed––Upon being freed of the Grand Seal, shirself and all the others seemed to have completely forgotten about any resolutions they had made to themselves. Their resolve to change resulted in nothing more than frozen promises melting away as soon as the heat of their own desires flickered back into being. Such was the way with self-gain opportunities, no use in lying about it. Of course, Mourn Fire burning through one’s very essence for centuries often changed the trend of one’s thoughts. But Mourn Fire was left behind in Tower Vozz, along with Dredikkon, and any others who hadn’t made it through the breach in the Grand Seal.<br>
<br>
<br>
After Sarakta’s sudden outburst of humor, shir two companions precariously glanced at shir–– well, one of them did anyway––The toad of a man hobbling near shir ankles didn’t even flinch, such was the norm with his impassiveness. The sky could be crashing down all around him and he still wouldn’t give a second glance or care. Shi sometimes wondered what kept him going. He was known only as Rag Man, a fitting name, since that was about all that he wore. Rag Man went by many other names as well, King of Beggars, Lord of the Filth, Viceroy of the Rats, and many others––all suiting names––but the Unconsecrated Ones simply called him Rag Man. He was bundled up from head-to-toe in filthy towels like a mummy garbed in trash, covering everything but his banana-shaped nose and the two beady coal specs that were his eyes. The small portion of his skin that was revealed looked more like an affliction than a face; yellow and white pus ran down it in thin streams, carving a route through creased skin that was so dry and flaky it could have passed as a patch of land forever stricken by drought. His nose was an infestation covered with growths and warts; the likes of which would make pestilence itself shudder and retire with indignation. The vesicles inhabiting his nose were like giant cherries, filled with volatile fluids that would mortify any healer and make him want to jump off the nearest cliff for not choosing a different profession. Rag Man’s back sloped up into a giant hunch––maybe it was just one massive wart––where birds’ might try to nest if he remained immobile for too long. Stubby legs held him only several feet from the ground. By most standards, he was a midget, and a very dirty one at that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rag Man’s dark eyes seemed complacent as they darted back and forth, taking in the beauty of the surrounding countryside. As he staggered along, tufts of grass brushed across his tattered clothing, leaving green stains that marked him up and down. He turned his pompous nose toward the sky, inhaling an ocean of fresh air through deformed nostrils. Despite Rag Man’s appearance, his voice was diligent and punctual. He spoke crisply and fluidly, his words being muffled only by the rags covering his mouth, “Do you enjoy this young breeze, my two friends? I’m sure it must be quite a relief to you, but as for me, I will never again know what fresh air tastes like. You need not look any further than my face, for if you look at my outer appearance, you can imagine what my inner workings are like.” He coughed out a chuckle to himself then quietly mused. “Cursed by greed. But why is greed such a bad thing? Without it, we would never discover new things. Everything revolves around greed. Love, friendship, and life itself are just some of the many masks that avarice wears.” His voice suddenly took on a tone of poignancy, “I was the most prosperous merchant in all of Kingdom Algaroy. But believe it or not, my wealth was all drained away from me! My estate was sold, so I could continue paying the apothecaries researching the remedy to cure my ailments, but as you can see...they failed. I lived far beyond my allotted time, growing more insane each passing day, until at last I died on the streets as a diseased beggar. I sometimes wish I had not prolonged my life for so long...but now that I have nothing, it makes me realize everything. In a way, I am thankful.”<br>
<br>
Sighing at shir unlucky choice of companionship, Sarakta payed little attention to the babbling Rag Man. Sometimes he was quiet for hours on end, but at other times he seemed to preach his beliefs like a Hamotsfu priest trying to convert tanzars away from the teachings of Zaramott. He was quite a pestiferous little man, creature, thing––whatever in Dardaroff’s grace he was. Despite this, shi was glad that someone came along with shir. It would be difficult to pull off shir plan against the Albanon Kingdom if shi was alone.<br>
<br>
After the Unconsecrated Ones escaped through the rending in the Grand Seal, they had almost immediately taken to fighting over leadership. Of course, Garbitter, being the most powerful, was able to easily quench any resistance from those who tried to take charge. He was as loyal to Dredikkon as a trained hound, but fortunately, he had been slain in the Rettazon Kingdom while some of their numbers went in to retrieve the Kredonicle. The Unconsecrated Ones then split apart, heading off into the world to seek out their own ambitions. Most of them went off to independently seek the Master, who they seemed to think would grant them limitless power.  Some of them stayed together, like Rag Man and Felsheena, who were now following Sarakta.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, Felsheena had been a Sanct Knight before succumbing to the evil of Dardaroff. Sanct Knights were holy protectors; defenders of the healing ziggurats and protectors of the central Hamotsfu monastery to the north. The Sanct Knights were an elite force––some of them were able to phase stride––their prowess with a sword being almost legendary. Even a war-hungry tanzar would have second thoughts before going into battle with one. They dressed in simple cloth, often appearing only to be ragged peasants. Walking among crowds, they maintained peace and order just by the fear of their presence alone. Felons were usually unsure if the Sanct Knights were out there, but even the slightest suspicion of one nearby was enough to keep them from committing any criminal deeds. Sarakta was glad to have one on shir own side. Shi would most certainly need assistance if shi was to overthrow shir identical twin sibling; Omnishala, the High Decka of Albanon. <br>
<br>
The purple-haired Sanct Knight strode up and fell into step alongside Sarakta, leaving the disheveled shape of Rag Man hobbling close behind. The back of her hair was braided into a tight-knit pony tail, hanging down past her neck and bouncing from side-to-side with every step. Her puffy cheeks glowed with a raspberry red, as if she was constantly blushing. Wisps of the purple hair lashed out across the side of her head from a sudden thrust of wind, but they soon fell limp as the breeze died out. Her rose-stained lips were full of color and health; they were so plump that they looked like they were about to bloom. She was garbed in simple gray garments. A short-sleeved shirt loosely covered her elegant frame, ruffled only by the uprise of the wind every so often. A curved sword, an arm-and-a-half long, was sheathed into a rust-colored copper sheath at her left hip. The only fanciful thing on her entire body was a golden brooch, encrusted with a pebble-sized ruby at its center, which seemed to capture the light and glow with an inner fire of its own. The brooch hung near her bosom, holding together the drawstrings of her white half-cloak, which fanned out like a rippling blanket behind her.<br>
<br>
Silence was all that passed between the three companions. None of them was in the mood for talking. Some were thinking back to the ice-hot Mourn Fire which had held them in its scorching cradle for longer than they wished to remember. <br>
<br>
Frequently, Sarakta found shirself wondering what life would have been like had shi not given up shir soul to Dardaroff after being cast in the Realm of Malediction. Was there any way to revoke it? Shi greatly doubted it. Thinking of Dardaroff always perplexed shir. He was once a loyal Nyriad but had been tainted by the ill work of the Prime Corrupter. That always raised another question, where had the Prime Corrupter originated from? The answer was the First Matron and the First Sire, but they were supposedly beings of omnipotent wisdom and passion. How had they spawned such a devil of a son?<br>
<br>
<br>
It mattered little now, but Sarakta enjoyed pondering such things. Shi was almost as inquisitive as a gridikkor shi had met a long time ago. Usually though, thinking about the course of events and why things happened was a waste of time, pieces fell into their places and they had to be played where they landed. <br>
<br>
The needle-like towers of the city of Karamoor were just on the horizon. The silvery outline of the moon overlooking the city below was steadily rising upward to meet Telios, as if the second sun was slowly reeling it in.<br>
<br>
Felsheena turned her head toward Sarakta, speaking softly but in a sharp tone. “So, there’s Karamoor. We are now fairly deep into the Albanon Kingdom, perhaps we should take a different approach other than the obvious. Patrols passing by at any time will likely see us even if they only cast a sideways glance. I recommend we find some cover.” She continued on nonchalantly, “And I suppose you have a great deal of notoriety around here, so best to avoid the eyes of our enemies all together.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta canorously laughed out a reply, “If they saw us, they would likely all throw down their weapons and bow before me. You seem to forget, I am an exact twin replica of the High Decka. That’s the reason I was banished into Tower Vozz in the first place.” Shir muzzle smirked into a mischievous grin. “Well, that’s not the whole story. Maybe I overused my false authority just a little too much.” Shir mouth then scrunched low into a spiteful frown, “But why wasn’t I just as deserving? We shared the same parents, yet shi was chosen to don the Emerald Clogs once our shilstia passed away.”<br>
<br>
Rag Man wobbled his way up next to them. His arms hung loosely in front of him with knuckles dragging across the grass due to his stooped over form. Speaking in a rhetoric unbefitting for a bum, he waved a malformed finger instructively, “So, greed is what guides your path as well? You will murder someone you’ve already betrayed for the sake of these simple Emerald Clogs?  Your lack of regrets is commendable.” Sarakta and Felsheena exchanged reproachful glances upon hearing Rag Man’s babble. He hobbled in front of Felsheena, squinting one eye closed and accusingly pointing a trembling finger up at her. He continued on, this time in a shrill voice, “And you! What is your underlying motive for being here? What self desire are you trying to fulfill by helping Sarakta?”        <br>
<br>
In response, Felsheena petulantly lifted her nose and shut her eyes. She spoke in a disciplinary tone, as if scolding a child that would never comprehend, “Rag Man, you seem to lack the insight that not everyone is like you. Truthfully, I do hold a grudge against Omnishala, as I do against all the High Deckas. During the War of Redemption they condemned me to a fate I didn’t deserve. I was only trying to help a fellow in need, as the scriptures of Hamotsfu had always taught me to do. I didn’t know that Larrikous was a follower of Dardaroff, until it was too late. We tried to take the Chalice of Renewal and––”<br>
<br>
Rag Man interrupted in a slicing tone, “See, like I said, you have a hidden agenda. You want to settle the rapacity of your selfish pride by killing the High Deckas.” He continued on with a self-satisfied laugh, “In a way, you are no better than me, heh.”<br>
<br>
The gray stencils of Sarakta’s eyebrows lowered as shi simply shook shir head. Rag Man often went off on pointless rambles like this, never making a valid point, except for proving the well-known fact that he was purely insane. But the fact still remained, shi needed him to make a diversion in the rest of the city while shi and Felsheena engaged Omnishala.<br>
<br>
The purple-haired woman only crossed her arms and precariously gazed down at the misshapen form of Rag Man. “I don’t see how that makes me anything like you...It seems that you’ll somehow find a selfish motive behind everything. Well, the same question goes both ways. Why have you come out here then?”<br>
<br>
Rag Man’s black chip eyes set themselves upward in thought for a moment; a palpable smugness seemed to wash across them. The beggar’s fluid voice held a tone of quaint amusement. “Come to think of it, I find the center of my interest no longer comes from wanting to gain wealth, but instead stems from Sarakta’s lovely legs! So smooth and lithe, I want to caress them forever, stroking them like newborn kittens. The desire to take is greater than the actual need.” Rag Man lifted his deformed hand toward Sarakta’s leg. “May I, just once?” He politely asked.<br>
<br>
Sarakta defensively backed away, checking to make sure none of shir leg was exposed. Shi was tired of treating Rag Man like a child, it was time to get harsh. “Listen up before I tear off your ears and stuff them down your throat!” It was obviously an empty threat, shi wouldn’t feel safe poking at that hideous face even with a fifty-foot long spear. Rag Man only stood stiffly, his face as stolid as a wooden board. Shi continued on, mellowing out her tone a bit, “Now, let me explain what our plan of action will be. To get into the city, we’ll have to take the underground tunnels used during the Battle of Fotenburg. I’m almost certain many of them are sealed off, which is just as well, some of them were merely used to draw away the enemies that found them, leading to pitfalls and other nasty surprises. But not to worry, I am very familiar with the proper routes. I believe there is one that leads right into the castle’s throne room. Nowadays, it likely serves as an emergency escape, and aside from Omnishala, it’s doubtful that many others know of its existence.” Shi pointed a slender finger at Rag Man. “You will have the task of keeping the rest of the city guard and militia occupied.” Shi tried to sound as sweet as possible, which was a difficult undertaking. “Our little raid will end very abruptly if you don’t keep the rest of the city diverted away from us.” Thinking of some other way to motivate Rag Man, shi added, “You don’t want to see my beautiful legs hacked into pieces now, do you?”<br>
<br>
Rag Man vigorously shook his head, then replied in a tone that seemed altruistic, “No, I wouldn’t want to see that.” He seemed to be balancing something in his mind. “But perhaps if my rag minions and I do you this little favor; you will allow me to touch your leg for only a moment in return?” Sarakta crossed shir supple arms and stubbornly shook shir head. Rag Man still pressed on though. “Even if I promise to use the un-calloused portion of my hand?” Rag man spun his disease-manifested hand around, realizing that he had spoken an untruth. “Well, maybe if I wear a glove?”  Sarakta’s white face was nearly fuming red-hot with anger now. But the other foolishly added, “A very big, thick glove?”<br>
<br>
Sarakta lowered shir snout and shouted with vexation into the other’s face, “Enough with the leg! Just do as you’re told and don’t expect any special rewards tagged on!” Rag Man was practically blown off his feet by the force of her voice. <br>
<br>
He regained his crooked posture and extravagantly bowed––if that was possible––then briefly spoke, “It will be as you say.”<br>
<br>
Felsheena rested a hand on her coppery scabbard while looking off toward the hazy outlines of rolling hills in the far distance. “If we take these secret passages then we won’t have to shed much needless blood. We can assassinate the High Decka and be out as quickly as we came in.” She waved a hand back toward the living pile of rags, “It looks like a sound plan. Let’s just hope Rag Man here does his part.” <br>
<br>
Lifting his cursed nose in a dignified manner, Rag Man muttered, “Have a little faith in a beggar.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta led them on through more beds of grass. Towering over the weeds, shi resembled a thin, walking scarecrow. Just ahead, the land stooped down into a steep depression, where a small pond sparkled at its bottom. Willows, with gnarled roots curling up and deluging beneath the water’s surface, were crowded around the still water’s edge. A few wiry trees, with long strings of dark green ferns dangling from their branches like greasy locks of hair, were also gathered around the pool. Lili pads, blooming with white flowers on their flat surface, dotted the entire pond. A small choir of frogs piping to each other suddenly quieted down as they heard foot steps approaching. <br>
<br>
Sarakta, taking long strides on shir tall legs, scanned the surroundings, looking for an opening of sorts. Shi glanced over shir shoulder at shir two companions, who were placidly standing around. “You could be helping me search out the entrance, you know.”<br>
<br>
Rag Man immediately complied. Instilled with a purpose, he hobbled around near the shore, overturning small fist-sized rocks with his rough fingers. Sarakta removed shir hat for a moment, clutching it in pity. Rag Man was truly beyond any hope. “Obviously, Rag Man, the entrance will have to be big enough for us to fit through.”<br>
<br>
Rag Man stopped his shambling for a moment, then glanced back at Sarakta. “Who said I was looking for an entrance?” He replied, almost defiantly. Holding out his hands, he displayed a crawling assortment of slugs and worms that he had collected from the ground. Sarakta’s stomach churned with a nauseous vengeance. “You’re not going to eat those...are you?” Shi replied in disgust.<br>
<br>
Rag Man returned the comment with a @#%$-eyed stare, as if he felt Sarakta was the insane one. “No, but if you’re suggesting you’re hungry and I should give them to you then so be it. I can always find more, but I don’t see how worms can be appealing to your appetite. They definitely leave something to be desired, even to me.” He continued on, “I only need them so I can create my rag minions once I’m in the city. I’m not a god you know; I cannot anthropomorphize living creatures from rags alone. I need some form of life to transfer into another.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta slowly nodded back at him. “Right, right.” Shi changed the subject. “Remember the plan though; don’t attack until the suns are hidden behind the eclipse of the moon. It will serve as our signal to strike as well, not to mention, it will probably spook the city even more if they are assaulted under the cloak of darkness.” Shi walked over to a tree trunk and ran shir hand up and down its smooth length, probing for a notch or anything that might point shir toward a secret entrance. “Now, if we can just find this tunnel...I know it has to be around here somewhere.”<br>
<br>
Felsheena bunched up her fist and lightly thumped on a nearby trunk with her knuckle. A hollow sound replied, echoing up and down the tree’s length. Rag Man scampered over from the pond, skidding to a halt across the dampened ground just before slamming into the tree. He stated the obvious, “Seems you’ve found it.”<br>
<br>
The Sanct Knight nodded, reaching a hand for the wooden hilt of her sword. “Stand back for a second.” Rag Man pivoted back on his heels as Felsheena drew her blade. In a motion that was quicker than the eye could follow; her hooked blade flashed and swept completely through the trunk without slowing, as if the tree held no more resistance than a thin bale of hay. Within split seconds of the target being slashed in half; the blade thunked back into its rust-colored scabbard with a metallic clank. The tree groaned like an ox as it slid and grated off of its base, toppling over and crashing to one side, its ferny leaves riveting and trembling one last time with the recoil of slamming into the ground. <br>
<br>
Rag Man’s eyes seemed to raise up in admiration as he nodded approvingly.  <br>
<br>
Sarakta strode over and examined Felsheena’s handy work. “Nice job,” Shi absently commended. The split trunk was now a circular wooden well. Sarakta placed shir hands on the edges and peered into the hole. Particles of wood dust still drifted down its length, disappearing into blackness below. It looked like a long drop. She was somewhat uncertain of the tunnels that lay at the bottom, but even if they weren’t the ones shi was looking for, they probably conjoined with the ones shi was familiar with. Cautiously, shi asked, “I hope someone remembered to bring a rope?”<br>
<br>
Rag Man and Felsheena correspondently gazed at each other with expectation; neither of them produced a rope though. Sarakta rubbed shir chin for a moment, then glanced back down into the narrow opening. “I believe it is narrow enough for us to wedge ourselves between each side of the wall and shinny down.” Shi moved shir arm over the gap, estimating the diameter between each side. “Yes, that should work.”<br>
<br>
Rag Man, who was at most half as tall as they were, bounced on one leg to the other with disparagement. “What about me!? I will not fit between each side.” His voice took on a stingy pitch, “Wait! I have an idea. You can carry me in your lap while you travel down, Sarakta.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta shivered and bluntly retorted, “Um, no. Don’t count on that happening. Maybe we should just throw you down first and use your body to cushion our falls. You’ll get to the bottom either way, right?”<br>
<br>
Rag Man wasn’t paying attention, his eyes were now fixated on a plains deer lapping up pond water a short distance away.  Its back was streaked with brown fur while its underside was coated with splotches of white. Two knobs were all that its head held for antlers. It must still be a young buck. Rag Man replied, “Never mind that, I know where to find lots of rope. Go on ahead, I’ll catch up.” With agility that seemed inappropriate for him, he leapt from the ground like a frog, hurtling himself toward the deer.<br>
<br>
Sarakta and Felsheena only stared after him for a moment longer then shrugged to themselves. Paying him no more heed of mind; they turned back toward the trunk’s opening. Felsheena flung herself over the side first, hanging on the edge, she swung back and wedged herself firmly between each side. After crawling down at a snail’s pace for a few minutes, there was an opening large enough for Sarakta to slip inside of. The trip to the bottom was a long one, since they were only sliding down mere slivers of distance at a time. The back of Sarakta’s greatcoat was probably filthy by now, but that was the least of shir concerns. Their surroundings grew darker as the light pouring down the trunk grew thin and scarce. Around the time they were near the bottom, a dark shape above blotched out the light. It was Rag Man. In his right fist he clutched tightly onto some kind of rope, or so it appeared to be. Pointing jubilantly at his find, he shouted down to the others, “Look! Rope! Lots of it too!”<br>
<br>
Sarakta, annoyed at the fact that shi had to practically crawl shir way down, shouted back up in response, “If you had so much of it, then why didn’t you tell us!?” Something dripped down from above and splashed on shir great coat. Was it raining? No, that couldn’t be. The circle of blue sky visible from the opening above was not even etched with the slightest wisp of clouds.<br>
<br>
Rag Man’s muffled shout replied in irritation, “Well, I needed to get it out of the belly of that deer first!” He shoved the coiled rope and it snaked its way down, landing against the edge with a splat. Sarakta reached out a hand and carefully touched its squishy surface––the thing was soaking wet with blood! It was not a rope at all but the deer’s intestines! <br>
<br>
Sarakta struggled to keep shirself from gagging, it felt as if shir stomach was a raging sea tossing about beneath a hurricane. The reek was so repulsive that it would have dropped a skunk dead on the spot. The all-powerful stench made Sarakta want to willingly give up shir sense of smell––if it were possible. Shi would throttle Rag Man’s neck extremely hard once they reached the bottom, but then again, shi wanted to keep shir hands far away from any part of that creature.<br>
<br>
Felsheena muttered under her breath, “What in the name of Holy Hamotsfu..?” She jumped from the wall and fell the rest of the way, landing with a dusty thud below. Sarakta waited for a few moments then decided to do the same; the remaining distance wasn’t far. With one hand, shi tightly clutched the brim of shir hat and plummeted down, landing softly beside Felsheena on the rough and dirty soil. It was dark and dank; a torch light most certainly would have been welcome. <br>
<br>
The deer intestines squeaked like polished shoes on a glass floor as Rag Man slid down them. He grumbled to himself, “This rope leaves something to be desired!” He resembled a tattered heap being lowered on a string as he repelled himself down the wall like a mountain climber. He pushed himself off from the sides with stubby legs then landed a marginal distance lower. He was thoroughly covered in the slickness of blood from the tip of his nose down to his sandals by the time he reached the bottom. Only his eyes were untouched by the prevalent red.<br>
<br>
Sarakta tried shir best not to look at the bloodstained mess of walking rags. With a quick gesture from shir left hand, shi motioned them to follow shir down the corridor to their immediate right. They walked away from the circle of light and melted away into the deepening shadows. Mustiness and roving grains of dirt clouded into each of their nostrils, tickling their nose hairs and trying to persuade them to let loose a sneeze. It was mostly quiet, except for the scuffling of shir wooden clogs and the footfalls of shir companions almost in step with shir own. The tip of shir hat brushed up against the low ceiling, it almost fell off several time where the roof curved downward, but shi managed to keep it on.<br>
<br>
The path became so dark that only the footsteps of Rag Man and Felsheena told shir that they were still following. There used to be light stones down here to shine a path, but they no longer seemed to be functioning. Their route was lit only by needles of light poking through near invisible holes on the ceiling, which also served as ventilation shafts. The lack of vision didn’t make a big difference, shi and shir siblings had played down here so much when they were childlings that any of them would be able to navigate them without needing sight or sound for guidance. <br>
<br>
Omnishala and shi had many adventures down here, they were close for awhile, until their shilstia began to show favoritism. Their shilstia was one of the High Deckas, supreme governors of the corresponding kingdoms of Falax’mertenya. Their shilstia, a remana known as Velzda, chose Omnishala to succeed shir in the event of shir untimely death. And a premature death shi had died, tragically falling down a flight of stairs and breaking shir neck. A very undignified way for one such as shirself to pass on to the next world. It made Sarakta sometimes wonder about how it had occurred...But Omnishala never seemed like one who would seize power, least of all from shir own shilstia. Perhaps shi had become a little covetous though. With the Emerald Clogs, Omnishala was able to live well beyond shir life span, ruling shir people for centuries. <br>
<br>
Draconeers lived for a decent amount of time––upwards of 200 years was not entirely uncommon––supposedly to offset the imbalance that nature had given them. They required three mates to produce offspring, unlike the other races, who only needed two. Though they looked somewhat reptilian; they were in all actuality mammals. It was sometimes misconstrued that Draconeers laid eggs, but that was not so. The remana gave live birth after receiving conception from a remo and fertilization of the egg from a remanute.<br>
<br>
A small tap on the shoulder snapped Sarakta out of shir thoughts. Shi looked back across shir shoulder to see the dim outline of Felsheena tapping her foot impatiently. She shook her head and in an insouciant tone asked, “What’s the hold up? We need to get a move on before the eclipse occurs.” She glanced around, they were now standing in a corridor bisected by a path on either side. “Which way from here?”<br>
<br>
Sarakta recognized the area. One way went deeper and the other went up toward the surface, opening up somewhere into the confines of Karamoor. Shir tone held a touch of alleviation as shi spoke to Rag Man, “This is where our paths separate. You go into the city and cause a major ruckus, but try not to harm many of my people if it can be avoided. We’ll likely only need a dozen or so minutes after the eclipse, so after that, I suggest you run for your life...Can you phase stride well?”<br>
<br>
Rag Man nodded. “Not as well as some, but I can, yes.” His tone deepened, somehow encasing a bitter sorrow. “Will I ever see you again?” That disease-strewn face almost filled with bashfulness––bashfulness!––Rag Man’s train of sane thought had obviously left him for greener pastures long ago. <br>
<br>
Sarakta shook shir head. “I doubt it.” Shi certainly didn’t thrive on a hope of them reuniting, in fact, shi hoped the little beggar would conveniently get killed off. Shi pointed off to shir left, “That way will take you to the inner city, good luck.”<br>
<br>
Rag Man compliantly shuffled off in the designated direction, staring back regretfully with beady eyes as he went. Shi could hear him quietly prattling to himself as he went, “My greed to please shir every whim encompasses my thoughts. Somehow, it all seems to leave something to be desired.” His muttering became a stifled murmur as he vanished off into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Felsheena coughed and cleared her throat, “I’m not too sad to see him go, but I must confide; he has more courage than many of the knights I have seen come and go.” She turned away and began walking down the opposite tunnel.<br>
<br>
Sarakta walked along dispassionately. Courage? Well, it’s easy to be brave when you have nothing left to lose. Rag Man was probably looking for a means to die anyway, and shi was just helping him find it. Shi couldn’t see how a creature like that could find any pleasures by living.<br>
<br>
After walking deeper down the tunnel, Felsheena asked, “How many do you think we will face?” Her gray and white garments were now somewhat embedded with dirt.<br>
<br>
Sarakta thought for a moment. If they were lucky enough, they wouldn’t have to deal with the Triumvirate of Protectors. Hopefully, the triumvirate would be distracted along with some of the High Decka’s royal guards. Optimistically thinking, they would be dealing with maybe twenty or thirty royals guards and the High Decka shirself. Even alone, the High Decka would be a formidable opponent. Shi was a Tetra Dancer, like Sarakta shirself was. But Omnishala had an edge, shi wore the Emerald Clogs which enhanced shir powers even more. Likely, it would take every last ounce of strength in Sarakta’s body to defeat shir opponent in the dance.<br>
<br>
In response to Felsheena’s previous question, Sarakta replied, “No more than forty. That’s if they rush the High Decka into the safety of the castle right away.” Most draconeers were bold, but they were protective of the High Decka. They would escort shir into the palace before the fighting even came near shir vicinity. Of course, that’s what Sarakta was hoping for.<br>
<br>
Felsheena pushed a rogue strand of purple hair out of her eyes. “I can phase stride, though I’m not very accustomed to it yet. Hopefully my limited abilities will be enough to face so many.” She continued on, “If not, we’ll just have to slay the High Decka and make a timely escape.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta stoically replied, “No, I won’t be leaving after the High Decka dies.” Shir bunny-like ears perked up as a yellow pulse of light became visible down a tunnel just ahead. <br>
<br>
Felsheena turned her head toward the other, arching her eyebrows quizzically. “What do you mean you won’t be leaving?” The tunnel began to rise up, leading into stone.<br>
<br>
Sarakta continued on in a tone of gratitude, “I thank you for coming all this way to help me. As you know, I am an exact twin of the High Decka. I have other plans in mind once she is overthrown...But I promise, I will return this favor to you someday.”<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Karamoor was overflowing to the brim with activity. Crowds of draconeers short and tall darted about on the cobblestone streets, hurrying to buy candles or flare streamers before the phenomenon began. Whenever there was an eclipse on either of the two suns; a celebration called Moon Chant was held. It used to be a serious ceremony, but gradually over time it grew more into a social event. Ancestors of the draconeers had always thought that when a sun disappeared behind the moon, it was lost forever, unless of course, they showed it the way back by lighting off millions of candles, and in later times, fireworks. Eclipses occurred often enough, but something like this––where both suns would be fully hidden––was rare indeed. The attendance at Moon Chant this year was at its peak; even the most elderly had come out to witness it. <br>
<br>
Nefalak crossed kes massive arms and leaned up against an empty cart. Moments ago, it was packed tight with candles and fire streamers. But a crowd of childlings came and plundered it all without much difficulty, nearly stampeding over kemself in the process. The childlings were not of a defined gender, since they didn’t reach physical maturity until the age of twenty.<br>
<br>
This was going to be just another dull Moon Chant like any other. What a bore. Nefalak didn’t have much other choice but to be here, either. Ke was the captain of the Triumvirate of Protectors, so it was necessary that ke show up to wherever the High Decka––who was acting strange lately––went.<br>
<br>
Being stuffed into a tight suit of armor didn’t help to ease the drabness of the situation either. Overlapping plates of curved, silvery mail, lined with leather on the inside, covered the Remo’s bulky chest and arms. Kes white scaly-looking hands were as massive as shovels, looking like they had enough power to crush down with the force of a sledge hammer. The large hilts of two blades stuck out from behind kes back, almost reaching past kes head. Ke wore a steel cap that had a brim shaped like a leaf, with the protective part of it shaped like a pyramid. A long white plume, that could have passed as a writer’s quill, jutted out from the left side of the brim. Two rabbit-like ears protruded from notches in the cap’s brim, but they were less in height than the decorative plume. Kes eyes were a cloudy gray, with a fierce gaze in them that could have frightened off a thunderstorm. The remo’s muzzle seemed stretched and thick compared to most. It was fixed into a permanent grin of dignity, flashing the incisors within for all to see.<br>
<br>
Yes, another boring year. How long had it been since the War of Redemption? When true heroes were needed? It was a simple answer; Nefalak only had to look at the year. Currently, it was 489 ADF (After Dardaroff’s Fall.) But the battle had not ended with Dardaroff’s defeat, there were many other branches of evil that stemmed from him. Of course, all of them were either slain or cast away into the Realm of Malediction by the Fundament and the High Deckas. Nefalak had not lived during that time, but ke knew kes history well enough. Ke envied those that lived during that era. Now, with the Gridikkor gone from Rettazon, fled far into the west, there would never again be a glorious battle on these lands. It made Nefalak feel useless. Sometimes ke felt as if ke was just a decoration with moving legs, whose only purpose was to attend ceremonies and march troops to death. The only battles ke had ever fought were against poorly disciplined and armed brigands, along with a fair number of palwaa leaf smugglers. There certainly was nothing too extraordinary about that.<br>
<br>
In a way, it was probably best that this was how things were. But still, at this rate ke would likely die as an old remo––what a lousy way to go!––with no stories of valor to tell the childlings.  <br>
<br>
Nefalak busied kemself with fastening kes gauntlets on while childlings scampered across the crowded streets all around kem. Some of them came forth from the doors of spire-like houses made from brick, which aside from flat disks that protruded from their sides like mushrooms growing on a tree’s bark, were mainly cylindrical in structure. The Draconeer architects greatly enjoyed contrast and negative space. The homes were spaced evenly apart and given a generous distance between each one. Every other structure was colored black or white, depending on its neighboring buildings. The tall edifices almost appeared to be giant pieces from a game called “Emperor’s Conquest” using the cobblestone streets as a playing board.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Nefalak wondered where Gustuffer and Meldeitha––the two other members of the Triumvirate––were at. It was very probable they were enjoying the festivities elsewhere. Not surprisingly, both of them lacked Nefalak’s point of view.<br>
<br>
Ke should really be near the High Decka, who was seated across the city near Castle Karamoor, but it’s not like anything drastic would occur. The only thing dramatic that ever happened during a Moon Chant was usually someone getting an eye shot out by a whiskey bottle’s cork shooting astray.<br>
<br>
A few remanan passing by lowered their heads in greeting to kem; ke returned the acknowledgment with a brief nod of kes own. The remanan were dressed in white surcoats, with long thin flaps in the back streaming out behind them like a bouquet of vulpine tails. <br>
<br>
Everyone was readying their candles, sparksters, flare streamers, and anything else they really wanted to light on fire. Fire jugglers were spinning their torches through the air on almost every street corner, so if anyone needed a quick light they could just go to one of them. The silver orb of the moon, Resuna, was elegantly sliding across the blue sky, approaching very close to the two suns, which were now in near perfect alignment with each other.<br>
<br>
At last, a sliver of shadow began to pass across the sun. The moon was like a boulder slowly rolling in place to block off a light at the end of a tunnel. Everyone went dead silent as countless candles were ignited. A sea of tiny orange flames flickered and danced in the receding sunshine, casting dull reflections and lively shadows on the faces and eyes of those who held them. Small protrusions of teeth from muzzles seemed to glow orange as every nearby radiance of light was mirrored in them. Soon; the moon entirely covered the sun like a lid over a fire pot. Suddenly, explosions popped and cracked everywhere from high above. The darkened sky overhead burst to life with pennants of falling colors from the fireworks, as if it were raining sparks down from the heavens. The childlings roared with laughter and many others clapped and whistled appreciatively. In response to the cheering, fuses of more sparksters and flare streamers hissed with the touch of ignition. Rows upon rows of them were launched, trailing comet-like tails as they rocketed away.<br>
<br>
Nefalak thought it was all a big waste of time. What was so intriguing about things blowing up for no reason anyway? But there would be more Moon Chants like this to come and there was no use brooding on it. Despite being a bit lax, something tickled at kes senses. Ke looked around but nothing was out of the ordinary. Still, it might be a good idea to get back to the High Decka.<br>
<br>
<br>
Apparently, ke had been right. Something moved in the sky, something massive. It was hard to tell what it was, but ke could hear it breaking through the air. It was something flabby and wobbly, spreading out like a blanket of goo. Others noticed it now too, staring blankly up at this strange new occurrence. There was more than one now, all of them bouncing and jiggling through the air as they fell. As they grew closer, it appeared they were some kind of liquid. The draconeers recovered from their moment of being awestruck and began shouting out warnings. Parents scattered in all directions, trying to herd their childings beneath any kind of shelter nearby. Some still stood in the middle of the streets, jaws gaping wide open as they peered up at the airborne goo that was about to collide with them.<br>
<br>
Nefalak wasn’t about to be caught beneath it. Diving shoulder first onto the street, ke rolled like a barrel and landed beneath a tilted cart. A few others were laying beneath it as well, their gray eyes blinked in befuddlement as to what was really happening around them. <br>
<br>
After a few more seconds, an ear-booming splatter rang out through the entire city. It was a sharp noise; the sound a giant would make if it belly-flopped off the peak of the World Spire and into a lake below. More of the splats followed and the slime pouring down splashed beneath the cart as well as on top of it.<br>
<br>
Nefalak raised a hand to kes face and revoltingly wiped off the thin meniscus of slime that now covered it. It was like gallons upon gallons of clear snot, maybe Hamotsfu himself had sneezed upon the world. All the candles and flames had been extinguished by it. Some of the candle-sticks gently rolled back and forth in the goo, abandoned by their holders.<br>
<br>
Nefalak barked out a laugh in a gruff voice that would qualify as a wolf’s. “Things have suddenly become a lot more interesting during this particular Moon Chant!” The others beneath the cart precariously watched kem as ke rolled across the mucus and back out onto the streets.<br>
<br>
Those who were caught directly beneath the falling gunk now lay unmoving in puddles of it. They seemed unhurt, likely they had just been stunned from the force and ear-splinting sound. Nefalak’s armor clanked like a tin can as ke trotted down the streets, heading toward Castle Karamoor to make certain the High Decka was safe. Kes plated boots squished across the slime, it was so slick in some instances that ke nearly slipped and fell flat on kes back. Draconeers climbed back out of hiding or came out of doorways, muttering in disbelief to themselves and each other.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Over halfway to kes destination, Nefalak skidded to a clumsy halt. Some kind of thing that ke had never seen before sat in the middle of kes path. It was a short form, clothed only in grease defiled red-stained rags from the head down to the feet. Its black eyes and plagued sausage of a nose were all that lay unconcealed from the rags. <br>
<br>
Somehow, it managed to speak in a clear, almost clairvoyant tone of voice. “I told shir I wouldn’t hurt the draconeers...much!” Nefalak fumbled kes hands back for kes swords. Two thick blades of steel, glistening even in the dimness of the eclipse, appeared in each of kes hands. They were two short swords known as friction blades, crafted from an alloy of metals that reacted with air when swung. It took a great deal of physical strength to wield them, but that was one area where Nefalak wasn’t lacking.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
<br>
Nefalak boldly shouted back in response, “Who are you!? Did a draconeer send you? If so, then who!?” Ke sheared his two blades together, producing a metallic grating sound.“Speak! Before my impatience drives me to gut the answers out of you!”&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
The ragged man swept an arm across his chest and formally bowed. “I go by many names.” He began counting them on deformed fingers. “King of Beggars, Viceroy of the Rats...” He trailed off and then continued on. “But those names leave much to be desired. My friends just call me Rag Man, you may call me that also.” Rag Man worriedly glanced around. He spoke secretively behind his hand, “As for who sent me, it’s a secret!” <br>
<br>
Draconeers timidly began funneling back out into the streets, coming from all corners and encircling Rag Man within an inquisitive crowd. They whispered amongst each other, some making snide remarks about the creature before them. Some of the civilians began to gather up rocks and loose pieces of cobblestone because outsiders usually made for a good stoning if they wore out their welcome. Guards decked out in thick plates of steel threateningly lowered their halberds, prepared to strike on Nefalak’s signal. Rag Man...that name definitely chimed a beat in Nefalak’s memory.<br>
<br>
After a pause, Rag Man reached into his tattered clothing, drawing forth slugs and worms that probably found a favorable living environment there. The draconeers only watched in bafflement as he began sprinkling them onto the gooey street. With a single wave of his hand, Rag Man simply disappeared, replaced only by a thick brown fog that flowed outward in ripples.<br>
<br>
Nefalak cupped kes mouth and violently coughed as the filthy air washed over kem, but that was clearly not kes most immediate worry. From the dirty smoke lunged forth many more creatures made of rags, these ones stood as high as the lamp posts on each street corner. Some of them were so tall that it looked like their legs had to be made of stilts. The rag minions’ long legs ran awkwardly, like those of a heron’s trying to dash in a foot race.<br>
<br>
Finally, Nefalak could put kes skills to the test. Ke raised one friction blade into the air, shaking it higher while shouting, “Defend the High Decka! Pass the word down the streets!”<br>
<br>
Voices high and low traveled off down the roadways in response, echoing the same thing. “Defend the High Decka!” Armored boots came thumping down the slimy roadways as more guards arrived to reinforce the ranks of those who were already about to engage the rag minions. Their added support wasn’t needed though. Draconeers were very defensive of their homeland, like all things, but they were naturally more territorial. The civilians didn’t retreat from the combat, but rather they deluged themselves in it. They began hurtling rocks and stones as soon as the first rag minion appeared from the concealment of the brown cloud. Caught between a crossfire of whistling, sharp projectiles; the rag minions fell in mass numbers––after all, they were just living bundles of cloth––once multiple stones shredded through them, they simply collapsed into smoking piles of refuse.<br>
<br>
Some of them managed to break free of the rock barrage, but they were greeted by the sharpened ends of halberds before they made it close enough to do anyone harm. The ones who made it beyond the halberds became very well acquainted with Nefalak’s friction blades. After engaging his nearest enemies, Nefalak spun and flowed through sword sweeps as gracefully as a bear dancing on its tip toes. The friction blades streaked paths of molten red out behind them as they slashed through the air, heating up to temperatures that seemed like they were about to melt the very material of the swords themselves, but the blades held together as they always did.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Nefalak was exhilarated; quite an excursion this day had turned out to be. The steaming bodies of rag minions were littered in a heap all around kemself. Ke had been so into the surrounding combat that ke completely forgot about kes duty to protect the High Decka.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt;p&gt;<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the distant cries of battle and warning; the royal guards surrounding the High Decka immediately took defensive actions. Lieutenant of the Guard, Talosivin, hustled all the guardsmen onto to their feet. The tall and lanky remanute rushed and knelt down next to the High Decka’s side, who was seated motionlessly on a straw-backed throne located beneath the shade of a canvas. Ominishala’s stare seemed vacant, as if shir thoughts were somewhere else besides here. Talosivin had noticed it as of late, so had some of Omnishala’s advisors, but they didn’t know how to approach the situation. Je took shir hand in jes own and gently shook it to get shir attention. The High Decka turned to face jer, shir own face held an expression voided of emotion. “What is it?” Shi asked with disinterest.<br>
<br>
“The city is under attack, your Gracefulness! We must escort you to the safety of the castle right away!” Talosivin quickly replied, trying jes best to sound firm and confident. There were a hundred or so of the royal guard that would accompany them into the castle. They would do the standard defensive maneuvers rehearsed in their drills, where every ten or so paces one of the guard would break off and take up position in the halls, forming a staggered line of soldiers down its length which could easily shuffle down and converge onto one point if needed. It would serve to hold off any assailants while the rest of the defenders escaped into the stronghold of the throne room with the High Decka, where they would bar off the doors and wait for the threat to pass away. <br>
<br>
The High Decka remained silent, shir expression unreadable. Shi limply raised up a slender hand, waiting for Talosivin to grab onto it and hoist shir to shir feet. Talosivin took hold of the delicate hand, being careful not to press down too hard on it. Je lifted shir from the chair and steadied shir on shir feet. Why had shi become so meek? Je spoke briefly, “I’m unsure of our enemies’ numbers or even who they are, but we can’t risk anything happening to you. We must get you into the confines of the castle for the time being. Mere seconds wasted out here could be the difference between life and death.”<br>
<br>
The High Decka solemnly nodded but didn’t speak a word. The guardians packed themselves in tightly around shir, prepared to use their own bodies as a necessary shield if the need arose. After organizing themselves into a tight circle, they took long strides out from the canvas where Omnishala had been resting. Spears and halberds were held low, prepared to strike if anything unnatural should leap out and surprise them.<br>
<br>
Talosivin wondered where the Triumvirate of Protectors was. They would surely need their help if the fighting breached the castle’s outer walls. Not that that was likely. Maybe if their foes were gridikkors it was possible but gridikkors were growing scarce in this day and age. It would be foolish for them to wage any kind of war, since they would be unable to replace their losses once it was over. <br>
<br>
The armor of the guardians clanked and jostled with every brisk step as they made their way through the city and up to the castle gates. The streets still held a few scattered draconeers, who quickly backed out of the way as the escort marched by. The slickness on the ground was beginning to dry out, becoming more of a flaky crust overlapping the cobblestone. <br>
<br>
The royal guard was as taciturn as a church during silent prayer. The only sounds made were their plated helmets jangling as their wearers swept their gazes all around themselves. Their gray eyes scrutinized everything, sizing up even the smallest childlings as a possible threat. <br>
<br>
At last, they passed through the arch of the castle walls, where many more guards were lined up at statuesque attention on either side of a brick roadway that divided a green lawn and hedges equally in half. Thankfully, the fighting still hadn’t drawn close. Talosivin was beginning to think this might be just another drill. Without slowing one step, they continued on their trek. They passed through the main entry and stepped into the castle itself, leaving the shadow of the eclipse behind.<br>
<br>
The wide hallways were constructed from slabs of roughly cut gray stone, sticking out in uneven lumps from either side. The floor was a mass of cold stone as well––free of dust of course. The servants were always right on task when it came to keeping it spotless. A few lit torches rested in their racks, casting faint pools of light where needed. <br>
<br>
Members of the royal guard began to break off from the main convoy and take up positions in the halls, standing tall in their seemingly infrangible suits of silver armor. They rested motionlessly as they held long spears and halberds perpendicular to the ground.<br>
<br>
After their numbers had been greatly lessened; the entrance to the throne room came into sight. Talosivin and the remaining twenty guards now formed a thin ring of protection around Omnishala. The High Decka’s Emerald Clogs clicked as shi walked between them. By the somber expression on shir face, one might think shi was being dragged into a prison cell. Talosivin tried not to pay the High Decka’s dampened mood much piece of mind. Halting in front of the heavy-framed double doors, two of the guards marched off and swung each one all the way open. The rest of the guards and the High Decka proceeded to walk inside.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
At the end of the dark and dank tunnel, an active light stone hummed with a bright yellow radiance––to Sarakta’s delight. Felsheena and shi were now able to see an opening carved through the stone above them. What looked like a wooden barricade of sorts was at the opening’s end; it would have to be torn apart if they wanted to reach the top.<br>
<br>
“Looks like it’s too high for either of us to reach by ourselves. Come on, I’ll give you a boost,” said Sarakta as she knelt down low, spreading out shir spindly hands on the floor to brace shirself. As shi crouched down, shir dark greatcoat stretched taut across shir lissom body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Purple strands of hair rolled back across Felsheena’s face as she stared up to where the blockaded entrance was. “I believe it’s just blocked off by a wardrobe trunk. Do you think it will lead us to somewhere near the throne room?” She asked as she prepared to step onto Sarakta’s shoulders.<br>
<br>
Sarakta’s shoulders burned beneath the weight of Felsheena as she lightly stepped onto them with her sandals. Shir body trembled as shi stood up baring the woman’s light mass. Shi spoke in a strained, almost quivering voice. “It should bring us right into the High Decka’s bedchambers, which branch right off from the throne room. All we have to do is get in there and find a good hiding place until the High Decka arrives.” Shir whole body wobbled like a tipping stack of coins. “Could you please hurry, though? I don’t know how long I can balance you.”<br>
<br>
Felsheena placed both hands on the wooded surface above, struggling to push it upwards and away. It didn’t budge even a hair. Annoyed by its stalwartness, she bunched up her fist and pounded on it several times. As a result, dust floated down and landed on the tip of Sarakta’s muzzle, shi struggled as it almost evicted a sneeze out of shir nostrils. Shi managed to squeak out, “What’s the matter?”<br>
<br>
With a flick of the wrist and a flash of steel, Felsheena had her Sanct Knight blade drawn free. “This thing is bolted down pretty tight. I’m just going to have to slice our way through it.” She thrust the blade upward and it pierced through the wood as easily as a needle through a bubble. <br>
<br>
Sarakta’s bunny-like ears twitched with each moaning grate of the sword cutting through wood––It sounded louder than a lumberjack hacking through a tree!––Shir strength was about to fall away underneath the weight of shir companion. She called out desperately, “Please hurry! Also, try not to be so loud!”<br>
<br>
Shifting her body somewhat, Felsheena almost slipped from the other’s shoulders. “Don’t worry, almost there. And...there isn’t a quiet way to saw through wood!” At last, a circular hole was cut through the bottom of the wardrobe trunk. Piles of folded up outfits, dyed with various stripes and streaks of attractive colors, rained down on them from the opening. Sarakta collapsed beneath the onslaught of falling clothes, while Felsheena managed to grab hold of the edge above and pull herself up through their makeshift opening. She cleared some more garments out of the way above, then, using her elbow, she smashed the lid of the trunk open from its lock. Back above the opening, her rosy cheeks reappeared. She somehow laid flat and reached down a hand for Sarakta. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Sarakta knelt down low, then pushed high off the ground with shir powerful legs. The Sanct Knight caught hold of shir hand and lifted shir the rest of the way through the opening. They now found themselves in Omnishala’s bedchamber, a wide room with much extravagant decor.<br>
<br>
The stone walls climbed far above, to where they met at a right angle with a tiled ceiling. Each tile on the ceiling was engraved with the symbols of the Tetra, one in every corner. Truthfully, the Tetra was not actually the Tetra any longer. The might of Tetra came from four sacred wells, which were sometimes said to be linked with the spirit flow, and through the dance, remanan were able to summon its power. But the Tetra had been broken, a part of it was lost forever. During the Battle of Fotenburg; Griddikor had consumed water from the sacred well, which was the essence of life and wisdom. With the loss of water, the draconeers were no longer able to heal sick and wounded through the dance. Because of this, they despised the griddikors with a hatred so deep that it could likely fuel the fires in Tower Vozz. First they had tried to conquer the draconeers; then they drank from the sacred well as if it were just a thing to be pilfered. Despite Sarakta’s inherited misgivings for the griddikors, shi felt a little sorrow for them. Their kind would eventually perish forever since they could no longer produce offspring. <br>
<br>
Felsheena was absorbing in the vividness of the room around her. She appeared to be examining the large portraits of Omnishala that were hanging from the walls. One portrayed the High Decka sitting on a stool in the middle of a grassy meadow with the rainbow specks of butterflies flapping their wings in the background. Shir long legs were crossed with tender hands folded over the top of shir left knee. The long sloping brim of a flowery hat concealed shir gray eyes, but everything else about the portrait, aside from the garments shi was wearing, mirrored Sarakta to an exact cut-out replica. Glancing from Sarakta and back to the portrait, Felsheena couldn’t help but quietly muse to herself. “That is uncanny, who would have thought Hamotsfu would craft two beings so very much alike?” <br>
<br>
Sarakta shrugged shir shoulders. If shi hadn’t been born the same as Omnishala then shir life would have taken a much different course indeed. Probably a more fulfilling one, to say the least.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
The rest of the room held random pieces of art; sculpts of fighting draconeers, vases teeming with flowers of wild colors, a wind-up music box, and more paintings. A few looming wardrobes were on either side of the room, along with several red chests, outlined with fastenings of gold.  The high-posted bed at the room’s center looked large enough to fit the entire servants’ quarters under its velvet blankets, and still have room for the cooks!––well, maybe that was over exaggerating, but still, why would anyone need a bed so large? <br>
<br>
Felsheena and Sarakta pulled themselves away from the bedchamber, heading for the doors that connected to the hallway leading to the throne room. The hall was empty of course; everyone was in the inner city. Slits in the walls on the right side only cast narrow shadows of light. The eclipse must be well under way. Reaching the hall’s end, they shoved open another set of doors, these ones leading right into the throne room. They cautiously stepped inside, it was empty. A staircase leading up from the floor connected to the main entrance hall, sloping up to a higher floor, where a high-backed throne rested, gilded with jewels and pretty things like most thrones were. Royal-blue banners hung still-life from the ceiling; the symbols of the Tetra stitched into them with silver thread. A red curtain hanging down from the roof behind the throne encircled a small area, concealing whatever was inside. It was an altar where the Emerald Clogs were placed when they were not on the High Decka’s feet. Sarakta easily recollected the time shi had stolen them from there so long ago. But afterwards, shi was cast away into the Realm of Malediction along with the other wicked beings as punishment. Sometime shi felt it was a deserving penalty too; shi had caused a lot of death for nothing...<br>
<br>
Felsheena was near the main doorway, peering out through the crack of the two doors’ central opening. She spun back toward Sarakta, waving her hands to tell her to take cover. “A group of draconeers are coming! Quick, let’s get behind that curtain!” The red drape fluttered briefly as they both dashed behind it. Kneeling down, they listened to the approach of armored footsteps. The confined area they were in became stuffy and hot, drops of sweat raced down Felsheena’s forehead. The Sanct Knight turned and whispered, “I’d say there are about twenty of them. I should be able to take the guards...if you can deal with the High Decka. I’m not eager to phase stride, but I will if necessary. Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that.”<br>
<br>
*****<br>
Omnishala, Talosivin, and the rest of the royal guard funneled into the throne room. Upon entering, guards broke off and sealed off all the entryways and exits with bars of steel. While the doors were being locked, a dozen or so of them formed a half circle of spears facing toward the main entrance.   <br>
<br>
Talosivin, leading Omnishala by the hand, helped shir up the staircase. The High Decka wore a slight melancholy expression. Why was she so depressed? Shir Emerald clogs clapped against the stone as shi reached the top, then came to a halt as shi plopped down into shir throne like a rag doll. “This will all be resolved soon your Gracefulness. Who knows? It was probably just a false alarm. Rest assured, you are safe with us here.” Je informed shir affirmatively. <br>
<br>
Did the High Decka even hear jer? Shi didn’t move a wisp, but just sat and stared, blankly. Two members of the royal guard began to do a routine check of the room, to make certain there were no hidden assailants lying in wait. The muscular remon halfheartedly prodded their way through the throne room, holding a casual conversation with each other all the while. They examined things just to make themselves appear busy, until at last they made their way up to the red curtain behind the throne. Using the point of kes spear, one of them lazily pushed the drape aside. They were not ready for what they saw next. Both of the guards’ eyes went wide with astonishment as they uncovered a purple-haired woman and a remana, who was identical in appearance to Omnishala. They both gave out surprised yelps, drawing the attention of the other guards away from the door, who spun around on their heels and now hoisted their spears upward. They quickly realized that they were at a disadvantage, with their potential enemies being the ones nearer to the High Decka. <br>
<br>
Talosivin cleared jes eyes several times, in hopes that they were lying to him. Unbelievable, a twin of the High Decka! Je had heard of such a person once––an Unconsecrated One perhaps––  but thought it only a myth. Soon after, jes gaze was diverted from the draconeer by the other intruder.<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, the purple-haired woman produced a curved piece of steel in her right hand. It was perfectly elegant in shape and form, glistening an all-white aura that seemed to encompass the whole room. Etched into the flat side of the blade was the image of a hummingbird sipping nectar from a flower, along with swirly and curvy lengths of Hamotsfu lettering. She was a Sanct Knight, but what was she doing here?<br>
<br>
Regaining jes composure, Talosivin raised his weapon and shouted demandingly, “Sanct Knight! Who are you? Where do your allegiances lie?” The troops behind him clanked as they took several steps forward.<br>
<br>
The woman replied unabatedly, “I am Felsheena, Sanct Knight of Hamotsfu. My allegiances depend on your choice.” She stood in relaxation, but Talosivin was certain a coiled viper would be safer to handle.<br>
<br>
<br>
That name...she was an Unconsecrated One! But not really what je had been expecting from one that held that title. Talosivin called back, “If you wish to do any harm onto the High Decka then prepare to meet your fate on the end of our spears!” To emphasize jes point, je began to ease jes way forward. Omnishala rigidly sat in shir throne, detached from reality. Shi hadn’t stirred once the whole time. <br>
<br>
The Sanct Knight slid back on her heels and ran several fingers down the length of her resplendent sword. “You have decided for me, then.” Her deep-sea eyes became distant, seeming to fill with a tranquility that did not belong in a mortal’s stare. Unsure if the draconeer at the woman’s side was hostile or not, Talosivin decided to hold back on commanding jes troops to strike. A mistake that proved fatal.<br>
<br>
The Sanct Knight vanished from sight where she stood. Only one final thought passed through Talosivin’s mind before it was shredded into nothing more than gray bits of matter. Phase Strider.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Sarakta was preparing to Tetra Dance, but apparently Felsheena had taken the liberty to phase stride. It was a gruesome sight to behold; all at once, every single member of the royal guard exploded into a geyser of red, splattering the walls, the floor, and even Sarakta herself in a fine dressing of warm crimson. Their enemies had no time to react, no time to scream; they were just plain and simply, gone. Only the scattered, misshapen debris of their bodies and armor served as proof that they ever existed. The Sanct Knight’s blade had slashed through thick mail as smoothly as a knife traveling through butter, and the frightening thing about it was that it occurred all within the time it takes for a clock pendulum to tick.  <br>
<br>
After the slaughter, Felsheena reappeared near the edge of the steps and immediately knelt down in pain. Despite the ground she rested on being soaked with blood, she didn’t make any attempt to stand back up. Her eyes were bulging wide with anguish, as if they were about to pop out and roll to the floor.<br>
<br>
Sarakta scurried over and knelt beside her, placing the other’s arm over shir own shoulder to keep her from falling. Shi spoke quietly and with deep concern, “Are you all right?”<br>
<br>
The Sanct Knight managed to twist her neck and turn toward the other, “I believe so, but I was gone for an hour at least! It almost consumed me; it was like a struggle through a raging snowstorm to find my way back...” She placed a hand against her forehead and shook off any quirks. “I don’t want to return to that place ever again...” Ribbons of purple hung frayed to the sides of her head, but other than that, there seemed to be nothing different about her.<br>
<br>
Sarakta patted the other on the back and lifted her up to her feet. “You did well, thank you for helping me.” Shi had almost forgotten about the High Decka, whose eyes were now wider than lakes and staring blankly ahead. Beads of red streamed down the curvature of shir face––somehow, it didn’t bother shir––but it was not shir own blood, it was that of the guards. <br>
<br>
Following a few moments after Felsheena was back on her feet, many more armored boots could be heard stomping down the main entrance hall, accompanied by triumphant shouts that told of a victory in battle. <br>
<br>
Upon hearing these new shouts, Sarakta pointed back to the hallway the two of them had entered from. Shi bowed humbly before Felsheena. “Again, my gratitude is yours, but you must leave before the rest of them arrive. I’ll stay here and finish off Omnishala. It seems that she has become a mindless puppet.” Shi paused for a moment. “Someday, once things settle down, you can return here as my honorary guest, but now I have work to do. Goodbye Felsheena.” <br>
<br>
Felsheena nodded and saluted with her blade, before shoving it back into its rightful place. “Farewell, Sarakta. I don’t know where my path will take me from here. If all else fails, I suppose the life of a vagabond or hermit would be appealing in a way. There are still High Deckas out there who boil my blood though, as I’m sure they do yours as well. I think we were unjustly cast into the Realm of Malediction, by the Sovereign of the Roses and Omnishala. Still, we have to live what’s given to us now, even if our existence is destined to be cursed. Good fortune to you, may we one day meet again.” With that, the Sanct Knight dashed over to the barred door and threw the lock aside, disappearing down the hall as she made her way back to the tunnels.<br>
<br>
Now, time to deal with Omnishala. Sarakta nearly jumped out of shir skin as shi turned to see the High Decka standing silently behind shir. Omnishala reached out a shaky hand as shi spoke in a quiet tone. “Sarakta, my twin shilister, is that you?”<br>
<br>
Sarakta replied in a tone of disdain, “Yes, it’s Sarakta. I’ve come to take the Emerald Clogs, and your life.” Shi prepared to lunge, but the High Decka remained passive. Shouts of worriment rang out from the other side of the main entrance hall door, followed by an earth-cracking thumping and pounding.<br>
<br>
To Sarakta’s great astonishment, the High Decka slid shir feet free of the Emerald Clogs and kicked them toward shir twin. Shi continued speaking in an impassive voice, “Take them, and my life along with it. I humbly ask it of you.” Shi stopped for a few moments, then dropped shir voice into a melancholy tone, “But before I go, I have a guilty conscience that I need lifted.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta, not about to squander the opportunity, knelt down to gather the Emerald Clogs into shir arms. Shi tried to keep the other talking, “Go on, I’m listening. Spill your thoughts.”<br>
<br>
Omnishala continued on, “As you probably guessed; I murdered our shilstia. Do not worry though, shi broke shir neck on the first step. It was necessary that shi be removed because shi was too conservative. Shi refused to join the Fundament, since they were allied with the Gridikkor, but being closer to the Realm of Malediction than most, our kingdom needed all the support we could find. Our kind would have certainly perished had I not taken action and relieved shir of shir position.”<br>
<br>
“So, are you trying to make yourself feel like a hero? Just because you joined with the Fundament?” It actually was a great undertaking, most draconeers were against it at first. But after Dardaroff’s minions began to ravage the nearby plains; the populace conceded to the wisdom of joining with the Fundament. <br>
<br>
Omishala nodded in response, threads of shir silvery hair falling free from shir head. “True, I did feel like a hero for a long time, but after I learned of a new, unbeatable evil, I lost all hope...There is always a more powerful being that can sweep away all that once seemed omnipotent. Dardaroff was only the beginning, there comes another soon, a Dark Mother.” <br>
<br>
Sarakta’s voice took on a sardonic tone, “Let me take a wild conjecture, you dreamed it? Just like all your other dreams that never came true?”<br>
<br>
Omnishala’s voice took on a defensive edge, “They never came true because I prevented them from happening!” Shi quivered as fear rattled throughout shir bones. “But this...there is nothing I can do. I don’t want to be around when it comes.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta leaned to one side, resting a hand on shir hip. Shi added in a jovial tone, “So, you’re going to let me take the Emerald Clogs, usurp your throne, and take your life without raising a single finger in your own defense?” Shi shook shir head in disbelief. “This is too simple.”<br>
<br>
Omnishala respectfully answered, “You will do all that I ask of you then?”<br>
<br>
Sarakta  nodded in acquiescence. This seemed too good to be real, but shi would do as the High Decka asked.<br>
<br>
The High Decka wasn’t finished though, shi solemnly began apologizing, “This won’t make things any better, but I’m sorry for banishing you into the Realm of Malediction. You must understand though, the innumerable losses you inflicted on our own troops while impersonating me had to be punished to the harshest extent. I would have been exiled with you as well, had I not sided with the Sovereign of the Roses and sent you to Tower Vozz.” She continued on expectantly, “I hope you forgive me.”<br>
<br>
Sarakta crossed shir thin arms and shook shir head. “I don’t.” A steady, heavy thud came from the door below. It was creaking and bulging in on its hinges from the force of a battering ram. Shi could hear a gruff voice shouting out orders on the other side. <br>
<br>
Omnishala turned shir gaze toward the door, then looked back toward Sarakta one last time. “You shouldn’t have difficulty impersonating me, because we always were so much alike. You can always read my diary to learn of certain events, though in some places, it might have frightening excerpts.” Shi slowly lifted shir arms and spread them out like wings to either side. “I’m ready now.”<br>
<br>
Omnishala didn’t so much as let out a peep or squeal as a spear point was driven clean through shir head, impaling it like a pike through a watermelon.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
Just outside the throne room, Nefalak was worried almost to the point of tears. Ke kept telling kemself that the High Decka was fine, just fine...Well, one more push from the makeshift battering ram and they would know for certain. Back a short distance down the hall, two rows of remon held up a pillar of toppled stone between them. Heaving and grunting, the remon charged forward once again, this time hammering the doors clear off their foundations upon impact. After the doors crashed to the ground, the massacre which must have happened only moments earlier was laid bare to all the eyes that now grimly stared upon it. Nefalak clanked to kes knees, nearly sobbing as ke pitifully buried kes face into kes hands. Ke had failed the High Decka. <br>
<br>
One of kes soldiers let out a joyous cry, “Someone is moving in there!” An intermediate pause, then the soldier shouted with zest, “It’s the High Decka! Shi’s alive!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
