&quot;Anyway,&quot; Lenore said, in an attempt to lighten the suddenly dark atmosphere, &quot;let me see what I can conjure up for a little entertainment.&quot;  she began to chant, and the air shifted around her, and a little bear cub now stood beside the druid.<br>
The little bear frolicked at Lenore's feet, causing a few chuckles to echo in the room.<br>
&quot;Now, we just need a little playmate for you,&quot; she said affectionately, and scratched the cub on his head.  The bear lowed softly, a happy sound, and proceeded to sniff around for morsels of food.<br>
Lenore watched as the bear entertained the guests, by walking on his hind legs, and receiving morsels of food as rewards.<br>
