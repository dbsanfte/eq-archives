In other words, this isn't a black and white issue. It was reasonable for DoW to assemble when they realized SR hadn't gone in 8 hours after the start of their book time. On the other hand, once it became obvious SR intended to use the booking after all, they should have gone somewhere else.<br>

Sorry.  DoW entered PoF on that Monday, during the SR scheduled raid time, AFTER SR had broken the plane, and while SR was actively clearing it.  Wolfy sees your argument, which is not the same thing as seeing &quot;your way.&quot;  He also says you shoulda headed elsewhere.  That *isn't* seeing it your way.<br>
<br>
So far as the ninja-looting incident, the actual person who pulled shissar from the temple, whoever that was, still has yet to step up and say, &quot;I pulled Shissar for X guild.&quot;  Produce your puller, saying he was the one to grab Shissar from the spawn point, and you'll win that argument hands down.

The first is your spokesman, which we both seem to agree doesn't help your case.  The second is the fact that most of the people who are publicly posting negative opinions about your guild have had run-ins of some sort with your guild.  Your GUILD has a reputation of running people over.  Not Kaurik -- other than his attitude (which I have encountered in game as well as on the boards) -- but your GUILD.  And your officers have a reputation of not caring that your guild runs people over.<br>
<br>
And that reputation isn't because of anything said on these boards.  It's because of events that happened in game.  It's an old, old reputation -- MY last in-game run-in with DoW was probably well over a year ago.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, barring forces to change reputations, they tend to last.  Once you've earned a nasty label, it takes multiple positive acts towards the people who felt wronged before they will start to change their opinions of you.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the reputation outlasts the memory of the incident.  I've distrusted DoW for a long time, but I only have a vague memory of being muscled out of camps and KS'd.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Kaurik -- what I have against you is because EVERY time you have anything to say to me, you're quite rude.  You complained that I didn't give you your password because you asked for it in an untitled thread I hadn't read -- and you acted like it was MY fault I didn't see it.  You encountered a bug in the software, and you were rude about it again.  You have referred to what I've done on Inny.com in nothing but negative terms.  On other issues, every time you comment on something I've said, you make it personal.<br>
<br>
You've lashed out at me more than enough times, I think.  You've certainly done it with a lot more vitriol than I've displayed towards you.<br>
<br>
And you treat just about everyone else on these boards the same way, with an apparant complete disrespect for anyone who doesn't kiss your arse.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, you've gone out of your way to make sure I'd feel about you the way I do.  My attitude isn't going to change before yours does.<br>

Well, a few questions.  Yes, this directly applies to this issues, but let's step away from which guild is which right now.<br>
<br>
Let's assume there's a race for a coveted mob.  Guild A and Guild B are both pulling mobs out of the way.  Guild A agroes the mob first.  At this point, I think we're all agreed that guild B would be KSing if they tried to pull the mob off guild A's puller.<br>
<br>
But let's say pullerA dies partway back to camp, maybe much closer to spawn point than campA.<br>
<br>
If the mob returns to his base point, is it okay for guild B to pull it?<br>
<br>
What if the mob is corpse camping, roaming around, or heading back to spawn point?<br>
<br>
Assume at this point guild B does agro the mob and start bringing it to their camp -- whose mob is it now?<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
From the things that have been posted on this issue, it sounds possible -- maybe even likely -- that DoW agroed shissy first, but their puller died.  TP then agroed the loose mob and began pulling it to their camp.  It's unclear whether they agroed it inside or outside the temple.  At that point, DoW peeled it off TP's puller.<br>
<br>
When you take another group's pull, that's called &quot;KSing&quot;.<br>
<br>
But it would be interesting to see how people feel about my questions above.<br>

<br>
I tend to stay off the DoW-hating bandwagon for a few reasons. First, and most germane: I personally have not had a problem with any member of DoW. I tend to form my opinions for myself, when I have a basis for doing so. <br>
<br>
Second: it is very, very easy (lazy, really) to accept reputation as reality, and to apply that to all situations across the board. They have a reputation for being inconsiderate and rude, therefore they would train, KS and ninja. Sorry, doesn't follow.<br>
<br>
Third, I am consistently impressed with Chargron's reasoned and polite responses. If we're judging people by the company they keep, I tend to judge based on the good as well as the bad and the merely annoying.<br>
<br>
Finally, a friend of mine joined Relentless Winter back in the day. I knew him to be a decent and honorable person, and I knew their rep, so I was curious about his reasons for joining them. But I trust his judgement and he said they were a good bunch overall, if a bit rowdy. His name was Debat. I don't think he plays anymore due to real life constraints.<br>
<br>
As opinions tend to be, mine are subjective, of course.<br>
<br>
I have no opinon of the events in Fear on that fateful night as I was not present, or affected in any way.<br>

If the puller died during the attempt of the pull but didn't actually make the pull then I'd say it's open to take still.  If the puller died after the mob had actually been pulled though then I'd say it still belongs to the group pulling.  As far as if they mob has returned to his base point, to me it still belongs to the group who pulled.  The reason is that once a mob is aggro then it belongs to the group who caused the aggro until they are shown not to be able to handle it (ie. they all die).  In your questions though I'm assuming only the puller has died.  One death does not mean you can't handle the pull.  What I can see happening is that many people may decide that since this mob is not an ordinary mob then ordinary rules don't apply.  That could work, but only if everybody was working off the same sheet of music.<br>
<br>
The real questions would be who had aggro first and if trains were caused for the reason to KS.  As both you and I have stated, we can't be sure since neither of us were there, but also both groups have accused the other of training.  One thing I see going against TP is that they have said a GM was there watching (correct?).  If a GM was there and trains actually happened then why did the GM not do something about that?  That to me sounds like one of the lies most people are accusing DoW of.  I've had neither a good experience nor a bad experience with either guild so I'm not going off old experiences as others are.  I'm just trying to read through the muddle this thread has become.<br>

And if the puller dies, it's not actually agro anymore.  Because it's not agro anymore, just going near it will take agro.<br>
<br>
But I suggest that if two guilds are racing for a mob such as shissy, you can't expect guildB to avoid the pull if the mob is not agro'd at the time they see it.  If pullerA is dead, then the mob is not agro'd.<br>
<br>
If guildA did all the work to clear the area to the mob, guildB should leave alone.  But if guildB did a lot of the work, then a free mob is a free mob.<br>
<br>
After all, you could argue that guildA took too many shortcuts if their puller couldn't even pull something like shissy.  They rushed, they blew it, they lose.<br>
<br>
It's a messy one, I think we're all agreed on that at least.<br>

3)You don't like how Kaurik communicates with people<br>
<br>
And the whole reason the GM sided with TP is because they looted the head, and it is unclear who has aggro first. So that leaves a total of ZERO(0) valid reasons to say TP is right in this.<br>
<br>
Edit: To Belcasor: No one hit the head on anything here buddy, It's agreed by pretty much everyone here except you that the only real and valid proof of who had aggro first would be a screenshot from the puller getting the aggro msg. This whole thing is pretty much people posting that they think DoW KS'd TP because they hate Kaurik for calling them a poopoo head and we have a bad rep that was made long ago.<br>

Most of DoW's bad rep is blown out of proportion by the people it happened to when Kaurik calls them a piece of @#%$. Also, the members who established the bad rep are gone. In Ugle's case it was Salahm and Tormu, both of which are gone. And sorry but you're an idiot if you call Guild 1 a bad guild because a year or so ago that had a member who KSed and is gone now~! and as far as those events being approved by the officer, that's bull @#%$. <br>
    DoW doesn't approve of training, KSing, or ninja looting. However, DoW also says if you accused one of our members of training, KSing, or Ninja Looting, you must provide proof to us, other wise we're just going to tell them 'if you're training or KSing or Ninja Looting, stop.' And I'm sorry you were mistreated Ugle but like I've said before that happened a long time ago and it's stupid to say that we still do stuff like that when we haven't done it and the people who did it are gone~! I think most have us have come to accept the bad rep we were branded with a long time ago, but that doesn't make it okay to say we are at guilt because of it. And DoW has NEVER ninja looted anything, so well if we haven't had one strike then it can't be three stikes, you're out.<br>

<br>
Wolfy - Again thank you for the work you do for the inny.com community.  I understand your position on my guild, I just hope you would treat encounters with my guild on a case to case basis.  I would hope that even if you choose to &quot;proceed with caution&quot; when you see a DoW tag, you would still proceed.<br>
<br>
Everyone else - I would hope that you wouldn't judge members of my guild based on thin assumption.  Also, Belcasor was a long time (and well liked, at least by me) member of DoW.  Just figured that should be made clear as he and Kaurik have some bad blood and he seems to want to pee on DoW. <p>Chargron <BR>

<br>
Is Kaurik still in DoW?  Hmm, maybe I still have people that have done some of these stunts in your Guild.  I could go back to some of those old threads if they are around and look at your members that replied at that time, odds are at least some of them are still Guilded.  Obviously I can't expect you to remove them from your Guild for stuff that happened in the past, and hope you will understand that as long as they are still in the Guild it's hard not to hold a grudge.  Hell, two+ years ago the Fishermen in Oasis killed Ugle when he was like L7, and I still kill them everytime I go through there with any of my characters.  The stupid little Vendor by P2 that killed me before gets whacked everytime I pass through there as well.  You'd be surprised how long of a memory Trolls can have.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to see that you are trying to repair your Guild's rep though.  So your Guild charter has changed?  Because from a few long, long talks with one of your officers in the past NL'ing was the only offense that you guys cared about.  But, that was a while ago that I had that talk, so maybe you've changed your stances somewhat.  In any case, if you don't want to use my name in this thread anymore, then I won't display it in the posting column for now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uchargron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chargron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://chargron.freeservers.com/images/greenbayflag2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/26/02 9:29:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=442.topic&index=156>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://chargron.freeservers.com/images/monica[1].jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: TP are ninja looting @#%$ sucking mother @#%$ </span><hr size=1> Not trying to repair any image.

only people i can remember off the top of my head are Woot and Weadreallylongweirdname.  i'm pretty sure Woot wasnt training us cuz i never even saw him , but Wead seemed to enjoy making laps around the portal with run song on.  there were only 6 LoD in the plane though and we didnt see them even fighting anything , just Wead training @#%$ , until it was broken then the other 8 zoned in.<br>
<br>
i dont expect anything to be done about it , not from LoD anyway.  you guys arent the ones that ninja'd , even though Mixo died 3 times trying.  technically nobody from LoD did anything wrong if you dont mind the fact he was trying to ninja or the fact that Wead enjoys run song and the Indi 500 around the portal.<br>
<br>
it's an old thread that's not going to change.  TP thinks what they think (anyone seen them even reply lately?  no?  didnt think so.) and we think what we think and everyone else think what you're gonna think.  this thread is just redundant and boring now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukilamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/26/02 10:20:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=442.topic&index=158>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: TP are ninja looting @#%$ sucking mother @#%$ </span><hr size=1> Wolfy, you have keep twisting things until you think you can get them to convince us of your thoughts on this.
