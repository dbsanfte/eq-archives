He opened the ziploc back with leather bike gloves, cut off at the fingers, and inhaled deeply. The blue leaves and buds inside simply reeked with the scent of high quality. The two other figures in the room (anyone who wants to join &amp; describe a char. This isn't as much fantasy as it is character developement for a while now. 'sides, I wanted to try a futuristic approach <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) sat in the purple smog, but their actions were, for the moment, unnoticed by Derek.<br>
<br>
The blue streaks in his spiked-back hair gave off a strange glow in the dim black lights of the small, cozy room. The apartment was huge for the rent, and this room was the designated &quot;smoke shack&quot;. Derek smiled. The pale skin reflected the sheen of the blacklight, even in the purple smog of the hydrike. The blue buds of the delicious, illegaly smuggled goods glittered as he pulled them from the bag. Kissing it once, he stuffed it into a metal bowl on the end of a long, blue, twisting acryllic tube. He smiled to himself, and sparked up on the end of his wicked, 2 ft. long knife. The flame at the hilt jumped to life, and he pulled the purple smog, which appeared red in the special tubing, up to his lips. Removing the bowl, he took in every precious little bit of hydrike, sat back, and let out his breath through the nostrils.<br>
<br>
He cynched the bag up, and tossed it and the bong to the next in the circle. &quot;Does anyone know why Kydosynche stopped dealin? I mean, did he do it to us, like, just us? Or did he get stomped out by tha fridge fukkks?&quot;<br>
<br>
Waving a hand, Derek reached a small, inch long piece of plastic. He pushed the single button, and the miniature speakers stopped blaring out sound. A split second and a button-push later, a different beat, with bass chords pumping and ripping through his relaxed body sounded. He almost didn't hear the reply from across the room...<br>

Her hair was long and shoved into a pony tail high on her head. With waving locks of chocolate hair spilling over her shoulders she layed still, her nap interupted by Derek's voice. What did he say? She didn't catch it. A black leather cord ran around her arm with a string dangling from it that held a small polished stones at the end that jangled when hitting a second strand. Her name was Nefertiti, she was named after some old dead chick that no one cared about anymore. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm tryin to sleep here! Show some respect, daaang..&quot;<br>
<br>
Rolling over on her other side she faces the coach and hopes that Derek'll shut up long enough to let her catch a few Z's. One of her loose black canvis pant legs was up around her knee from tossing and turning while napping. She had recently visited her folks house and it was obvious because long white cat hairs stood out against her rather tight sleevless black tank top. It was bad enough she had parents let alone she had to visit them. &quot;We worry&quot;. If her eyes were open she would have rolled them at the thought of *them* worrying about *her*.

Sweet tea. Very sweet.&quot; He thought to himself. A split second later a drink despencer burst through the doors. &quot;Here is your tea, sir,&quot; said a mechanical voice from inside the machine. &quot;Took you long enough. Here's your payment.&quot; Grabbing the packet and tossing a couple dollars over his shoulder he sat back down. Sipping on his tea he thought about how hard life was now'days. 'Rents always wondering what you're doin', like it's any of thier business. His eyes drifted off and he began to think about who he was. <br>
  &quot;I am Jash. Jash McKing. I have black hair with white lightening stripes streaking through it. Now what have I accomplished..well, I managed to out-run the cops a few times when they caught me grinding that rail near the library, I busted up that punk's face when he tried to mug me, and I am the best in town at Tryck (hoverboard sport...can't have a future without hoverboards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).

I'll leave now.&quot; Nearly jumping off the couch he made his way to his room where he grabbed his hoverboard and jummped out the window, grinding neatly down the wall. &quot;Ahhhh...this is all I need in life..just me and my board..&quot;<br>

She had a brown bag with her, which she quickly identified to the group as 'Chineese'.  Sitting on the floor in front of Nefi she reached in the bag and took out a small carry out box of curry, which she delicatly balanced on Nefi's temple as she slept.  Next she looked over at Derek.  &quot;You, you don't get jack 'till I see some money.&quot;  She waved a box of curry tantalizingly, hoping he would cough up the cash.<br>

If he hadn't known Jash since the second grade, he'd have taken the abrupt exit as a diss. Oh well, he left his hydrike... Derek smiled to himself as he lifted the other half-full bag, and dumped the rest into his own nearly depleted plastic container. He stared at the machine that was currently watching him. He hated owning machines. Derek opened his mind again, and, along with a flip of his fingers, sent a push of Willforce towards the damn dispenser. It skidded out of the tiny upwards sliding doorway before crashing into the wall.<br>
<br>
He needed focus. Derek lifted the bong again, and cashed out a few more leaves before he walked into the middle of the room. He really did feel sorry for both Titi and Jash. They had parents. Derek didn't know if he could actually deal with having an adult controlling his life, or &quot;suggesting&quot;, as they called it now, on his current situation. He was making good money, the how wasn't important. Derek sat cross legged in the middle of the room, his left hand outstretched and open, the right with two fingers extended and touching his forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kami sami naah... Kami sami naah... Kami sami naah...&quot; he chanted. He could feel his will spreading again. Mental excersises were the most common form of excersise anyone bothered with anymore. Well, most people. Derek made sure to keep his good build. He could feel a ring spread out from him, and eventually it took up the whole of the spiraled mat. Could he...?<br>
<br>
Derek tried one last time at his levitation attempt. With both hands facing upwards on his knees, he raised them high, grunting with the mental exertion. The mat started lifting... YES! FINALLY! Not quite an inch off the ground, Derek let his mind go slack. His head throbbed. That was hard...<br>
<br>
He looked to the left, and saw Nefertiti on the couch. Whether it was the nefer or the titi part of her name she hated, or the fact that her parents named her, he still hadn't concluded. Derek and Titi (Tee-tee, as he calls her) had known each other for years now. He remembered his younger days at the orphanage, and how she came to play there all the time. She envied those kids without parents, he guessed.<br>
<br>
None of that mattered now, though. Derek never thought about the past. He scooted over to Nefertiti and put a hand up. She rolled over in her sleep before he could touch her, and she was facing away from him. Bad dreams? He'd help.<br>
<br>
Touching his Willforce again, Derek gently touched Nefertiti's back. It was a procedure most people are taught, as your aura and chakras should always be well-kept. He started to massage her back, and a soft moan escaped her lips. Hey, that's always a good thing to hear... Derek kept moving his fingers as if his leather bike gloves didn't interfere with his movement. He kept pushing lines of her aura back into place, and massaging tired muscles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 11:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> ((Woah.

Looking up from Nefertiti, he watched Mika. Derek could never tell whether she wanted him, was a friend, or deathly hated him. He sighed, &quot;Women.&quot; He picked up the plastic remote with a single button. He pushed it, and and a box under the couch he was sitting on previously slid out. Grabbing the cash, he counted out five bills. He tossed them to Mika as she lobbed the curry towards him. &quot;Hey Mika. Guess what I finally did today?&quot;<br>
<br>

Food. Her eyes flutter open. It had been days since she had eaten, she was sleeping her life away, but sleep was easier to deal with than living, wasn't it? Sitting up with a groan she picks up the food that Mika brought her. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are a god sent!&quot; Flinging open the top to the container she picks up some chop sticks. Shoving some into her mouth she savors her first bite. A growl from her stomach confirms the fact that chinese food is the best out there. <br>
<br>
&quot;I... love you!&quot; Setting down her chop sticks she wraps her arms around Mika and hugs her tightly. Kissing her lightly on the cheek she goes back to her food. <br>
<br>
Mika hadn't been around for as long as the rest of them had, but she was probably Nefertiti's favorate. For reasons Nefertiti didn't know, Mika had always taken care of her. When things got bad, Mika made them better. And when things got good, she helped make/keep it that way. <br>
<br>
Nefertiti stops shoving food in her mouth long enough to look up at Derek and say, &quot;I know I've never been able to do it&quot; All that mind stuff was harder for her, when it shouldn't be. Maybe her mind wasn't strong enough. Maybe it wasn't clear enough. Or maybe she just plain sucked at it. In any case, people had tried to help her but no one seemed to be able to do much. That was just one more thing wrong with her added to her never ending list.<br>

His skin was pale, and his hair black-blue.  His hair was long, but not for style.  He had always been to lazy to cut it, but maybe lazy wasn't the right word.  No, Jerron wasn't lazy, he was just self involved.  His lips were colorless and thin.  Rarely did he wear an expression whether it be hapiness or sadness.  His most startling feature would be said to be his eyes.  Through a birth defect, they never stayed the same color.  In a matter of minutes, they could go from green to blue to black to red.  He stared disdainfully at the rest with his now stark blue eyes, corrupting their minds with the 'stuff.'  The acceptance of narcotics into society had been quick after their ill affects had been supposedly genetically removed.  No longer did narcotics eat away at your brain, but they took away your individuality!  They supposedly set you free, but into what!  I self imposed prison of bright colors and mindlessness?  They detracted from the abilities of the mind.  By making thoughts more chaotic and random one loses their natural mental capabilities!  Yes you can take the 'red pill' to imediately stop their effects, but no one uses it.  No one uses it because they can't!  He muttered under his breath, &quot;Your wasting your lives, your pitiful usessless lives.&quot;  To himself, he thought, your all lower than me.  Your filth, the dirt I scrape from beneath my finger nails!  Subconsciously, Jerron resented the world, because he imposed upon himself a veiw of lonliness and fear.  He guard was always up against the scornful words and attacks of others, yet they never came.

She opened it slowly, letting the steam fill her nostrils.  Then she dug in, not stoping to talk or rest until the entire box was empty.  When she had finished she left her chopsticks sticking out of the empty box on the floor and reached into her bag for a cigarette.  With a trick of her mind she lit it and inhaled deeply.  Nothing like the post meal smoke.  When her mind had cleared she looked over at Jerron.  &quot;So did he do it or is he just @#%$ with me?&quot;  She asked.  Jarron, as usual, sat in the chair looking utterly bitter.  speaking to the room now Mika pointed out, &quot;Nefi was asleep, and Jarron . . . well, you know.

Swallowing hard, he took a sip from a twisting glass of bright blue liquid. &quot;Mika. I'm a drug dealer, not a psychic. I don't think I even got *enough* chronic to get me hyped to do it again. Gimme a few, aight?&quot;<br>
<br>
He cleared his mind. Time to recoup. Time to recharge. Time to.... well, smoke. Packing another crystallic bud into the metal bowl, Derek sparked up the end of his knife again. With the chamber full of red smoke, he twirled the knife a bit. &quot;Hey Jerron, want a hit?&quot; he asked, holding the bong out to him. Derek knew what the answer would be. He resisted it like he was some kind of law-abiding citizen. In reality, he probably wanted to destroy society more than the rest of us, and could most likely do it. Oh well; his brother was a good customer. But shhhh, he dun no dat!<br>
<br>
Derek held out the bong to Mika after taking in half of the thick smoke. He blew it out, and the haze thickened in the room after the majority of it escaped when she opened the door. Purple smog rolled out of the top slowly. &quot;Want some? Better hurry, the chamber's spillin. 'N I'll do the levitation in a bit. Just take a hit, and show me first, eh?

Her stomach was as full as it had ever been but she still felt pains emitting from it. She ate too fast. Feeling like she was going to be sick for more reason’s than the obvious she smiles sweetly and walks to the bathroom. She never had been one to throw up after eating; she always thought eating disorders were for the ignorant. Closing the bathroom door behind her quietly she locks it. With her back against the door she slides to the floor, her arms pressing against her midsection. Gods, what was this pain? Reaching into her pocket she produces a tiny golden box. ‘Red pills’ stopped all effects of drugs, but Nefertiti found it also doubled as a very strong painkiller… if you had enough. Not just painkillers, thought killers. They would shut down your brain if you took enough. No one would know that though, no one used them… No one but Nefertiti. Opening the box she reveals five perfectly rounded blood red pills. Normally she only took three, but with every breath she took the pain in her abdomen increased. She could feel it spread to her mind. Her thoughts, her emotion, her soul, all ached. A mechanical groan, the kind a machine might make, screams inside her head with every beat of her heart. Faster and faster… her pulse was quickening. Tossing her head back she opens her mouth and rolls the five red pills in. Swallowing hard she lets them continue their journey to her stomach. If only they worked faster… It would take time for whatever chemicals they held to disperse throughout her body. Taking a deep breath and closing her eyes, she pulls her knees to her chest and waits. She had taken five this time… she’d never taken that many before… She had no idea what to wait for, all she knew is that she wanted it to come faster. <p><Br> <Br> <Br> <Br> Your head will collapse <Br> But there's nothing in it <Br> And you'll ask yourself <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Wheeeeeere iiis my mind?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/usuedydar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suedydar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Souls</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 3:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1>   Riding down to the skate park Jash plunged into the bowl. Thrusting forwards with a little help of his mind he grinds around the edge. &quot;Ahhh, this is much better than hydryke(sp?). Pure natural, not made from something,&quot; thinking to himself Jash loses his concentration and falls on his face.<br>
&quot;...Ouch..&quot;<br>
&quot;C'mon, Jash? Wiping out? Hahahaha!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh man, you're so lame. You've really lost it since you quit taking hydryke.&quot;<br>
&quot;Here, have some of mine.&quot;<br>
&quot;I think I'll pass.&quot; Grabbing his board Jash glides away to the library for another attempt at the rail near the library. <br>
  Glancing around quickly to make sure the cops aren't watching he lands and old trick he was taught called a 50-50 Grind. &quot;Too easy..time for another pass.&quot; Once again he grinds down the rail. Sirens sound immediatly. &quot;Oh no! Caught!&quot; &quot;Hey you! Stop!&quot; &quot;Time to go!&quot; Excerting all of his mental power to speed up his board Jash finally escapes the cops with a few turns and tricks. &quot;I better head back home and lay low for a bit.&quot; Turning around South, he heads home for the night.<br>

Good for you!&quot; Plucking his bong out of Devin's hands, Derek inhaled the last bit of the hydrike that *hadn't* spilled out by now. Why they don't smoke anymore was beyond him. Not like it hurts. Besides, they hand out with *him*... they should expect to be gettin pretty well fuckd up just from the smog in the room.<br>
<br>
He pointed to Devin. &quot;You got the visuals and yer physical @#%$. Of course you wanna challenge us to a duel, you can buff yerself. But me, well...&quot;<br>
<br>
Derek smiled, and shoveled more curry into his mouth. &quot;I can influence. I @#%$ with yer mind. Gimme a month. I'll be able to block your mentalities,&quot; sighing contently, he put his feet up on the small table in front of him, and set down the overused bong. Time to replace the coolant filter. 'I just wonder if I actually *can* block someone's Willforce... If I try hard enough, maybe someday. A month? Pshhh...'<br>
<br>
Looking thoroughly unimpressed, Mika asked again, &quot;So what's the plan for tonight? Are we partying??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes yes yes, we're partying. Zim's got the entire landing pad to himself. He's only your guys's age, so he don't have his own place, but the 'rents are out for months. Seein Neptune or somethin.&quot; He saw Nefertiti visibley shiver. &quot;Yea. S'wat I'm sayin. He said bring your own smoke, cigs, drink, snort, or shots.&quot; He looked to Jerron, who had finally boarded back up into the window. &quot;That means no more needles for you, Jerron! Hehehehh...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll be leavin in a few hours then, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea. I gotta make a few more deals, tho. Make yerselves at home till I get back. I'll pick you up when Z drops a com.&quot; Derek picked up his cellcom, opened a tiny fridge and removed a two-pound brick of blue, and shoved it into a space saver in his coat. Scent proof, of course. No oinkers gettin *him* today.<br>
<br>
He slapped hands with Jerron and Devin, sayin, &quot;I'm out.&quot; Derek then moved to Nefertiti and touched her shoulder, then repeated the process with Mika. &quot;Don't steal much.&quot;<br>
<br>
The door slid open, and he removed the blue glowing keys from his shortcoat pocket. The bike gloves creaked as he dropped the wicked knife to the magnetic sheath on his right hip. Derek was still wearing his black leather pants that were tight at the skinny waist, but were baggy enough to fit four of his legs in each pant leg. The spikes on shoulders and wrists of the black shortcoat sparkled in the flourescent lighting of the metallic hallway. Too bright. Derek tapped the headband that he kept hidden under a few black or blue spikes of hair, and darkness covered his eyes. He loved these multi-function mindbands. They were almost a necessary way of life.<br>
<br>
Derek opened his cellcom and pushed the single red button, while thinking &quot;Creeter&quot;. The number was dialed, and he said, &quot;Special delivery.&quot;<br>
<br>
The expected answer came from a voice, synthesized for saftey, &quot;Wrong number, caller.&quot; Caller meant get over here. Fool meant get here now. Dude meant get away. Thus, the code for his customers. Derek stepped into a room when the metallic door opened the complete opposite of his own; clean, well lit, organized, without boxes of Chinese and bottles laying around. Creeter didn't have people staying there all the time, though. Without another word, Derek slapped down the brick on the glass table. He removed his knife, and a laser edge glowed on the blade when he squeezed the hilt right. Sheering off layers and picking out buds of leaves, he slapped it into a weightless plastic bag. He handed it to Creeter, who weighed it on the mini calculator in his pocket; they perform *every* mathematic equation nowadays. He nodded and handed Derek a plastic card. Flicking it twice, the punk with pale skin walked out of the well-dressed man's apartment. Derek made three more stops, one to an old man, one to a young couple, and one to another business man-type before walking back to his place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uparadisetheheretic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paradise the Heretic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Decay</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 12:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> Mika had turned her attention to Nefi who was looking rather ill.  &quot;you ok sweetie?&quot;   <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 1:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: S'just Life.</span><hr size=1> OOC (I like your story Mindles!
