He told me of a fantastical weapon only children of the druid arts can wield. He told me he needed some items and if I returned them he would create this weapon for me. He then told me to seek out a brother of his, a withered treant, as he is so old, his name has been forgotten. I did as instructed and he asks for me to seek out the corruption of the lands of Antonica.<br><br>I happened to come across a hill giant in my travels, and when I killed him, he had the most peculiar item on him. I knew I had found one of the corrupted beings I was instructed to find, as I could feel the corruption vibrating from the object. It was a horrible feeling, and I could feel the pain of nature whilst holding this thing. <br>On another sojourn into the icy wastes known as Everfrost Peaks, I happened across one of the gentle mammoths that roam, and it was acting strangely. As I moved towards it, I could see the pain in its eyes, almost begging me to end its misery. I sent up a prayer to Karana, and did what the beast asked of me. I watched in awe, just as the great beast fell, that there was no body, only a small block of what looked like clay. As with the item from the giant, I felt the corruption vibrate from it as well. I had to go back to the Withered One and ask him what was happening. I showed him the items, and he seemed pleased. He informed me there was more corruption, and to seek it out within the waters of Rathe. So it seems I travel there next.<br><br>While I was passing through the lake of Rathe, I smelled a peculiar odor. Rathe always has an odor, since a band of gnolls make their home there, but this was different. I followed the scent while in the form of a brother in fur, and found what I was searching for. Beneath the waves, near an island inhabited by majestic avian creatures, is an underwater tower. The smell brought me closer to the tower. And there before me was a aquagoblin. I knew I had found one of the corrupted creatures the withered one spoke of. When the creature lay dead, an eerie silence followed, and it vanished, leaving behind what appeared to be a flask of water. The water is undrinkable, and it reeked. I knew I had found the final object of corruption. I gathered the remaining objects and returned to the withered one. I handed him the objects, and he began to tremble. The plains grew dark, and lightning crashed, then was suddenly gone. And where the withered one once stood, a small object lay on the ground. I gently picked it up, and realized it was a heart. I carefully placed it in my pack and as I turned to go, a voice echoed to me. 'Take this, my heart, to Yeka Ias. He roams in the Karana plains, and he will know what to do with it'. and I could have sworn I heard the sound of laughter, almost as if someone had a secret joke. So, doing as instructed, I found this person. He had an evil aura around him, and he seemed rather pleased I had a treant heart to offer him, but as soon as he touched the heart, he began to convulse in pain, screaming obscenities I don't ever recall hearing in my life. And when the smoke cleared, a clear orb lay on the ground. I picked it up, and felt a wave of peace fill me. The orb glowed and felt cleansed. This was one of the cleansed spirits Xanuusus spoke of. I placed it in a safe place, and continued my search.  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:24:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Well, seems I found some more corruption in the land. I was wandering around the Lesser Faydark, and encountered a unicorn. This one seemed to be wounded, pained, but not in the physical sense. After talking to her, she informed me she is in contact with Xanuusus, and she also wants me to find corruption on the Faydwer continent. Eager to help, I offered my service to her.<br>Just as I was about to leave, a pesky little brownie decided to attack me. This one was very dangerous looking, almost feral. So, after a lengthy fight, and a close call with death, the brownie lay dead at my feet. Just as I was about to bury the body, it vanished, and a branch now lay where the body was. It reeked of corruption, so I knew I had found one of the items the unicorn needed. The unicorn nodded her approval, and told me where to possibly find more corruption. The abandoned, underwater keep of Kedge, and the Ocean of Tears, she told me to look. I bid her farewell, and headed to the docks of Butcher Block, to catch the boat into the vast expance of water know as the Ocean of Tears. I needed to go there anyway. That is the only place to get a rare delicacy.<br>The Marr cherry.<br>I have learned how to make them into a wonderful snack, and was in need of more. So, while I was picking some of these cherries, a nearby band of adventurers were engaged in a battle with one of the cyclops that roam around. I offered my services, and they were grateful. When the fiend lay dead, a foul oder filled the air. I recognized the smell immediately, and asked them for the item. I knew it was another corrupted item the unicorn needed. Perplexed, but willing to let me have it, I took what looked like a large vine. I thanked the adventurers, and went back to picking cherries. At the end of the day, I had enough cherries to make a party plate of the chocolate covered cherries. I made my camp for the night, and decided to make a trip to Kedge sometime soon.<br><br>I did manage to make my trip into the forgotten city of Kedge. The fish that inhabit this place are beautiful, but deadly. Especially the seahorses. Seahorses are normally docile creatures, but the ones in Kedge are almost feral, having been isolated from outside contact for so long. Just as we were about to leave, an extremely feral seahorse charged at us, and a battle began. Just before he died, I thought I saw a look of gratitude in its face, as if thanking me for ending its pain and suffering. Just as he died, a crystal lay on the floor. I picked up the beautiful crystal, but felt the corruption eminating from it as well. I knew I had the final piece the unicorn needed. I made my way into the Faydark, and located the unicorn. She snorted and reared, sensing the corruption in my hands, but at the same time was excited. I placed the items at her feet and she stomped on them, making a blinding light fill the gloomy forest. Where the unicorn once stood, a unicorn horn now lay. And as with the withered one, a voice instructed me to seek out another and give the horn to them, and again I heard that secret laughter. I was beginning to understand now, and tricking the defilers of nature became a fun task. So, with a smile on my face, knowing I had been let in on the little jokes, made my way to Ak'Anon. I was to seek out a gnome named Silox Azrix.<br>I found him near the bottom of the mines near where the gnome heretics make their home. He looked up at me and was about to dismiss me when he saw I had a unicorn horn. He cackled gleefully, and grabbed it from me, but as soon as he touched it, he too, began to wail painfully, and in a swirl of strong winds, he vanished, leaving behind another pure crystal. I gathered this cleansed spirit and left the city of gnomes far behind <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:30:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Well, my quest leads me to Kunark, to an area known as The Burning Woods, and a kind Fier'Dal lives there. I was told to see him as well. But, as he was kind to me, he felt he did not trust me fully with a task. I implored him and he looked at me. <br>'Well, you do have a gentle nature, and if you do me a small favor, I may trust you.' he said to me. Seems a friend of his lives in Freeport, and guards a Koada'Dal, a Lady Shae, and since he does guard her, has little time to eat. My task was to deliver food to him. Being a criminal in Freeport, I had to resort to slinking under the guise of invisibility to find him. I breathed in relief as I was undetected, since my last trip into Freeport resulted in my arrest.  That still gives me nightmares.<br><br>I found Telin's friend, and gave him the food. He was so grateful when he finally ate his fill. He told me he would let Telin know of my kindness. Some days pass, and I meet up with the elf, Telin again. He thanked me for my generosity and gave me a note. I was instructed to seek out a sister of his in his homeland. I thank him and he wishes me a safe journey, as it is truly a dangerous one. As I enter the land of the elves, my mother's homeland, I feel a kinship here, and some sadness, as I pay my respects to my grandfather's burial place. I find Telin's friend, and give her the note. A frown crosses her lovely face and hands me a ring. She tells me to seek out a Teir'Dal in the heart of Kithicor. My face must have paled and she asked if I was alright. I answered I was. I told her I would do as she asked, and she wished me a safe return as well.<br><br>As I neared the edges of the secluded forest, I could hear the screams of the tortured there. I decided to wait til daybreak. As the last echoes of the dead faded, I warily entered the forest. <br>I found him, walking along the path. I gave him the ring and he looked at me and wished me a safe trip...into death, as handed me a coin and one of his servants ambushed me from behind a fallen tree. I managed to escape and left the forest with only a few cuts. I once again returned to Telin and handed him the coin. He looked very serious and gave it back to me. He then instructed me to seek out a fellow druid who lives in the Eastern Karana plains. My journey now leads me there. I must seek out Athele.....<br><br>Well, I found Athele and several other brothers and sisters of druidic magic. I showed her the coin, and she in turn showed it to the others. Just as she was about to speak, a Teir'Dal discovered us and proceeded to attempt to attack us and the druids. Fortunately, we proved stronger, and the Teir'Dal died. I then decided to see what he may have had in his pockets, and found a note. Athele asked to see it. I gave it to her and she paled. She scribbled a note and handed it to me. <br>'Go seek out Ella. She lives in the Thicket of Mists. Give this to her.'  she said.<br><br>I was recently visiting friends in Rivervale, when I happened to see the lady named Ella chatting with some guards. I gave her the note, telling her it came from Athele. She looked very serious, and gave me a bowl. Thought it was kind of odd to get a mixing bowl from her, and even odder still she asked me to find some special roots and berries for her. Obviously something dire was happening in the world, and she wanted roots and berries? Well, I did not question her, as she was well seasoned in her field than I, and found the special items she wanted. I put them in the bowl for her and she chanted. I watched as the berries and roots hardened into a clay-like substance, and she handed it to me. 'Guard this with your life, lass. Seek out the Fair Ones, and bring me a Rune Crested Bowl. Only then will I be able to do my duties to Karana, and Tunare.'  <br> <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A> at: 2/1/02 12:33:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:35:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Well, this little sojourn has proven to be very strange indeed. While trying to seek out the corruption of the lands, some strange assortment of people have asked me to do odd errands for them. A brother of the Glade asked me to get him a rare flower, which I managed to find near the city of Firiona Vie, a Firiona rose, and gave it to him. Well, then he turned out to be too shy to give it to the woman he was secretly in love with, so he asked me to. Then she asked me to do a very odd thing. Deliver an old painting to a skeleton in Frontier Mountains, and she told me to be sure to bring back the item it has. So I said I would, totally perplexed now. <br>Well, I found this skeleton, and gave it the painting. It vanished and dropped a fine looking locket, so I headed back home and gave her the locket. She thanked me, and handed me a pouch of fine powder, with silvery specks. Well, completely puzzled now, I sought out Ella again. I remembered she needed a special bowl, and I asked her about the powder. She told me the powder was needed to make the bowl, and a dwarf in Kaladim had the other ingredient to create the bowl, and to get it from him, and make that bowl for her. She also told me to head to the city of the High elf and get the pattern. So, off to Kaladim I go. <br><br>While in Kaladim one day, I remembered the dwarf. I sought him out, and in order for him to make the bowl for me, he wants me to bring him a colored axe. He told me I would find it in a forgotten city shrouded in mists, and inhabited by dead and other creatures. So, it seems I need to find this forgotten city.  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:39:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> While I was just passing time one day, running around in a vast expanse of ocean known as the Timorous Deep, I happened upon a High elf.

I shrugged, and said I would. 'Don't forget to bring me a receipt!' he shouted to me as I left. Needless to say, I was thoroughly perplexed. With all this corruption going on, several people seemed to have their priorities backwards! <br>Well, while in Felwithe, I found the person and I handed him the fragments of the bowl. He looked at them, almost unsure what to do with it. Then he sent me on an errand. I was to pick up some supplies for him, and I said I would. After I gave him his supplies, he handed me a receipt. I returned the receipt to the elf in Timorous Deep, and he handed me a pattern, telling me how to make a copy of a Rune Crested Bowl.  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:40:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Gah.<br>Hate double posts, don't you? <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A> at: 2/1/02 12:35:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:42:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> While searching for the fabled City of the Mists one day, I stumbled upon a gorilla. Not just any gorilla, mind you, but an actual living one. Most of the gorillas I have seen in the jungle here, known as Emerald Jungle, are undead, their flesh hanging in strips from their bones. All of the wildlife in the jungle are overly aggressive, and will attack with no hesitation. And this gorilla was no exception. <br>So, we defended ourselves as best we could, and it finally lay dead. Just before I could bury the body, it vanished, leaving behind a dark, green piece of bark, and the odor assailed me. I knew it was another piece of corruption! I stored it away in a safe place, for I knew it was a matter of time when I would continue my joke on the defilers of nature, and finally finish my quest. <br><br>While on a leisurely stroll through the Lake of Ill Omen, we stopped for a little repast, and decided to do a little fishing. I caught something, and it was big. A baracuda was caught on my line and it was huge! He fought like a demon, almost possessed, and it managed to jump off the hook and proceed to attack us. We fought for our lives, and I noticed an almost feral look about it. I was wondering if I had possibly found another creature of coruption. In all my travelings, I noticed the creatures of nature that had been afflicted with corruption were more aggressive than normal. And sure enough, when this one lay dead, an item reeking of corruption lay in place of the body. I placed this item in a safe place, and wondered how much more corruption existed?  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:49:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Well, we found the fabled city, after several weeks of getting lost and having to abandon the search many times. And it is safe to assume it is named appropriately the City of Mists, as it is shrouded in swirling mists, as the mists encased our feet as we walked. An eerie silence prevailed, and the only sound we heard was our own footfalls upon the cobblestones. <br>We rounded a corner and a large creature ambushed us. His body was as black as midnight, and seemed made almost of metal. We discovered that a lot of our magic could not fell the beast, so we had to rely on muscle. When it lay dead, I noticed an odd weapon in its fist. Prying the weapon from the dead hand, I saw the beauty of this weapon. The handle was of ebony, and the blade seemed made of jade. Sharp too, as I passed my thumb across the blade, drawing a little blood. I remembered that the dwarf in Kaladim was looking for a colored axe, and I wondered if this was the one he was looking for.<br>So, I headed back to the city of Dwarves. Sure enough, this was the one. He looked up at me, almost perturbed that I had bothered him while working, but when he saw the axe, he smiled so brightly, it reminded me of a child receiving a gift. I asked him if this was the axe he needed, and it was indeed. Then I watched incrediously as he took apart the axe, and smashed the blade. He mixed it in with some clay and handed it to me, and wished me a good day. Thoroughly dismissed, and completely baffled, I decided to try to construct this bowl. So, I read the pattern carefully, and place the clay on a pottery wheel. Then, I sprinkled that powder with silvery flecks on the clay, kneeding it and molding it, and grateful I had taken up pottery as a relaxing hobby. Reading the instructions carefully, I finally had the bowl. So, I made my way back to Ella in Misty Thicket. I showed her the bowl, and she seemed quite pleased, and held the bowl almost reverently. She said this bowl would construct an item of great power, and when combined with all the powers of nature would procure an item of unsurpassed power that only certain souls could wield masterfully. She then asked me if I had that item she told me to guard with my life. I gave it to her, and it seemed to soften and glowed softly. The orange light filled the bowl, and she handed me an orange colored stone, telling me to hold onto it, saying it was a key to power, and to seek out another of my kind, as they would provide the answers further.  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:53:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Well, I was passing the time away one day, enjoying the fine sunshine, when an old friend passed by. We talked for most of the day, and then he asked me a question. He pulled out a green stone from his pocket and showed it to me, asking if I had seen such a stone or what it was. It seemed to pulse, almost as if alive. And I remembered a woman of my kind, a druid, had mentioned she needed a stone similar to this. So me and my friend made our way to Firiona Vie and sought out my sister of druid arts, and showed it to her. Sure enough, it was the stone she needed. She asked me if I had the stone Ella gave me, and I handed it to her. She chanted and we watched as the two stones became one, and it glowed and felt warm to the touch. She handed it to me and told me to give this stone back to Ella, and she would tell me more.<br><br>I made my way towards Rivervale again, and saw Ella chatting with the guards again. I laughed softly to myself. She was a chatty woman, and obviously loved around here. I patiently waited for her to finish her conversations and she smiled warmly at me. We chatted about the weather, then I handed her the stone. She looked at it, then at me. She then led me to her cottage and removed a box from under her bed. <br>'Now I know I can trust you, Lenore. You have done all we, the children of Karana and Tunare, have asked, and no matter how menial, you did it without question. Here, take this.' and she handed me a scimitar. It was a thing of beauty. It seemed to have a life of its own. 'This scimitar will be proof to Wise Xanuusus that you have done all we asked. And you must finish finding the corruption in the land of Kunark.

He will give you an item, and you will take it and the other two cleansed spirits, along with this scimitar I gave you, and then, and only then, will Xanuusus award you with a great item needed to continue the fight against the corruption around us at every turn.' <br>She wished me a safe journey, and I made my way back to Kunark. <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco Bravehard"Have you hugged a Dragon today?"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulenoreb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenoreb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/31/02 11:59:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Quest</span><hr size=1> Determined to seek out the corruption now, I began to search in earnest for the final creature. They seemed to have a pattern of three creatures aflicted at a time. <br>While passing through a region of Kunark, aptly named Swamp of No Hope, becuase if you don't know your way around, there is no hope of leaving alive, we were set upon by a very large froglike creature. We fought long and hard, our magics seemingly unaffecting it. In the end, however, muscle prevailed and the rogue frog lay dead. The frog began to decompose quickly in the humid swamp, and all that remained of the frog was a crystal-like substance. Unsure what it was, I took it with me. Who knows. I might need it later.<br><br>A couple days later, me and a bunch of dear friends and family decided to have a little celebration in Timorous Deep. There is a beautiful Oasis there, secluded and very safe. I noticed a single dwarf standing along the edge of a small pond. We talked and found he was looking for a fabled fish. The fish is named Faydedar, he said, and if he existed, he intended to catch him and become famous. He asked me if I had any froglok essence, as he heard this fabled fish loved it. I remembered the crystal I had and showed it to him. The dwarf smiled and rubbed some on his hook. And just as he cast his line, a loud roar echoed through the Oasis. The dwarf turned seven shades of white and fled, leaving me and my friends to defend ourselves. <br>This was no ordinary fish. It was a dragon. Small one, but one nonetheless. After a very short battle, the dragon lay dead. A friend proceeded to gut him and backed away, nearly wretching at the stench. I recognized the stench. This was the final piece of corruption I needed. I took it and heard the echoes on the wind. I was to seek out the gnome in the Overthere, near the outpost. If he was like the other people I encountered, this joke on the defilers of nature was near completion. I made my way there, careful to avoid the dragoons that patrol the area. I handed him the items I had, and he inspected them. And sure enough, as soon as he touched them, he too, vanished in a painful manner, leaving behind a glowing orb. <br>I took this orb, feeling the cleansed aura about it. I gathered the other items I had and made my way back home to the Karana Plains. I knelt before the wise Xanuusus, and he held the items in his branches. A fierce wind howled, and I watched with awe as the cleansed spirits of the world fused with the scimitar Ella had given me. Xanuusus then told me to rise, and he told me continue the fight against the corruption, as he handed me the transformed scimitar back, as I had only vanquished a small portion. I told him I would, and made my vow to Karana I would continue my fight in His name, and for Nature itself.  <p>Lenore BravehardAmbassador to EoNDevoted wife and faithful companion of Choco
