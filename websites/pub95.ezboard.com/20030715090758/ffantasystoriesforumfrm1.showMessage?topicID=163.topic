The sword came back around in a deathly backhand, one that this manw as famous for and was no novice at. The leather-clad man leaned back, touching his hands on the ground behind him, the sword just barely missing his stomach. He shot is foot out form under him while in a back flip, kicking the other man in the chin and flipping back and landing on his feet. The other man, complete with a full suit of Goldened armor, encrusted with magic gems, staggered back. <br>
<br>
  The leather-clad man came forward in a rush. His hands came up, hooked around and caught the armored man in the chin with his right, and in the temple with his left. He kicked his foot out, hitting the man's knee cap, then pulled quickly away after hitting it, having done more damage to his foot than to the knee cap because of the magical armor. He dropped, kicked his left foot out and up, kicking the armored man in the chest, almost knocking him over, spinning around on his right foot, gliding his left foot to the ground. The armored man hit the ground with a thud as the leather-clad man tripped him. <br>
<br>
  The armored man dropped his sword, crawling backwards away from his adversary, fear in his eyes as the leather-clad man stood up slowly, and walked closer to him. The armored man tried to kick his leg up and hit the man, but the leather-clad man just hit it away with his calloused forearm. The armored man's eyes went wide as the leather-clad man picked up the sword, eyed it warily and curiously, and walked over to him, lifting it up in the air, the point of the blade over the armored man's heart. <br>
<br>
  &quot;I never did like to use these things,&quot; the leather-clad man said, &quot;but today I'll make an exception.&quot; The armored man screamed and waved his arms frantically to try and stop him. The color left the armored man's face as his own sword drove through him, his magical armor, and into the ground he was lying upon. <br>
<br>
  The leather-clad man kicked some dirt on his dead opponent, turned and walked away, wondering why he had been attacked. <br>
<br>
  He walked about 15 paces when he saw a flash of blinding light, a hand reached out and grabbed him from an unseen portal, and yanked him through. He fell into the portal, hitting the ground on the other side of it, rolling over his back and up onto his feet, hands up defensively. He quickly counted four men close to him, and one farther away. He kicked his right foot out, catching one man in the groin, spun on his left foot and jabbed another in the nose, crunching it repairlessly. He heard a sword come out, waited a second and ducked, timing it perfectly, and the sword coming out over him. Spinning while in the ducked position to face the man that has the sword, and rushes him, laying his face sideways on his stomach, and pushing him backwards. He sticks his foot out and behind the man, making him fall over and throwing punches into his face repeatedly. Getting up, kicking that man in the groin, and turning around. <br>
   <br>
   The last man rushing him, hand back in the ready position for a punch. The leather-clad man easily moves his head aside, grabs the other man's wrist and bends his hand down, bringing his other arm up to the elbow and breaking the rushing man's arm. He crouches a little, putting some weight on his back, and flipping the man over his back. The first man that he kicked in the groin getting back up and rushing him. <br>
<br>
  Then, the man stops suddenly, a red cage surrounding him, keeping him form moving. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Do not attack this man, you will only get yourself killed,&quot; he heard the man farther away say in a deep, ominous voice. The man seemed to calm a little bit..all the others groaning and barely moving still. The leather-clad man turns to face the new, mysterious wizard. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Who are you, and why do you want me?&quot; he asks. <br>
<br>
  &quot;I am Ordaino Yougan, First Wizard of The Order. And you are here to help us.&quot;<br>
<br>

Some constructive critism: avoid over use of certian words or phrases. Example &quot;The leather-clad man&quot;  &quot;the armored man&quot; I've seen both numerous amounts of times already. My suggestion, mix it up a bit. Try to say the same thing in a few different ways. Sorry, I'm just a bit anal about that =/ lol, I get paranoid over it in my own writing. ...reading on!<br>
<br>
Leather-clad man = 10<br>
armored man= 8<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not one for a whole lot of action and fighting, but this was good. Aside from the over use of thingies (ya like that adj.?) it was pretty good. I'll be looking forward to the next part!<br>
