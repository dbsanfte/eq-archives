I happen to agree with you in that space mining and such are good ideas to pursue.  It does, however, bring to mind a certain line in the Matrix where Agent Smith attempts to &quot;classify the human race&quot; as a &quot;virus that reproduces...until every natural resource is consumed.&quot;  I think to do that in space is probably not the best solution, but the universe is so f-ing big that any impact we might make would be negligible in the overall scheme of things.  However, its fun to take the opposing view and argue with you.  It provides some distraction from the grind of work.  Anyway if you wanna start a million-man march on Capitol Hill to provide more funding for space exploration and research, I'll happily carry the megaphone.<br>
<br>
Granted, I exaggerated somewhat on the bit about SUV's knocking down buildings, etc.  But I still don't like em.  Sue me.  Anyway, I really think you're mounting a high horse in stating that you in your Camaro own the road.  Who died and made you the godfather of the DOT?  You keep saying that the roads &quot;were built for&quot; so and so and such and such...but last I checked the highways were about 12-14 feet wide in each lane, with height restrictions of nominally 9 feet through certain tunnels and drive-thru windows.  There's a good chance of seeing a weigh station or ten on your average drive through any state in the Union, but those are usually closed anyway.  There's also a good chance that construction crews are widening the lanes of some arbitrary highway somewhere on the continent (probably to accomodate some more wide-ass vehicles), which in turn renders my narrow little Honda a bit safer for them when they get around to laying down 20 miles of orange cones and closing off the shoulders.  In any case, my piece of sh-t peddle car is still well under the minimum requirements, where some *other* vehicles toe the line a bit.<br>
<br>
A Honda is a car in the loosest sense of the word, true.  It can't comfortably seat 5 adults, true.  However, in my world its all the car I need, and I rarely come across a situation in which I need to drive 5 adults anyway.  I'm not breeding kids like Old Mother Hubbard either, so chances are good I wont need to upgrade my equipment any time soon.  When I get around to it, Laelia will probably get one of the 10k horses to ride as well.  I prefer the low-cost end of the cost-benefit spectrum.  Thats my nature.  There's no reason to *jeer* at me for it simply because your horse might accelerate a bit faster, or because your horse carries 5 toolboxes.  Not that I really give ashit...my horse still gets me where I wanna go, and I'm mighty proud of it because its mine.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, f*ck you.  <br>
<br>
Oh and btw, your arguments are good but your spelling blows chunks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Go back to grammar school Mr.-I've-been-driving-for-a-quarter-century.  You apparently learned to spell in a peddle-school.  Get off the road so I don't have to avoid killing you in that regard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thats it for now.  I'll get around to butting heads with you on the greenhouse &quot;gasses&quot; (see above) thing later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ally Poster</span><br>  Posts: 621<br> <font color=#778899>(12/28/01 10:27:45 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.xtimports.com/data/graphics/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> hm. I made two statements and I'm not sure which you're responding to... if it's the &quot;it's annoying to those of us who *do* own the road&quot;.. got nothing to do with my car. That was supposed to be ironic humor of some kind. Like that old joke &quot;those of you who think you're god are really annoying to those of us who are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, that statement in the Matrix was worrisome, except it's not exactly true. As humans reach higher stages of technology and society, they tend to breed less. <br>
Ever read &quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot;? It's about the far future when we encounter a millions of years old species in an isolated star system. We don't know it, but they go through cycles, trapped in that system. The problem they had is that their species started male, had to turn female, get pregenant, give birth and turn male again, over and over, or die. They develop civilization, fill up the planet, fight over resources, collapse, develop, fill the planet, fight over resources, etc etc. Eventually they got space travel and filled up the star system, but couldn't get out beyond it. So the collapses became almost continual as the asteroids and stuff in the system developed their own cycles. It was a pretty grim vision. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lae.... what I'm trying to get at with the SuVs that you hate is that you are not the only person driving, the only person with needs for a vehicle. If your Honda does the job for you, great, more power to you. If a Segway does it for you, wonderful for you. SuVs serve a purpose. Minivans might serve a purpose, if they could be made like Pintos (ie, rear-collision fireballs...) As has been established, I drive a Camaro. That doesn't mean Camaros are worthless. Same with SuVs. Just because Soccer Moms also drive them, doesn't mean they're worthless.<br>
<br>
And your f- you attitude is perfect. Keep it.<br>
<br>
Grammar isn't spelling, but I've noticed my spelling has deteriorated terribly over the past year or so. Writing used to be my strongest point, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Worst part is I don't notice it 'til I reread my posts or other people's quotes.<br>
