I think that Tony Blair would back the US before the Arab nations.  Call it the lesser of the two evils.  Also history shows us that Britian since the 1900's the US and Britian have been close allies.

When is enough, enough?, and what exactly do the people of the region who are pissed because &quot;we&quot; won't stop it think the US can do? Do they really want us to stop it? If so there is only one way it will happen......alot of dead Americans which is not my idea of a good plan. We can't make Isreal pull out it's troops and we can't make the suicide bombers stop what they are doing short of all out WWIII. From what i can see the US is between a rock and hells front door if we get mixed up in this and i for one hope another way can be found to end all this before it gets to where i am pretty sure it is heading.....WWIII<br>

<br>
Damn I dig your commentary on this thread Aldrin...it goes along pretty well with everything that I was thinking about the whole bloody mess.<br>
<br>
The only thing I know about the whole thing comes from what I read in Time magazine and in Leon Uris's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Exodus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  That's not much of a political science resume, I know...but I think its enough to formulate an opinion.  <br>
<br>
Basically, I think the Israelis are *sorta* the usurpers of land and wealth that Mego and others have made them out to be here...I don't really see where they get the notion of entitlement.  This is in line with my somewhat prejudicial first impression of Jews as pushy self-serving bastards...but I haven't met enough of them to really validate that opinion.  In general it seems to me that the Arab Palestinians sorta had squatters rights.  <br>
<br>
Regardless of my half-baked quasi-racist thoughts about Jews...the redneck southerner in me says that if I had my choice of who to lynch...the Arab or the Jew...the Arab would be swingin from the old oak tree right quick-like.  It seems to me, largely from impressions I got from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Exodus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, that the Jews came to Palestine and flourished when all who preceded them basically were a bunch of bums that turned the region into a wasteland.  Where there was desert, the Jews made farmland...where there was famine, they brought prosperity...where there was clan wars and death, they brought peace and hope.  Again, I don't know fact from fiction where this is concerned...but Uris spinned it as such and I pretty much believe it.<br>
<br>
The Arabs seemed to be jealous of all this, and felt intruded upon in their own little shiitty evil world of polygamy and greed.  So they started strapping bombs to children and sending em into the Israeli happy-camps to blow themselves up.  The Israelis...having survived Adolph Hitler...were no stranger to all of this and fought back...starting the vicious cycle of death that we see here today.<br>
<br>
As far as what to do about it...I don't know.  The eradication of all Arabs doesn't seem like a plausible solution...although I'd like nothing better than to see all the raghead gimps turned to dog food.  I got no beef with the Israelis really--them being pushy and self-centered doesn't mean they aren't decent Earthling citizens for the most part.  This in itself is more than I can say for the Arabs.<br>
<br>
I think if Ariel Sharon pushes it too far, (i.e. killing Arafat) it will result in an all-out war.  This will no doubt get ugly...because its all centered around the big lie that is religion.  The Arabs and the U.S. and China and everyone else will be forced to join the slaughter in a feeble attempt to stop a downward spiral.  <br>
<br>
Dammit! If people didn't behave like such sheep (pardon the term) because of their religions...the world really wouldn't have all these problems.  In my opinion, martyrdom only gets you one thing:  dead.  It doesn't buy you a flock of naked virgins...and it doesn't get you a leg up on paradise.  Its really pretty barbaric and stupid to think otherwise.  This is basic stuff here.  Get off the friggin opium.<br>
<br>
So the Arabs really are fitting Uris's stereotype of an uncultured, violent group of dumb barbarians by failing to live up to the moral imperative.  Stop blowing sh|t up and join the human race!!!  We're all stuck on this stupid rock for all eternity...and for God/Allah/Vishnu/nobody's sake...carve yourself out some space and stop bumping elbows with the heathen next to you...cuz he's struggling with a way to make sense of it all the same way you are.<br>
<br>
Anyway...all of this is just spam that I was thinking...and I have in no way justified my opinion here.  Carry on with your comments...cuz its fun to read <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Has anyone read the recent scholarly studies of the ancient islamic texts?  They are of course condemned by all Arab clerics as attempting to apply &quot;science&quot; and &quot;research&quot; to their beloved Koran, however they are quite revealing.<br>
<br>
Linguists working from the oldest and earliest available islamic writtings have determined that the whole &quot;virgins in heaven&quot; thing is incorrect.  Apparently the language the texts are written in is very difficult to translate because each word/character can have multiple meanings.  In modern day arabic small dots and dashes are placed around such characters to indicate which meaning is intended.  However, at the time of these writtings this was not done.  <br>
<br>
The practical upshot of this is that the characters representing &quot;virgin(s)&quot; in the ancient arabic language are EXACTLY identical to the characters representing &quot;white raisin(s)&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Yes, it sounds quite silly, I know.  But in a historical/cultural context this actually makes much more sense because white raisins were very much prized and treasured delicacies of the time and region.<br>
<br>
For their trouble the linguists and scholars doing the translations are, of course, now all on the official state death list in islamic countries for heresy as infidels.  I guess it's a little hard to get people worked up to the point of blowing themselves up if their reward is a handful of raisins.<br>
<br>
Oh well, still it would be kind of funny if their religion were real.  Think about it, you blow yourself up to be rewarded in heaven with a bunch of virgins for your personal use and get there and are handed a stack of white raisins.<br>
<br>
Not that I believe any religion is real. <p><BR>

<br>
Fact is Gamiene, I'm not a Jew or an Arab...I don't know any of em and cannot seriously claim to understand their predicament nor proffer any meaningful solutions...but I thought it was decidedly humorous to wave the flag of another merry band of groupthinking hatemongers whose politics I am familiar with but do NOT support in my halfassed analysis of the topic at hand.  Well dang Cletus!  I only gots one round o' buckshot left!  Who should ah shoot it at??  Gamiene the Jew-boy?  or that Ay-Rab Aldrin over thar?  Maybe I'll tossem a moon pie and see which one jumps for it first!  Or line em up and save bullets!<br>
<br>
Or maybe I'm just yanking your chain.  For all you know I'm fuggin' Christiane Amanpour...and have forgotten more about the Middle East conflict than your dumbazz will ever know.  After all, this is a form of roleplay here.  Its not like I'm really *obligated* to support every main idea with three supporting details, Miss MLA Format police.  (Whats MLA got to do with anything?  Nothing!  HA!)  I'm at work for crissakes...and its not my style.  Besides this text box is only like 15 lines high...and I can't remember what crap I spewed thats already scrolled outa the window.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;Redenbacher&quot; quote was interesting enough.  But it looks like its back to the card catalog for you on that one!<br>
Funny though....if you read between the lines enough you might notice that in every jest there IS a kernel of truth.  Racism, hatred, and religion are the core of the forces at work here, and I took a few liberties with them, just for giggles.<br>

Yah so anyway, heres some random opinions for Gameine to launch a personal attack on me for! (my only complaint about Gameine is her tendancy to attack people directly rather than address issues, bugs me)<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, my take on this is largely warped by a recent history class I've been taking.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Point 1: Palestine had squaters rights</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Umm yah, so did the native americans, err I mean indians, damn political correctness. America/Brittain walked over them quite easily enough in our own religious war (a war where we had superior numbers, but a war nonetheless). It's funny that now that we've seen the error of our ways, and it was an error, a lot of people are looking at Israel vs Palestine and saying one or the other person should own X territory and that the other should either shut up or move out. Umm.. what happened to a peaceful coexistance? Truth is, the Palestinians and the Israelis are facing the same issues America was with the indians. There are two religions and ways of life which oppose one another. You can make them play nice by use of force, but unless you change their IDEAS about one another, they will continue to slaughter one another without guilt. If the &quot;white&quot; settlers were fully aware of how interesting indian culture was and what kind of people they really were, then things would have gone down much differently.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Point 2: American Presumptualism</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Umm Who made us God? Why do WE get to decide what the result is? We're presuming our religion of technology, politics, democracy, and &quot;progress&quot; is the RIGHT in the world, so therefore, these religious &quot;notions&quot; that the Palestinians and Israelis have are utterly ludicrous and stupid. So what should prevail? Tollerance? We all seem to love this word, but it only works so long as EVERYONE plays nice. So umm we're supposed to Intollerate their Intollerance and kill em for it? Do we as Americans have the right to interfere in foreign wars that aren't our own? Has the whole world become one country so therefore All the worlds wars are our own? IF the world is one country, are we the leaders then? It would certainly seem to be so. Does this mean we get to go impose taxes on israel and palestine and make them obey our federal laws? I mean, we're trying to impose our morality on them as it is, so why aren't we going all the way? Where is the thin red line where &quot;offering assistance&quot; becomes &quot;parental rulership&quot;. Those are the big questions nobody can answer. If we're going to give so much money to these third world countries, why don't we turn them into reservations like we did the indian nations :P, I mean, they meet the minimum qualifications that the court cases that accomplished that feat required.. what was it.. the indians were a &quot;separate but sovreign dependant entity&quot;. So tell me , if the whole world becomes a group of &quot;separate but sovreign dependant entities&quot; does that mean the US is responsible to govern the conflicts between them too? Is that what we're becoming? The parents of the new world?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Part 3: In closing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Keep the UN out of it. Damn UN, everyone turns to the UN. It's like the &quot;federal reserve&quot; does anyone know why they named it that? It's neither FEDERAL -or- RESERVED, they named it that so it sounded all nice and stable. The UN is named &quot;United Nations&quot; because it sounds like &quot;United States&quot; but if you haven't noticed, it is NOT an extention of OUR power but an institution which allows other countries to have some say over how we govern US.<br>

<br>
The Israelis feel, and in my opinion correctly, that Israel won't exist if it doesn't remain a Jewish state.  This policy of theirs is for their own survival.<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with Sylli about comparing the situation to American Indians.  I think both sides are kinda unwanted people that were granted rights by Britain to unwanted land.  But I think it is irrelevant.  People need to deal with the situation today.  The Israelis are there and the Palestinians are there.  Neither one is leaving without a fight.  Arguments over history and rights while interesting aren't gonna help with a solution.<br>
<br>
I think we (USA) do need to be involved to some extent.  One or two nuclear explosions in that region and rants about the 25 cent price hike in gas will be truely laughable.  Also it is too late for us (USA) not to be involved or blamed.  If full scale war starts we (USA) are going to be attacked no matter what stance we (USA) take now. <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85687><IMG SRC=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bryionak/BrySig2.jpg></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugamiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warmly Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(4/4/02 12:05:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=585.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Worse with each @#%$ day...</span><hr size=1> I only attack the people over the idea when the people try to use the idea to hide themselves.

It's not a presumption, and it's not a religion.

Sorry, squatting outside a cave picking poopy out of my beard, but &quot;at one with nature&quot;, doesn't compare with sitting on a thousand dollar recliner in an air-conditioned penthouse apartment clean shaven and free from disease.  The technology that some people like to sneer at makes possible a 5 billion person population. <br>
Who made us gods? George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, et al... Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Teddy Rooseveldt, Alexander Graham Bell, Oppenheimer, Teller, Charles Lindbergh, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Robert Goddard, JFK, Neil Armstrong, Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates and thousands of others, all, rightly or wrongly, gave us the power we now wield. And that's why we have, maybe not the right, but certainly the responsibility to decide what the result is.<br>

So the U.S. isn't a democracy because Canadians aren't represented in our gov't? Please tell me who the Senators from the Choctaw nation are? Okay, if that's too obscure, how bout the Senators from Cuba, or Germany? (trick question actually; the U.S. isn't a democracy but a republic.)<br>
Yes, Israel is a democracy. Israel also seems able to recognize the difference between countrymen and non-countrymen. Arab Israelis <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> represented in the Knessit. (pardon mispelling please.) But Arab non-Israelis aren't. As it should be.<br>

I don't think that the Europeans/Asians moving to America was wrong, but I dissagree with the methods of subjagation (d00d I can't spell). Incidents like the Jackson-endused trail of tears are what I'm referring to here, I'm a patriot, theres no way in Hell I didn't want America to become what it was, truth is though, physically, the indians didn't hold all that much land 0_o. I have opinions on the other side too. A lot of people say &quot;poor indians&quot; when in truth there were many tribes which sided with the brittish against us on several occasions, thus becoming enemies, and they should have expected our emnity.<br>
