A soft rain came down upon stone paved streets that were hard on the feet and the thatched roofs of Inns, pubs and basic purpose stores. A cold wind blew through the trees surrounding the small village creating an occasional howl accompanied by the sigh of ancient lumber gently being rocked back and forth. The moon was hidden and all had retired for the evening, the streets were enveloped in almost pitch black. <br>
    A figure fully cloaked with hood and all kept their robes wrapped tight around them as they slowly trudged down an alleyway towards one of the better-known local pubs. Not even the usual drunkards, cons or whores would visit the pub this late. The figure stood outside of the door to a pub known as the Red Rooster. The figure made a sort of motion at the door and it slowly unlocked itself and creaked open. The figure carefully made its way into the common room, stopping to look over it’s shoulder every step of the way. The common room was empty, except for a solitary man lying unconscious with a bottle of rum in his hand. The figure made its way to a bulletin board, covered with signs of people looking to hire temporary help. The figure tore these down and threw them into a barrel that was used for empty beer bottles. It pulled out a piece of parchment and placed it against the board, it had firmly self adhered itself. The figure then made it’s way back out into the stormy night. The sign read:<br>

Strolling down the streets crowded with people- pushing shoving, the usual, Vermifax looked around at the usual customers. He had only had the job at this bar but 2 weeeks and was shocked to find that many of the usual drunks were outside sober. <br>
Pushing his way through the door, he found many people he had never seen before-all of them clad in armor and with their many weapons adorning them. They looked like giant meat grinders. So many blades, Vermi thought to himself. <br>
Walking behind the bar he took only three drinks from the lot of the people. Curious as to why people were here but not drinking, he looked around the bar to find many walking to the board. The board that was used for hire. Surprised, he found himself standing in front of the board himself reading the sign<br>

Smiling, he looked back as the bigger men pushed him out of the way. &quot;Move aside child.&quot; Snickering, Vermi was shoved and handled back to the bar. Angry at the men who shoved him, Vermi looked around. They did look older than he was. In fact they all were, Vermifax looked down at his young hands, he wasn't very tall, and had long blonde hair pulled back behind his head and tightly bound. Sighing, he looked back to the board with a slight grin. He reached in his pocket and searched out his prize. The purse was very heavy and fat with no copper coins, not even silver adorned this bag, it was gold, large circles, almost as big as the young lads eyes. Looking around again he quickly pocketed his treasure chuckling to himself at his cleverness. Unknowing that eyes were watching him.<br>

The crowd begin to part as three men entered the room. One was dressed in a fine red coat laced with gold trim with the golden symbol of a serpent over his heart. He had royal blue trousers with soft leather boots that came up to the knee then flipped over. He had a sword sheathed at his side that also bore the golden symbol on it’s hilt. He stood tall with a sense of confidence. To his left was a tall slender man draped in black robes, his face hidden by his hood, and on his right was a shorter, older, rounder, balding man, dressed in fine linen, and used a cane to walk. The man with the red coat helped the older man up onto a table then began asking for silence in the room. The old man cleared his voice once the room was silent. “I am pleased to see such a large turn out today,” the old man said surveying the crowd “but unfortunately we can only accept so many, the pay how over is 500 gold marks per person for the entire job.” A soft rumble came out of the crowd, 500 was a lot, and times were tough. The older man held up his hand. “The interviewing process will began, as you may expect these items are quiet valuable to me, so I am looking for the best of the best.” The two men left to sit at other tables while lines formed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=funbug>Funbug</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/26/03 12:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: help wanted</span><hr size=1> black painted lips spread out in a soft smile as the blonde boy was moved backwards..he saw out of the corner of his eye the stolen purse, some of these Merc's....So stupid but skilled...sad really, he walked forward but was blocked by two..very..very large orgeish humans&quot;...Godamnit..&quot; he sighed softly this wasnt the time to start blasting people away, he needed money...and bad.<br>

No one looked familiar, she was almost tempted to believe she walked into the wrong place, but she could hear Vermifax shouting over the din taking an order. Jumping up and down to try and get a glimpse of him, her braid of blonde hair behind her lifted from her mid back and fell again. Her slinder form could slip through some spaces, but there were none here. Pushing her way to the front, she brushed against a large man. Trying to push past him he looked at her while she got by him. Looking ahead of her again she felt a firm hand grip her thin arm. Spinning her around, she was face to face with the large man. &quot;Thief!&quot; Heads turned and men searched their belts. Many with indisgresion piled on the young girl, they pushed her against a table. The large man picking her up and setting her on the table. She heard many shouts for her to return their things. Finally resolve gave way to rough pulls and pushes. And then finally the large man ripped her pocket. There was a small wallet that fell out, hers. The large man picked it up and pocketed it. &quot;Search her!&quot; Hands reached in and flattened her back against the table, strong arms grabbed her legs and others her arms and they stretched her out on the table. Screaming as hands tore her clothing, tears ran down her cheeks, red with embarassment. The breeze sent a chill in her as it touched her bare midrift. She felt a numbing cold rise from her core and spread to her feet. Would no one help her... she slammed her eyes shut as hands searched places, anyone would know she wasn't hidding something... Someone....<br>

For the past three months, Ratendel (or Rat, although he perfers Tendel) had been forced to use summoned currency.  Currency which would last all of three hours, currency that didn't quite agree with its reciever when it dissapeared.  And Tendel oh so hated having to move around every time he was forced to  buy something.  Five Hundred!  Smoothing the perfect cut silk of his mid-thigh length vibrant green tunic, Tendel allowed his lips to part in a smile which could only have been made of greed.  He was quite tall for one of his vocation, being nearly six feet and he knew all to well how to weild the solid oak staff he held in his right hand, even if he didn't have the muscle to back up any form of physical threat.  Green eyes, so wide he had been called elfin as a child, stared, unblinking, at the man whose words echoed the thoughts in his head.  His pale face, looking more like one of the dead than that of a person for whom a heart pushed vibrant blood for, was perfect with a chin not to delicate like that a woman, but not broad like the meatier men near him.  His nose was perfectly strait, and his cheekbones were high, but not in a way that would make his seem hollow faced.  The only place of disorder in his persona was his hair, shoulder length, which was merely in slight disarray.  In truth, he was a disorderly, messy man, but when the prospect of money was near, he put up a show of false perfectionism.<br>

Smiling brightly she looked at the stranger. &quot;Hello, I'm Lizzy, Do you two know each other?&quot; just alittle confused, she looked back and forth between the two. slightly smiling at Rafel, &quot;I'm going to go try and find my friend, its why I was here before.

The day pasted, and she could not find her childhood friend anywhere. She only hoped that he was doing something that would not get him into trouble. The little theif had always disappeared for days at a time only to return with people chasing him. More or less disappointed in the misplaced talent, Lizzy started back to the inn. Hopefully her new friend would still be there. She walked into the lobby and started up the stairs. The owner gave her a smile as she walked by, winking back at the man, she smiled.<br>
