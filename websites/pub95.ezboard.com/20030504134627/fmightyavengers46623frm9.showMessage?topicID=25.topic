Please read</span><hr size=1> Raid Notes<br>
<br>
First of all it is imperative that everyone knows what the intent of a raid is. A raid is a grouping of characters whether guilded or not, to accomplish a common task. Often times this is to acquire Epic pieces or other items that a single character or single group cannot do alone. Raids, unless specifically set up to do so, are NOT designed for character experience. The experience that you receive in playing your class and seeing how things work on a raid is more than sufficient. It is also wise to realize that the assistance and time that you give will be repaid when you are the individual that is trying to obtain your epic or item that you seek. <br>
<br>
Preparations before the raid<br>
<br>
·        Everyone that is interested in joining the raid must make the minimum level qualifications and post their intent to participate on the guild message board. This helps the Raid Leader in establishing Group Leaders and group assignments.<br>
·        BE ON TIME, some raids require you to be at lease 15- 30 minutes early. This gives the Raid Leader time to make groups and issue any special orders that apply to the raid. Remember everyone’s time is valuable.<br>
·        Raids are intended to last a good while and players should plan to be there for the duration. Naturally things come up and people may have to leave but understand that the raid is dependant on all parties participation and your leaving may compromise the integrity of the raid. (1)If you can’t stay for the duration inform the Raid Leader ahead of time so he/she can find a suitable replacement. (2) Remember the help you give someone will be returned to you when you need that high level item you seek. (3) Please keep in mind that if you need to leave early that we cannot ask a porter to take you out. This creates a undue burden on the porter that is here for the raid. Also he/she may not want to have to change their bind point , if they can bind at that location. One reason why is that if things go bad and they die they repop right back in the middle of all the chaos and no one likes the idea of being caught up in a death cycle. <br>
·        If you need a port TO the raid one will be provided if you are in a location to receive a port and are timely in asking. Nothing makes people grumble more than waiting an extra 15-30 minutes on people who are late. (see rule #2)<br>
·        Ensure that you have a map of the zone (or zones) that is involved. This includes researching the general mobs as well as the main objective. Some mobs can only be cast on while in melee range, others have immunities to fire/cold, magic, snare, root, some complete heal, gate and the list goes on and on. Good research will ensure that you have the proper spells memmed for the raid.<br>
·        Buy your components before hand and take any extra gear that you may need (resist gear, weapons, etc)<br>
·        Prepare your hotkeys beforehand (most people will use /assist main_assist_name key. Clerics in heal rotation should have a message “Complete healing (insert main), (Cleric 2 name) your next.” The second Cleric’s message will read: “Complete healing (insert main), (cleric 3 name) your next.” And so on. This ensures that the proper heal rotation will be followed and that no one should miss a heal.<br>
·        Have all your settings the right way. If performance is a problem put your particle effects OFF, 3D sky OFF, dynamic lighting OFF, ect. This will reduce the chances of missing a heal or back up heal due to lag.<br>
·        Put all or most of your battle spam OFF, such as others hits, others misses, your misses, peoples spell casting and so on. You need to see the orders that you need to follow.<br>
<br>
Gathering up and buffing<br>
<br>
·        Be patient when grouping and gathering. This is the worst part about a raid and can be made even worse when people whine, complain, and goof off. It is important that you remember that someday you will be leading a raid so be attentive and supportive.<br>
·        Upon arrival to the gathering spot turn LFG on. This will help the Raid Leader in assigning groups.<br>
·        DO NOT mess around and goof off when gathering for a raid. It is extremely distracting to the others in the raid and very frustrating for the Raid Leader. Do not go AFK during the grouping or buffing phase. There will be a period of time to do this just before the raid begins. (this does any affect on the occasional “sporking” of your Group Leaders. =)<br>
·        After groups are announced the Group Leaders(the first name called in the group list) will invite the members and report to the Raid Leader that group # so and so is formed.<br>
·        Group Leaders will assign duties to the group members. (ie. Cleric A on main heal, Druid A on back up heal, etc.)<br>
·        The Group Leader is responsible for getting the group buffed, not the Raid Leader. Each group should gather in together separately to avoid confusion if the space allows for it. If any buffs are required outside of your group ask the Group Header, he will in turn solicit the proper group for your buffs through the other Group Leader.<br>
·        When your group is fully buffed each caster will report mana status to their Group Leader. Group Leaders will then inform the Raid Leader “Group 1 is fully buffed and is at 50% mana.”<br>
·        This is the time for you to get drinks, munchies, have that smoke that you are not allowed to have inside, and respond to the call of nature. Please try to be fast and make sure that your Group Leader knows that you are AFK. If you need to go AFK for an extended period of time, you are not ready for this raid and should remove yourself.<br>
·        When all casters are at full mana Group Leaders will report to the Raid Leader “Group 1 is ready to go.”<br>
·        At this point the Raid Leader will issue any special instructions (do not sit against left wall, etc) and will let everyone know that we are ready to go.<br>
·        Do not ask for unnecessary buffs, or go running around during the buffing session. Be patient and sit in your spot. Unless of course you get jumped on by a dragon.<br>
·        DO NOT ask questions to the Raid Leader ask them in group, your Group Leader will ask the Raid Leader if he cannot answer. Also do not hesitate to ask questions or to let your Group Leader know that this is your first raid and that you are unsure about what your duties are. Being up front will gain you respect and all the help you will need. (as well as a good “sporking”)<br>
·        The guild message board is a GREAT place to post questions prior to the raid. This will also save you a lot of trouble when getting started. <br>
·        Listen to everything that the Raid Leader says. Do as you are told and do so as quickly as possible (especially when moving).<br>
·        Make sure you don’t spam the raid channels with spam. Unnecessary chat can cause someone to miss important instructions. It is best to use guild chat or tells for all unnecessary chat. <br>
·        Make sure you read the Guild Message Board for the raid so that you know and understand any specifics. This is very important in regards to loot rules, pet restrictions, and other items that are particular to that individual raid.<br>
<br>
During the raid<br>
<br>
·        When entering the zone the tanks will zone first followed closely by the primary healers. Once in the zone DO NOT MOVE AROUND. Stay close to the zone until told to move by the Raid Leader.<br>
·        If we get aggro fight as normal and ASSIST properly.<br>
·        Once in Group Leaders will inform the Raid Leader “Group 1 in zone and ready to go.”<br>
·        When the Raid Leader says its time to move, everybody stand up and move as a group. DO NOT run ahead, keep proper positioning, (i.e. Tank type in front)<br>
·        Once at the camp area, sit behind the MA, he/she needs a clear view of the area and any incoming mobs.<br>
·        There should almost always be just one puller. This person will be identified at the start. The same goes for the MA and SA (one of each)<br>
·        If there is an enchanter they will be in charge of crowd control, if no enchanter is available then someone will be assigned to pull and park adds.<br>
·        Everyone else will stay put, and assist the MA. If you are getting beat on by an add let someone know, running around increases the confusion and invites more trouble.<br>
·        After every fight casters inform their Group Leader of mana status. Group Leaders will then report their status to the Raid Leader.<br>
·        When we are ready for the next pull the Raid Leader will inform the puller. <br>
·        ALWAYS use the assist key. If the MA calls to switch targets DO SO as fast as you can. Someone should root/mez the previous target. At this point the SA will engage the target if it is not mezzable. Know beforehand if you are to stay with the MA or are to switch and engage with the SA. This should eliminate any confusion with people attacking the wrong mob.<br>
·        Only the MA breaks mez! The MA will announce clearly what the target is. Everyone else should wait till the MA engages then assist. Sometimes the MA needs to be on the mob for up to 10 seconds to establish agro. This helps to cut down the amount of unnecessary heals.<br>
·        Root and stun mobs that are not mezzable and put a tank in front of them. DO NOT do damage so that they will not summon. Do not use grasping roots but instead the non damaging type from wizards, enchanters, shaman, cleric, paladin, or necromancer. Do not use sound of force to stun, do not hit the mob only taunt.<br>
·        Do not heal a FD puller unless he/she asks you to do so. Healing them while they still have aggro will transfer the aggro to you and may lead to your death or in the wost case a TPW (total party wipeout)<br>
·        DO NOT DoT in raids on regular mobs. Sometimes you have to switch targets and the first mob will not be able to be mezzed. This often ends up with a dead enchanter and a failed raid. Besides these mobs dye far to quickly for your DoTs to be effective.<br>
·        DO NOT use AE’s If you use an AE and break any mezzes be prepared to fight it by yourself. If you attack something by mistake and break the mez be prepared to solo it. A group wipe out due to incidents such as these is a tragedy and usually ends up in angry Raid and Group Leaders who’s success or failure often determines their ability to attract people to bigger and better raids. <br>
·        SoW and other such spells and songs will be banned on some raids. This is to ensure your safety. If you are feared and have SoW on we may never find you.<br>
·        NEVER use fear or similar spells. Put them in the back of your spell book where you will not see them. Fearing a mob on a raid will more often than not lead to a TPW.<br>
·        Do not panic! Trust the person next to you to do their job. Remember people die on raids its natural. If someone goes down the Group Leader will announce the death (or the Healer if the Group Leader dies). When the fight is over we will rez, med, and get on with the raid.<br>
·        Leave the fight or zone only if the Raid Leader calls for it. This is a rare occasion and in most cases will only serve to intensify the problem.<br>
·        If things go really bad DIE in place. Do not pull a train to the raid. Take one for the team. It is much better to rez one than 20 or 40. Also this will help in the recovery of your corpse.<br>
·        ONLY mages and sometimes necros should have pets since there is a maximum number of pets allowed on a target. Make sure pet taunt is OFF, and let your pet attack only when the MA has established agro. If a mob has AE fire spells mages make a fire pet since it will be immune to the AE. Be aware of buggy pathing and place your pet accordingly. There is nothing worse then getting a ton of adds because someone’s pet decided to go for a stroll.<br>
·        Do not push mobs into walls, into water, or off ledges, pull them back if you see that is going to happen. Mind your pets here to. If you see a mob heading for something everyone should get between the mob and the obstacle so that the mob gets knocked away from it. If that is not possible then disengage and pull back, on a summoning mob this is harder but can be done because it only summons every 12 seconds. Fighting in water is not a good thing especially if you never learnt to swim. Mobs that poof and port when pushed into a wall then summon people from the other side of the dungeon and kill them one by one make for nasty corpse recoveries. And lets not forget the ever popular pushing a dragon off of a cliff which leads to a fun ride to the bottom of a chasm for the raid! Wheeeee<br>
·        When low on healers druids save mana for heals and do not nuke.<br>
·        Do not be afraid of using special abilities such as lay on hands to save MAs, clerics or enchanters in dangerous situations. You have that ability for a reason now is the time to use it. By saving the MA, cleric, or enchanter you might have saved the entire raid. Remember do not target the mob when using LoH<br>
·        DO NOT sit when a pull in incoming, the mob will aggro on you. Stand up as soon as people say %t incoming. Do not sit after casting a high aggro spell like Tashanian or slow. This seems to be a competitive sport among enchanters to see how fast they die.<br>
·        Do not wander away from the group, stick together or you may aggro additional mobs. Raids are not the time to go exploring the zone. Do that on your own, (or with someone else’s character =).<br>
·        If you get aggroed, invis dropps, or whatever die away from the raid force. You can be dragged, summoned and rezzed. Remember a new break for the purpose of a corpse recovery is only fun for the mobs.<br>
·        DO NOT go AFK in dangerous places for example Kedge Keep, because the person that is casting enduring breath on you may have their MP3 player on and will not hear you drowning till its too late. Only rest in designated spots.<br>
·        NEVER gate or evac out of a raid. This is especially true for the planes. If you gate out plan on not returning to the raid.<br>
·        The CAMP command is given by the Raid Leader ONLY. On the command of “CAMP!!”, Clerics camp first. Invis your Clerics if possible. Any class that can FD or sneak hide will follow to assure for a smooth corpse recovery.<br>
·        Do not spam the raid channel for a rez in the event of a wipe out. This does nothing to aide in the raid recovery and often times adds unnecessarily to the frustration that everyone is feeling. You will eventually be rezzed and rebuffed. <br>
·        Most importantly, LISTEN TO THE RAID LEADER! If they say “jump” you jump, If they tell you not to sit against the walls, don’t sit against the walls. How the raid is being led is NOT up for discussion unless the Raid Leader declares it so. If you don’t like the way the leader is doing their job, talk to them AFTER the raid. There is nothing more demoralizing and distracting for a Raid Leader than to have people yelling at them for not doing this or that, or spamming them with tells about how they think the raid should be led. Raid Leaders often have good reasons for the way they do things, and if you want to continue to have raids you need to respect their method of leading events.<br>
·        Remember EVERYONE makes mistakes, just admit it and learn from it. Don’t get mad at each other. When someone makes a mistake they are subject to a full raid “sporking”!!!!<br>
<br>
Loot <br>
<br>
·        The raid leader will determine how the loot will be distributed. The two main ways to do this as covered below:<br>
o        NBG – Need Before Greed – This method takes in consideration the ability of a character to use the item including level considerations. It is not useful to give a 30 AC BP with STR and STA stats to a wizzy. This sometimes upsets your greedy characters but is very beneficial to the guild as a whole. Remember when you need that dragon epic mob the strength of the characters in your guild are what will be the determining factor on whether or not you will be successful.<br>
o        GREED – everyone rolls on everything. At lower levels this may be the norm but does nothing to strengthen a guild’s power and ability.<br>
<br>
·        Keep in mind that some items may be defaulted to a particular character or class. This information should be posted on the guild board.<br>
·        The Raid Leader will designate the person or persons that will be the ML’s (Master Looters). This ensures integrity in loot distribution and eliminates finger pointing and hard feelings. <br>
·        DO NOT loot anything unless you are the ML or the Raid Leader instructs you to do so. Ninja Looting will not be tolerated and may result in your being asked to leave the current raid or even to be suspended from the next event.<br>
·        All loot will be rolled on AFTER the raid is complete. If for some reason you have to leave you may designate an officer to roll for you ONLY choosing from the loot that was obtained prior to your absence. No Drop loot will be rolled on immediately after the fighting is over and things are safe.<br>
·        Fake or “spam” rolling will disqualify you for the real roll, as it is very confusing and annoys others.<br>
·        Once a person has rolled and won an iten they will not roll again until everyone has won something.<br>
·        Roll only on things that are useful to your class. (refer to the reason for NBG looting)<br>
·        The Raid Leader may choose to do the rolling. He/she will call for those who are eligible to roll on an item, assign them a number and cast the roll. This is much less confusing and faster.<br>
·        (optional)The raid leader gets to pick his or her “prize”. You need to understand that researching for a raid, gathering all the necessary items ( pearls, peridots, fish scales, etc.), and coordinating balanced groups requires a tremendous amount of the Raid Leaders time. It is only fair that he/she have the option to call their prize.<br>
·        A portion of the common (junk) loot that will be sold at a vendor, and money, will go to the casters to pay for spell reagents in the event that they are not provided by the Raid Leader (ie, peridots, pearls, and so on).<br>
