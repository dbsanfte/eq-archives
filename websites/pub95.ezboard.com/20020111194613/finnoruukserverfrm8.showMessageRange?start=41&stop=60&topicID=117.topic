But I can give you something from another interview that was on TV.  They were asking people from Afghanistan what they thought about us and the bombing.  Many said they would be happy if the Taliban was removed from power.  All of them however said they would also want us to totally leave after it was done and never return.  Why?  One of the reasons given by many was that we were not of the same faith.  That would fall into one of the sub-catagories I tried to break it down into earlier.  Did you read that one?<br>

Also, who's pro-Iraq view was it exactly in that movie?  BTW, it's not if I like it or not when they are portrayed in any fashion, as long as it's the truth.  Start throwing out lies (not pointing at you, I think many of our disagreements are more about being missinformed on our parts in certain subjects) and there goes the whole arguement someone may be trying to make. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

However, evolution does happen. If it didn't, animal husbandry wouldn't be possible. There's really nothing particularly contradictory between evolution as a process and creation. It's the Bible's account which seems to be contradictory to evolutionary theory. But keep in mind that the Bible wasn't created to be read or interpretted by microbiologists, but by farmers and laborers; even the literate of the day were quite ignorant about the workings of their world. Do you explain the thermodynamics involved in a sunset, from nuclear interactions through fluidics and atmospheric reactions to a 4 year old? Or do you just tell him that all the pretty colors are caused by the sun going down?<br>

By mainstream I mean the Catholic church and such Protestant organizations founded or supported by Fallwell and his ilk.<br>
 Since much of the book was interpreted through 2 or more languages there are errors in those interpretations (the most famous being the number 40, as early hebrew and aramaic used it to mean many, not a specific number) that have been used by those in religious authority as a means of control.<br>
 Science and indead evolution confirms my belief in a God but I will not force those ideas upon another... heck I could be wrong but I don't believe so, let others come to their own understanding of God. My only problem with people who are fervent in their beliefs is when they try to force that belief upon others through intimidation or physical violence which the Taliban and some so called christian church's are wont to do. What is occuring now is not a result of actions taken by the american govt. or people but by zealots who cannot abide someone not of their faith gaining power. It becomes their mission (a holy one) to lesson the non-believers power over others.<br>

<br>
That's my take on forcing religious views on others. If what you believe can affect whether you see paradise or perdition, then it's up to you to come to that belief. If any deity would condone forcing the 'correct' view on someone, He could simply have created us with that view indelibly etched on our minds. And I can't help but think, even if one's own view is the correct one, that one puts his immortal soul in danger for the hubris of coercing others to Belief, no matter which Belief is true.<br>

<br>
Also, my post wasnt in debate of Evolution, but in the manor in which people are decived every day by media and Hollywood by just leaving out facts. If the people of various Islamic nations are told we are evil, then for all intents and purposes we are. Which is clear is happening. These people talk about Holy Wars and such on a daily basis with the target as the United States, and they have done so for years prior to this attack. They are being fed their daily dose of fanatacism and it is working. Surprise Surprise...a page out of Adolf Hitlers book. That is what I equate these Islamic leaders to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Syria. THey would do exactly what Nazi Germany did to them if they had the means...That is what the United States is preventing.<br>

Heck il even repost them here.<br>

Post 1:<br>
===================================<br>
Quote<br>
=====================<br>
Where do these people die? Cleveland? Omaha? No.. in backwards third world shitholes where they won't stop breeding and apparently can't learn basic human sanitation.<br>
=====================<br>
end quote<br>
<br>
You know why they breed? Because they know that alot of the kids will die due to disease and such. And as they dont have the wellfare system and pension funds etc that are existing in the developed world, they will need someone to support them when they get old. and what you call basic human sanitation... basic for you. and me. In these countries alot of people dont even know what a bacteria is. Alot of them cant read. How do you know about 'decent sanitation'? youve been in school. Alot of these people have not. Your parrents have tought you since you were a child, since they were schooled as well. Alot of these people dont have access to clean water. How would you be able to cope if your watertap suddenly stopped to work and have to bathe in the nearby river? Alot of these people have only seen war. <br>
<br>
You have an extremely egocentric world view mate, but that is a common problem when discussing issues like this. We internalise things around us and things we learn so it becomes a part of us, and see it as a rudimentary thing that everyone should know. it is not.<br>
<br>
Ps Dont you find it interesting that bin ladin troops are using AMERICAN made stingers (amongst others) against american troops? wonder how he got them... US shipped them to Afghanistan when they were at war with the Soviet union. They didnt like the regime in the country then either, but chose to neglect it. My enemies enemy is my friend was the word. Now that has changed and the ex friend is the enemy, as the former friend continued to evolve, and could start to concentrate on a new enemy, as their former enemy (soviet union) was out of the picture.<br>
<br>
A few years ago America was involved in an operation in Africa if you remember. Not that much was mentioned in the media about it, the pictures shown on TV was a dead american helicopter pilot dragged through the dirty streets.<br>
In this operation 7000 Africans died. That wasnt shown to much in media was it? <br>
<br>
In this operation US warplanes also mistakenly bombed a medical supply storage, built with the help of UN fundings. This storage house contained about half of the countries medical supplies. It was calculated that 10 to 20k people died indirectly because of this as they didnt get the medicine they needed.<br>
<br>
An investigation was started by the UN on this incident, but it was vetoed by the US.<br>
<br>
All countries tries to affect the world in a way that is beneficial to them. Every country does it. And as America is a very dominant country with a big flourishing economy it has alot of interests to take care of. Nothing strange about that. Just dont get into the illusion that US is all about helping the world. Its no 1 priority is to guard its own interests, and alot of the actions to achieve that isnt pretty, and is therefore hidden to the public. Obvious to me.<br>
<br>
Now you can go ahead and flame me and misquote me, i dont care. <br>
===================================<br>
<br>
Post 2:<br>
===================================<br>
Hiraghm<br>
===================<br>
3.5 million, 3.5 trillion, or 3.5 people dying is all the same to me. And it's all the same to them if they die alone or with 3.4999 trillion companions. I didn't know one of them. Let their loved ones mourn, and work so that it'll never happen again, as I would.<br>
===================<br>
<br>
Then you dont care that much about all the americans that died in the terrorist act in new york, as i bet you didnt know 99.9% of them?<br>
<br>
And also dont care about the holocaust, as you didnt know about them either? or about Stalin killing millions of russians? or about the red khmers i kambodia? And the final statement in that quote block about work for that it wont happen again... Perhaps the terrorists think they did just that?<br>
<br>
I should have known that my comments about special forces etc was coming, and in retrospective view, i should have passed on making that one, as it was not in the interest of my post, and it would make the arguments against it loose focus on the main arguments. I would really like some response to the other comments and arguments i had there though, that made up 95% of my 2 posts or so.<br>
<br>
You have some very good points in your post about why the US lost the Vietnam war. One of the reasons the fundings was cut short was that the war was getting to expensive to uphold. To solve this situation US worked hard with making new money (new bills), so you got alot of inflation during this time. The war simply costed to much to uphold. <br>
<br>
The president of france saw this (De Gaulle). Alot of the currencies in the western world was tied up to the american dollar (the so called gold foot), which basicly said that if you wanted to you should be able to hand in one dollar for a certain ammount of gold. This is why all the gold in fort Nox was being stored. Degaulle then stopped this connection to the dollar, and lots of other countries followed. The outside of US view is more of a curiosa i guess for you, but still could be interesting to know.<br>
<br>

=====================================<br>
You don't want your child to starve to death or develop a disease? Don't have one until you can feed it. Work with your bare hands if necessary to build a clean environment<br>

My arguments against this is in my two earlier posts. Please read and comment. <br>

Kemryen you are very right. I dont think alot of civilians understands what our responsibility is as americans.<br>
We dont go in and just deplete the land.... We actually stick around after wards to help rebuild and form some type of government and basically help them the surviving to start over... We send over food during the war and randomly drop it and that is a act that is done on most missions.....<br>

Chico Rally Address<br>
Thank you for the opportunity to address this rally today. It is not often<br>
that a fighter pilot is asked to be the keynote speaker. There is a rumor<br>
that they are unable to put two sentences together coherently. I'd like to<br>
dispel that rumor today by saying that I can do that, and in fact that I<br>
have written several books. I always wanted to be an author, and I ARE one<br>
now.<br>
I'm a pretty lucky person really. I'm like the little boy who tells his<br>
father that when he grows up he wants to be a jet pilot, and his father<br>
replies, &quot;Sorry son, you can't do both&quot;. I made that choice a long time ago<br>
and flew the jets. I was fortunate to live my dream, and then some. I<br>
survived something I shouldn't have, and today, tell people that I am 28<br>
years old, as it has been that long since I was released from the hospital.<br>
It was like I received a second life, and in the past 28 years, I have<br>
gotten to see and do much, so much that I would not have thought possible.<br>
Returning to fly jets in the Air Force, flying the SR-71 on spy missions,<br>
spending a year with the Blue Angels, running my own photo studio.... and so<br>
much more. And now, seeing our country attacked in such a heinous way.<br>
Some of you here today have heard me speak before, and know that I enjoy<br>
sharing my aviation slide show. I have brought no slides to show you, as I<br>
feel compelled today, to address different issues concerning this very<br>
difficult time in our nation's history.<br>
I stand before you today, not as some famous person, or war hero. I am far<br>
from that. You know, they say a good landing is one you can walk away from,<br>
and a really great one is when you can use the airplane again. Well, I did<br>
neither.........and I speak to you to today as simply a fellow American<br>
citizen.<br>
Like you, I was horrified at the events of September 11th. But I was not<br>
totally surprised that such a thing could happen, or that there were people<br>
in the world who would perpetrate such deeds, willingly, against us. Having<br>
sat through many classified briefings while in the Air Force, I was all too<br>
aware of the threat, and I can assure you, it has always been there in one<br>
form or another. And those of you who have served in the defense of this<br>
nation, know all too well the response that is needed. In every fighter<br>
squadron I was in, there was a saying that we knew to be true, that said,<br>
when there was a true enemy, you negotiate with that enemy with your knee in<br>
his chest and your knife at his throat.<br>
Many people are unfamiliar with this way of thinking, and shrink from its<br>
ramifications. War is such a messy business, and there are many who want no<br>
part of it, but rush to bask in the security blanket of its victory.<br>
I spent an entire military career fighting Communism, and was very proud to<br>
do so. We won that war, we beat one of the worst scourges to humankind the<br>
world has known. But it took a great effort, over many years of sustained<br>
vigilance and much sacrifice by so many whose names you will never know.<br>
And perhaps our nation, so weary from so long a cold war, relaxed too much<br>
and felt the world was a safer place with the demise of the Soviet Union.<br>
We indulged ourselves in our own lives, and gave little thought to the<br>
threats to our national security.<br>
You know, normally my talks are laced with numerous jokes as I share my<br>
stories, but I have very few jokes to tell this afternoon. These murdering<br>
fanatics came into our land, lived amongst our people, flew on our planes,<br>
crashed them into our buildings, and killed thousands of our citizens. And<br>
nowhere along their gruesome path were they questioned or stopped. The joke<br>
is on us. We allowed this country to become soft.<br>
We shouldn't really be too surprised that this could happen. Did we really<br>
think that we could keep electing officials who put self above nation and<br>
this would make us stronger? Did we really think that a strong economy<br>
adequately replaced a strong intelligence community? Did we imagine that a<br>
President who practically gave away the store on his watch, was insuring<br>
national security? While our country was mired in the wasted excess of a<br>
White House sex scandal, the drums of war beat loudly in foreign lands, and<br>
we were deaf. Our response was to give the man two terms in office, and<br>
even then barely half the American public exercised their right to vote. We<br>
have only ourselves to blame. Our elected officials are merely a reflection<br>
of our own values and what we deem important.<br>
Did we not realize that America had become a laughing stock around the<br>
world? We had lost credibility, even amongst our allies. To our enemies we<br>
had no resolve. We made a lot of money, watched a lot of TV, and understood<br>
little about what was happening beyond our shores. We were, simply, an easy<br>
target.<br>
But we are a country awakened now. We have been attacked in our homeland.<br>
We have now felt the reality of what an unstable and dangerous world it<br>
truly is. And still, in the face of this unprecedented carnage in our most<br>
prominent city, there are those who choose to take this opportunity to<br>
protest, and even burn the flag.<br>
If I were the regents or alumni of certain large universities in this<br>
county, I would be embarrassed to be producing students of such ignorance<br>
and naive notions. Like mindless sheep, they march with painted faces and<br>
trite sayings on signs, blissfully ignorant of the world they live in, and<br>
the system that protects them, hoping maybe to make the evening news.<br>
Perhaps if they had spent more time in class they would have learned that<br>
those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. They might have<br>
learned that all it takes for evil to succeed in the world, is for good<br>
people to stand by and do nothing. If they had simply gone back in history<br>
as recently as the Viet Nam War, they would have learned that an enemy that<br>
knows it can never defeat us militarily, will persist as long as there is<br>
dissention and disruption in our land. Their ignorance can be understood,<br>
as their young empty minds have been filled with the re-written history<br>
tripe that tenured leftist professors can spew out with no fear of removal.<br>
But the unwitting aid they provide the enemy, in disrupting the national<br>
resolve, is unforgivable.<br>
I think this is wonderful country, though, that gives everyone their voice<br>
of dissention. I am all for people expressing their views publicly because<br>
it makes it much easier for us to identify the truly foolish, and to know<br>
who cannot be counted on in times of crisis. These are the weak and<br>
cowardly who, when the enemy is crashing through the front door, will cower<br>
in the back room, counting on better men than themselves to make and keep<br>
them free. Well, the enemy is at our front door, and isn't it interesting<br>
those who cry loudest and most often for their rights, are usually those<br>
least willing to defend it.<br>
I heard a student on TV the other day say that this war just wasn't in his<br>
plans and he would simply head to Canada if a draft occurred. Just wasn't in<br>
his plans. I wonder what plans the young men at the beaches of Normandy had<br>
that they never got to live. I wonder if it was in the plans of 19-year-old<br>
boys in Viet Nam to lie dying in a jungle far from home. I guess the men<br>
and women at Pearl Harbor one morning had their plans slightly rearranged<br>
too. Gee, I hope we haven't inconvenienced this student. Those people in<br>
the World Trade Center have no more plans. It is up to us to have a plan<br>
now. And it isn't going to be easy. Who ever said it would? Just what<br>
part of our history spoke of how easy it was to form a free nation? It has<br>
never been easy and has always required vigilance and sacrifice, and<br>
sometimes war, to preserved this union. If it were easy, everyone would<br>
have done it. But no one else has, and we stand alone as the most unique<br>
country on earth.<br>
And isn't it amazing that we have spent a generation stamping God out of our<br>
schools and government, and now as a nation, have collectively turned to God<br>
in memorial services, prayer vigils and churches around this country.<br>
I am also very disturbed to hear that there are people in this country, at<br>
this particular time, who feel it inappropriate to wear the flag on their<br>
lapel because they are on the news or in a public job, and school officials<br>
who want to remove pro-American stickers so as not to offend foreign<br>
students. Well I am offended that these people call themselves Americans.<br>
I am offended that innocent people were killed in a mass attack of<br>
unthinkable proportions. And I am offended at listening to TV broadcasters<br>
speak to me condescendingly, with a bias that screams of their drowning in a<br>
cesspool of political correctness. I pity the person who thinks they are<br>
going to remove this flag from my lapel.<br>
This flag of ours is the symbol of all that is good about this country.<br>
America is an idea. It is an idea lived, and fought for, by a people. We<br>
are America, and this is our symbol. We are imperfect in many ways, but we<br>
continue to strive toward the ideal our forefathers laid down for us over<br>
225 years ago. I could never imagine desecrating that symbol. Perhaps there<br>
are many people in this nation who have never been abroad, or in harms way,<br>
and seen the flag upon their return. Those poor souls can never know the<br>
deep pride and honor one feels to see it wave, to know that there is still a<br>
good ol' USA. With all our warts we are still the greatest nation on earth,<br>
and the flag is the most powerful symbol of that greatness. When I was in<br>
grade school, we used to say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning. It is<br>
something I never forgot. I wonder how many children even know that pledge<br>
today.<br>
This flag is our history, our dreams, our accomplishments, indelibly<br>
expressed in bright red, white, and blue. This flag was carried in our<br>
Revolutionary War, although it had many less stars. But it persevered and<br>
evolved throughout a war we had no right to believe we could win. But we<br>
did, and built a country around it. This flag, tattered and battle worn,<br>
waved proudly from the mast, as John Paul Jones showed the enemy was true<br>
resolve was. This banner was raised by the hands of brave men on a<br>
godforsaken island called Iwo Jima, and became a part of the most famous<br>
photo of the 20th Century. Those men are all dead now, but their legacy<br>
lives on in the Marine Memorial in Washington, DC. Those of you who have<br>
seen it will recall that inscribed within the stone monument are the<br>
words-When Uncommon Valor, Was A Common Virtue- I don't believe you'll see<br>
the words, &quot;it was easy&quot;, anywhere on it. This flag has even been to the<br>
moon, planted there for all time by men with a vision, and the courage to<br>
see it through.<br>
I personally know what it is to see the flag, and feel something deep inside<br>
that makes you feel you are a part of something much bigger than yourself.<br>
Laying in a hospital bed, I can vividly recall looking out the only window<br>
in the room and on Sundays, seeing that big garrison flag flying proudly in<br>
the breeze. It filled the entire window, and filled my heart with a<br>
motivation that helped me leave that bed, and enabled me to be standing here<br>
today. And many years later, while fighting another terrorist over Libya,<br>
my backseater and I outraced Khaddafi's missiles in our SR-71 as we headed<br>
for the Mediterranean, and I can still clearly see that American flag patch<br>
on the shoulder of my space suit, staring at me in the rear view mirror as<br>
we headed west, and it was a good feeling. Now don't ask me why we had rear<br>
view mirrors in the world's fastest jet, I can assure you, no one was<br>
gaining on us that day.<br>
I am so happy to see so many flags out here today. Long may it wave.<br>
History will judge us. How we confront this chapter of American history<br>
will be important for the future of this great nation. This will be a war<br>
like none other we have endured. The combatants will not just be the<br>
soldier on the battlefront, but will be fought by us the citizens. We are<br>
on the battlefield now; the war has been brought to us. We will determine<br>
the outcome of this war by how well we remain vigilant, how patient we are<br>
with tightened security, how well we support the economy, and most<br>
importantly, in the resolve we show the enemy. There are some things worth<br>
fighting for, and this country is one of them.<br>
I pray for our leaders at this time. In the Pacific, during WW II, Admiral<br>
Bull Halsey said, &quot;There are no great men, just great circumstances, and how<br>
they handle those circumstances will determine the outcome of history&quot;. Our<br>
future and the future of coming generations are in our hands. Wars are not<br>
won just on military fronts, but by the resolve of the people. We must<br>
remain tenaciously strong in the pursuit of this enemy that threatens free<br>
people everywhere.<br>
I am encouraged that we will win this war. Even before the first shot was<br>
finished being fired, there were brave Americans on Flight 93, fighting<br>
back. These people were the first true heroes of this conflict, and gave<br>
their lives to save their fellow countrymen.<br>
This nation, this melting pot of humanity, this free republic, must be<br>
preserved. This idea that is America is important enough to be defended.<br>
Fought for. Even die for. The enemy fears what you have, for if their<br>
people ever become liberated into a free society, tyrannical dictatorships<br>
will cease and he will lose power.<br>
How can they ever understand this country of ours, so self-indulgent and<br>
diverse, yet when attacked, so united in the defense of its principals.<br>
This is the greatest country in the world because brave people sacrificed to<br>
make it that way. We are a collective mix of greatness and greed, hi-tech<br>
and heartland. We are the country of Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mantle; from<br>
John Smith and Pocahontas to John Glen and an Atlas booster; from Charles<br>
Lindbergh to Charley Brown; from Moby @#%$ to Microsoft; we are a nation<br>
that went from Kitty Hawk to Tranquility Base in less than 70 years; we are<br>
rock and roll, and the Bill of Rights; we are where everyone else wants to<br>
be, the greatest nation in the world.<br>
The enemy does not understand the dichotomy of our society, but they should<br>
understand this; we will bandage our wounds, we will bury our dead; and then<br>
we will come for you.......and we will destroy you and all you stand for.<br>
I read this quote recently and would like to share it with you:<br>
<br>
We are pressed on every side, but not crushed,<br>
Perplexed, but not in despair,<br>
Persecuted, but not abandoned,<br>
Struck down, but not destroyed.<br>
<br>
That is from II Corinthians. Not too long ago it would have been<br>
politically incorrect to quote from the Bible. I am so happy to be<br>
politically INCORRECT. And I am so proud to be an American.<br>
Thank you all for coming out today and showing your support for your<br>
government, and your nation. You are the true patriots, you are the<br>
soldiers of this war, you are the strength of America.<br>

Spare me this nationalistic b ullshit will ya ;)<br>
Pls just accept that you arent gods gift to mankind and that US isnt a saint nation only working for the best for all the world. US is working for its own good, as is all other countries. If its good for other people as well then thats a bonus of course. Rest assured that US has been behind alot more innocent peoples death then the 7k that died in the terrorist act in New York. All this flag waving and 'go usa!' are getting a tad to much ;)<br>

Americans have alot to be proud of, but dont think that your country is snow white (sp)<br>

I know i will be called anti american, perhaps some silly accusations of different kinds, but spare me, and try to be a bit realistic and think again before you give me that crap.<br>

We supply arms to &quot;freedom fighters&quot; all over the world -- anywhere we don't like the established regime.  We supply arms and support to dictators all over the world -- anywhere we get along with the established regime, no matter how horrid they are.<br>
<br>
We trained the Taliban and Saddam Hussein's people because it appeared to further our causes against other regimes.<br>
<br>
We maintain the monarchy in Saudi Arabia because it maintains stability and a friendly government.  This is a monarchy that does not allow many of the freedoms Americans take for granted.<br>
<br>
The Shah of Iran and Marcos in the Phillipines.<br>
<br>
&quot;Freedom fighters&quot; in South America.<br>
<br>
We enforce a no-fly zone over a sovereign nation to reduce the ability of that nation to put down insurgents (protecting the kurds in northern Iraq).<br>
<br>
What's the quality of life in Cuba these days?<br>
<br>
It would be nice if we could claim the moral high ground in all these situations.  But we knew what the Taliban was like, we knew what Saddam Hussein was like.  We know about the human rights issues in Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
We are not snow white.  People die from the guns and bullets we provide.  People die due to lack of decent nutrition in Cuba and other places.<br>
<br>
Some of these situations can't really be helped.  We're stuck between a rock and a hard place.  We couldn't afford to go head-to-head with the Soviet Union in Afghanistan -- that would have been the start of something truly horrible.  Yet it would be morally reprehensible to do nothing.<br>
<br>
The world needs the oil available in Saudi Arabia.  Supporting a friendly, stable government there probably has resulted in a greater level of world peace.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the U.S. government is trying to be evil.  But there are times where your choices are to pick between evils.  You are forced to pick a path and go with it.<br>
<br>
But you can't make those choices and not end up hurting people.<br>
<br>
It is NOT anti-American to admit the truth.  In fact it's awfully irresponsible to deny the truth.<br>
<br>
The truth is -- we're trying to do what's best for the world at large and the U.S. specifically.  Sometimes we end up making policy that is unpopular in some areas.  Sometimes people get hurt.  We're sorry that's how things happen, but we're doing the best we can.<br>
<br>
The alternatives are conceivably far worse.  What would the worldwide situation be in if the oil-producing countries decided they weren't gonna share?<br>
<br>
I'll tell you what -- Japan went to war over this once, and they'd do it again.  So would every other industrialized nation, if that's what it came to.<br>
<br>

At least Wolf has an idea I can handle even if I don't agree with him totally.  I think he and I see the same picture overall, just from different views.  You on the other hand seem like some little child who has yet to see the harsh reality of the world and what it can do.  I do have one question for Wolf though.  What does the plight of Cuba have to do with us?  We don't trade with them but we don't stop others from doing so.  Canada and many other countries have open trade with Cuba.  Are we to stick our noses in there so people can whine about how we're someplace we don't belong again?  Would providing them aid in the form of food and medicine be the way to go?  North Korea gets aid each year in the form of tons and tons of food each year but yet their general population continues to starve and die by the thousands each year.  Their leaders and army continue to be fed though while their military continues to grow.  I wonder where all that food goes.  We cannot provide for the world in all the cases.  To do so would provoke other things.  Some countries don't want our help and then cry about how they are so poor and such.  Once I see our own tanks running over our people protesting the government will I believe we are the devils people try to make us to be. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

<br>
As for Kil's question regarding Cuba...  Cuba is denied trading activity with the only 1st world power in 1500 miles.  Cuba is denied trading activity not only with the U.S., but with all U.S. companies.  I'm not sure, but I also suspect that travel to and from Cuba is made significantly more difficult -- I suspect, but don't know for sure that there are no Miami-Havana flights by any airlines.  Thus, flights need to originate in Canada, South America or Europe.  Not exactly convenient.<br>
<br>
Are we directly killing people there?  No, and we're certainly within our rights to not engage in trade with a country we disagree with.<br>
<br>
But why would we single out this one country?  We were selling wheat to the Soviet Union throughout the cold war.  We engage in trade with China.  We carry on relations with tons of deplorable regimes.  What makes Cuba unique?<br>
