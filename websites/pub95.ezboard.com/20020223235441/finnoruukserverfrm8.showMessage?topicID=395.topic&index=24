This isn't going to affect the regular servers in any way, other than the possibility of losing a small percentage of the players.<br>
Verant has said quite clearly that the GMs on this new server will NOT be taken from the existing GM pool, and they will NOT be taking resources from the regular servers.<br>
I think this is a great idea, especially for those more into RP than hack-n-slash.  Assume that they have 8000 users at $40/month, that comes out to $320,000/month, or $240,000/month more than a similar regular server would pull in.  (I think we can assume that the generic server costs are the same.)  Now with this extra money they can easily hire 20-30 really good, active GMs.  If they do this right, on peak times you'll have 8-10 GMs online, and even at absolute minimum times, you should be able to have 1 or 2 GMs online.<br>
What will you really get for the money though?  It's not like they're going to be able to do custom campaigns all the time, or at least not without making major changes to the Norrath backstory.  I expect that you will get the chance to actually take part in the big, overarching changes in the story of Norrath, stuff like the plauge in the Karanas or the kidnapping of FV or the search for the Nexes portals.  These events happen on the regular servers, but it's pretty much luck as to who gets to take part and who gets the nifty items.<br>
On this new server I expect that they will really play out the events though, with several little events leading up to it, and a number of events which have very little to do with the evolving storyline, but are there more for entertainment.<br>
I don't see anything that indicates that Verant will stop offering these interactive quests on the regular servers, and the statements from Verant seem very much designed to assure people that they won't take away from the regular servers.<br>
I think most of the people ranting are doing so because they want Everquest to be something it's not:  a really big and intricate D&amp;D-type world with personal GMs and customizable content.  Verant asked if people would be willing to pay for an additional level of service, and enough people said yes that Verant is going to try it.  <br>
I'm personally not going to switch, unless my guild were to decide to move as a whole, because I like the Innoruuk community and I don't really think not having customizable campaigns is a big problem.  Maybe if there were no AA points, and once you made 60 there wasn't much more to do, joining a server where the GMs created content would be more attractive, but I don't think I'm missing out on that much.  For me going to Chardok and killing Sarnaks is fun, even if I don't have a GM telling a story about how the Sarnaks have been raiding the goblin villages, and selling the goblins into slavery, and how the goblins have hired my band of adventurers to help them in their battle with the sarnaks.  If I really want the backstory like that, I make it up.  <br>
(For example, I'm giant ally because no being should ever trust a dragon.  Those scaly bastards can't conceive of any other creature being anything other than a snack for them, even if they pretend to tolerate them.  I've seen too many dragons turn.  The only good dragon is a dead dragon I say, and the best dragon is one that's dead and rotting!)<br>
I really hope this server works out, though I'm afraid that if it does it will cause more discord than good.  I look at it as an equivilant to the personal shopper service that high-end stores offer, where you pay extra to have someone assist just you, and pick stuff for you and you alone.  Nobody @#%$ that Nordstroms doesn't offer good service to regular customers just because you can pay more for personalized service.<br>
I hope those to whom the backstory is important, and those who like being able to effect the story go to the new server and are happy there.  Who knows, this may be the perfect server for those who actually do have a problem with powergamers and not just with everyone who might have slighter better equipment.<br>

Its the execution that is lacking. This is, IMHO, the crux of the complaint many have with Verant and the delivery of EQ. <br>
<br>
Promises were made via marketing materials, posts at the EQ site, etc. that portrayed the game in a certain fashion - one which a  considerable majority feel has yet to be realized. For some time now, many have preferred to take a 'wait and see' perspective and that's really very commendable. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Verant and Sony Online Entertainment have taken a fairly nonchalant view of complaints and an all but non-existant interest in actually providing the level of service and interactivity (i.e., events, etc.) they promised would be an integral component of this product. <br>
<br>
This has but contributed to the underlying dissatisfaction of their customers and the latest news of the product people *thought* they were going to be receiving arriving with additional fees is considered by many to be a slap in the face... perhaps even the last straw.<br>
<br>
I have been surprised people haven't pursued the matter in a more logical and effective way. Perhaps this is the beginning of something along those lines. Personally, I believe there is a case to be made that EQ has failed rather significantly to deliver the product promised to its customers. <br>
<br>
Is anyone interested in making such a case? I become more and more interested in doing so. Not because I hold any personal vendetta against Verant or Sony Online... but because I believe it is inherently wrong to allow a company to get away with 'bait and switch' tactics, and in my personal opinion - that is precisely what has occurred.<br>
<br>

As paying customers, and basically the backbone of Everquest, I think we should do something about promises that have been broken and service that hasn't been satisfactory.I'm sick of waiting for Verant to fix problems that exsist while they merrily work on new products and avert from what should be done.

<br>
The fansites were all featuring interviews and spoilers in which things such as the Bazaar function were discused(not implemented so far, but HEY, the premium server already has an automap, and it's not even LIVE yet!).  The point most folks seem to be choking on is that Luclin CONTENT isn't even all live, let alone interface upgrades, but resources have been apparently devoted to this Legends program.<br>
<br>
For instance, one of the high level raid zones in the new expansion isn't live.  The places are all there, and there's a quest to get the key to the zone, and the big boss MoB is already rendered and pacing in his little sanctum, but the key quest is broken.  It's intentional.  Triton, a guild on Povar already HAS keys to this place.  They've received confirmation from server GM's that this was indeed the key, but it doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Here's a little insult for you to sprinkle on the injury:  a few guilds have gotten in with various tricks and killed the guy, and they took the time to code in loot for him....JOKE LOOT!  He drops a breastplate that's -200ish to most stats called the Curiass of Sad Exploitation, and a tremendous sword that nobody can equip.  Not only have they not finished the content, they've taken the time to put in surrogate content to deride the folks who can bypass the broken bits and get to it!<br>
<br>
Now we see that while they couldn't implement a great deal of what they were promising with SoL, they DID have time to code new interfaces, and add features to the game that we paid for, but will never see.  We see that the content and service that we were promised when EQ went live, and arguably have yet to see, is available for an extra thirty bones a month?!  I don't know who coined it, but the sentiment seems to be:<br>
<br>
&quot;You're in our world now, and the rent just went up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I'm having fun with Everquest, and will continue to, but I'm not paying any more for the service than I am now.  If'n I ever feel that the level of service I'm rendered isn't worth what I'm paying for it I'll just stop playing.  I don't have any shares in Sony stock, so I don't care what they do with the money I send them for EQ.  I would, however, like to see them finish the product I bought afore they start making new'uns. <p><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/39/2383739.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=395.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=395.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=28><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=395.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=395.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=395.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=395.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
