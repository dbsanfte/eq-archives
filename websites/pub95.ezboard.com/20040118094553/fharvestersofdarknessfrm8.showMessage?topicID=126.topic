He wasted no time in moving to Shadowhaven after his confrontation with Kerridwynn and Demaste in New Tanaan.<br>
<br>
The hulking lizard storms up the pathway towards Harvester Hall, his tail swishing back and forth dramaticaly as it followed him.  His dark armor glistens in what light there is; his huge, rune-covered greatsword was casually and unconciously waved around in his clenched claw.  His scales are adorned with similar runes, seemingly written in blood.  His ice cold eyes glow with something that he rarely shows - anger, or prehaps something even more.<br>
<br>
Shouts can be heard from within the keep as the guards signal his approach; the Overlord Saurix Shizathir is far form difficult to identify.  As he closes, the two guards flanking the Hall's great doors more to intercept him, weapons drawn - but too late.  In an instant, the massive Overlord springs forward, his tail lashing at one guard's head and his free hand grabbing the other's neck.  The first guard falls to the ground, unconcious from what was as good as a small tree trunk's blow; the second is raised several feet off the ground and pinned to the door, dropping his weapons in shock.  Saurix focuses his awesome glare on him and growls out his demands, always keeping his Teir'Dal perfect:<br>
<br>
&quot;It was most rude of your Ilharen to flee from me in mid conversation, whelp, and I intend to finish what I had to say.  If you have any intelligence at all, you will escort me to his chambers immediately, where I will await his arrival undisturbed.  Failure to do so will result in increases in the population of a number of dark gods' planes, until I am able to finish said discussion.  Am I clear, weakling?!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, he throws the guard down at his feet and awaits his response.<br>
<br>
((OOC - Wheee - hoping someone comes to take the NPCish guard's role, or at least comes and relieves him..  poor guys, I almost feel bad for beating them up as often as I do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ))<br>

<br>
Saurix looks up from the guard to the other Iksar, letting out a feral growl at this corrupted whelp before addressing him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kss, manners?!  You Harvesters have shown me none yourself, so you recieve none in return.  Prehaps, if you are so concerned with manners, you would be so kind as to escort me to your Ilharen's chambers.  He, if noone else here, seems to be especially lacking in that department.  I do not want to have to teach any lessons tonight, especially to those who haven't yet themselves earned them...&quot;<br>

Keeping his sword at the more-than-ready and his temper just in check, he continued on with his demands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, you will do just as well, Priestess.  I must say, this is an interesting place for YOU to go hunting...  and it is a shame that you do not think it fair for both sides to say all they want before one flees.  Now, I believe you are very much in debt to me, Kerridwynn, and it would be to your advantage to negotiate the proper terms, before I decide on them myself.  I will give you and your people here another minute to act before I do.  I would suggest sending an escort, or preparing a mass-resurection spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Saurix began to count out the seconds with every swipe of his tail behind him, his glare focusing in on the priestess, waiting....<br>

<br>
&quot;Saurix, I imagine any debt owed you was paid in the blood from my back.  You asked for me to aid you, and I said no.  My husband confirmed that.  He grew bored with your constant blathering, and we left.  What else did you have to say that hadn't already been said?<br>
<br>
As for negotiations...there are none.  No deal was made, no bargain struck.  I'm rather disappointed in you, making all this fuss over such a little thing.  You wouldn't even tell me what you wanted my help for.  Why should I have given you any other answer?<br>
<br>
Go back to your home.  Find some other priestess to bother.  I wish to be quit of you completely, so that maybe I can get over what you did to me.  If you think that you will gain my compliance by razing my guildhall, and wreaking havoc among my family, you are sorely mistaken.&quot; <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/Kerridwynn.jpg"><BR><i>~*Templar of Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows*~<br>~*Mistress of the Scythe*~</i><br><i>The hours go by like minutes,<br>And the shadows come to stay.</i><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208851>Garb of the Priestess</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chaeslcassiline@harvestersofdarkness>Chaes LCassiline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(9/2/03 12:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Unexpected Visitor?</span><hr size=1> Shadows seemed to part quietly as two figures slipped between them, severing the darkness with a slow domination of color. Subdued hues of blacks and greens, with orange, pressed from the shades, the figures splitting quietly apart and flanking the Iksar Overlord. <br>
  <br>
Katar grasped easily in the Vah Shir's hands as he crouched to the left and behind the Lizard, his tigress companion settling herself to the right. The two became as still as statues, with the exception of the rise and fall of their breathing, seeming to be living statues.<br>

The Vah Shir stared quietly at the Iksar, eyes concentrated upon him, focus unrelenting. Unwavering.
