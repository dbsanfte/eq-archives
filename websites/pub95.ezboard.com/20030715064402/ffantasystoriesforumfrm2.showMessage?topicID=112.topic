<br>
&quot;Damnit I tell you I cannot spare the men for your foolish campaign, I am seventy years old and I saw that bastard die when I was a new Knight. I really don't believe you, he can't be back, gentlemen I'm afraid that I cannot and will not spare the men to help you in your journey, go find some Mercenaries for hire&quot; Sir Lucan said with a tired voice. &quot;I am sure there are plenty out there.” Syithumis was sitting in a chair by a window in Sir Lucans chambers, in which Sir Lucan invited us in to speak with him about matter which Uncle Bleuhakwe and Syithumis said were important. Both Bleu and Syithumis are well known in Freeport and have good reputation with both Sir Lucans militia and the Knights of Truth. “I don’t think he’s alive&quot; Syithumis began, &quot;but I do think there is someone out there that has the leadership skills to form an army on which we do not know the size of yet and go and slaughter a entire village in a way that looks like Rhendavud did it himself.” Your city is at risk here&quot; Bleu butted in. &quot;And if this guy or guys or who every has the power to more or less wipe a village from the face of the earth like its a crumb, you should be concerned. This guy Err who every has a large army now may have an even larger army later, large enough to be a threat to Freeport!” <br>
<br>
There was something about saying “threat to Freeport” which made Sir Lucan mad, mad enough to throw all of us out onto the streets of Freeport. “I’ve have never seen him that angry” said Bleu as we walked away to nearest bar in Freeport, Syithumis was first to enter the Grub and Grog a bar that was well know for its violence and mercenaries adds. Lucky there was only two other people in the bar, A dwarf which was sitting in a corner enjoying his drink and the other was a half elf. From the looks of it the half elf was drunk and had past out with his mug still in his hand. Syithumis walked over to the bar tender and ordered one Freeport short, a Ogre Swill and a Dwarven ale. Bleu on the other hand took a look at the mercenaries billboard and ripped off a few adds and brought it to the table that Soen choose. Soen choose a table that was on the far end of the bar, she did not like bars and often waited outside when we went in to get a drink. Syithumis and Bleuhawke argued a bit on whom they should hire, finely Syithumis said “forget it I’ll let you chose, I’ll try and find us a Inn for the night. At that, Syithumis left the bar to find us a Inn for the night. <br>
<br>
After a few days of working some pretty fair paying guard jobs we got just enough money to hire a small group of professional mercenaries like ourselves. “So who did you hire to help us Bleu? &quot; I got a well armed little ragtag bunch, let me see, theirs Captain Begnar , he's a dwarf he has short auburn hair, green eyes, he wears a brown tunic and green trousers, he wears a heavy fieldplate and the rest of his group except for the assassin wear lightfield plate, he is proficient with a two handed axe, a single handed axe and... Thats enough geez , these guys must be pros if they got their damn descriptions and proficiencies written on a piece of parchment&quot; screeched Syithumis after he interupted Bleuhawke. &quot; either that or their damn desperate&quot;.<br>
<br>
On our way to freeport we were attacked by a band of highwaymen and Syithumis had a close call. When we had set up camp we built a fire ( which was stupid we could be seen for miles, but after Soen's persistent nagging about getting cold we finally gave in ). Shortly after we went to bed Bleuhawke took the first watch sitting in a tree facing west, when they attacked they came from the east. They came right behind Soens tent after they thought they had dispatched Syithumis by slitting his throat, well when he went to bed and fell asleep his hand was on his neck which is what saved him. &quot;AHHHHHHHHH (In a high pitch woman scream) You PIG&quot; Soen screamed. My uncle Bleuhawke fell out of the tree with his weapons drawn both a longsword and mace and I came out of the tent wearing only my trousers and I brought with me my hand axe and short sword. Yaoric was no slouch either, apparently he sleeps with his armor on and was the first to start hacking and bashing. First he and another highwayman charged each other. Just before impact he crouched down stabbed under the mans shield and used his momentum to throw him over himself and into the tree my uncle bleu was in, the man was neatly stuck on the tree by a branch the my uncle had been whitling. Then I saw Uncle bleu leaping into the freigh alongside the Darknight as if it were a everyday thing. He first dodged an over head swing and then fully extended his arm and brought it down sideways into the mans belly neatly cutting him open and leaving his steaming entrails on the grass below, then he caught a man off guard with his mace and sword. He first smashed his bottom jaw off entirely and then cut the top part of the mans skull off revealing a gooey brain. The man was in shock evidently because he tried to put his head back together, upon seeing this my uncle swung the mace into his skull cavity killing the man and he also made a sound akin to a large rock being dropped into a pool of water. I figured it was my turn so I found myself a bandit trying to rob our supplies , I threw my axe at him but he dodged it and threw it back at me and he stuck it in my left arm, but I was immune to pain at the moment, I was very angry and was not phased , He came at me like a wolf , head down teeth bared and weapons drawn, I then pulled my axe from my arm and I stood my ground letting him charge, then at the very last possible moment I sidestepped  , I brought my axe down on his spine and for good measure I stabbed him in the neck. <br>
<br>
Then the white hot pain seared through my body I stabbed the man in the neck and twisted then I noticed the dagger in my side . &quot;Uncle Bleu I got one&quot; Toag Shouted above the roar of the fight. &quot;Your mine pretty, you'll fetch a sweet price on the market for a slave&quot; cried a bandit . Soen being the strong willed womenshe is created a fireball in her palm and hit the man in the chest with it. Now they both stood looking at one another, THAT STUNG YOU BI***!!!, Madden Soen kicked the man in the balls spread her fingers and created two lines of pure energy and sent them through the mans head boiling everything inside until it blew up! Soen began sobbing and ran back to into her tent Just at that moment the powerful wizard emerged from the tent, everything stopped fighting, even Bleuhawke turned to a Bandit and &quot; Murmured yer in for it now!&quot; Soen ran to Syithumis and clung to his robe &quot;they tried to kill you and sell me&quot; she cried . The wizard looked and his disciple and then scratched his goatee. Then with a satisfied look he motioned for my uncle and Yaoric to hit the deck. Right after that he cast a very powerful spell that brought down a bolt of lightning and with all the assorted armor and metal on the bandits the lightning appeared to jump from each one. The Stench left was unbearable and for some reason uncle Bleu's and Yaoric's hair were both standing on end. They were also heavily panting, I myself had gotten the last kill when I saw a man running I threw my hand axe and shattered his spine. Then I ran up and slit the mans throat, broke his neck, stomped on his head till it cracked and then I accidentally yanked his head off. All total in a few minutes we had killed about eighteen well equipped highwaymen, we made quiet the profit selling all their equipment. After the fight I was congratulated about my first scar and Soens first kill as well, It turns out I killed one of the men that helped drag Soen away and upon her hearing this I was awarded a kiss on the cheek, my cheeks turned bright red and I was slapped on the back and given a manly cheer, after the bandaging and drinking things got a little more serious. Yaoric and Bleu pointed out my flaws and Syithumis did the same with his disciple as well. Bleuhawke now openly welcomed the Dark Knight a bit more and they got along much better after he showed uncle Bleu what he did to his second kill , he boiled the mans blood cut him in half and sucked his life force from the bleeding body. Yaoric was still a very hard man for some reason and would not talk to Soen, Me, or syithumis very much. All total I had gotten two kills, Soen one, Syithumis killed about six , uncle bleu had five kills, and Yaoric four. I don't think the fighting men in our group exactly enjoyed killing but I think they thought of it as a challenge to face another man in one-on-one combat.<br>

“So who’s hiring us Begnar?” Meddwin asked in a curios voice, as Begnar the dwarf walk along the streets of Freeport followed by his good friend a halfling named meddwin. “A warrior name Bleuhawke and old wizard named Syithumis.” Bleuhawke? Meddwin said, what kind of name is Bleuhawke? And a wizard, I never like wizards always rude and the act like they know everything.” “Bleuhawke is northmans name and Syithumis is known to be one of the most powerful wizard alive next to Al’kabor and Shi Koron. Bleuhawke has a nice reputation as well, I would not joke with these people.” Begnar warned. Meddwin look a little disappointed, “ I would not joke with these people, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?” Begnar looked at Meddwin with a serious look “I know you Meddwin, how you like to steal and cheat and play jokes on the people who hire us! These people have some serious background for being good at killing anyone who makes em mad. I can’t have you beheaded for cheating in a poker game now can I, not good for business.” Meddwin look at Begnar with a hurtful look, “ Well fine if you say so.” Begnar smiled, and then stopped walking after he turned a corner. Meddwin stopped as well. <br>
<br>
“So where do we meet these people Meddwin said with a yawn. “Right here around eleven” Meddwin look up at the sun trying to find out what time it was, after some time meddwin eyes began to hurt from looking at the sun to long. “What time is it.” said Meddwin as he rub his eyes. Began reach in his pockets and pulled out a chain     with a gnomish watch attached “ a little past eleven” he murmured. Meddwin looked at Begnar in a envious way. “ I bet its nice to have that gnomeish watch always know what time it is and everything.” Meddwin looked at his fury feet and began again. “How much did it cost?” . “A few plat”. &quot;That’s not bad squeaked the little hobbit assassin&quot;. “Are you two the mercs?”. Said a gruff low voice from behind a corner. “ Yes we are, are you our employers ?” . “I’m Bleuhawke this is Syithumis, Were is the rest of your group, I thought we hired five Begnar”. &quot;Oh you did, but they didn’t want to come, so is the deal on , we get 300 platinum per week per person?” said the dwarf trying to muster some dignity. &quot;If your good enough yes, but we only pay half up front so we make sure you don’t run off on us&quot;growled bleuhawke . &quot;All right if you insist , lets go meet the rest of the crew&quot; begnar said. <br>
<br>
After a couple of minutes of walking Bleuhawke, Begnar, Syithumis and Meddwin walk into a unnamed inn that housed the rest of Begnar’s mercenary group. “ Hello Begnar are these guys the employers?” said a heavily tanned Half elf with a scar that started at the top of his eyebrow and fell all they way down below his cheek bone. “ I’m Threndir, I’ll be your warrior / scout. The half elf outstretched his hand to Bleuhawke but Bleuhawke ignored it. Two others arose to meet the wizard and the warrior. “Hello I’m Vandir and this is Elaudd” said a elf in chainmail with his hands on the butts of his sword. bleuhawwke started “ I’m am Bleuhawke the warrior and this is Syithumis the Greatest Disciple of Al’ Kabor and one of the most powerful wizards upon norrath” . If any of you know it was I and Syithumis whom helped vanquish Rhendavud Na’Vak along with Al’ Kabor and many others, most of those heroes are dead and unable to help us, well it seems that Rhendavud or someone like him is terrorizing the countryside apparently looking for whatever it was that he was looking for. A few days ago we found a village that had been burnt to the ground and that village had a four hundred man garrison, their was one survivor, now we are hearing rumors of a shrine in the oasis that has been attacked. We need to go their and see what’s going on so we can see if this is a copycat or if it is an impersonator, Rhendavud was a brilliant strategist and usually leaves a rear guard. We have found a guide to get us there, he left just before the night of the attack his name is Adoesh, the altar boy of that particular shrine&quot;. Late into the night they spoke of plans and strategies until the dawn. <br>
<br>
It was late when Bleuhawke and Syithumis got back to the inn that night and the sand of sleep had filled their eyes greatly, so much that they did not notice Soen sneaking into Toags room to speak with him. “Toag Toag wake up” whispered Soen. In a blur of steel Soen was at the end of a dagger until Toag rubbed the sleep from his eyes. When he could see her he immediately twirled his dagger back to its sheath. “Why are you here?” Toag said after he got his trousers on under the sheet. “I wanted to talk about tomorrow with you” I’m kinda scared about going off into the desert and fighting some evil guys with a lot of evil things with him, and I know your brave so I just wanted to talk with you.” “I’m not that brave, as a matter of fact I was afraid we were going to die when those bandits attacked us.” “Your just trying to bluff” . “No I’m not, as a matter of fact I’m scared as can be about tomorrow, I don’t wanna die, but I like to fight, its in my blood, I guess that’s a silly thing to say being a warrior and all.” “I don’t think its silly at all , I thinks its heroic that your so honest”. “Thanks, that means a lot.” “ Will you protect me tomorrow if we get attacked ?”. “Of course, I really like you, I’d die protecting you if I had to” Said Toag in a soothing voice. Soen frowned for a moment and then spoke &quot; if you die I'll kill you&quot; Soen gave Toag a big kiss and hugged him for being so nice *geez this is great, but this is embarrassing too * thought toag. Silently Soen went back to her room. Then something that looked like a heat wave appeared, then poof, Syithumis and Bleuhawke had appeared and had listened to everything, with a smile of approval each went off to their separate rooms for the rest of the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning everyone was getting ready to go on their trip. Syithumis, Bleuhawke, Toag and Soen were all standing in the lobby of inn. “When do we get you meet our other companions?” Toag ask. Right at that moment Begnars and his men came in through the inn door, ready for combat as ready as anyone could be. “So these are the other two Begnar said with a smile as he look at Toag and Soen. “Wow, we have a pretty one here” Meddwin grinned evilly as he look at Soen with a dirty look. Soen scowled at the Meddwin, folded her arms then said to Toag. “Dirty little halfling.” Meddwin look at Toag just in time to see Toag give him a look that seemed to say “Back off if ya know whats good for you!” Meddwin smiled a innocent smile. “May I have every ones attention Syithumis said loudly breaking up the stare between Toag and Meddwin. “Everyone, Bleuhawke and I are in charge. What we are planning to do is first go into the Desert of Ro and head to a small shrine on the far south part of Ro. A boy by the name of Adoesh will show us the way, I sent Yaoric to go to the boy’s Aunts home to pick the boy up. Once they return we’ll be on our way. “Who is Yaoric? Begnar ask. You never said anything about a fifth person.” “Yaoric is a knight, a dark knight at that, and the reason why I did not tell you about him is because, I was not even sure if he was going to accompany us. This morning Yaoric came to my room which I told him where we would be staying when we first enter into Freeport and said that his guild master told him that he was to accompany us to find out more about this person who is impersonating Rhendavud.” “I see Begnar said. Well, when will he be here it already past seven and I would like to get into the desert before ten.” “He’ll be here soon” Syithumis said to reassure the dwarf, I may not know Yaoric very well but what I do know of him is that he is not a person who slacks off of the job, he’ll be here soon.” Just at that moment a man in dark black armor walked into the inn followed by a small brown haired boy. Yaoric walked past everyone as if they where not even there, he stopped in front of Syithumis and said. “The boy is ready to go.”<br>
