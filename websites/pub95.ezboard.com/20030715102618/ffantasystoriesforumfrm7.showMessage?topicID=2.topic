She hated cities, and hated Freeport even more, but she needed a few things and had to get them here. The list of items to buy could wait, she thought. Staring out over the water she let the wind rush over her and ruffle her coal-colored robe. The glittering water seems to match her eyes perfectly. It was times like these she could not help but feel at peace.

She was prone to seasickness and spent most of her time hiding in the shadows below deck thinking of dry ground.  But for some reason on this evening she was compelled to go to the main deck.  The night air was crisp and biting, but she felt secure and warm in her heavy black robes.  As she opened the door to the main deck she saw a small dark elf girl standing at the side, gazing idely at the ever fading shoreline.  Paradise giggled quietly to herself, forgeting for a time the gut wrenching swaying of the ship, and aproached the girl from behind.  Paradise was a quiet person, and shy, and normally did not approach strangers.  She also rarely took ships and when she did, rarely went onto the main deck, but something about the night drew her to the girl, as if the night was a part of the girl, the girl gave it shape and texture.  When Paradise saw the symbol of hate upon the girl's clothing, she knew it was someone she had to meet.  <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 7:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest rp start?</span><hr size=1>   Matteus loved the feel of the cool water splashing across his face.  He was intoxicated by the motion of the waves, constantly rising and falling.  The air was so fresh and clean out on the ocean!  So unlike the fetid air of the city.  Well, thats what you get when thousands of people who bathe twice a year all live in the same area, he thought.  Water splashed onto the boat, plastering his shirt to his hardened muscles.  Many of the passengers had gone bellow deck to avoid the chill.  Matt loved the solitude.  At times he would sit alone staring into the waters for hours, contemplating life.  He was strange, even as a child.  He never wanted to play warrior, nor wizard.  He didn't know what he wanted.  When people saw his black eyes, they backed, thinking him a demon.  He was tall for a human, standing 6'2 with black hair and very tan skin.  As he stood out, facing the city of Freeport, he dreaded having to leave the sanctity of the waves, but he knew he must.   <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 10:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest rp start?</span><hr size=1> Time was passing and though she did not want to leave, Bellona knew she had to. (After all, she was quiet hated in Freeport and the gaurds would be making their rounds soon). Pulling herself from the water, she turns slowly, her mind still wanting to stay with the hypnotic rolling of the waves. The corner of her eyes catch sight of a shoe near her on the ground, turning quickly she has her mace drawn just as she sets eyes on the woman behind her. Taking a step back, she scans the woman from head to toe, she was not here to fight, or she did not look that way at least. Putting her mace with the rest of her things, Bellona nods a hello to the woman before her. She had to admit this stranger was gorgeous - for a human. It is hard to believe such a fowl and weak race could produce someone like her, she thought. Bellona's eyes are drawn the the woman's. Something about her eyes was fimiliar... she had seen them before... Bellona remains where she stands as the waves clear her mind of any and all thought. <p><Br> <Br> <Br>I'm just a sample of a soul made to look just like a human being</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest rp start?</span><hr size=1> &quot;HEY!! GET BACK HERE!!&quot; The voice boomed throughout the streets. Gods damn it.<br>
<br>
I rounded the corner to Velith's, and, sure as day comes, was Sir Dubin. Stupid paladin was wandering a bit out of his territory, I'd say. &quot;Yo, Dubin, back up out tha slums, kid, before you get hurt!&quot; A sword arced through the air, nearly taking my head off. Another one! What was with this crew?<br>
<br>
The short sword glinted the lamp light off it's jeweled hilt as it crashed into the brick and mortar of the building. Barely missed! Hmmm... Time to run again! I began chanting, as I always had my innate ability to gather shadows around me. Only problem is that these *were* pallys...<br>
<br>
The sword came in low. I parried, barely, with a spear I'd been given as a gift, long ago. Before I could start reminiscing about Her face, I realized that my casting had no effect on these guards. Sir Dubin came in fast to flank his comrade.<br>
<br>
Blocking the steel spear with my sheild, and parrying another sword slash, I burst past the guards, running towards the docks. I knew the Militia wouldn't help me, surely, but why were the paladins still after me? I turned and shouted, &quot;Oh, come ON! It's been three years since I bathed in that priest's blood, and he asked for it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SILENCE, MURDERER! Your foul tongue shall be pro- GUH!&quot; I picked up a big rock and lobbed it behind me. From the sounds, it got Sir Dubin's little friend square in the mouth. I heard someone shouting that the boat was departing... Great.<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP THE BOOOOAT!&quot; I ran to the docks. Bellona was standing there! My, how she'd grown... Someone was standing next to her. Before I could really gander at the beauty, a pally dove and caught my foot. I stumbled, wishing I'd kept the flayed skin this one time... Plate mail never came off easily.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest rp start?</span><hr size=1> Bellona catches sight of Mindles not too far off. Sighing, she chants quietly to herself. Damn Paladins. Turning back to the woman, she does not watch the paladin's swift entrance into the realm of the dead, his screams were enough asurance for her. She would have loved to walk over and speak with Mindles, or at the very least kill a few light walkers with him, but this woman was of high inportance at the time. Her image was lost somewhere in Bellona's memory in a time beyond her reach, but it was there none-the-less. Perhaps after a conversation she may know, or perhaps she may never find out. Either way, she wanted to speak with this stranger for she could feel the power that radiated from her aura. <p><Br> <Br> <Br>I'm just a sample of a soul made to look just like a human being</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest rp start?</span><hr size=1> No doubt, she was busy.

I lured the fool to the darker side of the port. The Militia wouldn't mind one more Sir What-the-hell-ever gettin taken out. The short sword bit into the wood, and was lodged between planks. While the lightwalker struggled, I released the Fangs, and quietly ripped out his jugular vein. A bit of blackened mana, and the decay was halted. A little sprinkling here and there, along with a Glimpse effect, and it was like I was right there beside my little girl.

The water felt wonderful as he glided into the depths.  He emerged from the waters minutes later saying a quick hello to the few fisherman, now infuriated at him for scaring away the fish.  He ascended the stairs to the dock.  Before him was the beautiful indigo woman whom he had stared with longing at for the entire boat ride.  Her large almond-shaped eyes and cerulean skin reminded him of the waves, but as he saw what she had done, he was revolted.  Bile rose in his throat.  A pile of dead palidans lay at her feet, a smile on her lips.  He shook with fear as he readied his harpoon.  He couldn't let her live?  could he?  No!, he couldn't, but he couldn't just kill her.

The girl before her however, she found quite interesting.  Paradise, after being noticed by the dark elf, parted her perfect lips as if to speak, but even then the @#%$ sung its song, and the sun began to rise, it's light shimmering off the still waters of the ocean.  Like smoke in the wind, Paradise vanished from the scene, running invisible through the streets, searching for darkness far below the ground.  The hall of the Necromancers is where Paradise would travel to, deep below the streets of Freeport, accesible only by hidden entrances, the necromancers made their home, and at this moment, were building their army.  A storm was on the horizon and the necromancers were gathering en masse.  After meeting with the council at freeport, Paradise would travel to Neriak, and then on to Qeynos, to rally the troops.<br>

No words were spoke; I'd have heard that. Where was she going, though?<br>
<br>
Necromancy wasn't my specialty, but it was, by far, the most useful of all arcane sciences. The dead bodies of rats and lesser men that decayed on the streets opened their rotting eyes for me to see from. Where now... Yes, *there*!! Wait a minute... She was heading to the guild- MY guild! Was she a necromancer? Or possibley just an evil mage? She sure didn't look half undead, like most Liches tend to, but more alive and beautiful. Follow, we shall, my Curse...<br>
<br>
The shadows gathered once again, but they ceased just before the spell was complete. What was the point? Walking in the light was the same anywhere, whether invisible or not. Besides, the Militia kind of favored me for taking out the paladin freaks. I dug a meat hook into the eye socket of Sir Dubin, the paladin that had chased me- FOR NO GOD DAMNED REASON- from the bank. Muttering about cash withdrawals and multiple item deductions, I trailed the dead man behind me, the blood loss mostly stopped by my meat preservation skills.<br>
<br>
Before I rounded the corner to go back home (or what qualifies for home around here), I noticed a funny looking man, dripping wet, with harpoon crouched behind a barrel. &quot;Uhh.... Hey, you there!&quot; I called. &quot;Are you oggling over that Tier'Dal beauty? If so, stop the stalking and get to the courting so she can put your head on a pike like the other fools.&quot; I smiled at his horror, or what could be interpreted as such, and bounded away with my kill dripping slightly behind me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/upenarindevalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Penarin Devalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 12:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My addition</span><hr size=1> Bibilwood smiled at the two women, the darkness that followed them, for he loved the evil tricks that mortals tend to play. He had just gotten off the boat as they ran off; noticing the rising sun. He thought to himself that it couldn't be morning already. He noticed the man standing on the docks, but hiding behind the barrel. He watched him as he readied himself to strike against the dark lady. Smiling he watched as the man decided to cower in the corner and he glanced towards the barrels. The man obviously thought he was well hid over there. Bibilwood wrote on a piece of paper and tied it to a dagger he was carrying. He threw it in the direction of the barrels and heard the man fall over when he saw the object comming towards him. It stuck to the wall behind the man and Bibilwood watched as he read the note to himself. <br>
   &quot;You are being followed and I would advise not being there. The dark lady has most indeed seen you and your attempt to attack her. Do not underestimate those who practice the art of necromancy. They have a talent to see all that is around and they rarely miss.&quot;<br>
Bibilwood watched from hiding as the man looked up and searched for him. Smiling to himself he began to sing a song and went through the contents of the backpack he had just &quot;won&quot; for himself. His dark robes clad tight around him, hiding the armor below, he went inside the biulding and started down the stairs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaver of Flames</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 3:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My addition</span><hr size=1>   While staring in longing at the most beautiful woman he ever seen, a wicked dagger flew through the air before him nearly clipping his nose.

He scanned the area, looking for his benefactor who had warned him, but he was no where to be seen.  A lump formed in his throat as he stared at the twisted smile of the dark elven woman.  What should he do?  If he ran, they would see him, but then again, they already had.  Well, they can see me if I'm outside the barrel, but how bout when I'm INSIDE the barrel.  He chuckled to himself as he secretively crawled into a small barrel, with an eye hole of course. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udahnyella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnyella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 7:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My addition</span><hr size=1> Mykenzie sat uncomfortably on her bar stool, awaiting her glass of wine. The place was crowded, yes, but it was also filled with peasants. <br>
<br>
As her drink was set before her, she forced a smile at the bartender, but he ignored her and went on. Mykenzie watched him tend his customers, he didn't treat them with the respect like the bartenders in Felwithe allowed. Not at all.<br>
<br>
Finishing her drink she laid a few gold on the bar, and took her leave. As she headed for the door, she threw on her sky blue cloak and dawned her hood, covering her deep red hair.<br>

It was time to start her task at hand, she clutched her spell book close to her tall slender form as she headed for the West Gate. Before her the sun was setting, it was only a matter of time. <p><HTML>

She could not remember the last time she had raised her voice, but opal had gone too far this time.  Paradise stood for a few moments in the quiet darkness of the corridor and considered going back into the hall and killing opal before the paladins had the chance to.  Her daydream was inturupted by the sounds of a man coming down the stairs and into the corridor, the blood of paladins stained fresh on his tunic. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 12:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> la~</span><hr size=1> Bellona blinks as the woman disappears. Oh well. Turning back to the water her eyes are burned by the slow rising sun. Morning already? There was no need to turn around, the guard's steps were heavy and their plate armor noisy. ~I do not have time for this~ Rather than fighting, which would have been fun, Bellona sighs as translusent bubbles float around her. Stepping into the Foreign Quater she smiles, the gate spell and its many uses. Bellona never could tell if the guards in Neriak hated her, or liked her, she never cared either. All she knew was that it was good to be in a place where people got out of her way when she passed through. <br>
<br>
   As always it was empty in her home town. It was so nice to be out of the sun. Mystic arcane symbols were the only light in any part of Neriak. A guard steps directly in Bellona's path. Apparently he did not see her... She would fix that. <br>
<br>
&quot;What exacatally do you think you are doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyes turn to her, and he jumps out of the way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me, Madam, forgive me. I did not see you. Had I, I would have avoided you completely.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Avoided? So my pressance is not pleasent? You are too *good* to be in the same path as I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No no no no, its not that. Really, its not. I just... Well I wouldn't want to anger you in anyway b..b... bec.ccause&quot;<br>

&quot;Hold your tongue. I have a list here. See that everything is bought and send it to the Temple. Can you do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Y..y...yes yes of course!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then go&quot; <br>
<br>
Bellona raises her hand up as high as she can and lets the paper slowly sink to the ground. She giggles as she watches the guard scramble around trying to catch it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ignorant fool...&quot; Her pace was slower than normal today. Telus was probably home and he was someone she did not want to see now, or ever. Her Mother always lectured her on &quot;family&quot; and how &quot;important&quot; it is to be &quot;together&quot;. She was always on his side, always defending him. Maybe she should have gone with her Father, at least then she would not have to see Telus's horrid face. Bellona walks towards Neriak Commons. She would go to the Temple today, Ithvol probably wanted to speak with her anyways.

Except something nipped her senses, and she stopped. Looking above her, a dagger flew down at her feet, causing her to jump back a little bit. Tied to it was a scroll...

Maybe they shall have it when they see the force that opposes them.' A soft chuckle parted from his lips as he stepped into a beam of light that trickled from the world above after everyone had gone. His short body was still difficult to see when he stood in the light. His head was covered by a hood that hung low over his eyes and his mouth wore a sinister sneer. Bibilwood started down the hall when he sensed someone comming. He spoke softly to himself, &quot;They mustn't see me. Not yet, for the hour is not upon us.&quot; Bibilwood lifted his sleeve and passed his hand accross the gem embued bracer that he wore and he slowly changed. His form grew taller and took the form of a human. He passed by the person and walked into the upper portion of Freeport. He always enjoyed watching the beggars, for they amused him greatly. He turned after watching one for a bit and saw the man from the docks. Still clad in his human form he walked up behind him and whispered into his ear, &quot;You are known to them, they just do not know why they seek you yet. You are the key to the opposition and you shall find her in Neriak. Remember the docks lad, the slayer of the lightwalkers. You must seek your beginnings and there shall you find your strength.&quot; After that Bibilwood dissappeared beyond the eyes of mortal eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umindles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kay Oss kNite</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 8:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boiling Heads = FUN!!!</span><hr size=1> Yes, she went down the &quot;cordial&quot; entrance through the building. Ah, so formal. I remember the days when I used to have to take that path... Before, that is, I brought in the first Sir Fukknut's head in on a pike. This time, though, the brains were boiling in the skull. Most people say the pungent aroma is revolting, at best. I find it quite delicious!<br>
<br>
Either way, I set down my... &quot;bowl of stew&quot; outside the doorway. I made my way around two turns, and started my decent to the underground. I heard shouting down below; a woman was quarrelling with Opal Darkbriar. Mmmmmm, not smart in my experiences, but that *was* when I was just a lad, skewering orcs... Maybe I should pay her a visit for her &quot;lessons&quot;, as well?<br>
<br>
&quot;.... now you call for peace. This war will be bloody and the necromancers will show no mercy. You can stay here and get slaughtered in this tomb; I'm going to neriak and than to qeynos.&quot; Well well well; a human that dared to walk the streets of Neriak by herself? Maybe I should try a more polite approach, rather than threatening- after all, not many have the measure of respect from the Tier'Dal as I. Besides, I haven't seen a woman that beautiful in years, much less a human one...<br>
<br>
My blackened plate mail greeves and boots clanked on the stone as I descended. I could hear her soft padding on the stone, and wondered if donning the rest of my armor, or my elegant mace and sheild, for that matter, would have given me a more dangerous look. But, again, that didn't matter. The oddly magical leathers were good enough for easy Freeport battles.<br>
<br>
She rounded the corner and ascended, nearly colliding with me. I leaned up against the wall with my right shoulder, and braced my spear butt against the stone walkway. &quot;So...&quot; I began. My wooden pipe was brought to my lips, and a fragrant puff escaped as I grumbled, &quot;You seem to have business with my- with Bell.&quot; I snaked smoke out from my lips in the shape of a dragon with spreading wings. &quot;And I hear something about war, Neriak, and Qeynos. Have I been gone that long? Trouble again brews in my absence?&quot; I mused.<br>
<br>
In a more serious tone, like a general awaiting orders, I pleaded, &quot;What do you know?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uparadisetheheretic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paradise the Heretic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Decay</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 11:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.globalrray.net/user/paradisetheheretic/paradise.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> the true paradises. . .</span><hr size=1> Paradise turned her dark eyes upon the vagrant that dared to stop her.  Although she hid it well, Paradise was surprised to see him.  Rather, not to see him, but she was surprised that she could not read him.  There were few creatures that walked the face of Norrath that Paradise could not read like an open book, yet the human standing before her managed to keep his secrets.  <br>
   &quot;my buisness with bellona is exactly that, MY buisness.  As for the rest why don't you go ask that ignoramous Opal.  but mind you don't stay too long, she's likely to get us all killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paradise raised one hand and placed it on the spear shaft that blocked her way.  Almost instantaneiously the wood of the shaft rotted and turned to dust.   The man stared at his now shortened spear in bewilderment and Paradise could not stifle a small giggle as she continued her ascent and her journey to Neriak. <p><b>Sinfuly Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu<br>"Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que'on a perdu."<b></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=181&stop=184>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=20><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> -
