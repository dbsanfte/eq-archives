With a warrior’s arrogance, and a cane in his left hand, Marcus, head held high hobbled down the cobbles of Main Street towards his newly bought office building. Stepping up on the wood walk, he pulled a table closer. Slapping the deed to the building against his hand, Marcus opened an envelope and emptied the contents out on the table. A few papers fell loose and a key clattered to the table. The gloved hand thrust the shiny wooden cane with a brass eagle grip, under its master’s arm and picked up the key. As Marcus walked to the door four others with a similar look of soldiery about them stepped up and stood by twos on either side of him. The large glass doors swung open and the five of them walked into the new office.<br>
<br>
Glancing around at the empty space the four men gave a grunt of approval. The glass doors swung back closed reading:<br>
“D’ Vega and Partners Services”<br>
Marcus was indeed satisfied about the new accommodations. Looking around the room was bare except for a reception desk at the front. <br>
<br>
“Gentlemen, let’s get to work. I need a working office by this evening.” Marcus eyed his men, “I don’t care if it’s raining outside go.”  <br>
<br>
The door opened and closed after the four left into the rain. Marcus now stood, leaning on his cane in his new office. Looking out the window, the storm had started to pick up. The hail was pelting down rather heavy now. Looking back in his office, Marcus started his awkward hobble to his private office in the back. Claiming this as his new base of operation was a wonderful plan. The people here were humans, no disturbances of outside creatures. The damned would hold little to no sway to the choices in the life of Pillo Point. A devilish smile came over his face as he rubbed his leg, Marcus had heard of rumors of dragons in this part of the world. Dragons had been his favorite sport; their wings had kept them from his range until he developed a new method of hunting. Before his men could only lure it down and when it came close enough shot at it with arrows. But since his travels he had discovered a new way to take down a beast. The miners had developed a new powder substance from grain and plants. With this powder they could blast the rock from their mines. Taking this into mind, Marcus had drawn a few sketches for a newer type of bow, one that was powered by the powder. The arrow was changed to a full metal shaft and wide enough to fit snuggly in a long, thin, steel barrel with spirals on the inside to guide the bolt. With the powder packed snuggly against the bottom of the arrow, when lit with a spark the arrow would be launched into the sky with great accuracy and power. He called this his rifle, after the process the spirals in the barrels were created. <br>
<br>
Opening the shades to his window, Marcus looked up to the sky, the mountains east of the point jutted into the sky. That would be a great home for Dragons; he would hunt as soon as his business took off.<br>
<br>
Rain fell down on her upturned face as her soft giggle could be heard echoing back into the cave. Tir Bella stood arms outstretched on the landing of her home, her thin tunic being soaked in rain. The great cave entrance stood behind her like a gapping mouth waiting so swallow her whole. <br>
<br>
*Green eyes come back inside before you catch yourself a cold silly girl. * Tir twirled towards the deep sounding voice in her head.<br>
<br>
Facing back to the cave she put her hands to her mouth so her voice would be clearer. “Vermifax, I will stand out in the rain for as long as I wish, it is just a simple summer rain.”<br>
<br>
Twirling on the landing, her bare feet spun on the rock. Though the stone was slippery, Tir’s feet had long since learned to balance on slick rock. Stopping and turning her face once more to the sky, Tir closed her eyes and opened her mouth. Finally having enough, Tir turned back and swallowed the rain that had gathered in her mouth. Smiling as she headed back into the cave the sounds of claws on stone could be heard coming closer. She squeezed the rain from her long hair and wiped her face.<br>
<br>
“Vermifax, stop pestering me and go help Trigg to learn the human tongue.” Tir scolded the oncoming sounds. <br>
<br>
*It is not Vermifax daughter. I called for a council for the Wings in the territory; you must come and help understanding. * The loud clear voice rang in her ears, while not being spoken. <br>
<br>
Understanding came over her brow as it furled. “More humans? Mother why do you bother with them, they are nothing but spoiled creatures concerned with their own two feet staying on the firm ground.”<br>
<br>
*Daughter, the humans are our allies, and do not forget you are still human. You do not have our wings; you do not have our fire. Daughter, you are as much dragon in your heart as I, as any dragon, but you are still human on the outside. * <br>
<br>
Sighing heavily, “Fine mother, I will grace them with my presence, but once they start to bicker I will leave. I hate their arguments.” Tir looked down as the sound of claws scrapped against the stone slowly fading. Giving a huff of disapproval for her mother’s sympathy, Tir stormed off towards the antechamber. <br>
<br>
The council had been born the day Tir had been given to Groagin. Tir was an ambassador to the Dragon race for the human kind. Though her rising had been taken over partly by Groagin, she was more Dragon than human. Her body was frail like a human’s, no scales, and lack of wings and her absence of fire; Tir hated her human heritage, but withstood the bond between the Wings and the humans for the sake of her new family.<br>
<br>
“Listen boy, you must hammer the steel like this, if the metal is folded in such a way the sword will be far sharper. Feel this - feel this steel? This is softer than the blade steel, the back of the blade must be made softer, the blade will then have room to take greater impact without the steel being so frigid. There tap the wedge, there and see how it folds over, now hammer it flat and continue.” The sounds of the Blacksmith’s instructions were in that harsh, rough, voice, but Trent had grown used to it and even found it helped him focus on his work. Sweat ran down his face, as he hammered the steel like he was told. <br>
<br>
After his work was done, he dipped the new blade into the cooling bin and let the steam rush up to his face washing it slightly of the grim that had collected there. “Done Master Hitch. Will you call the handle men today?” <br>
<br>
The master blacksmith turned the blade over and over again. “No, first the polishers take the blade, then the handle makers. But I am sure that the sword will be finished by tonight.” Then you can take it and test the durability. Since this is your first blade, you keep it; I will take it out of your pay. The fineness of this blade and your work only tells me that it will not be long before you pay off the debt.” The master smiled at the proud smile that took Trent’s face. <br>
<br>
“Now, go home, you’re father will be waiting for his lunch.” <br>
<br>
Trent dipped his head into the wash bucket and dried his hands and face on the towel that hung from the side of the barrel. “I will be back after lunch Master Hitch.”<br>
<br>
As Tir strode back and forth listening to the chat of the different Wing Masters, and Dragon lords she felt alone. Sitting down in a corner, Tir started to focus on the speech of the mind. This was the way of the Wings. They did not have the vocal cords of a human, but had a way to speak to each other through the mind. Tir had practiced every day for her seven years with the dragons. Her listening skills were excellent, but she had trouble speaking to her wingmates. <br>
<br>
*Trigg, are you and Vermifax busy? I was wondering if you weren’t so busy if you could take me flying. * Tir tried to send it through the thread she shared with her younger siblings of the wing.<br>
<br>
*Green eyes, of course we could take you flying. When does your meeting start? We need to know when to have you back or mother will have a fit. * Came her reply, sighing, Tir did not know when the humans would make it, they had started the travel this morning but the meeting grounds were high in the mountains for protection against hunters.<br>
<br>
*Please, Trigg I want to fly. The two legs can wait, if we do get into trouble with mother, I will take care of it. * Tir smiled at the mental image of her falling from one of her wingmates to another and feeling free like she could actually fly.<br>
<br>
*Your mind’s tongue has gotten better over the years, I’m proud of you Green eyes. Meet me and Vermifax out on the east landing. We’ll take you flying like you have not been in some many moons. * Smiling, Tir jumped to her feet and snuck to the tunnel leading into their home and started to run with a happy stride towards the east landing.<br>
