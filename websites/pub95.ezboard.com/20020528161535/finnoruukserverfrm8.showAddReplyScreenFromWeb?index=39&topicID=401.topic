Honestly I fail to see the point of trading accounts in genreal, but that's for another rant I would wager.   Problem is, no matter who this guy is on as he is gonna be able to scam people as long as they set themselves up to be scammed.   Want the best policy to not be scammed?   Don't put yourself in the position unless you know you can hunt them down in person and persuade them to give you your gear back.  Simple rule for eq, trust no one when it comes to trades.<br>

Folks wouldn't have these problems if they stuck to their own account and played the game themselves, in fact, trading accounts is a violation of the game's terms of use so that's two reasons right there not to do it. Third of course being that EQ is pretty fun to play, getting a high level character is kinda like buying a very old used care, little mileage left. If your finding EQ too hard then go back to something more your speed, like Chutes and Ladders or Candyland.<br>

Havern is a great guy and I go to school with him.<br>
<br>
The randoming you saw at the spires was, yes, for the hammer.  Nobody at the raid complained and I didn't either because nobody seemed to care about it.  Everyone cared about the CoF and the bag, as did I.  If you wanted the hammer you should have said something to Dollaine.<br>
<br>
The origional Bjornn traded accounts with Dollaine, Dollaine was a great guy in my opinion.  Ok so now we have Dollaine as Bjornn now.  Bjornn was very interested in Elder Tribunal because he is Dollaine, he knew everyone but they did not know him.  That is the reason Bonestriker, and Sinwell why he went on a few raids with you.<br>
<br>
So next they hold this naggy raid.  I was there and the new dollaine did a terrible job at hosting it, it was very slow going and he had no real authority.  So when the  new dollaine gave the new bjornn the hammer nobody seemed to care about it because its a piece of crap.  If you cared so much then why didn't you speak up at the raid?  When the new dollaine appointed the Cloak to the new bjornn(This is the Original Dollaine From Elder Tribunal) he handed it over to the rightful owner.<br>
<br>
So then they switch accounts back.  So now Dollaine and Bjornn are theirselves(cept the part if Bjornn traded accounts again, and why anyways would someone want a naked shaman, ive seen him).  They both get harassed and their reputation is screwed.  Dollaine told me if you need to give him tells he is the original, the person who leveled the monk, the person who played the monk, the person who made his friends(Elder Tribunal).<br>
<br>
So why then is the original dollaine part of this? he wasnt, the origional bjornn sucked him into it because he tried to bribe him with the hammer.  So Dollaine shouldnt have his reputation gone, now nobody will accept him in anything.<br>
<br>
If you are reading this you probably think im Drollaine, or Dollaine, or Collaine, or Bjornn, or whatever alts they have, but believe what you want, what I tell you is truth.  Bjornn, vooloo, ninja are all on 1 account.  Dollaine Collaine are on another, I am not sure about Drollaine though.  I really hope some Elder Tribunal Folks read this, Dollaine will never get his rep back.<br>
<br>
So the meaning of this is to tell you not to trade accounts, and most of you think Bjornn and Dollaine are stupid which is ok.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only thing I ask people from Elder Tribunal, that knew Dollaine when he FIRST became an initiate, to reply and say what Dollaine has done good or bad to them, and be sure to have your name.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time to read this, and I hope it will make you think differently. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=innoplaya>innoplaya</A> at: 2/12/02 6:55:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubonestriker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bonestriker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/13/02 2:11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=64>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://jayhawks.net/~watts/Images/Bonestriker_portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bjornn incident</span><hr size=1> I've been active on USENET and other parts of the Internet since 1992.  I'm not a net.grandpa but I've been communicating in text format for longer than most.  One thing that I find I'm very good at is telling the difference between folks based on how they write.<br>
<br>
Now, obviously grammar and spelling can make it easy to tell someone who's ignorant from someone who's educated, but I'm talking about subtle differences, like choice of words and sentence structure.  I can usually tell when someone is playing someone else's character.<br>
<br>
For example, I can tell when Lunawolf is being played by her real-life husband Wulfheart.  I can usually pick the she-males from the real women as well.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However, Dollaine and Bjornn had drastically different styles of communication.  I could clearly tell Bjornn from Dollaine.  Now it's possible Bjornn was playing Dollaine for a very short time and I just didn't notice because he was doing constant price checks and selling in /gu just like Dollaine constantly did.  But I can guarantee that he did not play Dollaine for very long periods of time because I watched Dollaine like a hawk when he was an initiate and I would have noticed.<br>
<br>
However, this conversation is rather pointless.  It's very clear to me, innoplaya, that you are in fact Dollaine.  You sound very much like Dollaine and the only person that would post this in the way you did is Dollaine.  You are also the only person that would be privy to this information.  Havern would know, but I would think he would have offered this information to me two weeks ago when I talked to him about the incident.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we're all wrong.  Perhaps most of the bad things you did should actually be attributed to Bjornn.  However I feel very strongly in guilty by association.  I do not associate with people that are morally corrupt.  You chose to associate yourself with Bjornn, and you knew about his wrongdoings and didn't report it to us.  In fact, you encouraged that we include him in the guild.  Claim ignorance if you will, but in the Real World(tm) people are judged by the company that they keep.<br>
<br>
Also, I had already started the process to have you removed as a member.  Why?  You were always clearly out for yourself.  That's not what the Elder Tribunal is about.  I could cite numerous examples, but I feel I've already divulged enough information about your initiation to the public (we generally keep all of this confidential).  Also the fact that you let someone other than yourself play you without our knowledge (members are not allowed to share accounts with non-members) is a complete violation of our trust and would have been grounds for removal.<br>
<br>
Finally, on a personal note - I find you to be a very well-spoken and &quot;nice&quot; young man.  You are generally nice to talk to and you are very friendly.  However it was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>very</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> clear to me that you had very loose morals and you were only really interested in what benefitted you.  It's actually not that uncommon among teenagers to be completely insensitive of other people's needs and be focused only on their own - it's a juvenile survival instinct.<br>
<br>
However the Elder Tribunal is a guild comprised of mature people and your behaviour is destructive and unwanted.  I'm sure you are having a very hard time with your terrible reputation, but you have to understand that you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> earned</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it, and now it's time to lay in the bed you made.  Stop blaming others.  Apologize for your behaviour and own up to your mistakes like a man.  Make reparations for your mistakes and for Bjornn's, and you'll find that folks will start to accept you once again.<br>
<br>
As far as coming back to Elder Tribunal, you never will.  You blew your second chance.  Perhaps you're not guilty of everything that folks have attributed to you, but your name comes up so much you're <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>clearly</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> guilty of something.  Add that to the fact that you weren't a good member when you were here means you will never see that guildtag over your head again, at least not while I'm on duty.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this is blunt and rather brutal but I'm hoping that perhaps this will help you change your ways.  If you continue in this behaviour you'll find that Everquest isn't the only place you'll have problems.  Folks in the real world don't have as short of memories as we do.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your travels. <p><b>Bonestriker</b><br>
