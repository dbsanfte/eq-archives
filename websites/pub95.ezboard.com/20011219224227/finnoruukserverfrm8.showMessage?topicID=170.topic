<br>
Hello, I've reached that point in my life.  And I went into the game feeling this way.  Had a horrible time where nothing went right.  Talked to a couple of players that I've been good friends with online over the years through my guild and tried to cheer up, but it only made it worse.  So before I could delete my epic, petition my in game surname to be removed, give everything back to Mirswith that he'd given me, and delevel my chanter some 40 odd levels... various stupid things to hurt my character more just so that I could express the anger and discontentment I feel, I came here to rant.<br>
<br>
I've always been the wicked evil type to hurt myself before I could hurt the ones I love, and today I almost crossed the line and tried to hurt others I care about... simply because I'm tired of letting down and being let down by the people who I care about and supposedly care about me.<br>
<br>
Somebody please for the love of God, teach me how to be insensitive.<br>
<br>
RL wise, I'm going through a very rocky separation with a man who I centered my life around for almost 9 years.  He's trying to keep things together, but I don't know if they'll last simply because I'm already feeling so jaded and burnt out.  I start school in 5 days.  My life is starting to change and for the better (or so they say) yet I feel horrible and crummy and alien to it all.  Desiderata preaches: Many fears are born out of fatigue and loneliness.  I have to face it, I'm tired, and I'm lonely.<br>
<br>
Whatever Jeis, you're with somebody.  Yes, but just cause you're in a relationship with somebody doesn't mean that you're not alone.  And he left me alone years and years ago.<br>
<br>
EQ wise, things are going ok.  I got my epic, I go on a lot of raids with The Final Covenant and I have fun with them... but I don't do much else.  I don't see Mirswith often and whether he wishes to believe it or not, I miss his company.  Some punk guys still like to try and harrass me as if they own me (I won't even mention names here).  I have my good friends in game that I've talked to for years long before EQ was around... so things should be fine and dandy and I should be happy, right?  But I'm not.  Before I could petition a GM to restore my old last name thinking that would resolve everything, I figured I'd rant some and see if it makes me feel better.<br>
<br>
Nexc, a good friend of mine online pre-EQ sent me a random tell earlier and sent me a hug.  The feeling overwhelmed me, as if he could tell that I really needed one.  Then he said, &quot;Jeis, people really love you and you have a lot of friends.&quot;  I don't see why I do, cause I just exist.  I'm just there, and I'm nothing spectacular.  But Nexc, you're really an incredible guy and our little pep talk came just in time before I started randomly deleting stuff.<br>
<br>
Alan, a friend of mine from one of the local clubs, called me tonight and said, &quot;Honey I know you're not going to the clubs tonight cause it's pouring rain out... but we'll miss you and I wanted you to know that.&quot;  Just another reminder of what I could be out doing but because of the weather I'm stuck here at home.  I went outside, in the pouring cold November rain, and let myself soak.  Thinking the chill hitting my spine might wake me up enough so that I could understand why I'm so angry, I was terribly dismayed when I walked inside and realized that I was just cold.<br>
<br>
I've also deleted AIM and ICQ from my computer.  I'm so close to giving up internet life period, but I'm not sure if that will make me feel better.  I almost paid for a character transfer to move my enchanter to another server, but I don't know if that will make me feel better.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just the holidays... I so hate the holidays.  Or maybe underneath the surface, I'm just angry and I don't know who I am anymore.  The whole separation thing, the near-petition where I was going to request my old name back... all have to do with an identity.<br>
<br>
I just don't feel that I fit in anymore.<br>
<br>
My personal new year's resolution:  To find what makes me happy and chase after it, even if it is just a falling star destined to burn out... and to not let my old habits of tradition and responsibility hold me back anymore. <p><img src="http://notoriouskillers.com/jeisenne.gif">

Desiderata is something that will provide you comfort I'm sure, it has done so for me on many occasions. I try to live my life with the philosophy that you have to do whatever makes you happy. Of course, finding out what makes you happy is the hard part... I just hope things work out for you hun.<br>

I'll find you as soon as I get back online, meanwhile keep an eye on your mail <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A smashing dose of perspective does wonders in these situations.<br>

Volunteer a bit in the children's playroom of your local hospital.  I guarantee it will help.<br>

I think you're onto something when you say your problems all center around your identity... and you're coming out of, or trying to salvage, a longterm relationship which is one of the things we use to define ourselves. However that situation resolves itself, it's a major change. School starting up represents a big change as well.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that change is so scary (or exciting, depends on the individual and, in my case at least, mood) when it's the primary impetus for self discovery. Maybe that's WHY it's scary and exciting.<br>
<br>
I say go with it. Embrace the changes (and yes, probably time to take a break from the game so you don't have a security blanket), and don't try to force yourself to &quot;enjoy&quot; them, or &quot;make the most&quot; of them, or any of that. Just sit back and observe yourself for a while as you go through this. And yes, absolutely do some volunteer work to get out of the house  and incidentally out of your own head for a while.<br>
<br>
Accept change, it's part of life. A wise man once said that the only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.<br>

<br>
Why people like you?  You are always enthusiastic and caring when dealing with people.  It is hard to explain, but you are fun to be around.<br>
<br>
I don't know if there is anything anyone can say that will really make you feel better, but I know that everyone wants you to be happy.  I think Gart's idea is great.  I went for a walk the other day and passed this little boy about 5 years old and he looked at me and held up a piece of a broken vase.  He declared &quot;I have a piece of a vase!&quot; and grinned.  I really grinned like an idiot for a long time as I was walking along.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I get down I try to listen to some happy music.  Used to write a lot of poetry.  I guess what used to work best was sitting by the ocean watching the waves roll in.  Solitude can put things in perspective.  I think being in love with someone and having it end bad is probably the hardest thing to get over though.  It is all perspective.  You have your health, you have friends who care, and that is good.<br>
<br>
I guess the only other comfort is know that unhappiness is like a season, it will pass and you'll get happy again.<br>

In a time like this, it shows that most of us care more about the person behind the pixles than the pixels themselves...I'm here for ya hon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Because we both play chanters, we don't get to group together.<br>
<br>
But I also see how people respond around you -- both here and in-game.<br>
<br>
People just like being around you.  It shows in how they respond.  That says a lot about you.<br>
<br>
It's easy to let what's going on with relationships rule our entire lives.  I do that.  It can lead to some real roller coaster aspects to our lives.  I think some (most? all?) people need a solid relationship to feel good about themselves, to feel anchored.<br>
<br>
If this describes how you're feeling, recognizing that can go a long ways towards getting through the down times.  It may not make you feel better, but just understanding why you feel how you feel can help weather it.<br>
<br>
Hang in there.<br>

Yeah, take a break from EQ. I left for a week and haven't made it back for about a month now.<br>
If that doesn't help I could teach you to be insensitive. It's not all it's cracked up to be to be completely honest. People find you strange and your sense of humor changes. However if you've been desensitized as long as I have you start looking for something to care about. The longer you don't care, the harder it is to. I've been lucky, and I've found something. She knows who she is.<br>
<br>
My advice:<br>
Just roll with it. It's all good. <p>Shintou, on Sleeper: Can't the guy take a fuckin Nap? Jeez. Leave him alone.

Now, I don't know if that's because it's an exhausting process, or if it's a letdown after all, or if maybe that was the only goal left to keep you interested. - Just an idle observation. <br>
<br>
Of course they're not exclusive reasons; it's perfectly feasible that it's a combination of the three.<br>

It's all RL stresses and the sudden realization that I'm not getting any younger and time is not going to be forgiving if I don't start taking advantage of it now.<br>
<br>
The identity crisis hits hard as well.<br>
<br>
One of my favorite writers wrote the following lines for a song:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I've been afraid of changing<br>
cause I built my life around you<br>

Children get older<br>
I'm getting older too<br>
            -- Stevie Nicks --</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I was in a Fleetwood Mac mood last night and I heard Landslide and it all sort of kicked in.  And some people say that music doesn't help.  For some individuals like me, music is the best form of therapy.<br>
<br>
I start school tomorrow.  I'm feeling empowered because I'm going to finish a dream that I put on hold 8 years ago because I had to work in order to make ends meet.  Essentially my new life starts tomorrow, and whether my marriage survives or crumbles with this new start has yet to be seen.<br>
<br>
But in times like these, when I feel that I'm going crazy and about to lose my mind, it brings me great comfort to read words of encouragement such as what I've seen through replies.  I never expected anybody to reply, never expected sympathy, or so much as a second glance.  But what I've seen brings a smile to my face, and I start to believe less and less that I'm as evil as I've tried to convince myself.<br>
<br>

You're a wonderful person, Jeisenne, our talks over the last few months have shown that to me loud and clear.  If losing the chance to talk directly helps you heal, then that's something I'm willing to do.  A break is always a good thing, being in new surroundings, meeting new people, all are ways to keep the mind occupied while you're able to deal with the new and conflicting emotions that are washing over you.<br>

I can totally relate to your feelings....suddenly seeing your mortality, realizing that the beauty, health, and other things that you took so much for granted in your youth will not always be there.  You start questioning your decisions, and realizing that some of them are too late to do anything about (in my case, career choices, education choices, etc).  Responsibilities start to take over your life, and the free-spirit that was once you begins to vanish..I often feel myself turning into my mother.  /cry<br>
<br>
I also find that song Landslide to be a source of inspiration, although my preference is for the Smashing Pumpkins version.  Cooincidentally, I was humming it to myself last night while picking up dinner at Wendy's.  (People probably thought I was nuts, and they are of course correct).<br>
<br>
<br>
Another song I find similarly interesting regarding this topic is Time Stand Still...by a band I am sure many of you hate (Rush) , but the lyrics are good.<br>
<br>
<br>
I turn my back to the wind<br>
To catch my breath,<br>
Before I start off again.<br>
Driven on without a moment to spend<br>
To pass an evening with a drink and a friend<br>
<br>
I let my skin get too thin<br>
I'd like to pause.<br>
No matter what I pretend<br>
Like some pilgrim --<br>
Who learns to transcend --<br>
Learns to live<br>
As if each step was the end<br>
<br>
Time stand still -- I'm not looking back<br>
But I want to look around me now<br>
See more of the people and the places that surround me now<br>
<br>
Freeze this moment a little bit longer<br>
Make each sensation a little bit stronger<br>
Experience slips away...<br>
<br>
I turn my face to the sun<br>
Close my eyes.<br>
Let my defences down --<br>
All those wounds that I can't get unwound<br>
<br>
I let my past go too fast<br>
No time to pause --<br>
If I could slow it all down<br>
Like some captain, whose ship runs aground --<br>
I can wait until the tide comes around<br>
<br>
Make each impression a little bit stronger<br>
Freeze this motion a little bit longer<br>
The innocence slips away...<br>
<br>
Summer's going fast, nights growing colder<br>
Children growing up -- old friends growing older<br>
Experience slips away...<br>
<br>
<br>
I think of it as sort of a reminder to make the absolute most of every single day, because before you know it...time slips by. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=170.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=210.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessage?topicID=221.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=170.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=170.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=170.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=170.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
