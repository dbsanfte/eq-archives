make one for chanter too but of course don't use cheal =p<br>

only problem I've found with this is /target command is real screwy. best to have cleric always facing combat and MT close to cleric so /target can see him. <br>

I know myself I use EDSF controls for moving around, E=forward, D=backward, S=left, F=right.  You should also change your hotkeys so you have all 10 slots within easy reach.  This way you can have your best computer as your main that you sit in front of.  Which for that combo I would suggest your chanter be on your main because they need to move around and do the most in groups.  Keep your cleric on your off computer, to whichever side your mainhand is.  Then learn to control your character with just one hand.<br>
<br>
Best advice is to just practice to where you can use both of your characters very fast, if you have a hard time with keyboards and have to look at keys and can't tell from feel then you probably won't have too good of a time.  Need fast hand eye coordination.  I myself usually play Warrior (main cause I pull and am the assist), Wizard (off comp), or Cleric-main / Wizard-off or.  Or other combos, but I always try to keep a lax character on my off computer that I don't need to worry about too much.  Wizard is perfect cause all you really need to do is snare and lay some timely nukes.  There is more to this class yes, but for the most part it can be done very easily with just one hand.<br>

Enchanter on primary comp, druid on #2, and the poor rogue on the laptop.<br>
<br>
I've tried enchanter/cleric, and it's HARD, and I've been dual-comping for nearly a year and a half.  The problem is that when you're busiest with the enchanter is also when you're busiest with the cleric.  It's really hard to split attention between mesing 4 mobs and making sure no one is dying while they're getting mes'd.<br>
<br>
Tricks are as mentioned above.<br>
<br>
1. Hotkeys!  My druid has 3 as /target sinsa.  6 is heal on druid and mes on chanter.  5 is DD on both.  Try to get the hotkeys of similar nature in the same spot on both accounts.<br>
<br>
2. Put the character that has to do the most clicking on the right (assuming you drive mouse with your right hand).  The healer can be on the left 'cause you can use F1-F6 to select the members of your group for healing.<br>
<br>
3. Avoid using the mouse on the left side -- in tight situations, you can easily find yourself using the wrong mouse.<br>
<br>
4. ALWAYS put the characters on the same comps.  If you swap around, you'll try to mes with the cleric and heal with the chanter.  That doesn't usually work.<br>
<br>
5. Make sure your group knows you are dual-comping.  Most people understand that means you can miss tells or might not be paying enough attention to healing.<br>
<br>
6. Decide which is your primary focus.  Make sure that the druid in the group knows that in tight situations, they need to be ready to heal, as the cleric is likely to respond slowly on heals while you're mesing something.<br>
<br>
7. Have sound on both machines.  You can use the sound to tell you if your spells fizzled or if you're getting hit and don't realize it.  Warning: chanters in illusion make different noises when getting hit, and you might not realize you're dying if you let the noise be your only clue.<br>
<br>
=== A word about primary focus ===<br>
<br>
This is a little story about a time hunting Eboots.  We had 2 good groups, but short on clerics.  So I was dual-comping chanter and cleric.  Skyal was there -- 6 levels higher than me, I think -- as his ench.  But I was so focused on playing chanter that I wasn't focused on the cleric enough, and the puller died a few times.<br>
<br>
Moral: let the other chanter be primary chanter, and focus on the role of cleric.<br>
<br>
=== Other comments ===<br>
<br>
I can dual-comp kite.  Wolfy and Sin &quot;solo'd&quot; most of the way to 50 by kiting.  It got tricky on multiple pulls, but I got good enough eventually to be able to quad-kite.<br>
<br>
People who catch me in Seb lately have seen me with 3 characters, working hard on 60.  Wolfy and Sinerip (druid and rogue) would normally stay out of the group, so we effectively had 8 people gaining xp for 6.  This can be WILD experience.  Most of the time, I'm heavily complemented on how well I do that.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's the back-patting.  I'm no slouch at dual-comping.<br>
<br>
I won't dual-comp primary chanter and primary healer in a &quot;real&quot; situation.  I can pull to Seb zone-in that way, but I wouldn't go to disco like that.<br>
<br>
It's strictly a matter of attention.  Playing chanter during a 4-pull requires a lot of attention.  That's the same time the cleric also has the heaviest workload.  Someone is going to die.<br>
<br>
If you have controlled pulls, or if you trust that the tank can take a heck of a beating, maybe you can pull it off.  But it's probably the hardest combination available.<br>

You have to left-hand one and right-hand the other, so being ambidexterous to a certain extent helps.  One of my characters always talks more though heh.<br>
<br>
I've played quite a bit with my Mage/Necro combo, as well as my Shammie/SK.  I have a bit more trouble playing the Nec/Tank, tanks do a lot more work then most people give them credit for, and between pet/root/ST/Dot, Necros can stay pretty busy as well.  Two Casters are much easier because most things can be hotkeyed, even with two pets.  I see a lot of Cleric/War combos, and generally speaking I find people tend to die more or at least come closer to it, again because you can't hotkey your movements, bash and taunt recycle faster then most spells, etc., so while the Tank is busy the Cleric is unavailable.  Personally I wouldn't want to dual with a Cleric or Enchanter as one of them, because frankly they stay pretty busy in raid type situations, if you're in a strong group in Seb it might be different.  As someone who duals, I hate it when I see someone dualling and their tank is always either the last one in the fight, or because their other pays so much attention to HIS needs that the rest of the group can suffer.<br>
<br>
It kind of gets back to Wolfy's point about telling the Druid he needs to be ready to heal.  If dualling is hurting the group, maybe you shouldn't be doing it..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukaganfindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaganfindel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#778899>(11/20/01 1:15:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dual wield computers</span><hr size=1> Another person to talk to might be Shaethius(60 priest)/Whiplassh(59 monk.)

Generally speaking, my rogue will lag getting on the mob and is more willing to skip backstabbing if the main tank is having problems keeping the mob's attention (meaning the mob isn't sitting still).<br>
<br>
Wolfy sometimes forgets to snare, and I always prefer someone else in the group have primary snare duty.<br>
<br>
I usually have my dual-compers out of group so I don't feel guilty about hogging xp while not completely contributing.  <br>
<br>
There ARE some points where dual-comping is extremely advantageous.  But I still feel the contribution from the alts is lower than if you had another person filling that spot instead.<br>

Some combinations just aren't that hard -- druid/chanter for instance.  Generally speaking, the druid isn't busy the same time the chanter is.  And Wolfy can usually heal Sinsa faster than the group cleric can, because she knows when I'm getting beat on badly enough to need it.<br>
<br>
The thing is, you need to be prepared to nearly entirely ignore the second computer when things get tense.  You can't do that for chanter/main healer.  I would consider THAT to be particularly dangerous.<br>

<br>
Personally I dual comp also, my combo is druid/war. This seem so do quite well.. as i am taunting and or the main puller. All i need to do for the druid is mem the assist to me.. and snare target.. group sow.. group regen. and DD when mana is good. This combo is really easy to do also. The only time i peel off my warrior screen is to heal casters that over nuke.. or for chanters that had trouble with Mez. So far so good !. Also i dont tell my group that i'm dual comping for the distinct fact that i once saw a dual comper withe the second char as a mage just sit on his a$$. =(  So i dont usually tell the group untill 15-20min to the group.<br>

Perhaps even easier with the /sticky.<br>
<br>
Played an enchanter and a rogue in EQ, and now a healer and a thane in DAoC.  Haven't noticed any added difficulty for PvE.<br>
