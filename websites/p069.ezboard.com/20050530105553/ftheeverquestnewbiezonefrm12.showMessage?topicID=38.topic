My name is Cuchulaine Kynthelig, preserver of 55 seasons. While I have spent a great majority of my time grouping, I have also soloed from time to time, and have striven to master all the various techniques. I have always felt that I should learn all I could about playing a druid, and that includes the soloing methods available. Though I no longer play, I started this guide when I did, and decided to go ahead and finish it, so that others may benefit from my experience (and my mistakes). I have grouped these techniques by which are the most efficient at the various levels. <br>
<br>
Here is the format:<br>
Levels when this method is most efficient<br>
Name of Method<br>
Starting Level (always because of a minimum required spell, which is listed)<br>
Ending Level (Max level that this method can realistically be done at)<br>
steps to use method<br>
notes<br>
<br>
Some methods are never the most efficient at any level, but definitely have their uses. For those, there is an additional line of which levels are best for using that method.<br>
<br>
So, here we go:<br>
<br>
Level 1-8:<br>
Nothing special about this, except perhaps the use of harmony at level 5. I have thought about writing a harmony guide, but I'm not sure if that will happen. Level 1-8 are pretty much the same for all classes.<br>
<br>
Level 9-18:<br>
Porcupining<br>
Starting Level: 9 (Shield of Thistles)<br>
Ending Level (realistically): 50 (after 35, choice of mobs dwindles considerably)<br>
1. find a blue /con mob<br>
2. cast snare until it sticks, and move away to give yourself some room<br>
3. tab to target self<br>
4. cast damage shield<br>
5. tab to target mob<br>
6. cast swarm DoT<br>
7. melee<br>
8. heal when needed- if getting interupted, move away and heal (mob should be snared) <br>
Porcupining is a very efficient method of fighting, even later on in your druid's life, and you will need to keep doing it at times in order to keep your defense skill maxed out. Obviously, it can really only be done on mobs that do not hit particularly hard for their level. Prior to about 30 or so, there are few mobs that hit too hard, but as you level up, the mobs that hit weakly enough to be able to do this begin to dwindle. <br>
<br>
Level 19-33:<br>
DD kiting<br>
Starting level: 19 (Careless Lightning - can be done from 14 on, in places where you can use anti-summoned spells, such as Lavastorm Mountains)<br>
Ending Level: 60 (though after 34, there is no reason to use this method over quad-kiting, see below)<br>
1. find a blue /con mob<br>
2. cast snare until it sticks <br>
3. run ahead and cast your DD spell, repeat until mob is dead. Some prefer to melee the last bit<br>
DD Kiting is the easiest method to master, and probably the safest soloing method of all.If you get too many resists and run out of mana, you can just zone. Do NOT train almost dead mobs on groups or other people, hoping they will finish it off for you (ESPECIALLY when quad-kiting). If you can't finish them yourself, then don't solo them. Soloing means you do the WHOLE job, from start to finish. Many people already have a poor view of druids, we don't need inconsiderate kiters adding to it. <br>
<br>
Level 34-60:<br>
Quad kiting<br>
Starting Level: 34 (Lightning Strike)<br>
Ending Level: 60<br>
1. find a blue /con mob. This should be done in an area where you can find 4 of them relatively close together<br>
2. cast ENsnare (snare will not do- it will wear off before you are finished)<br>
3. repeat 1 and 2 3 more times until you have 4 mobs snared<br>
4. move ahead and then watch the mobs approach. try to move in a direction such that the mobs will come closer to each other as they close on you. Repeat until all 4 mobs are so close they look like one mob. when the mobs get fairly close together, circling them a couple of times helps to bunch them up even tighter.<br>
5. run ahead a ways and cast your AE DD (Lightning Strike 34-48, Lightning Blast 49+), repeat until all mobs are dead.<br>
Ok, there are several notes about quad-kiting. First is location. I always look for deserted spots to quad-kite. If you see anyone but other quad-kiters, then you should think about moving somewhere else. There are 3 reasons. First, when people see you killing four mobs at a time when they can't solo at all, it only creates more animosity towards druids in general. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say. Second, it is unfair to take 4 spawns when other groups are trying for them. Finally, quad kiting is neither easy, nor particularly safe. You need to have complete control, and that is much easier to accomplish when you don't have to worry about other people. There are also other methods of rounding up your 4 mobs. I just gave the method I use. Some prefer to circle around them, others have yet other methods. It doesn't really matter, as long as they get tightly bunched. Your AE DDs have a very short radius. If you miscalculate, and get hit, not only does it put a major hurting on you (not a bad idea to keep regen up in case you do get hit), but it often throws off the grouping, so you may need to bunch them back up. Each time you cast, look for 4 hit messages. If any are missing, you need to re-bunch them. Quad-kiting is extremely mana intensive. If you are going to do it, you will need to get your wisdom as high as possible (up to 200), and may look into +mana gear after that. If you plan on quadding a lot, then you should specialize in evocation, as well. <br>
<br>
From the time you make level 34, quadding will be the most efficient method of soloing available, all the way to 60. However, there may be times when you have trouble finding a decent spot to quad, or just don't feel like dealing with the intensity. There are other methods of hunting which are really not ever the most efficient, but certainly have their place:<br>
<br>
Root-DoT<br>
Starting Level: 14 (Stinging Swarm)<br>
Ending Level: 60 (Root-DoT is actually the only method that gets BETTER as you get higher level)<br>
Best Levels: 49-60 (49 root is FAR more suited to this type of soloing than any before it, and the 56 root is even better)<br>
1. find a blue /con mob (even high blue, but must be 50 or below)<br>
2. ensnare or snare -ensnare if you have it, as snare will probably wear off before you are finished<br>
3. root -lvl 49 or 56 root is best for this, but can be done with any. you just have to refresh it more<br>
4. cast swarm DoT<br>
5. cast fire DoT - if mob has high fire resist, skip this part<br>
6. if 52 or above, post 50 fire and swarm DoTs stack with pre-50 DoTs, so keep stacking if you can. <br>
7. items which cast Drones of Doom are very useful with this method. Use them if you have them<br>
8. refresh your spells as necessary until mob is dead. med in-between castings. <br>
I can be at 3 bubs of mana after root-DoTting even high blues, so I can go at it again in short order. Root DoT, especially at 53 and above is the second most efficient method of soloing. I can get about 1/2 as much XP with this method as quad-kiting, even though quadding does four at a time, because of being able to med during the battle, and also because of being able to kill high blues. In addition, this is often the only way to solo mobs with exceptionally high hitpoints. Now that root and snare stack, there is no longer a need for med-kiting, except in rare cases where root just doesn't hold (the dino in OOT, for example). <br>
<br>
Fear Kiting (and charm kiting)<br>
Starting Level: 1 (Panic Animal)<br>
Ending Level: 60 (but finding XP-giving mobs you can use it on after about 53 will be difficult)<br>
Best Levels: None, actually. Fear-kiting for druids is situational, at best. It is neither faster nor more efficient than even DD kiting, and it severely limits the mobs you can hunt. It does have it's uses, however. See below.<br>
1. find a blue /con ANIMAL<br>
2. snare or ensnare (ensnare if you have it- snare will wear off before you are finished<br>
3. cast fear spell (panic animal, terrorize animal, etc.)<br>
4. cast swarm DoT<br>
5. cast fire DoT- skip this step for high Fire resistant mobs<br>
6. either: follow behind mob hitting it with melee OR med. Generally, at lower levels, meleeing will be more efficient, at higher levels, medding will be better. <br>
7. re-apply DoTs and fear as necessary. <br>
Optional charm-fear kiting:<br>
Starting level: 14 (befriend animal)<br>
Ending level: 53 (XP-giving animals only go so high. technically, there are mobs in Kedge and Siren's Grotto that will give XP all the way to 60 by charming. Only the most experienced and skilled charm-kiters should even consider doing this, and should be prepared to die a lot)<br>
Best levels: again, this method is probably never the best, but lower level charms have shorter casting times, making those levels a bit better. <br>
1. find a blue /con ANIMAL<br>
2. ensnare (snare is not recommended for this method -too dangerous)<br>
3. cast charm spell<br>
4. find a second blue /con ANIMAL (same type is fine, even recommended)<br>
5. ensnare<br>
6. send charmed pet<br>
7. fear (actually optional- I prefer not to fear, but keep it memmed, in case it becomes necessary to get rid of one or more)<br>
8. whenever charm breaks, select the mob with the highest hitpoints, RESNARE (you can only refresh snare when the mob is NOT charmed) and then charm that one. <br>
While mobs are fighting, you can med. If charm holds fairly well, you can keep this method up (generally without using fear) for a good amount of time, just getting new victims, as you kill them. Charm will normally break during the fight, allowing you to charm the other, more healthy mob, and kill the former pet with it. If you start to get low mana, or can't find any more victims in the immediate area, or just need a break, just go ahead and finish off that last pet when charm breaks. You can always break charm whenever you need to by going invis (wood elves and halflings can use hide). Charm and charm-fear-kiting can be very efficient, but can also be very dangerous. If you get enough resists at the wrong times, you can easily be killed using these methods. Also, places that have enough animals in proximity to make this method efficient can easily get out of hand with adds. Because of this, it is recommended that you do not use fear and charm together. Fear does not allow any control over where the battle goes, so adds are always a possiblility when using it. One of the best uses of straight fear kiting is spell-casting animals, such as snow griffins in Eastern Wastes. Root-DoT doesn't work, because they will simply heal themselves while casting on you (snow griffins are druid casters, so they have the same spells you do). However, if they are feared, they cannot cast. <br>
<br>
EDIT*** There are some animals in Western Wastes that give XP all the way to 60. Be careful however. Some are over level 51, and summon..just be aware. I would not recommend hunting in Western Wastes without good Claws of Veeshan faction. There are wandering named dragons that can kill you before you realize you are being attacked.  Also: Ihave since determined that charm kiting is actually a very effective method of soloing, particularly at the higher levels. Spells such as Call of Karana and Glamour of Tunare (animal MR debuff) make charm and charm-fear very effecitive. <br>
<br>
Final Notes:<br>
<br>
Druids are perhaps the most self-sufficient class in the game. We can easily travel from one place to another, can move through dangerous areas in relative safety, and if we like, we can solo all the way from level 1 to level 60. However, soloing can be boring. There are often long periods of downtime (especially with quad-kiting), so unless you have some way to pass that time, you will quickly grow very bored. My personal recommendation is to use soloing as a way to gain XP during those times when you have trouble finding a group, or while you are waiting for something, such as grouping friends to come online. It is also a good choice for those times when you only have a couple of hours to play. Keep in mind that if you DO solo while waiting on groups, you will level faster than those you group with, so if you wish to continue grouping with them, you should try to keep it at a minimum. <br>
<br>
Many people dislike druids, and their reasons are not completely without basis. While I think it is wrong, even just plain silly, to hate someone you don't know simply because of the class they play, there HAVE been druids playing EQ that have helped to earn us the reputation that has garnered so much animosity. Druids who drag their kites over other players, either intentionally (hoping to get them to finish them off) or by accident (by not choosing a suitably empty place to kite); druids who take more than a fair share of mobs in a crowded area; druids who use their powerful spells and special skills such as tracking to kill steal rare mobs: all these things help to sully our reputation. All druids are hurt by these actions. While it is clearly not fair that we all pay the price for the actions of a few, it is a fact that we do. We should all do our best to try to repair those reputations, and at the very least, do nothing at all to add to them. People dislike druids because of the actions of some druids. Do not add to those actions. Kite responsibly. <br>
