Oh well - How was the weekend?</span><hr size=1> Saturday did not go too well.  We wound up killing a named Wyvern in Cobalt Scar - and Our druid did not have enough mana to Evac us away before we got the faction hit.  But it was only one, so that can't be too bad right?<br>
<br>
Sunday we invaded Tower of Frozen Shadows getting up to 4th floor before our play time ran out.  The silly Angry Librarian took FOREVER to spawn for our 2nd team.  Upon further reflection, team #1 should have moved to the next level and hunted there while waiting for the spawn.  But in 3 hours time - our team take was 420 plat (42 plat per person)<br>
<br>
Next week we are going in again - but this time straight up to the 4th floor.<br>
<br>
I gave another backpack of bones to Lashun, and I am still amiable.  So now I am camping Putrids in SK, and will probably go mow down some bandits as soon as I figure out whom to give the sashes to.  <br>
<br>
I am thinking of creating a fish killer in Qeynos - if I can figure out where these fish are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
So - how did your weekend treat you? <p><CENTER>

Died 4 times (including once to some stupid paladin who got charmed and killed me).  Got Nifty killed twice.  Also lost our DSL connection for about a half hour.  Blech<br>
<br>
Saturday:  Family stuff in the morning... (free pizza! w00t!)  Later on we did mistmoore and got a quest piece i needed from there.  Then we went and did the Hero Bracer quest for my sis-in-law.  Then went and camped shadowed men to get some more quest stuff for my soon-to-be-transferred enchanter.<br>
<br>
Sunday: Run around and get all 3 items: Rod of Insidious Glamour (AC2 CHA12 Effect: Alliance (right click)), Incandescent Mask (AC3 INT5 CHA7), and Incandescent Gloves (AC6 STR3 AGI3 CHA3 MANA3).  Also got my shaman from lvl 9 to about a yellow away from 13.<br>

I wanted to replace my Tattered Mantle since I'd rather have the +6 sta than the 1 more AC, since when I wear my resist gear, my sta can drop below 100.<br>
<br>
So I spent hour after hour in Mistmoore. The Avenging Caitiff finally spawned... and dropped the Crested Helm... his rare drop! Grrr... I can't believe I was actually mad for getting a rare drop for once. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He eventually spawned and I got my spaulders though.<br>
<br>
While there, I helped 2 people get gypsy lutes from the ball room, and I managed to get an advisor's robe, MM shield, Noble's Robe, and a Nightshade Wreath (word of advice... breaking the Maid's room with a full spawn by bum rushing it HURTS, even though I lived).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Staurday:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Didn't play at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Sunday:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Hate raid. No drops for me, I just got for fun. Got to play with Greenmist in a raid setting for once, so I could see how it worked.<br>
<br>
1 proc at the beginning of the fight = complete aggro for the duration of the fight<br>
2+ procs at any time = complete aggro<br>
1 proc somewhere in the middle-end of the battle = no aggro.<br>
<br>
Later, I had to lead a CR squad into Dalnir to rescue a few guildies... that makes 2 times this week.<br>
<br>
Then I went to Kael to do a raid with guildies and friends of the guild, only to have a power surge hit my place and lose internet connection.

Lost a few of the tanks, me included, but took him down. I got some screenshots too. He's a really little guy. About the same size as a basilisk if you ask me. But hits harder than Vox <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Saturday: Logged in at 5PM for a Vox Raid. Failed. A Healer agro'd her some how, and vox ended up over by the healers rampaging bad. Ping ponging back and forth. It sucked. Got our rezzes, and tried again. FAILED AGAIN! She summoned me this time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The first time, my MR was about 130, and cold about 160. Second time, we had a bard in the group, and my MR/CR were both 250 or 280 or something silly like that.<br>
<br>
Ya know what? The first time, Vox never landed a cold blast on me for more than 300. Not once, and I resisted her breath weapon completely probably 4 times. the SECOND run around, with my magic and cold over 250, she hit me every time with her breath, for 400+ EVERY TIME! And the max of 500 several times! I am now firmly convinced, that when your resists exceed 200, it does some kind of roll over and restarts your resists at 0. That was just ugly.<br>
<br>
So, the new record is VOX 3 BALKIN 1 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Made about a single blue bubble all weekend, and didn't log in on Sunday at all. Oh, and started a little troll shammy just for fooling around when I don't feel like being social.<br>
<br>
Why is it, that people run up to you and invite you to a group without ever speaking to you? THAT is rude! MAN I hate that. A pet peeve I've had for a long time. Silly, but it really steams me. I don't WANT to group at low levels thanks. <p><table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" width="100%" border="0">

Went into the maze in CT trying to get Radiant, but I got lost, and got about 2983729837428347 lizzies on me.  Got lost trying to get out.. Death #1.  oh gee, i'm bound in Kaladim.  Got a port back, got my body, and finally got radiant, and the thing we needed.  Off to Guk!  Got to LGuk, after some DSL Problems, we were finally able to go kill the mobs we need and loot the stuff we needed.    Then, off to MM.  We decided to fight our way in (just me, a 42 rogue, a 51 chanter, and a 26 clerc), our first mistake.  Got all the way to the bottom of the ramp leading to the bridge, Death #2.   By then, it was 3:30 am.  Sleep!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Saturday:  Family stuff  (Pizza is good!) then we got on and did the MM thing again, this time with a Bard, Pally, me, and the cleric.  And we invised in, and killed the thing we needed, and invised out.  Took about 5 minutes in all.   Then we camped the Mino Hero in Steamfont, and did some running around, so a friend could get the Hero Bracer.   After all that, we went to WC to kill shadowed men for the 2 things we needed.<br>
<br>
Sunday:  Did all the running around for the 3 quests, and ended up having to hide/sneak through the 3 zones that make up Neriak.  I have never been more scared in my entire life. I was sure that someone would see through it, and that would be the end of me!   Later, got my cleric to 43, and then headed over to Trak, for the cycle raid.  SOOO many people were there, so we headed to CoM. I LOVE This place.. wish i could play there all the time!  Trak finally cleared up, so we got 4 of us our Seb Key.   May take awhile to use them.. but we got them!   We then went back to CoM.. and had loads of fun, CoM to ourselves!    Then decided to play my rogue, got her about a yellow from 44, when someone decides to train our group with the noxious spider, the king, and so many other things.  I die, then get a port back, then we get trained again!  Luckily, there was a nice cleric there, and rezzed me and about 40 other people that died in that train.  By the end of the night, i was a yellow and a blue from 44<br>

On another note.. it's still my weekend!  I love Mardi Gras.  No classes til Wednesday <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Oh well - How was the weeke</span><hr size=1> Overall I had a great weekend.<br>
<br>
Friday night I went on my first dragon raid, which was Vox.  <br>
<br>
A few guildies were able to go with me (it was an open raid) but we all got put into different groups.  The raid took almost 5 hours to get started, and it was overorganized... the leaders were hollering at people in shout and we didn't actually engage Vox until well after midnight.  My fiance never saw her, he fell into a bear pit on the way there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I however got to see her up close, because when I AOE healed my group for the third time (we were all melees except for me and taking equal damage) I got summoned.  Amazingly I resisted every dragon roar she sent at me, and even channeled a remedy through being beaten on.  Then she killed me.  My group died shortly after.<br>
<br>
What really blew was that right after the raid ended, and nothing but a spell, a pally book, and scales (all claimed for the guild hosting it), a LOT of people left disgruntled and immedately ported out.  Only a handful stayed to recover bodies in the bear pits and I was the only cleric rezzing for a long time (and I wasn't even in the hosting guild!).  <br>
<br>
Overall I liked it though.<br>
<br>
Saturday was fairly uneventful.  I spent most of it camping crystalline shardwurms with two friends for exp and some spells to sell for cash.<br>
<br>
Sunday was a fun day.  I completed my fourth shawl and got invited on a spur of the moment Nagafen raid!  So I got to see both dragons for the first time in the same weekend.  It was the polar opposite of the first raid however, in that this one had barely any organization.  We won that one too, though.  Unfortunately there was a case of a bard ninjalooting something off the giants that was nodrop and she couldn't use, then claimed it was a mistake... and then the raid leader said that he was keeping the cloak of flames for his guild (there were only 2 of his guild even there) and the entire raid threw a fit, since it was never announced.  An officer of the guy's guild finally showed up and told him he had no choice but to roll on it, but it was not pretty.<br>
<br>
Still, I'm glad I went.  It was fun to see both dragons die in one weekend.  Plus even if I did see just how selfish and greedy a lot of people in EQ can be, I met a lot of very nice people I had not previously, and got some idea how raids work. <p><p align="center"><i><small>

<br>
Sat did a little xp grinding, but nothing major.<br>
<br>
Sunday we set up for Fear.  Only had 2 Clerics and 1 Druid show up (grrrr) but we decided to give it a go anyway.  We got in just as re-pops were starting from the raid who was in on Sat.  No named were up, so we just casually cleared the Plane <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Started with ~26 people, and a few other came in later.

Well again, Trena didn't get to 55. Heck, besides Friday night, Trena didn't even get PLAYED <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Friday, did some XPing in HS (though not for as long as I would've liked).<br>
<br>
Saturday, guild raid on the Plane of Fear. We were unlucky in that the broken golem we needed to finish up our last Wizard epic wasn't up. But, we managed to drop Fright, Dread, and Terror and got a ball of everliving golem for one of our Warriors, 2 iksar child tears for an ally guild Shaman and a new invite of ours, and the BIG ONE: A Soul Leech for an ally guild/former guildmate. He had been to Fear around 50 times and never saw it drop. Now he's one step (Lhranc) from Innoruuk's Curse. That'll make 4 of the 7 SK epics on the server we've had a hand in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It also marked the first time &quot;The New Blood of the Phoenix&quot; has taken on Cazic Thule. We got him to 60% health before we ran out of steam. Pretty darn good for a guild that people wrote off as dead just a few months ago. Again, we didn't have the kind of turnout I had hoped for but we made the most of what we did have. And the part that really vexes me is that our Wizards were told (by me) not to cast anything on him until he got to 50%. hehe I'll take the heat for that bonehead move.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday we hit Halls of Testing (at 10am EST <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) for 12 hrs and got a lot of nice drops (4 plate legs, 2 plate BPs, and a bunch of smaller pieces of leather, chain, and silk). As a result, Tara's now wearing:<br>
<br>

Of course, now I can't totally retire her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One good thing that came out of it was that our lead cleric, who's been lvl 60 for almost a year now, finally got to get rid of her Donal's armor. She got a BP and legs to go with the boots she got on our last trip. Also, our allied guild got her Donal's legs TWICE (she was going to pass them to a cleric who was at the raid when she got her plate legs...then that cleric got plate legs also so they were passed to another cleric in that guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

<br>
Finally, after probably a month of auctioning, I SOLD MY BARBARIAN SPIRITIST'S HAMMER!!!  Persistance finally payed off, someone I had run across in Everfrost really wanted it, and I told her to keep me in mind even though she didn't have the cash.  It pays to be polite =) She went on a mad Mammoth Spree, and raised the 6Kpp I had quoted her.  I've never had so much money before!!!  And I don't, anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
   My grand total of items obtained over the course of just auctioning to sell the Hammer and hanging around EC, by Friday night:<br>
Centi Longsword (1500pp)<br>
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood (4500pp)<br>
Crafted BP (236pp)<br>
Crustacean Greaves (250pp)<br>
Gauntlets of the Black (250pp)<br>
Dwarven Sap (x2) (50pp &amp; 80pp)<br>
<br>
I started out with around 400pp.  I currently have 600, and am looking to get a guildie jeweler do the combine for 2 Velium Fire Wedding Rings.  Another Guildie is supplying the gems, I just have to buy the Velium somehow.  The amount I payed for the Hammer in the first place?  250pp.  I think I came out ahead.<br>
<br>
I can now get to adventuring and barshin' stuff.  The Brood Axe procs an 85DD, I haven't found a blue yet to see how often in a real fight.  The effect looks like an Ykesha though, very cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That weapon combo is a big improvement over my Ebon Razor/Crystallized Sword.  I R uber now!  I also have a backpack full of spider/spiderling silks to do a tailoring day if I so choose.<br>
<br>
Saturday I hooked up with Yaenna, Yansabar, and Blackrain and we had an alt hunting day in the Warrens.  Some of us forgot that we were no longer uber 56 DrOOds and promptly  got killed by the skeleton guards after running out before my little ranger could camo everyone (/poke Yaenna)  Figures she was bound in Felwithe :rofl.  One 56 Cleric rez cleared that up nicely though =)  Didn't kill near enough Kobolds to get un-KOS to Paineel, I may just forego that and turn 'em in in Erudin.  Camo RoXXors =).  And rangers can make very effective tanks, especially if they're fighting blues and subtley twinked =)<br>
<br>
I plan on spending most of my time with Kinor though.  Whatever the name of the tundra zone on the other side of Netherbian Lair is, it's nice hunting for a 27 warrior.  I could take out a critter there and lose around a bubble of health, so I can warrior solo with no problem, especially now that I've upgraded my stuff.  I've been 27 for close to a year now, it's time I saw 28 and higher =)<br>

I fell well short of getting up to 27 this weekend but I at least got 23 for selos consonant chain. Slow &amp; snare will come in very handy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I made my first trip through the dreadlands to use the wiz spires there. Being in a zone where mobs see through invis &amp; level 50 players are LFGing was not terribly comforting.<br>
<br>
I got my iksar BL up to 5th as well in the breaks where I couldn't get a group with my bard &amp; didn't feel like soloing him.  <p><br> <b> <DIV ALIGN="center"> Jathrous Thunderfall, Knight of Rallos Zek </b> <br>

I guess they 'hear' me get smaller - and realize that, without me saying it, that I am going to shrink them too.<br>

Oh well - How was the weeke</span><hr size=1> This weekend really didn't start off too well.<br>
<br>
Friday I didn't play much cause this week at work really wiped me out.<br>
<br>
Saturday I had made plans with some people in my guild to take on Black Dire for my <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1784">Black Fur Boots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Gathered our group up and went to MM. Sat in the Advisor room for a couple hours waiting for him to spawn. He finally did and we invised and went out to<br>
the zone line to pull Black Dire. Medded up and invised.<br>
<br>
I went to pull the wolf and did not get 3 steps from him and fell down dead. My dumb butt was still bound in the Nexus. Fueamin got his sister who happened to be in GFay to come rez me and then she stayed to help. If she hadn't there's no way we would've won. <br>
<br>
Almost lost wizzie and druid but they zoned and we finished off the wolf <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I looted the pelt! We medded up and ported off to EJ to talk to the spirit. I realized I forgot the gem that I had to turn in to start<br>
conversation with the spirit. I bound myself in EJ, Fue TL'd me to GD and I got the gem and gated back. We ran over to where the spirit was and I waited<br>
til I didn't see any wandering mobs and uninvised to turn in gem.<br>
<br>
Started convo and shortly there after a soulsipper started attacking me! /sigh I didn't change targets fast enough and someone /assisted me and killed<br>
the Spirit Sentinel, I lost my gem.  /sigh  /cry  /depression on. I have to redo<br>
everything up to the wolf.<br>
<br>
I left to help my family get ready for a party on Sunday. Was supposed to go play Bingo but never heard from my friend who I was supposed to go with. So I returned to the computer, probably shouldn't<br>
have, and had problems logging in. Finally got into the game and invised to run though WFP and EFP cause I'm KOS. Just before I got to the dock my invis dropped and a guard kicked my butt! /sigh /more depression on. Was too angry to get a rez, looted my body and headed out to OOT to start the quest over and couldn't find the little runt I was supposed to kill. I killed a<br>
barbarian bandit and promptly went LD and couldn't get back in. Which was probably for the best, I was so upset at this point. <br>
<br>
Sunday, I got up and did the whole family thing all day long. It was fun. Got home and promptly logged in, I was bound and determined to have my black fur booties before the weekend was over <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Found the runt in the tent I didn't look in last time, killed him. Gated back to NFP did that part. Went to Wisp Isle and<br>
waited underwater to talk to a bunch of mobs who don't say much at all for the better (or worse depending on how you look at it) part of an hour. Got<br>
the gem from the spirit there. Went to RM and killed Glaron the Wicked and Talbian the Goodly to turn into the Spirit in WK to get my shield over again. Turned them in and got my shield *again*<br>
<br>
Went to EJ and had my 2 druid protecters with me and did my dialogue with the spirit and got my Black Fur Boots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehe I'm so excited!!! Manaless instacast sow!! LOL even while I'm running! Can you tell I'm a little excited? and they look SO good!!<br>
<br>
So it ended up being a really good weekend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Saturday, didn't play much EQ.<br>
<br>
Sunday was a long Kael raid. We also decided to try Derakor the Vindicator. This was our first real CH-rotation mob attempt. We botched it horribly (mostly me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but it was a learning experience. I am confident we'll get better. I predict he will fall before VL within 2 months. <br>
<br>
Catyra: for your faction thing: We kill dragons all the time as a guild, and then go back to Kael to repair the faction. It's not a big deal at all. I just went to max ally with CoV for the third time yesterday.  <p><h6><a href="mailto:cuchulaine_eq@hotmail.com">Geneze Angelfyre</a><br>

Sat...played a bit with yans, then with Kinor and Yaenna and Blackie as our alts in the warrens. /hug Yae for letting me see that sometimes memories go and that we dont always play our mains.

<br>
Well this is traditionally epic night for my guild when we run around doing bits for peoples quests. First off was Eejag a couple of time for monks. Then becuase a fellow ranger only needed one bit to get his first epic it was time for the hole to go do Jeril the wretched / insane. what I did not know was that the insane version can be spawned multiple times.. but thankfully someone told me to take my shiny bowl along.. and so I actually got a bit of my epic done! Very happy! Then it was off to bed for me as I had RL stuff saturday<br>
<br>
Saturday<br>
Out most of the day - got back and logged on just in time to be ported to DL to go kill V - he had spawned and it was our turn in the rotation! He died very easily. Not sure what I did after that - nothing special that I can remember of the top of my head<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday<br>
Finally got my HS key and went there for the fridt time - great fun and got meself a parrying dagger - fun weapon except for the fact it has an aor proc making it a little dangerous... other than that lots of soloing of rockhoppers and then a fun group in SG killing sirens!<br>
<br>
<br>
Monday<br>
Well not really the weekend I know.. but forogt to post yesterday! Started witha group in Umbral peaks, then we were going to ToV but it was full. So we looked around - and as we did Sev in EJ popped. One of our warriors has been waiting for him to complete his epic for sometime - so we rushed over there! I missed the actual fight as I got a bit lost in EJ til Sev found and eat me! Still the dragon died and we got an epic warrior! Having so many of us together and nowhere togo we decided monday would be this weeks friday and headed to LOIO to do more monkie stuff. Finished that okay and headed to thurg to hang around - when some one in gu mentioned VSR was up in KC! As it happens there were only 2 of us on who needed the stone off him - so manage to round up a couple of groups and head in there - another easy kill and another step of my epic down! Only 3 things left for me - okay not easy - but feels nice to have made some progress at last!<br>
<br>
<br>
So a good weekend for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
