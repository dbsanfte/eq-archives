Personally, I just assumed they scrapped the idea altogether since no one brought it up for well over a year, then all of a sudden, Legends came out. I find it odd that no one &quot;leaked&quot; that they were working on this. Then again, maybe they did and I just didn't hear about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/uflame22.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flame22</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Proud Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#000000>(2/10/02 5:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p069.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=441.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.homestead.com/flame_22/files/dancer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /gu got it right over a year ago!</span><hr size=1> Yup, it's been that long since that poll, That was before I left <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/ubalkin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balkin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Proud Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 816<br> <font color=#000000>(2/10/02 10:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p069.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=441.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tjcool.freeservers.com/images/minibalkin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /gu got it right over a year ago!</span><hr size=1> LMAO!!!<br>

Of course the general outpouring of anger was to be expected. But I don't think they'd have greenlit it if they didn't know there was support as well. <p><br> <b> <DIV ALIGN="center"> Jathrous Thunderfall, Knight of Rallos Zek </b> <br>

The 10 dollars is a simple payment to access the servers, and not even that is guaranteed (hello EULA <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
But, mankind (in general) tends to be greedy. So put a GM on a server for 8 hours a day and people belive they have the right for a GM coverage 24/7. They &quot;DEMAND&quot; an answer from the GM's in 3 minutes MAX and constant quests and events (but of course always for their level). They want the quests to be announced (so they can participate) but limited (so they thet phat lewt).<br>
<br>
I may sound harsh, but I just hate to see that people make comments like &quot;With Legends they finally do what they should have done from the beginning&quot; or &quot;I won't pay for a service I should have in the first place&quot;. Belive it or not, there will NEVER come out a game with that coverage for 10 dollars a month. It's just not possible. <br>
<br>
IMHO Legends is a great thing. I don't switch to there because EQ is enough fun for me at the moment even without GM intervention and I can't play that much that it pays. But if it works out it will be a signal for other games as well. In my opinion, Verant tests some &quot;new forms&quot; for SW:G already. European servers (rumours talk about a 2nd one and/or asian one), Legends, special rulesets (Sullon Zek) and so on. They can gather numbers from there and see if it's worth doing or not. <br>
<br>
It is easy to flame Verant, but no other games had such a success in a longtime player base (well, some MUD's probably do :-)). Take a look at DAoC for example. People are already coming back because it's not the same and a lot of people I talked with told me &quot;DAoC is too easy&quot;. Of course some are gone and stay gone, but DAoC didn't kill EQ like so many tried to convict us. I think the only programs that can kill EQ is SW:G and EQ2. <br>
<br>
just my 2 cents<br>

<br>
Incidentally, DAoC's fundamental problem is/was that *all* of the high-level content at release was based on PvP. The first dragon(s) *JUST* went in-game in the last two weeks. <br>
<br>
Mythic's doing fairly okay, though, imo, all things considered, but they did make a serious error in choosing to have the game centered around PvP content, rather than the PvE/PvM content. For me, PvP is boring, and I've never been terribly good at it (with the exception of old school Team Fortress... HW Guys own you =). I have zero desire to get into a game that I'm going to be doing something I won't enjoy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The other problem with Mythic's design is that the class balancing is completely screwy - moreso than EQ's ever was, from what I understand of how EQ *used* to be. In PvP, until the most recent patch, Hunters were *the* class. Pretty much any group of 3-5 hunters could take down anyone of similar level in a heartbeat. Even a solo player could do some serious damage, all because of one skill. Of course, Mythic nerfed the skill entirely, rather than just in PvP, so now it's kinda useless against monters, too. Oops.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, regarding Legends... the problem here is that it's a poor PR move, imo. Now is NOT the time to release this sort of thing, because it gives the impression to the majority of the playerbase that Verant is more concerned with making money than with their customers. Now, OBVIOUSLY that *is* the case, but giving that appearance right after the shoddy Luclin release (which still isn't fixed up to most peoples' satisfaction, I'd think) just isn't a good idea, imo.<br>
<br>
I don't much care what they're doing with Legends... I'm not moving, and I'm not too concerned that the rest of the live servers will suffer. What I am concerned about is all the people who *will* move, and then DEMAND (for $40, you can bet they will be demanding =)  better CS, more GM quests, more loot, etc, etc, etc. Verant can't/won't guarantee that a GM is present on Legends 100% of the time, and really, how many times have you ever requested the assistance of a GM? (Don't include naming issues, or petitions for trivial things when you were a newbie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I'd be willing to bet that the majority of EQ players have called upon a GM less than 3 times per year they've played. <br>
<br>
However, I do think that ALL live servers should have 3-6 GMs per, each on 4-8 hour shifts. EverQuest runs 24/7... the GM staff should as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
The problem with class balancing is really when are classes balanced? There are 2 possibilities:<br>
<br>
1.) All classes are equal - Now that would be boring. If all classes could do the same things, there would be no sense in having different classes. But we have to agree that they would be 100% balanced :-)<br>
<br>
2.) The classes have strengths and weaknesses but are overall possible to achive the same things. - This is what EQ (and all other games) *TRY* to achive. But the more classes you have, the more complicated it is. Imagine you have 3 classes. One (warrior) has strong AC and dishes out medium damage, Two (wizard) has strong damage, but low AC and third (cleric) has strong heals and AC, but no damage. That would work pretty well. But put in a fourth, fifth and so on... it gets more complicated.<br>
<br>
This is the crux with classes. As soon as one clast is &quot;the best&quot; in one line, the other classes can (and will) complain. But basically there are too few &quot;key elements&quot;, meaning some classes can't be the &quot;best&quot; in a field needed. I would say there is healing (cleric), tanking (warrior), damage (rogue/wizard) and maybe crowd control (enchanter). But where is the mage (pet?), shaman (buffs/slow?) or ranger (ehm...)? Verant TRIES to make every class special and to improve their uses. But it really is not easy, even for them having almost 3 years of experience.<br>

<br>
Actually they do. They hired additional GM's to be able to cover Legends 24/7. Although I don't know what exactly that means. I would assume they have about 2 GM's during prime time and one during off-times (with the help of floating GM's). But there shouldn't be a &quot;no GM day&quot; as with other servers. In addition, there will be no volunteer Guides on Legends. They don't want people to get hold of a CS representative who can't help. <br>

<br>
I agree that it would be nice, but I don't know if it would be doable. I don't have the numbers to evaluate if it would still pay off or not, but I guess it will stay a dream. On the other hand, by your own words (and I agree), how often does one really need a GM? I can imagine that if ALL people would only call a GM if the request is valid (as within the guidelines they give for valid petition reasons) it would work.<br>

This will be interesting to see. I know I will try it out, but I don't know which one will keep me then. If I do a very basic simplification and say &quot;SWG is like EQ, just in space with sci-fi equipment&quot;, then it sounds like a nice change. And what I saw untill now (E3 teaser, Screenshots) looks nice. The question is, will it attract more new people, or will it draw a substential amount of players away from EQ? Hard to say...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> EQ2... eh. Verant's got more to worry about right now than another entirely new MMORPG.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, EQ2 is a totally different team and doesn't have anything to do with EQ. Well, of course they exchange knowledge and I bet there are people who moved from one team to the other, but working on EQ2 will not take away manpower from EQ. I can also imagine (no proof though of course) that some programmers from EQ2 (and SW2) already test parts of their codes with EQ (e.g. new graphic engine). Personally, I don't think EQ2 is too far away from us. To develop such a game takes a lot of time, so they can't wait untill EQ is dead and then start on the new one. It HAS to be parallel. And who knows if there aren't a few coders working on it already? Remember that the basic concept is already done and most of the things they want to change should be already known to them. Taking the fact that Legends came pretty surprising shows that Verant CAN keep secrets, if they want. So even having a project like EQ2 can be &quot;hidden&quot;. Of course we all know that sooner or later it will be released (that is no secret IMHO), but the time is unknown ;-)<br>

I still say that it's much easier to put up some screenshots than to actually release a game. On paper (or screen hehe) it's easy to promise new things and point out, where other games are weak and how you will do everything much better. In the end, the numbers of player decide about a success or not. amazingly enough, a lot of players curse about EQ (I know I do from time to time), but in the end they love playing it. Other programs tried to compete but failed. That's why I stil say, the only program to kill EQ is EQ2 (and maybe SWG) :-)<br>

<br>
Hehe.. never said it wasn't complicated. It's just that Mythic's class balancing has to take PvP into account FAR more than Verant's does. EQ has 4 PvP servers out of over 40... Mythic's servers are all PvP (well, kind of), and the game is centered on the PvP as you get higher in level. <br>
<br>
Druids used to be broken in that they could kite/level/etc VERY fast. Still, all that did, at a basic level, was create lots of higher level druids. Hunters in DAoC were broken so badly that they could 1-shot kill people in PvP. That's more of a problem, when 95% of your high level content *is* PvP. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thing is, nerfing the abilities for use on monsters at the same rate you nerf them on players is a fallacy.

Agreed, wholeheartedly. Heck, the rogues have been complaining about monks, because we're getting great weapons lately, and they have yet to see a 16 damage piercer (I think?).<br>

<br>
The root problem here really is (imo) that Verant's design made it so that if you have enough warriors, enchanters, clerics, you don't really need anything else. Throw 50 level 60 warriors, 10 'chanters, and say 20 clerics at Tunare, for example, and I'd bet she'll probably die. <br>
<br>
The larger problem is the players. It's PLAYERS who reinforce the garbage about &quot;Paladins suck&quot;, &quot;Rangers can't tank&quot;, &quot;Druids are useless in groups&quot;, and similar tripe. Until player attitudes change on a large scale, the perceived imbalances will always exist, as will the animosity towards people playing a certain class, regardless of their skill.<br>

It'd be a bad idea to put in writing a guarantee that GM assistance will be available 24/7, otherwise if a GM wasn't available, it'd open up Verant to being sued for a breach of contract. Trust me, *someone* would do it. =)<br>

<br>
There was a decent analysis of the logistics of it on the old TNZ (I think?) a while ago, when Absor posted the number of GMs hired for Legends. It's something like 20-30 people, so that's plenty to cover any number of shift combintations for any given week. I highly doubt that there -will- be 24/7 GM coverage, myself. I just don't trust Verant to make it happen. <br>
<br>
I'd also argue that Verant, in general, doesn't want people to get a hold of a CS rep *in general*. Guides take way too much flack, imo, and I'm really moreso referring to the actual paid employees of Verant/SOE. Remember how there used to be a 1-800 number for phone CS/tech support? Changing it to a long distance call ENSURES that they receive less calls, in general. GM hours are designed such that people have a very difficult time getting a hold of them, as most GM hours are something like 10AM PST-6PM PST. The majority of those hours fall during work hours for anybody in North America, which means that most of the requests for GM assistance will happen during a 3-4 hour period. People can and will get ignored/lost in the shuffle, when there's a limited time to look into things.<br>
<br>
This also, of course, would assume that the server GMs are actually in-game for their entire shift. If Rodcet, or the server I was a Guide on briefly, are any indication, that's *rarely* the case.<br>

I've been specifically avoiding looking into SWG, myself. In my opinion, exactly four well-done Star Wars games have been created.

<br>
I think SWG *will* be a fairly good draw... I'd not be at all surprised if 100,000 pick it up at release. Still, if Verant's still adding new content to EQ by the time SWG comes out, I'd bet that a lot of people are going to pick one or the other. <br>
<br>
*snip comments about EQ2*<br>
<br>
Incidentally, has Verant ever actually said there *would* be an EQ2, and that it was currently in dev? Not doubting you, El, just don't recall hearing anything save for the odd off-hand comment during interviews.<br>

Well, AO was pretty much a flop, which I really do regret, as it had so much potential to be cool. I can only assume that they were running out of money, and needed to get it out there to restore their cash flow. Unfortunately, AO didn't do much of anything to compete, although it seems to have improved greatly since release.<br>
<br>
DAoC is EQ's only real, solid competitor at this point. Mythic had 100,000+ buy the game in the first couple weeks it was out. Even if only 75,000 or so are still playing, that still makes it (more or less) the second most successful MMORPG in the North American Market (I'm not even TOUCHING Lineage. =). Mythic/DAoC have their respective problems, but from everything I've heard about it, it *is* a good game, if you enjoy RvR. They're being a bit heavy with the nerf stick, by the sounds of it, but Verant's done no less or worse, when you get right down to it.<br>
<br>
And somehow, I forgot to mention World of Warcraft in my last post (I really do hope that's just a working title. hee =).<br>
<br>
Blizzard consistently puts out GREAT stuff, though you have to wait for it. Starcraft was delayed over a year, and enjoyed smashing success. Diablo 2 was in development <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> forever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and also did very, very well. I expect World of Warcraft will be the next big success in the MMORPG market, due to Blizzard's huge pull in the gaming industry. Everything they've put out since 1995 has been pure gold. WoW, hopefully, will be the same. <br>
<br>
Admittedly, I like the Diablo universe better, as far as names/history/etc, but the temptation to be a big stupid orc is just too great. I'll be picking up WoW whenver it comes out.<br>

This is the kind of thing that I think we'll be seeing more and more often. The 'preferred' customers will be getting better service, leaving us short. Maybe not. Maybe all the legends GM's will be new, instead of sharing it between all of them.<br>
<br>
I do know im getting a little angry though. Because as more and more time passes, it's less likely I'll get my quest pieces back. <p>[60 Warlord] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8921">Raaj</a> <<a href="http://www.clantaveren.com">Clan Ta Veren</a>>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's just that Mythic's class balancing has to take PvP into account FAR more than Verant's does.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
EQ was (and probably always will be) a PvE game. The PvP servers suffer a lot from that, as some features of the engine are not built with having PvP in mind (charming, pets, dots etc.). However, IMHO the number of servers and population show that the vast majority of EQ players just plain don't want to do PvP. The fear of getting your fun ruined by some PKillers is way too high.<br>
<br>
Out of that I was amazed when Mythic made PvP a core element of DAoC. I never said &quot;they will fail because of that&quot;, but I knew that the high end game of DAoC would not be what I wanted to do...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hunters in DAoC were broken so badly that they could 1-shot kill people in PvP. That's more of a problem, when 95% of your high level content *is* PvP. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The funny thing is, that Mythic explained on and on that character building in DAoC is completely different to EQ as it allows more variety. The problem is, that the majority of players will take the path that will result in the most powerfull character. Here and there we hear the question of a new player asking &quot;What is the best class in EQ&quot;? Amazingly, for EQ there is no real answer, but it seems like for DAoC there is (or was). <br>
<br>
The different paths lead into players talking about &quot;templates&quot;. And they advised which skills to take and which not. And if Skill A is 100% effective, while Skil B is only 95% effective, People will Choose A, no matter what (or let's say most will).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The root problem here really is (imo) that Verant's design made it so that if you have enough warriors, enchanters, clerics, you don't really need anything else.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think this is a negative side effect of &quot;complete healing&quot;. The question is, how do I make an encounter more interesting/dangerous? The AI itself is very limited, so it has to be done over damage (through spells or attacks by the MoB) or longer fights (through high HP's, AC, MR and so on). That puts casters in a bad position. If a MoB can CHeal himself, sooner or later the casters are OOM and all their damage is gone. The melee, however, can still fight and continue to make damage. <br>
<br>
Complete Heal pushed the capabilities of warriors with a cleric in his group up (since these warriors now could fight longer), so they had to up the MoBs as well, making the gap between casters and melee even higher.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The larger problem is the players. It's PLAYERS who reinforce the garbage about &quot;Paladins suck&quot;, &quot;Rangers can't tank&quot;, &quot;Druids are useless in groups&quot;, and similar tripe. Until player attitudes change on a large scale, the perceived imbalances will always exist, as will the animosity towards people playing a certain class, regardless of their skill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is so true I don't even know what to say. To break this &quot;triumvirate&quot; (cleric, enchanter, warrior) is very hard, as it is deep in the heads of the people. IMHO there is only one solution: <br>
<br>
****Attention, the following statement is a personal Opinion of Ellegon. Disagree as much as you like, but don't flame me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  **********<br>
<br>
Get rid of &quot;masters&quot;, give multiple classes options. For example: Give Druids a complete heal at higher mana costs than a cleric.<br>
<br>
What would that mean? It means that a raid without clerics could still work, but not as easy as with clerics. But a druid would suddenly be an alternative to the cleric.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, give the cleric a new spell (e.g. Holy Smite) that does some high damage, but at higher costs than a wizard.<br>
<br>
Of course such changes would start in an outcry by the people, but it would close the gap between the classes a bit. For example: I was in ToV quite a few times already. What was my purpose as a Druid? Circle spells (resists) and backup healing. The circles are nice, but with the new SoL spell it's one cast and then the buff is on for 2.5 hours. Now, backup healing.. at level 53 I have Superior Healing. That means, if I cast it on a full buffed warrior, I heal him for about one fourth of a bubble of life. You call that backup healing? I call it a joke. I can heal the cleric itself or an enchanter, but if the cleric goes down, so goes the melee.<br>
<br>
But then, it's easy for me to come up with such ideas and not having to work them out hehe...<br>

<br>
First, I agree that some would :-)) Second, the wording is a bit vague in that statement by Verant. It says &quot;While you may not see a GM at every log in, with dynamic content ongoing throughout each day, you are sure to be caught up in the weave of stories and events.&quot; Does that mean there is not necessarily a GM online, or just not visible? I agree that it wouldn't be wise to guarantee it, but somehow I belive the server is set up to have 24/7 coverage (maybe with exceptions for breaks etc.).

<br>
Actually the GM hours are 2 pm PST to 11 pm PST (which is 5 pm EST to 2 am EST). That looks like decent hours (at least for the americans :-). Interestingly enough, the GM hours on Antonius Bayle are during European Prime Time (meaning VERY early for poor Drembo). But then GM's are often invis or, in the case of a real good GM, helping on other servers as well.<br>

Well, nothing official, just rumours. I can't even say that I have &quot;sources&quot; because I don't. Or if I'd had, I wouldn't say it :-) But by putting a few things together that I heard here and there, then pressing COMBINE I wouldn't be surprised if it is announced sooner or later :-)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> DAoC is EQ's only real, solid competitor at this point. Mythic had 100,000+ buy the game in the first couple weeks it was out. Even if only 75,000 or so are still playing, that still makes it (more or less) the second most successful MMORPG in the North American Market (I'm not even TOUCHING Lineage. =). Mythic/DAoC have their respective problems, but from everything I've heard about it, it *is* a good game, if you enjoy RvR. They're being a bit heavy with the nerf stick, by the sounds of it, but Verant's done no less or worse, when you get right down to it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Mythic has a hard time and an easy time at the same time. On one hand, it is easy to get &quot;bored&quot; EQ players towards a new game by making promises and create excpectations. With some good PR you can get a lot of players pretty fast. That's why I always told that only the future will show how good DAoC will hold. And that brings us the the hard time: Most of the DAoC players compare DAoC with EverQuest. So whatever is different is rated as &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;. If there are more &quot;better&quot; parts people will stay, if there are more &quot;worse&quot; parts, they will go back (or search another game). With PvP being a core item in DAoC and my assumption that the majority of players don't like PvP (based on population numbers of the EQ servers) I would say that more and more players will reach the high level game and then quit.<br>
<br>
Of course that is pessimistic, but I don't see that DAoC will be as successfull as EQ was. But I'm also not sure if ANY game ever can be that successfull again in that genre. EQ was for a long time the only real alternative (next to UO). And probably the lack of PvP was a huge factor in that.<br>
<br>
Does that make DAoC a bad game? No, not at all. But I also wouldn't say it's superior to EQ. It's better in some areas, and worse in others. For me, when I tested it, the bad parts were bigger in numbers so I quit.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Blizzard consistently puts out GREAT stuff, though you have to wait for it. Starcraft was delayed over a year, and enjoyed smashing success. Diablo 2 was in development forever, and also did very, very well. I expect World of Warcraft will be the next big success in the MMORPG market, due to Blizzard's huge pull in the gaming industry. Everything they've put out since 1995 has been pure gold. WoW, hopefully, will be the same. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I kinda disagree here. Starcraft was a GREAT game and still is a lot of fun to play. D2 on the other side was a huge disappointment for me. Of course I bought it, as I trusted Blizzard, but they took away the &quot;fun&quot; of Diablo. <br>
<br>
For me, Diablo was THE game before EQ. I could start a game, kill a few monsters and have some fast fun. I had a few difficulty levels (church, catacombs, cave, hell) with 3 major difficulty levels (ehm...easy, medium, hell?). The 3 races were straightforward and more or less balanced (although the sorceror just rocked). It was fun in multiplayer as solo'ing.<br>
<br>
In D2 they changed some of these nice features. The storyline was better IMHO, but the &quot;touch&quot; got lost. The casters suddenly had to decide what path to take, which brought the fear of being screwed later. I couldn't get better in an area except for leveling and putting points into the skills. In Diablo I just spent some time in the levels, collecting books, and improving my spells with that.<br>
<br>
Also the &quot;Boss types&quot; in D2 were mostly way too powerfull. What I did (and others from what I heard) was to run in, hit the Boss a few times and die. Then run there again, pick up your equipment (only one click needed luckily) and hit on the Boss a few times. Rinse and Repeat.<br>
<br>
Another &quot;bad thing&quot; (and pardon me for letting this post slip a bit :-)) was the equipment part. On one hand, there was this neat idea of armor sets, meaning you find an &quot;Shield of the Eagle&quot; (example) which has some nice stats. Then, later, you might find the &quot;Boots of the Eagle&quot; and so on. Rumour said that if you wear a full set it would be even more powerfull. But how can you collect it? The storage space in that box was a joke. The only chance was to create mule chars and store it on there. Sad as it would have been fun to hunt for your last part (remember hunting for the KSOH in Diablo?).<br>
<br>
Then take the gem concept. Neat plan, but I tried to collect gems and run out of space quickly. And since the lower level gems didn't really add a lot, I had to combine them. To make a long story short: gem hunting wasn't worth it IMHO.<br>
<br>
Of course that is my personal opinion, but I think fewer would have been better in D2 and I never had the fun with it I had with Diablo. :-)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I drifted off a bit. Sorry for that :-)<br>
