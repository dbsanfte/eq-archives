DING 40 Friday night!<br>
<br>
Gotta love the Crystal Caverns.<br>
<br>
AND I now have 119 of the 200 crystalline silk swatches that I set as a goal to skill up my mage's tailoring.<br>
<br>
Got a Crystal Grinder too, 27dly 9dam piercer, Lore/Magic. NICE piercing weapon. In fact, of the 6 people I grouped with on and off, all 6 of us got a grinder... We were there quite a while, can you tell? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Getting smarter though, we officially stayed the hell away from the Queen room!

The sad part, is that 40 officially sucks. I'm BARELY my mandatory safety 1/2 bubble into it. This is going to take a LONG time *sigh*.<br>

Friday I saw Pearl Harbor (It was ok, very long), and decided to play a bit when I got home at 12:30am.  I decided to gank some Giants for faction in GD.  As I pass the Wurm caves I notice the Broodmother is up, so I send a tell to my friend Gathon who needs to finish the Kromriff Military leggins quest.  So, he turns up, gives her the harness and we are off to the Giant fort.  We start beating on Mr. Frostsky and he hits me a few times.  I target my self for a heal, just as root broke.  Quickly cast root, but sometime is wrong...why can't I move... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  !!!!!  I rooted myself at the feet of a lvl 45 Giant! ACK!!!!  Despite the efforts of Gathon, I died.  I quickly made it back to GD and we finished him off and got Gathon his leggings.  I however lost lvl 53 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, I drag my corpse to Thurgadin and ask a Vicar inside for a Rez.  He is nice and comes out to rez me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Rez Ding!  Woot!  So, I go back to hunting Giants.  I hear a shout about a new Dragon in the zone.  Check tracking and sure enough there is Karkador (sp) red con on track.  So, being the brave soul I am (mind you I'm hunting Giants cause I'm still KoS to CoV), I invis and start tracking him.<br>
<br>
Karkador is ahead and to the right<br>
Karkador is straight ahead<br>
Karkador is straight ahead<br>
<br>
Karkador claws YOU for 227 damage<br>
Karkador claws you for 150 damage<br>
Karkador kicks you for 70 damage<br>
<br>
You are hit for non-melee for 1240 damage<br>
Returning to home point.<br>
You have lost a level. Welcome to lvl 52!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Turns out invis never took, but I didn't check to make sure.  Luckily, the same cleric rezzed me again (after Fadax was nice enough to come find my corpse) and I was only 3 kills from dinging again.<br>
<br>
So, beware the new Dragon in GD.  I think he is a quest NPC on CoV faction.  I never saw him/her, so can't tell you what they look like.<br>

(Indoors due to rain <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Then I showed him EQ. Next thing we knew it was 5 hours later and he had his first 5th level character!  Then we played some cards and they went home.<br>
By 4:00 Sunday he has the game installed and is telling me to get online to play! So my wife and I made new characters and the 3 of us hung out with a couple of my guilies by Freeport and got ourselves to 3rd level while we showed him the ropes. He should have done the tutorial first, but what can I say?<br>

<br>
<B><U>Friday</u></b>: Guild raid on the Tower of Froze Shadow. Before I showed for the meeting place, I goofed around in South Ro, hoping to catch the AC so get my SK some Jboots. No luck there. Went to the raid. Only 3 people, including myself, showed up. 3 more that were within the level limits said they were "too busy" to come along. We spent 3 hours on the first floor and never got a key to move on to the second floor. Watch a druid quad kite INSIDE the tower on the first floor!! I really hate druids sometimes!! >:<br>
<br>
<B><U>Saturday</u></b>: Died with my wiz first thing in the morning. Had a charbone in Loio resist 7 roots, break 2 that stuck in under 2 seconds, and beat me to a pulp. I got 2 shadow steps off... that only put me 5 feet from the skeleton. Grrr. Later died with my Iksar SK in the Crystal Caverns. Took on an oracle and 3 miners jumped in. FD failed twice. Gave up frusterated for the night.<br>
<br>
<B><U>Sunday</u></b>: Died with my SK again in CC. That made it twice and both times I was bound in FP. Got my corpse and went off to collect some minor twink gear for my gf's new cleric. Hit unrest with Cy and got a BS tunic on the second knight spawn. Let her play her cleric for a while. Logged my SK on later and got a tell from a shaman friend asking if I wanted to group with them. We decided to hit the shardwurms in GD. Was a 41 shaman, 40? druid, 43 warrior, and me 42 SK. Picked up an enchanter on the way. Kill the first elder no problem. Attacked an ancient and it gated at the last second before it died. I went right after it and got aggroed on by another elder and ancient. I run out and away from my party saying to stay clear. I knew we couldn't take them and was going to run them around then zone. The enchanter tried to mez one... which you can't mez these guys. I have to run back to save them. I get killed REALLY fast and no one healed me. Death #3 for the weekend on my SK. I was very pissed off. Decided it was time to quit for the weekend. Got a 39 rez and logged out. Had some work to do.<br>
<br>
Overall, the weekend kinda sucked EQ wise. On another note, I have officially retired Cyranith from further gaining of xp. I will only bring him out when needed, but for the most part, I won't be playing him anytime soon. Risen Phoenix guild leader is now my SK.<br>

Didn't play Amagine at all, only Zarubine. <br>
<br>
Friday<br>
First goal for Zarubine was to learn how to use the new spells effectively. So I stayed in Lavastorm, adding Rock Dervishes to the Drakes I was fighting before and I think I got it now. Thanks so much for all the tips, hints and advice given in the How do I...? section. The only problem I still have I can't seem to get Color Flux to work properly but I will get there eventually. <br>
<br>
Saturday<br>
Second goal was completing Stein of Moggok quest. Run all the way to WK to feed Frostbite the Regurgitonic and got finally the Koalindl corpse and some very nice faction for a DE. Then quickly of to Qeynos and Erudin getting Erud's Tonic. Back to EFP, giving Gregor all ingredients and got Bartender's compendium. Tired of running I decided to go to Oggok another day and headed back to Lavastorm. <br>
<br>
There even more Dervishes and Drakes. I was lucky. Almost every second mob dropped a gem, everything up to Star Rose Quartz. Dinged 13, wohoo.  Got jewelery up to skill 23.<br>

I pretty much just can't play any more from my computer at home, due to frequently getting booted to desktop, and finally sunday just gave up on it once and for all.  Died a couple times due to it.  Did come out of the weekend about a blue bub ahead of where I started, so overall at least met my goal of moving in the right direction. <br>
<br>
This morning was a little more interesting (I come in early and play on my work computer for a couple hours)- couldn't get a group going in GD, so ran down to Kael to see if I could follow somebody around for faction.  Got hooked up with a big guild raid and think I got a lot of faction, but haven't had a chance to check it yet.  Was a bit nervous about getting out as we were in the King area when I needed to log and kept doing 'say' for an invis and not getting any response.  I wasn't upset with them - they were doing me a favor and I was taking my own chances, but I was surprised that out of 40 people, no one would do it.  Then I found out that the vast majority of them did not speak English.  In the end one of them sent me to GFay for free.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/btheeverquestnewbiezone.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sylvius>Sylvius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Proud Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#000000>(6/4/01 9:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p069.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=692.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How was your Weekend?</span><hr size=1> I didn't play much this weekend.

the lowlight of my weekend was the fact that he gave me a loc for the GMs corpse, and not a landmark.  not having used loc that much, i am not very good at it.  by the time i got there (near the ruins, why didnt he just say so?) the GMs corpse was decayed and gone.  /em makes the pac-man dying sound.<br>

A friend met me in Iceclad where I'd been spending most of 35 killing Snow Cougars with little trouble.  As soon as he gets there 3 of the cats jump me (never happened before, always got them 1 on 1).  He can't manage them, which seems odd now that I think about it, him being an Enchanter.  He says to run but to where?  The pirates do nothing against the cats.  I run and he finally stops them but they'll be coming at us again soon.  I Feign Death just as the cats come for us.  He Gates (back to Freeport) just in time.  To add insult to more injury, just as I got my health back up to full (I was down to just a bub), someone trains 3 more cats into the pirate camp and they tackle me because I was still sitting.  I finally managed to get another FD to work but not without them taking me down to 2 bubs again.  It was a bad night.<br>
<br>
Saturday - I moved over to Kunark and the Overthere where my friend wanted to group.  I had a real bad experience there with that group.  First, my friend begs me to come to his newly formed group.  More like &quot;Come here now, we need you, hurry!&quot; while I was selling, had to bank, med and heal myself from some things I was doing while waiting for him to log on.  Second, I get there and as soon as I get in the group the Cleric starts badmouth insulting me because of the surname I chose.  Sure, beg me to help you then insult me.  Third, there were too many people in the party to see any decent XP.  Fourth, free for all looting with a constant stream of pulls, I got relatively no loot.  Any other time I'd have left that group right at the begining but my friend ask me to stay.  It wasn't a happy experience and I won't be doing that again any time soon.<br>

Things have quietened down in loio so I'm back there hunting. I got two levels, now 27, in what was a long weekend here in NZ.<br>
<br>
Most of my huntings been at the Sarnak fort, either a platform group or the alcove inside. One group on the platform was going well, I was bringing in a constant stream of singles, when the shaman (healer) decided he'd start pulling. To my surprise the leader agreed. I was a little miffed &amp; worried my great pulling wasn't so great <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I politely excused myself shortly thereafter as it was late &amp; having my healer pull always worries me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Next two groups were both in the alcove, still pulling. This time a couple of people said they thought I was doing a great job pulling which cheered me up no end (what can I say, we ogres just want to be loved <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Sadly the last group came to a messy end when we were jumped after a big fight by a revealer, a revenant and some friends. My bods lying in the fort near the back door now... oh well, kept my level &amp; some of the others made it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also won a roll on sarnak offhand claw (Eitchata?). Not a great weapon, but that and kodiak claws will make for great twinking weapons once the Kerrans are out.<br>

<br>
I smithed a bit and finally got some skill raises.  I was really getting frustrated, stuck at 175 skill level with over 60 combines prior to this weekend and no skill raise.  I finally got a point after another 30 or so combines, then two combines later got another point, then the next morning making small boots for my cleric (after failing twice the night before and running out of padding) I got a third skill raise!  Wahoo!!  I had someone offer me a bunch of plat to make some cultural armor, but its such a pain, Im not sure you could pay me enough to make it for a stranger (besides, the first set of enchanted armor is for me to wear!). <br>
<br>
I brewed a bit and got a few more skill raises making Faydwer Shakers.  I also had a friend make some Wus armor for my monk in exchange for a stack of mana, 2 stacks of silk and 4 stacks of heady kiolas.  He only failed once, and got two skill raises.  <br>
<br>
I had a couple of really great groups in DL, and got 2 yellow bubs on Saturday and then a whole level in one sitting Sunday!  Also met some people I would definitely like to hunt with again (and one I wouldnt).  A friend of a friend gave me Boon of the Garou and now Im only about half a level from scribing it!<br>

I had monday off and to make it a really long weekend I took friday off as well.... which meant a lot of EQ time around some other activities outside :-)<br>
<br>
Thursday: Went on my first plane trip ever. We went up to Hate to clear first floor and then planned on going to 2nd floor on friday. The most annoying thing was: WAITING. First you have to wait till everyone was in SRo (our designated spot to gather) to be ported up. Me as a Druid had to gather a lot of ppl all over Norrath. You don't know how often I had to go to DL to pick up ppl who &quot;just logged in&quot;. Anyway, we travelled up to hate and about 5 seconds later I'm dead already :-)) Seems that there were some roamers around and got aggroed :-)) Well, I got a rez and then waited again untill we finally started. The raid itself was smooth and I even gained about one orange bubble of exp. We were divided up in groups and it seems that our monk (with epic) a ranger (with epic) and another ranger (without epic) had enough dmg power to outdmg the other groups :-)) I even won a Blue Diamond in a roll which was later turned into a nice BD Bracelet :-)<br>
<br>
Friday: 2nd floor of hate. It took even longer and we had to pause a few times. Around 7 am my time I had to leave and go to bed but they took down Innoruuk later. Too bad I missed that. On the plus side: I won the roll for some nice Druid Gloves :-)<br>
<br>
Saturday: Completed the 3rd and 4th Prayer Shawl Quest in Thurgadin. I now have a nice range item (+3 wis, +20 mana) and also the 4th shawl. However, the 5th will take some time as I need a lot of Crystaline Silk Threads which I can only get in Velketors Labyrinth. This will be a pain :-(<br>
<br>
Sunday: Not much of EQ as I was invited to a friend. After I came back I decided to start on Fletching, since I need it for one of the Shawls anyway. While I was working on it I talked a bit with Bashim (Balkins Alter Ego) and made him envious at my process. Took me only about an hour or so to master it to 102 :-)<br>
<br>
Monday: I started in a Duo Group in DL with a warrior of my guild. After he had to leave I went to Surefall Glade and continued to fletch. Put in another 1.5 hours and now I'm up to 188 fletching. A bit more and I can make a bow for Balkin :-) After that I went to LoIO and hunted some Bloodgills untill I finally dinged to 49. Went off to LS to pick up my spells and scribed them. And then I finally was able to cast Skin Like Nature on me. This was like a Dream come true. I remembered when I was a young Druid in Misty Thicket aroudn Level 3 or 4 and that great looking Druid casted SLN on me. I thought I was invincible and ever since then wanted to have that spell myself :-) Now my next goal is to reach 50 finally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
