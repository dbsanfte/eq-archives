<br>
I just read another thread with questions about hotkeys. I noticed that not everyone is aware of how powerfull hotkey's are. I have a few I use here and then and they made my life much easier. I'm sure some others have them as well, so what great hotkeys did you invent which saves you time or do a neat little trick? Let's gather the ideas here and I think everyone could learn a few nice things. I'll start with some (no I did not invent all of them, some are &quot;stolen&quot; from other posts)  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The pulling hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is an easy one and I'm pretty sure most of the pullers have them. it mostly looks like<br>
<br>
/g Incoming %T<br>
<br>
The trick here is the %T, which is replaced by the name of the NPC/MoB you will bring back. I love that extra information to maybe mem a quick spell or prepare for another strategy. Of course the text can be altered to make the incoming message more funnier. However, some ppl don't like that and want to stick to the plain Inc. Up to the puller :-)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The spell effect hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Some spells can aid if casted at the correct time, but be dangerous if casted at the wrong time. For example: fearing a snared mob makes it easy, but fearing a non snared mob might be tricky since the feared creature runs away at full pace and might pull the melee's into trouble. So to cast fear one should wait till the mob is snared. To ease the communication you can use a hotkey when the effect has hit. For example:<br>
<br>
/g ##### %T snared #####<br>
<br>
I use the &quot;#####&quot; before and after the msg to get the attention in the fight spam. I don't take chances there :-)) Of course I can only use the key when I see that the spell has landed. Otherwise the fear caster might launch his spell too early. Other spells where this is especially usefull is mez's from Enchanters. It should tell the rest of the group what Mob NOT to attack :-))<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The assist hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
/assist is a very usefull command. It assures everyone is fighting the same creature and not breaking the mez of the Enchies. Normally one melee (most of the times a warrior) is the designated main tank (or MA for Main Assist) and everyone should use him as a reference. Now to not always have to target him and use /assist you can make a hotkey for it. A lot of people use<br>
<br>
/assist %T<br>
<br>
to assist the current target. However, often it is tricky to target the MA, especially in big raids where the MA is in another group. I therefore tend more to<br>
<br>
/assist name <br>
<br>
e.g. if Balkin is the MA you use<br>
<br>
/assist Balkin<br>
<br>
This will switch your target to whoever target Balkin has at the moment. Quite usefull for all involved in a bigger fight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The healing hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Clerics often use that method. The reason is to avoid double heals and to calm the warriors. A spell like &quot;Complete Healing&quot; needs 10 seconds to be casted. If the backup healer jumps in too early there and casts Superior Healing or similar, the group has waisted mana. So what they do is something like<br>
<br>
/g Incoming Complete Healing for %T<br>
/cast 1<br>
<br>
The first is the message showing what the target is, the second line will cast the spell in slot number 1 (top spell slot). Of course the number and text can be adopted to your setting. In addition you could add &quot;/sit off&quot; to make sure you are standing and &quot;/book 1&quot; or &quot;/sit on&quot; to sit down to meditate again. One click to stand up, inform the rest of the party, cast the heal and sit down again... quite neat isn't it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The &quot;Oh my god I'm going to die&quot; hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We all know the situation, you pull too much or get jumped while low on health/mana. The MoB kills us and we have no clue where the corpse is. This hotkey will save us from a lot of troubles:<br>
<br>
/loc<br>
/y<br>
/say Help me, I'm getting attacked by %T<br>
<br>
First line will show you the location of where you got attacked. This will help in finding the corpse again. Second line will cause you to yell for help, so others will see a line like &quot;Ellegon is yelling for help behind you&quot; and 3rd will inform the ones around you what is attacking you and killing you. A level 5 might not want to come to aid if a ghoul is attacking you and rather run for safety him/herself :-)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The spell training hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Casters should try to keep up the casting abilities at the max of their levels. Some abilities are less used than others unless in specific situations, so they quickly fall behind. To avoid that a lot of casters &quot;train&quot; the abilities by casting the same cheap spell over and over and over again. For example, minor healing (cheapest heal spell). Now to ease on the amount of clicking you can set up the following hotkey. Let's assume the spell to be used is mem'd in the bottom slot (slot  :<br>
<br>
/pause 80,/cast 8<br>
/pause 80,/cast 8<br>
/pause 80,/cast 8<br>
/pause 80,/cast 8<br>
/cast 8 (or /g Finished)<br>
<br>
The trick here is that the pause command is issued AFTER the 2nd command. The pause pauses for x * 10th second. That means /pause 10 would pause for 1 second. Based on the spell you will have to fiddle around a bit with the numbers as it will need time to cast the spell and then to gain control again. The only drawback is that in the case of a fizzle, you will still wait the normal time untill you can cast it again. The last line is either a /cast (being the 5th cast) or a msg to your group that the macro is finished. Since most of the times you will not be grouped while practising you will receive a msg like &quot;You are not in a group&quot;, but the only purpose is to be aware that you can click on the button again :-)) Practicing spells is a lot easier with that setup...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The TRAIN hotkey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Causing trains can happen. Every player caused one some day in his EQ life. It's part of the risk in certain zones. However, warning others is the least thing you can do. In the hectic of fleeing it's hard to type, so suggest the following hotkey:<br>
<br>
/shout ##### TRAIN TO xxx ZONE #####<br>
/ooc ##### TRAIN TO xxx ZONE #####<br>
/auct ##### TRAIN TO xxx ZONE #####<br>
/say if you can read this, the train is CLOSE !!!!!<br>
<br>
I'm against spam as everyone else, but there is such a thing as too less warning :-) The above hotkey will make sure you cover more than one channel (in case one is turned off) and also tell meditating casters if you are near :-) the xxx is replaced with the zone name to be specific.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The &quot;my spell book is organized hotkey&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The more in levels you raise, the fuller your spell book gets. Now every caster might have his own way of organizing spells. Mine works as follows (and is important for the hotkey to be efficient): On page 1/2 I have the &quot;Most Wanted&quot; spells. It's the spells I use a lot but don't have them mem'd all the time. Currently it holds spells such as Spirit of Wolf, Skin like Nature, Chloroplast, Greater Healing, Cure Disease, Cure Poison and so on. The next pages contain spells I use and switch around from time to time like root, Shield of Spikes, DoT's, DD's and so on. then I have a double page dedicated to all Resists (Poison, Fire, Disease etc.). Following is a double page for my single TP spells, then the Group TP spells, EVAC spells, Animal based and so on. As you can see I organized them by &quot;theme&quot; :-) Now I know my Single TP spells start on page 9, my group tp on page 11, Resists are on page 7, animal on 15 and so on. What I did is several hotkeys with different names:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> M.W (for Most wanted)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
/book 1<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> SelfTP</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
/book 9<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> GrpTP</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
/book 11 <br>
<br>
and so on. By clicking on that hotkey I will open the book at the appropriate page automatically. No more flipping back and forth to find the correct spell :-)<br>
<br>
Ok, what else do you have???<br>

/say &quot;You will squirm in fear little worm!&quot; or &quot;Die you gravy sucking pig!&quot; or &quot;In the name of Brell, %T must die!&quot; or &quot;All right, who ordered %T onna stick?&quot;<br>
/doability 1<br>
/loc<br>
<br>
This has the advantage of giving you a loc as you start your fight, and you may forget to do one later. Also, if you use one of the latter two /says or a variant thereof, folks know if you have the right mob targeted and can tell you if you don't notice. And yes, I do this too much. That's why I make a better healer.<br>
<br>
Also, having autoattack with a sense heading attached helps keep that skill maxed. Another good idea for fighter types is to attach sense heading to taunt, which cycles a little faster than kick/bash, so you can roughly see when you should have pushed it.<br>
<br>
The where key.<br>
<br>
/doabilty 1 (sense heading)<br>

<br>
This is my travelling essential for ALL characters. It's how I navigate. And it helps me learn to use both to get where I am going.<br>

/corpse<br>

So you can drag your corpse or someone else's to safety.<br>

Lately, I've been grouped with idiots. I've been running away from them when my health is low enough. They complained they missed the &quot;run&quot; in all the battlespam- which I understood, but wasn't inclined to type more while running.<br>

/g RUN DWARF RUN<br>
/g I highly reccomend that y'all come too.<br>
/g No more heals, because I am out of here!<br>
/g RUN RUN RUN!!<br>
<br>
This of course in areas where there is more distance between party and zone line should be followed with the Train key. And at later levels, should be replaced with an Evac key:<br>

Language<br>
1) I have hotkeys for the different langauges I know so I can move to the right hotkey bank and just hit a number and it'll switch to one of 13 different languages I currently know.<br>
<br>
/language 3<br>
<br>
Simple key, yet so useful.  Though sometimes its easier just to type /lan 3 at the command line.<br>
<br>
2)  Teaching.  Hot key spits out 3 lines of text to group-say for teaching a language to someone you are grouped with.  The pause is necessary to by-pass the anti-spam filter.  If you leave off the pause, your group member(s) will only see the first line.<br>
<br>
/g This is a group of words spoken in a langauge you might not<br>
/pause 10<br>
/g understand.  However, this should help you learn this language<br>
/pause 10<br>
/g Please let me know when you can understand and we will move onto another.<br>

SPELL CASTING<br>
Like the pet commands, I like to add a little RP stuff into some hotkeys.  Now, I don't hit them everytime, as the saying would get really old really fast, but every 5th use or something similar.  I normally cast with ALT-number.<br>
<br>
HEAL (starting from seated or standing, returns to meditate ... the pause-double-cast is fizzle insurance, spell seven is the heal spell of choice, the second pause is to allow enough time to finish casting before sitting)<br>
<br>
/sit off<br>
/say %t, turn away from sin and be faithful to Tunare!<br>
/pause 2, /cast 7<br>
/pause 50, /cast 7<br>
/book<br>
<br>
STRIKE (combat spell for pulling or just jeering the MoB while casting a DD, spell 1 is the DD of choice)<br>
<br>
/say May Brell burn you where you stand, %T!<br>
/cast 1<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
/say Cazic Thule grows weary of your existence, %T ... die!<br>
/cast 1<br>
<br>
OR<br>
(spell 1 is lifetap line)<br>
<br>
/say You have found disfavor with Innorruuk, %t, you're life is MINE!<br>
/cast 1<br>
<br>
ROOT-MEZ (Basic MoB control hotkey, spell 4 is root/mez, cast-pause-cast is fizzle insurance)<br>
<br>
/say Halt where you stand, %T!<br>
/pause 2, /cast 4<br>
/cast 4<br>
<br>
/say %t is being MEZmerized.  Do not engage until you are fully prepared.<br>
/pause 2, /cast 4<br>
/cast 4<br>
<br>
BUFF (basic buffs like shield or a skin, etc.  spell 8 is this spell)<br>
<br>
/say May Tunare protect you in your travels, %T.<br>
/pause 2, /cast 8<br>
/cast 8<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
/say May Innoruuk's hate flow through your body always, %T<br>
/pause 2, /cast 8<br>

My biggest problem are not the hotkeys themselves but how to organize them in the hotkey banks. For my mage I have spells, all the pet commands, assist key, help key, etc. They don't fit in the first bank and I find it difficult to switch between banks in midfight. For my enchie it's even worse - even more spells, assist key, help key, MEZmerising key, MOB is MEZzed key, etc. <br>
<br>
So how do you organize your hotkey banks and how do you switch most quickly. <br>

<br>
I group them by &quot;theme&quot; as well. For example, all my melee's have a fighting hotkey bank with all skills for fighting (like taunt, kick, mend, Flying Kick etc., depending on class). For my druid I have one bank for the spell book hotkeys, one bank for normal travel, one for casting etc. Swichting is easy by pressing SHIFT plus the number. E.g. SHIFT-1 is bank number one, SHIFT-2 is bank number 2 and so on.<br>
<br>
Another neat trick is going to the overlay screen, where you have 10 hotkey banks compared to the 6 in &quot;normal&quot; view. Now I fill up the bank there, giving me 10 possible hotkeys per &quot;theme&quot;. Now if I switch back to normal view, I only see 6 hotkeys, but all 10 are accessible with the number keys 1 to 0. For example: on my Druid I have in my &quot;general hotkey bank&quot; to hotkeys at spot 9 and 10. 9 is a &quot;/who all friend&quot; and 10 is &quot;/who all GUILD&quot;. So by pressing 9 it shows me all my friends who are online and pressing 0 shows all of my guild, even when I don't see the hotkey itself. I hope that makes sense :-)<br>

<br>
I have added some roleplaying touches to my pet command hot keys to add a little color and to be sure everyone knows what me and my pet are up to.<br>
<br>
I created a fishing hotkey that throws out my line and does sense heading three times.  Very helpful when medding (did this in Crushbone and caught some very nice Boar Carp...ummm, good eating!).<br>
<br>
I have a whole bank dedicated to my inventory slots, which allows quick access without going into the Persona screen.<br>
<br>
However, I have to say that the most important key that I have setup so far is the Assist Hotkey.  With a single click or keystroke, I target the doomed MOB, sic my pet onto it, and inform the group that my pet is on its way into the fray.  I think this helps to let the group know that I have my pet under control and that I am a contributing group member as well even when sitting with my nose in my book!<br>
<br>
Along the same lines, I want to create some spellcasting Hotkeys as well, to clearly communicate what I am nuking and when.  Plus from my understanding, if you are blinded you can still cast from a hotkey if you are already targeted.  I don't know if any MOBs cast blindness spells or not, but I know it happens in PvP from what I have read on various message boards.<br>
<br>
My problem is organizing all those hotkeys.  Does the Assist key go on the Pet Commands bank or the combat bank?  Where will I use it most?  Etc.  Its all personal preference, but it will take time to figure out what I am most comfortable with.<br>
<br>
A quick note to fellow newbies, you can switch between Hotkey banks with Shift and then the number of the hotkey bank that you want.  For example, your about to die so you want to switch to your corpse recovery hotkey bank.  You hit Shift-8 and switch to the bank with Corpse, Loc, Yell,  Hide/Sneak, etc on it and then Shift-1 to switch back to your combat bank once you have looted your corpse.<br>

<br>
my &quot;book&quot; hotkey:<br>
<br>
/doability 1  <br>
/doability 2  <br>
/book<br>
/em sits down, opens his book, and begins to meditate<br>
<br>
ability 1 =forage - if you get some food, you can put it away while you watch the blue line grow.  In emergencies, don't worry, you can swap spells with food in your hand<br>
ability 2 = sense heading - you can also work on sense heading while medding, did you know that?<br>
I make the last one long so the group knows I am a) regaining mana b) not able to see.<br>
<br>
I also have an /assist hotkey.  I use the function keys to select the person in the party, not reprogramming the hotkey.  I can also select a monster and use /assist to quickly target who he is hitting so I can damage shield or heal them.  /assist  is exactly the same as /assist %T<br>
<br>
On the Train! hotkey, I suggest one really long message with some caps, not multiple lines.  Folks in the zone appreciate a warning that stands out, but they won't appreciate being spammed, possibly scrolling other important messages out of their text box.<br>
<br>
mine is something like:<br>
<br>
/shout  TRAIN!  %T and %P buddies are after me! LOOKOUT!<br>
<br>
I once hunted with a ranger that had separate hotkeys depending on the con of the creature he was pulling.  Very nice.  Something like:<br>
/g Ho hum, another green %T<br>
/g Blue %T coming in<br>
/g Looks like an even fight with a %T<br>
/g Prepare for battle, a yellow %T incoming<br>
/g Stand up and unsheath your swords, an angry red %T is after me!<br>
<br>
I think he had actually made the more dangerous cons longer and longer lines (my example isn't like that), and kept all the %T near the end, so you could tell in a glance what and how dangerous the pull was.  I think he even had a multi-pull message, and a message (I never saw it, he was good!) if he got an overpull and was headed away from the group.<br>
<br>
I think the optimal sense heading training key is five lines of the following<br>
/pause 20, /doability 6<br>
<br>
I named mine Msens - it can block other hotkeys if it is still running (takes 10 seconds), so you don't want to do it when it isn't &quot;safe&quot; - for example use it on a boat, traveling, medding when no one is pulling.  I don't recommend this for kick or bash, for that reason - you can't stop the hotkey and get on to another hotkey when you need to.<br>

That is just WAY too much.  Shout is the channel used for announcing trains... if you have shouts turned off then that is the risk you are taking.  Could you imagine a zone like Crushbone, Unrest or Blackburrow if people used this hotkey?<br>
<br>
Also... if using a hotkey that says something in group... dont click it over and over.  Make it cast your spell multiple times to account for fizzles.  Its quite annoying to see this because you fizzle 4 times...<br>
