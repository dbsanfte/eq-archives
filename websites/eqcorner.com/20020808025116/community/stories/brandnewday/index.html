<b class="heading">A Brand New Day to be a PK…er PVPer…oh Whatever</b><br>

<i>by</i> Delrachnid
<br><br>
Pestilence rubbed his eyes slowly and outstretched his arms to shake off the cobwebs of a good night’s sleep. As his vision began to clear he took notice of his surroundings and smiled. War had been good to him. Through countless battles Pestilence amassed a desirable fortune. Trinkets of gold and platinum, weapons of steel, and armor of sturdy plate littered the bed chamber of this well known PVPer. Yawning, Pestilence began his day.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez opened his eyes warily and spread his toes in a morning stretch. As his vision began to clear he took a look at his surroundings and laughed. He made a mental note to himself to clear out the crap that his newest victim kept littered about their floor while selling the phat lewt to support his decadent lifestyle. Yawning and hawking up some phlegm, pHeAR M3Ez began his day.
<br><br>
Pestilence finished washing his face in the washbowl and looked around for something to wear. Deciding on a suitable array of armor and weapons he quickly got ready and started downstairs for the morning meal.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez spit in his hands and rubbed them under his arms and against his cheeks. Picking through the belongings of the recently killed he decided on a suitable colleague of mismatched armor, scratched his ass, and got a strange look on his face that could only mean he was hungry.
<br><br>
As Pestilence sat at the dining table a well groomed maid quietly brought her master a plate of warm pheasant and biscuits. Exchanging smiles and pleasantries, the maid then adjourned to the kitchen while Pestilence enjoyed his meal in solitude.
<br><br>

</NOSCRIPT> 
pHeAR M3Ez tossed his sword atop the table and looked around for someone to serve him. Remembering that he had tied up the maid the night before he grimaced as he realized there would be no meal for him in the coming minutes. Walking into the kitchen pHeAR M3Ez rummaged around until he found some cold pheasant and hard biscuits from the night before and pumped his fist in the air at his incredible luck.
<br><br>
Pestilence walked out to the stables to saddle his mount and prepare for the daily ride. There were rumors of conflict in the next town and he knew that his talents could be well used. While the use of his skills would be reward enough, Pestilence also knew that there would be plenty of opportunity for personal wealth as well.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez silently cursed to himself as he walked into the stables and saw that it was filled with mules. “Friggen minerz,” he muttered to himself as he walked back out. Deciding that he would have to “acquire” a mount as soon as possible, pHeAR M3Ez headed towards the next town while keeping his eyes peeled at the forest area on either side of the path.
<br><br>
As Pestilence rode along the path he began to hear the distant clang of steel against steel. Hastening his mount’s gallop Pestilence rode hard towards the sound of battle while carefully unsheathing his sword in anticipation. Over the next hill he saw his target. A small band of brigands were harassing a local merchant and his family and their escort of armed guards. Clenching his teeth, Pestilence let loose a battle cry as the brigands turned to meet his onrush.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez sat quietly in the brush examining his prey. The innocent maiden was hunched over delicately picking some flowers for a bouquet she was arranging. With her back to the brush she had no idea what was about to occur. Her mount was tied to a tree nearby grazing on the long grass by his hooves. “Welcum 2 deth fagot!” pHeAR M3Ez yelled while smiling inwardly at his amazing wit. “Oh my God nooooo!” the maiden screamed as she threw the flowers at her attacker and watched as they bounced harmlessly off his armor. Before she was cut down the last thing she heard was maniacal laughter. As he untied her mount he took the time to quickly look through her belongings only to find absolutely nothing. Brainstorming, pHeAR M3Ez decided he would have to kill at least seven more innocent maidens to increase his chances of finding some phat lewt.
<br><br>
Pestilence brilliantly parried and countered the swords of at least three combatants. For every sword thrust and spell cast Pestilence had three counter attacks at his disposal. Within minutes of the battle the brigands knew that they were not going to survive this encounter. One even had intelligence enough to begin running. Beneath his visor, Pestilence smiled.
<br><br>
As pHeAR M3Ez rode atop his new mount a distinct sound could be heard, barely audible, from over the next hill. As he debated whether to explore the nature of these sounds a man in battered armor, with one arm hacked off, both eyes gouged, and limping noticeably came stumbling over the hill. Looking around to see if this man’s attacker was following pHeAR M3Ez cautiously approached the walking corpse. “H-h-hello? Is….is someone…there?” the ruin of the man gurgled forward, “P-p-please help…me…”
<br><br>
“Yes, sum1 is heere,” pHeAR M3Ez began quietly, “And it’s called ur deth!” With stunning skill pHeAR M3Ez quickly disabled the mostly dead and horribly disfigured opponent by touching him on the shoulder with his index finger and shoving him to the ground. The man, fumbling on the grass like an inverted turtle, just moaned and quietly passed away. Standing over his latest victim in triumph, pHeAR M3Ez smiled.
<br><br>
Pestilence looked over the battle grounds as the dust cleared. The bodies of many brigands lay at his feet. The merchant and his family slowly appeared from their hiding places and risked smiles. Pestilence returned their warmth as he began to pick through the belongings of the intended thieves. “Thank the gods you came,” the merchant offered graciously. “Tis nothing,” Pestilence responded, “I live for the thrill of battle.” Making sure everyone was okay and tying up some articles of miscellaneous thieves’ items, Pestilence rode off towards the clearing where he thought he saw one of the thieves run from the battle.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez cackled wildly as he stripped the corpse of its armor and trinkets. Like a whirling dervish he picked the body clean in the matter of seconds. Reaching back for his mount he grabbed the reigns and began to tie most of the phat lewt to his pack. Within one of the bags pHeAR M3Ez found a small mining pick. “Wtf…gay crap!” he yelled as he kicked the corpse for good measure. Concentrating on getting, as much into his bags as possible, he had not heard the horse’s hooves that were coming up over the hill.
<br><br>
“You there! Stop that looting and turn to face me…slowly.” Pestilence cried forth. Frozen in his tracks, pHeAR M3Ez quickly tried to think of a way out of this. Not knowing what he faced he decided the best course of action was to listen and try to explain his presence here while scooping out this threat. Talking was not his greatest strong point, but it did stall a bit.
<br><br>
“ok…ok…wait a sec…uh…huh?” pHeAR M3Ez spoke confidently.
<br><br>
“What right do you have looting the victim of one of my battles?” Pestilence asked.
<br><br>
“bs…i kil’d him. he ran at me and i had to fight bravely to suceed…i almost died!”
<br><br>
Believing this person to be one of those gay roleplayurz, pHeAR M3Ez decided that he would act first. Reaching into his pockets slowly he drew out a small vial and threw it at Pestilence. Pestilence, seeing it coming, made his horse sidestep and watched as the vial flew by. pHeAR M3Ez gasped in anger as his hands began to glow. “phear my magik deth wussy!”
<br><br>
As the bolts of energy sailed towards Pestilence he grinned. The energy dissipated from striking his protective shield and Pestilence unsheathed his sword and charged towards this rabid corpse looter. He would pay for attacking him…with his life.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez gasped as he watched his magic sizzle. Unsheathing a sword of his own he dug his feet in the dirt and prepared to meet the onrush of the man on the horse. Then an incredible idea entered his mind. Turning his back on the rider, pHeAR M3Ez bent over, spread his legs, and began to rapidly churning dirt through them like a dog digging for a bone.
<br><br>
Pestilence threw up his hands but it was too late. “Gah! What the hell kind of attack is this?! Fight like a man you bastard!”
<br><br>
“hahahaha…eat durt and lik it!”
<br><br>
Blindly galloping forward, Pestilence swung wildly astray as he rode past pHeAR M3Ez. PHeAR M3Ez laughed and saw his moment of opportunity. Striding forward he jumped onto the back of Pestilence’s mount and through his arms around the rider’s neck.
<br><br>
“Oh no you don’t…this isn’t going to be that easy!” Pestilence screamed as he lurched back and pushed hard using the horse’s neck as leverage. Both Pestilence and pHeAR M3Ez flew backwards off the mount with Pestilence landing atop of his attacker’s chest.
<br><br>
“ahhhhhh…get off me u fagot. i don’t lik that stuff!”
<br><br>
“Shut up you idiot. Hold still and stop squirming and I’ll make this fast. Prepare to die!”
<br><br>
As Pestilence rolled forward in a somersault and got to his feet, pHeAR M3Ez rolled backwards and got to his. The two combatants circled each other, blades drawn, staring into the eyes of the other, waiting for the first move. Pestilence took a step forward attempting to strike high. pHeAR M3Ez saw it coming and quickly ducked underneath the blow while stabbing upwards with his own blade. Only Pestilence’s instinct for battle kept him alive, but the quickness of pHeAR M3Ez counter left an open gash along Pestilence’s forearm.
<br><br>
“hahahaha! Eat mi steael looser!” pHeAR M3Ez taunted wittingly.
<br><br>
“Damnit!” Pestilence responded while grabbing his arm.
<br><br>
pHeAR M3Ez took this opportunity to make a second attack. Pestilence met the charge and the two locked blades. Pushing against each other they tested the other’s strength until Pestilence found the weakness and shoved his foe to the right while following with a viscous sword attack with the blunt side of his weapon. The blow struck pHeAR M3Ez on the right side of his rib cage and left him howling in pain.
<br><br>
“u stupid ass..wtf kind of attak was that?!”
<br><br>
“One that leaves you crippled.”
<br><br>
“screw u jerkoff!”
<br><br>
Pestilence and pHeAR M3Ez circled each other again. Pestilence looked over his opponent and saw him dipping slightly from his previous attack. Smiling, Pestilence knew of at least three attacks that would end this in the matter of seconds. Just as he was about to strike he noticed pHeAR M3Ez’s body began to glow. Pestilence watched as pHeAR M3Ez darted toward his mount, grabbed whatever bags he could, and turned to laugh. Before Pestilence could react in time the man before him disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
“Damn you coward! Come back and fight!” Pestilence screamed. But it was too late. pHeAR M3Ez had fled.
<br><br>
Appearing beside the bed where he had started the day pHeAR M3Ez grimaced as he rubbed his side and dropped the bags of phat lewt he had managed to take. As he lay on the bed he quietly thought about the man he had faced just moments earlier. Reaching in his pocket he pulled out a small orb, which he had stolen from his foe while they were grappling. pHeAR M3Ez knew it would lead him to the bastards’ house and vowed that tomorrow he would have to pay a visit with a few of his friends. “i hope he has a maid…” pHeAR M3Ez mused to himself, “The one i kil’d earlier didn’t have nothing…cheap ho!” pHeAR M3Ez laughed out loud and promised that tomorrow would be a brand new day.
<br><br>
Pestilence swore to himself all the way home. How could he let that fool get away. Handing his mount to the stable boy he walked glumly up to his bedchamber and dropped his new belongings from the day in a pile in the corner. Lying on the bed he quietly thought about the man he had faced earlier. Then he smiled. Knowing that the idiot stole his orb and letting him do it made Pestilence sure that he would be seeing him again. “I hope he brings friends…” Pestilence mused to himself; “Just one bastard isn’t enough of a fight for me.” Pestilence chuckled and promised that tomorrow would be a brand new day.
