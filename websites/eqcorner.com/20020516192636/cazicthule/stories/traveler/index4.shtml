<b class="heading">The Bad Night</b><br>
(Part 4 of The Traveler)<br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
Freeport, like any other large city had its mixture of good and bad. There were areas that the citizens didn’t go at night. Oddly, the Militia House was one of those places. Whatever plots and schemes the Militia hatched could be done in the private security of the brick building by the West Gate. It was out of this building that several cloaked figures slipped into the night. The platinum pieces that they had been recently paid were neatly tucked in their clothes, bound so that they would not make any noise. This would be their last night in Freeport. Nowhere in the city would be safe after their next act.
<br><br>
Analiea paced of the hallways of the temple, some inner sense of danger driving her on. Jimmu was right, even the citizenry of the town were nervous. Of course, no one stepped forward with information, that was normally how things went in this town. Analiea sighed, she supposed she should be used to it.
<br><br>
She walked onto one of the small terraces overlooking the garden, nodding at the fully armored sentry who acknowledged her presence abruptly. Analiea was clearly not a paladin of the temple. Instead of the full plate, she wore only steel bracers, chestplate and boots. The rest of her body was covered with the blackened armor that could be bought at the bazaar. This gave her a unique distinction from the others in the temple. Perhaps it was her lack of familiarity with the grounds however, that caused her attention to snap at the movement by the gate. “What was that?” she asked the guard.
<br><br>
He squinted and said, “I don’t see anything unusual. A rat?”
<br><br>

Analiea shook her head, frowning. “I’m not sure,” she turned and went back into the temple, her inner alarm bells ringing louder than before. Sharp eyes flew to every shadow, trying to detect any movement, yet feeling ridiculous as she did so. This place was heavily guarded. Who could get in?” Still, she thought she saw something towards one of the side rooms. It was the room that Brother Lourious preferred to pray. He was a travelling cleric who occasionally adventured with Analiea and Worlik. Like Analiea, he felt obligated to come back to Freeport to face the on-coming onslaught. He gave solace to many in the city.
<br><br>
Deciding that Analiea could use a little spiritual healing, she went to the room and opened the door. Her mind registered the disarray of the room immediately, and without hesitation she called for help. Help would come, but not in time to save the life of the Holy Man they found on the floor near his praying mat. His neck had been slit.
<br><br>
In the Jade Tiger Den, the inn besides Tassel’s Tavern, Anarchy sat up abruptly when the previously invisible pet that Loralie had summoned began to roar and attack the assassin that had a knife to the magician’s chest. Loralie snapped awake at the same time, instinctively twisting towards Anarchy. The cut that should have gone through her heart dug its way across her upper arm and back instead. The wound was painful, but not fatal. Anarchy began to cast a spell as Loralie scrambled over him. She screamed when she ran right into a second man who was getting ready to attack Anarchy. She called the pet on to the second man, when a third man, who had lingered in the shadows jumped and attacked the pet. The second man grabbed Loralie’s wrists in an attempt to stop her from casting. In the meantime, the third assassin dispatched the pet, then spun to engage the angered dark elf.
<br><br>
Loralie, feeling weak, could not seem to break the assassins hold on her wrist. At the same time, he could not seem to get himself in a position to do more damage to her. He didn’t dare let go of her hands. They were supposed to have killed the couple in their sleep, and were unprepared for a fight against users of the arcane. In the meantime, the man who had actually stabbed Loralie was standing dazed where the spell had hit him. Anarchy commanded abruptly, “Attack.” With that the assassin turned and jumped on his companion who was still feeling scalded from dealing with the pet. While those two were distracted, Anarchy spun and cast again. Suddenly the man holding Loralie felt his chest and throat constrict. With his concentration broken slightly, Loralie twisted free and immediately began casting a spell of her own at the two assassins that were fighting each other. A column bathed them both. The one assassin left who was unaffected by one of Anarchy’s spell went after the enchanter, hoping to break Anarchy’s hold on the other man. He was stopped, however, by a rain of swords that ripped into him and his charmed companion. Screaming, the cloaked man decided that flight was his best alternative, but the fireball that hit him as he ran for the window killed him before he could escape.
<br><br>
In the meantime, the third assassin went to grab Loralie again. Before he could, however, he was lifted off the ground and began spinning in place. He went in circles in a dizzying pace, while his face began to turn blue from lack of oxygen. He would die that way, the last vision he would see was the room moving before his eyes. This left both spell casters to face the remaining attacker who was only now beginning to shake off the enchanter’s charm. When he came to his senses to find the pair looking at him, he screamed and ran towards the window. In his confused state, he forgot they were on the third floor of the building. Normally, he could have handled the fall safely, but in his befuddled, injured state, he landed head first - hard. By the time anyone could reach him, he was dead.
<br><br>
Loralie collapsed back on the bed, feeling lightheaded. “Anarchy,” she said faintly, “I think you better find a healer.” With that she passed out.
<br><br>
Worlik sat in Tassel’s Tavern - still - not hearing the commotion upstairs. Empty mugs surrounded him as he stared ahead, apparently in a drunken haze. Across from him sat a barbarian with an equal number of empty mugs. The barbarian seemed a little worse off, however, for he was visibly swaying in his chair. By this time, all of the occupants of the bar were passing coins, betting who would go down first. Dwarves were known for their tolerance for alcohol, but the barbarian had much more body mass. The odds seemed fairly even. Worlik, with a smile, picked up the next mug and downed its contents. With satisfaction he wiped the foam off of his red beard and slammed the mug back onto the table. The Barbarian went to do the same, but when he tilted the mug back, he found his massive form tilting back with it. With a thud the huge man landed, causing everyone in the bar to cheer or boo, depending on how they bet. At that moment, a man ran into the bar yelling, “There’s a fight next door! They’re throwing men outta windows!”
<br><br>
Worlik was quick to stand, pretty sure that he knew at least two of the participants. As he did so, a man who had been quietly watching the contest stepped forward, a dagger appearing in his hand. He went to stab the dwarf from behind with the poisoned blade, but the little man spun and grabbed the assassin’s wrist in a crushing blow. The speed of his reaction was unbelievable, particularly given the amount of alcohol he had just consumed. Worlik grinned and said, “What do I have here?”
<br><br>
For a moment the two just stared at each other, then the silent man pulled out a matching weapon from his other sleeve. With surprising strength Worlik twisted the man’s hand which was still holding the knife into his abdomen. The wound and the poison killed him instantly. 
<br><br>
There were other stops for the assassins that night. Some were to the holes of dirty men who gave information to the paladins. One stop, however, would rock the city. It is enough to say that the Bard Jimmu and his entire family slept well during the night, unaware of what happened to them.
