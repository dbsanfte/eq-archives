<br><br>
She laid under a tree in West Commons, watching the sun set over the hills afar. She was going to camp there for the night, she knew it wasn’t exactly a safe place to camp as Dark Elf are very active around that area but she decided to stay there. She wasn’t exactly a traveler as this is as far as she had been from her home, the High Elf city, Takish-Hiz. She would rather call herself an adventurer, venturing to dangerous places and doing what ever she could to help her kind. "You’re still young, my child." Her wizard guild master would say, "Don’t let your courage fool you, be wise." Said her dad, but she was out here to prove them wrong.
<br><br>
As you’d expect from a High Elf, she was very pretty and she managed to keep her white robe sparkling to match her beauty even after a day’s travel. Opening her backpack she took out a small bag of iron rations and began to have her dinner. "Guarding you Master" a voice carried by the wind came from behind a mound. She quickly pulled out her dagger and crept towards the direction of the sound. With a bag of food in one hand and a dagger on the other she crawled up a hilltop to spy on the intruders. To her surprise a swirl of air rushed towards her, hitting her hard. She got on her feet quickly only to be faced with an air elemental and it’s master a Dark Elf magician. She considered the Dark Elf to be a bit more powerful than she was but being a High Elf, her pride prevented her from running.
<br><br>
The two adventurer’s eyes filled with hatred for one another. She knew that she could not win over the evil magician and the air elemental but she was determined to take him down with her. The great city, it’s people and his father came into mind and she admired the blood red sky one for the last time. Of cause she didn’t want to die, she loved her life but it was too late to run now.

She quickly got to work, she chanted at the elemental while trying to ignore the pain from the elemental’s attack and the burnt caused by the magician’s fire bolt. After being interrupted numerous times she got a spell off, rooting the elemental to a fixed spot. She quickly moved back leaving the angry pet’s gushing punches behind. Aiming at the Dark Elf she began her offensive spells throwing at him the best she’s got. After being torched, frozen and shocked the Dark Elf knew he could not out damage the wizard, at least not with sorcery. Knowing a wizard’s weakness he engaged his enemy with his fine steel staff.
<br><br>
‘Thump’ a sound of thunder shook the very ground the stood on. ‘Thump!’ the sound got closer. The two engaged magic user ignored the sound, trying to concentrate on what could be their last battle but the elemental noticed the massive figure behind a dozen tree tops. "Master, Master! A hill giant!" the Air elemental spoke with a cool breeze. The two Elves’ gaze met again but this time it’s not with hatred but with fear. They stood no chance against the huge warrior even if they were fit not to mention the way they were then, both half dead and out of mana.
<br><br>
The giant slammed down on the elemental, which was dispatched immediately. They both ran as fast as their feet would carry them, but they were no match for the Giant’s long legs. The Dark Elf leaned towards his bitter enemy and asked in Elvish, "You got any thing to get US out of this mess?"
<br><br>
The honorable Elf responded naturally, "I got my teacher’s spell book with me, it might have something in there." It was after she answered that she realised that she was talking to a Dark Elf, but being in the emergency that she was in, she left the thought of alarm in her head.
<br><br>
"’K, I’ll distract the Giant while you meditate and look for something to get us out of here. Deal?" the male Elf asked in mistrust. He would not trust a High Elf in a million years but that was the only solution he could think of at that very moment.
<br><br>
She could think of no other ways to live but to work with him. She was willing to die from fighting a Dark Elf but dying in a Giant’s path seemed such a waist of life to her. "Deal." She answered. She ran to tree, away from the Dark Elf and the Giant, then sat down and began to rummage through her master’s spell book looking for the group portal spell that she knew existed. A thought came into her head, she could meditate now and just gate, leaving the Dark Elf behind but she quickly dismissed the thought. Her father looked upon honor very strongly and being brought up by her father she had the same view as him. She would stick to the promise, what ever it takes. He taunted the giant away from her and ran round in circles desperately trying to get away from the raging Giant. ‘Please let me live to see another day.’ He prayed to no god in particular, he didn’t care which as long as it gets him out alive. Tunare looked down upon the Dark Elf, a mockery of what she had created. Affection grew in her, after all they still originated from her blood. She decided to help him, she did intend to help her very noble child in the first place anyway.
<br><br>
The High Elf looked through the book and found the two portals known by the Elves at that time. The Commons Gate, which would be too close from where they were to get away from the Giant and the Tarkish Gate, which was later renamed the Ro gate. She scanned through the words, memorising it. ‘It is too complicated for you to learn now, may be when you’re older my child.’ Her guild master spoke, but she was renowned by her intelligent, which was the very reason her master accepted her in the first place.
<br><br>
"Hey!" She shouted to the magician, who surprisingly had managed to avoid the Hill Giant. "Come quick I’m ready." He, delighted to hear her comment ran towards her with the giant closely pursuing behind him. "I hope this works!" was her last comment and with her chant and hand movements they disappeared, leaving the angry Giant to pick on some less unfortunate soul.
<br><br>
The light around them dimmed. "Quick! Hide." She whispered to him desperately. He did as he was told, as he was disorientated and didn’t know where he had been transport to, he couldn’t see what bad hiding could do anyway. Footsteps sounded as the metal boots trotted on the grass. A High Elf Guard appeared from the thick forest. The guard was a new recruit, from the latest recruitment campaign set up by King Thex in preparation on the crisis that they were going to have. He did not see the black figure of the Dark Elf as he had ran and hid inside the nearest bush to the ruin so he only saw the white figure of the female Elf.
<br><br>
He bowed respectfully, "Hail, Princess."
<br><br>
"Hail, honorable knight." She responded.
<br><br>
"The General told me to bring word upon your arrival to see him and Master Flamesiege immediately." The soldier said hastily as if he was afraid that the princess would disappear before he could send the word. "And he told me to escort you to the city, just in case of any trouble."
<br><br>
‘Ack!’ she thought to herself, ‘This must be about Mater Flame’s spell book. Good thing I borrowed it though.’ Although she knew she would have to face his father at the end of the day but she couldn’t do it then. She had to get the Dark Elf out of the forest as soon as possible especially with the number of good rangers scouting around. "Guard the portal!" she raised her voice and ordered sounding frightened, "I was attacked by a band of Dark Elves in the commons and I gated back. However there are wizards in that group and they might come through. I’ll go to my farther on my own."
<br><br>
"But," the knight began to speak his rejection to the idea.
<br><br>
"Sh." The princess silenced him, " What if Dark Elf spies ports in now? Do you accept full responsibility?" with that the princess went into the forest, behind trees, leaving the young guard behind to wonder what he should do.
<br><br>
Her head worked fast for the plan to get the Dark Elf out. A blue hand grabbed her by the shoulder. "You are the princess?" High Elf being his race’s bitter enemy, made intelligence about the Elves circulate back in Neriak and he had heard an awful lot of about the princess of Takish-Hiz back in the Dark Elf Taverns.
<br><br>
"Yep." was the answer but she wasn’t exactly a princess as the King wasn’t her father, her father was the General of The Elven army, the brother of the King. She was given the title Princess by the residents of the High Elf and Wood Elf cities, may be because King Thex had no children then but the main reason was because King Thex treated her as if she was his own. She had been called princess since she could remember so she had came to accept being called a princess. "That was lucky, if we met the old guards back there they’d have taken me to my dad surely." She said to the Dark Elf as if still reluctant to the last situation. Her mother was killed from giving birth to her and so she was brought up by her dad, a paladin and general so from when she was small she had been playing with people from the barrack. A lot of guards were like uncles to her, they watched her grow up and because they knew her to be mischievous they would have took her back especially after her stealing her master’s spell book. Although renowned to her fun loving ways, she was also well loved by people who knew her and the elven population mostly because of her nice personality but also because of her high charisma, often being described to being the most beautiful of all Elves.
<br><br>
"You trying to get me killed?!" The Dark Elf was furious, being ported into the great Elven forest wasn’t exactly getting out of trouble for him but he did see how the High Elf tried to protect him, he wasn’t really angry but it was a way to let his worries show.
<br><br>
"Calm down I’ll get you back to the commons alive, I believe this to be part of our deal." She looked around sharply knowing a ranger could just appear from anywhere in this forest, a sense of insecurity covered her and from this sprung an idea for her plan. "We need to change our robes over. They’ll know you’re a Dark Elf from a mile away if you’re wearing that black robe, not to mention close up."
<br><br>
"Wait!" The Dark Elf said urgently, feeling out of control, "What do you mean close up?! I want to know OUR plan, before I’m doing anything."
<br><br>
"You’re going to have to come into the Tree City with me. It’s the only way to get out of here safe ‘cause the rangers will never think of tracking for enemies in their own city." She explained. She was starting to get excited by the thought of the challenge ahead of them and it was this kind of attitude, which she had which made her so adventurous.
<br><br>
"This is crazy!"
<br><br>
"Crazy it may sound but it’ll work, trust me."
<br><br>
"Why should I?"
<br><br>
"Fine. If you don’t trust me, I’ll go now." She begun to walk away, leaving the Dark Elf on his own.
<br><br>
He chased behind her, "Where you going? You said you’re going to get me back to the Commons alive." He was starting to regret for getting a High Elf to help him and if he had known she was the princess he would never had asked.
<br><br>
She turned round to face him, "Then trust me." Her eyebrows rose and a playful grin appeared on her face. He looked into her deep ocean blue eyes, she was beautiful but at that moment he wasn’t in the mood to admire her looks. In the end he gave in to the princess. He had to, he needed her help.
<br><br>
She got behind a huge tree in the great forest. The Dark Elf quickly took off his black robe of Neriak and through it next to the tree. A white robe was thrown back in exchange, as he picked it up he could smell a scent of sweetness which freshened his mind. He stared at the tree trunk while he was putting the robe on but suddenly a sense of discomfort grew inside him, one which pulled his gaze away from the High Elf’s direction immediately.
<br><br>
The hood hung over his face, he kept his head low and climbed onto the massive platform, he made sure no one could see his complexion. The guards on the platform were just about to report back about a ‘Dark Elf’ wearing the robe of Neriak approaching when they saw the girl who wore the evil robe. She walked trough the pair of astonished guards gracefully with the white robe passing by unnoticed in the darkening sky. The citizens who saw the princess started to giggle amongst themselves, wondering what the princess was up to this time. She saw the Dark Elf who stood in a distance and begun her journey to the ladder nearest to the shores, what would later be the city of Freeport. She crossed several bridges hanging between platforms with him following closely behind. A huge crowd could be seen on the next platform on which the bank was erected, sad eyes from the crowd switched their attention to the dark robe. After seeing who wore the robe, grins diluted the heavy atmosphere. She ran across the platform to join her people.
<br><br>
"Nice dress you got there princess." Commented one of the Elves lightheartedly. They laughed. The princess was pleased with her handy work. She knew what had been just been revealed to these people and she hated to see her people sad.
<br><br>
"Felwithe!" a gentle tone passed trough the crowd, "Why are you wearing that disgusting robe?" The voice silenced the crowd and the sea of heads gave way to a middle age High Elf lady and the two High Elf guards who followed her.
<br><br>
The princess ran up and hugged the Queen, "Hi, Auntie."
<br><br>
The Queen beamed a warm smile to her beloved nephew then her face turned serious again, "Where’d you get that robe from?" sounding fed up.
<br><br>
"Well, I slain a Dark Elf necro in the Commons," the growing crowd cheered, "and I found this in his bag. Do you think it suits me?"
<br><br>
"No! I like your white one better. Anyway your uncle and your dad won’t be please when they find out you’ve been wearing that, so take it off before they see you." her features changed back to gentle.
<br><br>
The Dark Elf stood from afar, looking at his enemies and their city. Lights of flames grew in the darkness on every platform as the Wood Elves prepare for dinner. Torches were lit, illuminating the whole of the Tree City, spanning as far as his eyes could see. White marble towers taller than the tallest tree stood out in the horizon. Elves on every platform carried on their everyday business, children played with each other, wives lit up their cooking fire and men carried their preys back. A cool autumn breeze carrying red leaves from un-pine trees onto the orange ground. He took a deep breath, fresh air of the great pine forest and the scent of sweetness from her dress lingered in his mind. He looked at the Elven princess, he felt peaceful, tranquil. A feeling he had never felt, back in Neriak it was all about plots and schemes, not only to take down the High Elves and Wood Elves but also anyone in their own race who threatened their power. A mixed feeling grew within him.
<br><br>
She caught him with the corner of her eyes. "Yes, Auntie Jane. I’ll that it off before I get back to the palace and see my dad about master Flamesiege’s book." She promised the Queen hastily. "Well, See you tonight." She ran off in the Dark Elf’s direction.
<br><br>
"Hey! Fel where are you going now? It’s nearly dinnertime." The Queen exclaimed but it didn’t stop the princess. She ran up to the highest platform, where he was. She stopped next to him at the edge and admired the view.
<br><br>
"Beautiful, isn’t it." She said softly. He said nothing, he didn’t want to admit he liked the view of the Wood Elves’ nor did he want to admit liking the Princess. He looked at the High Elf, her blonde hair was lifted by the breeze, flickering yellow flames set on her light, soft skin and her ocean blue eyes filled with depth. She noticed his gaze upon her and turned to face him, to his surprise her red eyes was sparkling, filled with moist. A drop of tear ran down her cheek. She wiped it off with her hand "I, I’m sorry." The tone was soft, full of sadness. She tried to turn back to her normal and cheerful mood. "Come on lets go. I got things to do afterwards." He followed her silently.
<br><br>
They went through the city with out trouble. They were running through the forest when they heard a loud song like chant a head of them. The very soil they stood on seemed to move with the energy of life. The trees and plants all seemed to awake from their dormant state. They both felt the breath taking power of the chant. A light of flames gushed into the sky.
<br><br>
She carried on walking but faster wanting to get away as quick as possible. For she knew full well who were chanting. It was the great Elven druids, preying for rain, battling with Solusek Ro to keep the forest alive. The Dark Elf felt the sudden change of speed and direction and he knew it was some sort of secret of his enemies but he wasn’t tempted to find out what it was. He knew whoever it was behind those trees could crush him easily and he wasn’t prepared to risk his life.
<br><br>
Soon the sound of the chantings fainted behind them and claps of thunder rang over head. Rain poured down into the southeastern part of Tunaria but if was brief. She looked up at the now clear sky and sighed. They got to the edge of the East Commons and changed back to their own robes. There was a heavy atmosphere between them. He turned away from her silently and begun his journey back into the city he belonged to. "Know this, Dark Elf." he turned his head, "Next time we meet on the battle field, we will be enemies and I shall not tolerate you." Her tone was strong and bitter. She watched him who carried his burdened heart walk away, disappearing into the darkness of the Commons. She then turned back, to face her father, uncle and her master.
