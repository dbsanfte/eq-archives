<b class="heading">Fildaren's Gambit</b><br>

<i>by</i> Fildaren &amp; Vanalin - Erollisi Marr
<br><br>
Fildaren, son of Finarthin, shrugged his cloak tighter over his shoulders as the lingering cold of winter swept over him. He used his warm breath to blow life back into his aching fingers, all the while casting his blue eyed gaze across the tableau before him. Another two orcs had appeared from inside the tunnel to join the first who had stood guard there for the hour that Fildaren had studied him. The young High Elf’s sensitive ears could hear the loud crunch of the orcs’ boots as they stomped their way towards their companion. Crushbone orcs. By the grace of Tunare he hated Crushbone orcs. They were spreading like a plague across the Greater Faydark and the very thought of their presence here brought a bitter taste to his mouth.
<br><br>
The Crushbone’s hold on the area, like all things, had started small. Fildaren could remember back a few winters when the first reported sightings of orcs had filtered through to Felwithe. A Dwarven merchant by the name of Nib had braved the long road from the Butcherblock Mountains to ply his trade amongst the fair folk. Fildaren recalled the day when the small band of dwarves had arrived at the gates of the city, their leather armour scarred and tattered, their shiny axes clenched in fists of rage as they told of blue demons descending upon their caravan from the hills. A few hours and a few soothing ales later the dreaded truth was known. The children of Rallos Zek had come to the 1es’ ancient forest home.
<br><br>
Fildaren had heeded the signs well. He knew that this would not be a single incident. That was not the nature of the orcs. War and carnage were seeded into their every fibre. He knew that where a few led, more would surely follow. It was up to him, and those like him, to lead the charge against the shadow that would come. With this in mind Fildaren chose to align himself with the Magicians Guild. With time and patience his meager skills in the arcane arts had grown and blossomed. With a thought he could summon a loaf of bread or a fireball of pure destructive force. His apprenticeship completed, Fildaren had pledged allegiance to the Crusaders of the Soul. The Crusaders were a sacred society dedicated to promoting peace and justice and to stemming the flow of evil that ravaged Norrath. It was through this guild that the young High Elven mage saw his chance to turn his heartfelt beliefs into action. The creatures of darkness had to be stopped.
<br><br>
Fildaren’s premonitions had been realised. Reports of orc attacks had become more and more frequent, travellers found slaughtered, homes burned and looted until the legions of Crushbone were reported at the very steps of Felwithe and Kelethin. Now an unofficial war raged between the minions of Emperor Crushbone and the Elven folk, joined by the many races of Norrath that opposed the spread of the dark enemy. Bands of adventurers roamed the ancient forest seeking out the invaders and striking a blow any way that they knew. With blade, arrow, staff or spell they sought to drive the enemy from their door.

All these events had lead Fildaren to this moment. Crouched upon the frosty ground of a lonely knoll in the middle of Greater Faydark. Before him stood the entrance to Crushbone. Two huge bonfires blazed away defiantly along either side of the entrance and the huge black and blood crimson standard of the orcs fluttered in the icy breeze. The image before him was like a sharp slap in the face to the young elf. This was his home and he would rather kiss a troll than stand by while the forest was overrun with orcs. An ironic smile curved his lips as the mental imagery hit home. Kissing trolls was not one of his favourite pastimes. The smile soon faded as the deep, guttural voices of the orcs floated to him across the crisp air..
<br><br>
&quot;Hail Emperor Crush&quot; snarled the two newcomers in unison. Fildaren could hear the loud thud as they slammed their fists into their chests in salute. The guard who he had been studying returned the salute and stood to attention, or what Fildaren thought resembled attention.
<br><br>
&quot;Glory to the Emperor&quot; growled the guard in response. All three appeared to be centurions. Thick leather armour covered their muscular chest and shoulders. Their metal helmets were dented and tarnished and they each cradled a rusty short spear in their thick arms. Light cast from the bonfires caused shadows to form and shift across their dark blue skin and their beady red eyes shined with a predatorial fervor. Black lips curled over thick fangs as they struggled to mouth their words.
<br><br>
&quot;We have been sent to help guard. Scouts report elves nearby. Probably smelt foul elf stink.&quot; They each emitted a rumbling snarl which Fildaren could only guess as being laughter.
<br><br>
&quot;Need no help guarding. Elves are cowards. Cringing dogs.&quot; This brought another rumble of appreciation from the trio as they assumed their posts along the entrance.
<br><br>
Fildaren clenched his jaw involuntarily. &quot;We shall see who the cringing dogs are&quot; he mumbled ominously to himself. The waiting was over. He had been studying the entrance to learn of the movement of the guards but he had missed his chance to strike the solitary guard. He scrubbed his fingers through his snow white hair in annoyance and cursed his procrastination. He had to move before more reinforcements came.
<br><br>
As silently as he could he backed himself down the small incline until he was shielded from view. He drew himself up to his full height, his deep purple magician’s robe flowing majestically about him, and prepared to draw upon his power. He closed his eyes in concentration. He could feel his mana, his magical essence, flowing through him. It was the pool from which he drew his power and he sensed it now like a warmth smouldering deep within him. Fildaren began casting. He silently mouthed the ancient script that was branded into his memory. He had cast this spell a thousand times before and it came to him now as naturally as breathing. The warmth inside him became a heat. He could feel the power began to spread, rising up from deep inside him, coursing out along his limbs, as tangible as anything he had ever felt. With his hands Fildaren weaved the ancient magic symbols in the air that would conjure the spell. A crystalline green light emanated from his fingertips and he slowly wound a web of brightness about himself. He felt the light settle and bind around him like a cocoon. He had cast a shield spell. It was one of the first that he had ever learned and it had saved his life on more than one occasion already.
<br><br>
With his defences in place Fildaren turned his attention to offence. He drew a small, green gem from his pouch and held it in his upturned palm. Once again he cloaked himself in concentration. The burning symbols of ancient runes formed within his mind’s eye, the words of summoning formed upon his lips. He felt the familiar surge of power as he drew upon his mana and transformed knowledge into action. An emerald green circle of light formed about him, twinkling like a cluster of stars in a clear night sky. The light swirled and twisted, contracting upon itself until the outline of a shadowy blue figure was discernible. As the malachite gem in his hand slowly dissolved into nothingness the figure grew in depth and sharpness until the ethereal figure of a water elemental floated a few feet above the ground in front of the young mage. Fildaren sensed the mental link form between himself and the elemental.
<br><br>
&quot;Katarnik is yours to command, Master.&quot;
<br><br>
The words came to Fildaren not as sound, but rather as thought. Images formed within the elf’s mind. The crisp freshness of a mountain stream, the beauty of raindrops trickling amongst the leaves, the crushing power of an avalanche and the irrepressible majesty of an iceberg. The elemental was the embodiment of all these things and it was now Fildaren’s to command. He had summoned the creature from across the dimensional plane and bonded it to himself. His peers in the Magicians’ Guild flippantly referred to the elementals as ‘pets’. None took their pets for granted though. To each mage they were an aggressor and a protector in one. They were a formidable weapon in battle and a resilient shield in defence. Fildaren studied the elemental with satisfaction. A translucent blue torso with thick, powerful arms, it stoically awaited his command.
<br><br>
&quot;Hail Katarnik and well met. Time to steel yourself my watery friend. We have a fine battle before us and Crushbone orcs are our quarry.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;As you command, Master.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren drew his dagger from his belt and clutched it tightly to him. With all his magical skills there was still comfort in the feeling of cold steel in his hand. He slowly crawled back up to the crest of the knoll until the orc centurions were in clear view once again, the elemental drifting soundlessly behind him. He picked his target, the particularly unattractive centurion standing towards the front of the others, and prepared himself for battle. As his heart beat faster with anticipation, Fildaren could not suppress his thoughts of home. Not for the first time he considered that he might have been better off staying in the corner of the Travellers Home Inn, with a mug of fine ale in his hand, and a pretty eleven maiden on his arm, instead of scurrying about in the cold tangling with bloodthirsty orcs. He shrugged that thought off. Ideas like that did him no good now. He had made his decision to lead this life and he stood by it. If nothing else he could sleep at night knowing that he was making a difference. No matter how small his contribution he was still taking a stand against his people’s darkest foe.
<br><br>
He fixed his attention upon his target once more. The orc leaned against its spear, shifting its weight from one leg to the next, oblivious of Fildaren’s presence.
<br><br>
&quot;Let the festivities begin&quot; he muttered to himself as he began forming the runes of his next spell in his mind. He felt the rush of power through his body as he cast an outstretched hand towards his target. The unsuspecting orc suddenly burst into flame. Squealing in pain and terror, the orc dropped to the ground and flailed about in a crazed panic, vainly attempting to extinguish the flames with its hands. Its brutish colleagues gawped in stony silence as the centurion writhed in agony, seemingly too stunned to react. Fildaren took full advantage of the situation and fixed his gaze upon a second orc. The command passed from him to Katarnik in the twinkling of an eye.
<br><br>
&quot;Attack!&quot;
<br><br>
With alarming speed the elemental rotated in midair and sped towards the second orc, its large fists raised like battering rams. The orc could not even raise its spear before Katarnik slammed into it like a crashing wave, dealing it a flurry of sickening blows. The orc’s knees buckled and it unceremoniously slumped to the ground. The third centurion rallied in the face of this surprise attack and charged towards the elemental, its short spear lowered to impale the invader. Katarnik spun to face its attacker, just as the orc drove its spear into the elemental’s right side. A roar of pain echoed inside Fildaren’s mind, a reverberating howl of agony. The elemental slammed its left fist into the head of the centurion causing it to stumble backwards in a daze, leaving the spear deeply embedded in Katarnik’s torso. Then the elemental raised its hands in an imitation of Fildaren’s own arcane gesturing and a streaking flash of white like lightning encircled its body. The light took form and hurled towards the stumbling orc, a hail of razor sharp icicles tearing into the dark blue flesh of the Crushbone centurion. The orc let out a bark of pain as it was slammed backwards from the impact and lay twitching upon the ground, then fell deathly still.
<br><br>
Fildaren watched in astonishment as the elemental grasped the shaft of the spear in its powerful hands and, in one swift movement, drew the spear from its side and cast it to the ground. Fildaren gave a warm smile. The fearlessness of his elementals never ceased to amaze him. He had seen them do some amazing things in his time. He still sensed pain from the elemental though. The spear had pierced deeply and rest was required for Katarnik to regain its strength. Two of the orcs now laid prone upon the ground, one a gruesome tapestry of torn flesh and inky blood and the other a charred form still consumed with flickering flame. A sudden movement to the left caught Fildaren’s attention. The last remaining centurion was recovering from its daze and had regained its feet. He had to act quickly. Fildaren dashed towards the Crushbone entrance, fighting hard to hold his concentration as he formed the runes inside his mind. The orc raised its head towards the young mage, eyes widening in surprise then narrowing in scornful recognition.
<br><br>
&quot;High Elves! Filthy pig High Elves!&quot; bellowed the orc, its face contorted in a mask of hatred and contempt. ‘Guards! Guards!’
<br><br>
Fildaren’s steps faultered as three more orcs emerged from the shadowy tunnel of the Crushbone entrance. The mage’s heart sunk as he identified two huge legionnaires and between them, the unmistakable figure of an orc oracle. Fildaren cursed under his breath. He would have to plan his strategies a little better in the future, if indeed he had a future. He watched helplessly as the legionnaires drew their swords from their belts, their curved blades glinting menacingly in the light of the bonfires. The oracle weaved symbols in the air with its hands and a sickly green sphere of light enveloped it. Fildaren cursed again, much louder this time.
<br><br>
He gained his composure just soon enough to see the centurion rushing towards him with its spear lowered in attack. He felt his protective cocoon shudder as the lethal point of the spear deflected against his shield spell and the weapon rattled and fell from the orc’s grasp. The momentum of the centurion’s run sent him crashing into the High Elf and they both crumpled to the ground with a resounding thud. Fildaren grimaced as he felt the air rush from his lungs and he gasped vainly for breath. Pain arched through his body from the impact and his chest felt like it was going to collapse from the weight of the centurion pinning him to the ground. His magical buffer protected him from weapon attacks but not from the confines of gravity. The orc continued its vicious attack, repeatedly slamming its broad right fist into Fildaren’s jaw. The young mage’s head snapped back sharply from the impact but the shield spell held, cushioning him from the pain of the impact. Blow after blow weakened the shield and it was just a matter of time before the spell would fail and Fildaren’s defenses would be laid bare. He struggled to deny the panic that was creeping over him. He was made of sterner substance than this. He would not relinquish his life so easily.
<br><br>
&quot;Defend yourself you fool. Defend yourself.&quot; The thought forged itself inside his mind as blows continued to rain down upon from above. He had to repel his attacker. Through the mist of his pain he identified his salvation. The feeling of cold steel in his hand. Fildaren tightened his grip about the hilt of his dagger and brought it up between himself and the orc. With one powerful thrust he plunged the dagger into the centurion’s neck. The orc howled in agony and stumbled backwards, clutching at the dagger, coal black blood gushing from the wound. Fildaren rolled to his left and in one swift motion had regained his feet. Wasting no time he formed the runes inside his mind’s eye. He spoke the ancient commands and drew the ancient symbols in the air. A crimson corona formed about him, the hazy light hardening into dagger sharp points of energy that Fildaren hurled towards his stricken opponent. The centurion screamed in anguish as its body was torn to shreds by the magician’s attack. The orc was dead before it hit the ground.
<br><br>
Fildaren glanced back towards the entrance. Katarnik hovered between the two legionnaires, arms flailing as the elemental desperately attempted to deflect the arcing blows of the orcs’ scimitars. Behind the legionnaires’ merciless attack stood the oracle, long fingers of light streaking out from the sphere that surrounded it, each one striking Katarnik with a minute explosion of magical energy. Fildaren could sense his elemental’s strength failing, its lifeforce slowly fading away with each vicious blow. The young elf locked his gaze towards the legionnaire closest to him. He called upon his inner power, his brow furrowing with the effort to maintain his concentration. One again he formed the arcane runes inside his mind’s eye, each symbol a burning brand against a curtain of black. He once again conjured the crimson corona around him and hurled the burning points of energy towards his target. The spell struck the legionnaire with an audible blast of power. The massive orc gave a mournful howl and staggered backwards, fighting to keep its balance from the onslaught. Katarnik took its chance and enveloped itself in a streaking blanket of pure white light. Fildaren watched on as the hailstorm of ice struck the legionnaire at full force and sent the orc crashing to the ground, its leather armour and skin alike in tatters. Again an echo of agony reverberated inside the mage’s mind. He witnessed in horror as the second legionnaire plunged its sword deep into the center of the water elemental. Katarnik clutched weakly at the wrist of the legionnaire, vainly attempting to draw the blade out.
<br><br>
&quot;Forgive my failure, Master.&quot;
<br><br>
The words struck Fildaren harder than any blow the orcs could deal him. He watched in dismay as the figure of his pet faded away to nothingness. He felt a break in the bond between them, a violent snap like a rope stretched beyond its breaking point. He stretched out his mind but could no longer sense the presence of the elemental. A feeling of loss, of incompleteness overwhelmed him. When a pet died a small part of Fildaren always died with it, so strong was the bond that his magic formed between them.
<br><br>
&quot;Glory be to Felwithe. Glory be to the Crusaders.&quot;
<br><br>
Anger wracked Fildaren. He roared his challenge, stooped to retrieve his dagger from the centurion’s corpse, and rushed towards the remaining legionnaire. He formed the arcane runes inside his mind and wove the ancient symbols in the air. He looked deep inside himself to draw upon his magic core and found…nothing. Fildaren stopped dead in his tracks as his anger faded to alarm. His mana, the source of his powers was depleted. In the heat of battle he had unwittingly emptied his magical resevoir. He needed time to rest and replenish his strength but time was not something he had in abundance. He cast a concerned look towards the legionnaire. The mighty orc bore a mixed expression of apprehension and bewilderment which was slowly turning into one of cruel recogniton. The legionnaire gave Fildaren a malicious grin and marched confidently towards him. The young mage froze, his feet rooted in fear. The legionnaire stood head and shoulders above him and all he had to defend himself was his simple blade. He considered a hasty retreat but before he had a chance to act upon his decision he doubled over in agony, his stomach clamped is severe cramp. His skin suddenly burned with a violent fever and he broke out in a cold, clammy sweat. Crouching with one knee on the ground he lifted his head back towards the Crushbone entrance to see the legionnaire still striding towards him and, in the background, the oracle bathed in a splotchy, insipid light that stretched out its tendrils towards him. The dark arts. He tried to fight the revulsion and pain that flowed through him but it was too much for Fildaren to stand. The legionnaire finally reached him and coiled back its powerful sword arm to strike him. The blade of the scimitar came down upon Fildaren’s head with bone crushing force. He felt his protective shield shudder violently and, to his growing dismay, felt the spell fail as the protective cocoon around him unravelled.
<br><br>
&quot;So my time has come at last&quot; regretfully concluded Fildaren. He had considered that he would die this way but he didn’t believe it would be so soon. He had barely begun upon his path of retribution for his people and it was over before it ever really began. His fate decided, there was only one thing left to do. Take this bastard legionnaire down with him. From his crouched position he glanced up to see the orc wind its arm back in a final deathblow. Before it had the chance to complete its deed Fildaren hurled himself forward and plunged his dagger into the solid left leg of the centurion. The legionnaire bellowed in agony and clutched at the elven blade lodged deep within its flesh. Pain coursed through Fildaren’s head as he felt the orc slam the hilt of its sword against his temple. The world lurched and swayed around him and he felt what strength his legs held fail. He slumped to the ground and felt a dampness trickle across his eyes and blur his vision. He lifted a hand to his forehead and brought it back down, stained with the deep crimson of his lifeblood. Through the haze he saw the legionnaire pull his dagger from its leg, leaving a gaping wound behind. It cast the dagger to the ground disdainfully and limped towards him, its face a hideous expression of determination. A determination to see this elf dead. It stood over him for a moment, relishing in the young mage’s helplessness.
<br><br>
Fildaren was tired. So very tired. His body and soul ached but it would soon be over and sweet relief would be his. He watched with a sort of emotional detachment as the legionnaire raised its rusty blade above its head, taking pleasure in prolonging his agony, a spiteful grin revealing the joy it took in its undertaking. He could hear the mocking cackle of the oracle from somewhere in the haze beyond. Fildaren looked deep into the animalistic, red eyes of the orc and waited for the final blow that would end his all too short life. A blow that never came. An arrow sliced through the air and slammed into the sword arm of the legionnaire. As the creature squealed in surprise and agony the sword rattled from its grasp. A second arrow followed and embedded itself through the thick neck of the orc. In a reflex action its other hand clutched at the long wooden shaft, its eyes reeling madly in an attempt to identify its attacker. It had no chance. In the blink of an eye a third and final arrow arched through the air and finished with a loud thud in the broad chest of the Crushbone minion. The orc made a gruesome gurgling noise and a steady flow of black blood gushed from its mouth. It swayed unsteadily and slowly toppled to the ground with a crash. The oracle was no longer laughing and with great effort Fildaren tilted his gaze towards it. The orc was whipping its head from side to side trying to identify the unseen assailant. The last thing Fildaren saw was a bright blaze of light to his left. A luminous ball of flame soared through the air and slammed into the unsuspecting oracle. He watched as the dark figure was engulfed in purifying flame and tumbled to the cold earth. Then all he knew was darkness.
<br><br>
When Fildaren awoke he was swathed in a warm, comforting blanket of healing power. He could feel the stiffness in his limbs slowly fade and the dull, throbbing ache in his head lessen. Energy and warmth surged through him like the feeling of an open fire on a cold winter’s night. His vision cleared to be greeted by the beautiful, smiling face of an Elven maid. Deep brown eyes and fine features framed by chestnut hair.
<br><br>
&quot;Well, well.&quot; Her bell like voice chimed. &quot;What do we have here? Another caster in a dress just waiting to be rescued. Getting into trouble seems to be a common trait amongst you High Elves. You see Cirre? He’s not dead. You owe me a gold coin.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You’ll have to forgive Vanalin here, Brother.&quot; A deeper voice replied. &quot;Wood Elves are known to be a bit on the crude side but Vanalin gives the word a new meaning.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren drew himself up on his elbows and took in the scene around him. The ground was littered with the corpses of dead orcs and amongst the carnage stood the figures of, who he believed to be, his rescuers. A petite young Wood Elf maid leaned casually upon her longbow. The light of the still burning bonfires refelected brightly off her ringmail armor and a quiver of arrows was slung across her back. Next to her stood the more stately figure of a male High Elf. His long white robe marked with the emblem of the Wizard’s guild flowed to his ankles and he clutched a wooden casting staff proudly in his right hand. He shared Fildaren’s features in many ways. The slim frame, fine features and shock of white hair that identified male High Elves. He towered over his fiesty female companion.
<br><br>
&quot;Ha!&quot; shot back Vanalin. &quot;If I hadn’t come along you’d still be traipsing through the woods in that dress of yours hoping to Tunare that you didn’t run into an orc patrol. I’ve saved that pale Elven hide of yours more than once.&quot;
<br><br>
Cirre gave Vanalin a withering look. &quot;For the hundredth time it is a robe, not a dress. Where did you learn your manners? At an ogre street brawl?’ He let out a long suffering sigh. &quot;Yes its true, she has assisted me on the odd occasion and she refuses to let me forget it. Fair Vanalin here has the heart of a lioness, fights like a she-wolf and has just about all the subtlety of a hill giant.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren watched the exchange with increasing amusement. The diminuitive Wood Elf stared daggers at her companion. He chose this moment to intervene. He pulled himself to his feet and brushed himself down.
<br><br>
&quot;I must disagree, Brother. She looks as dainty as a butterfly and as beautiful as a rose to me.&quot;
<br><br>
Vanalin gave Fildaren a dazzling smile which quickly turned to a scowl as Cirre snorted loudly. &quot;I think I like this one, Cirre&quot; she said. &quot;We may have to add him to the party to make up for your crass behaviour.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Well we can’t let you have the monopoly on crass behaviour now can we, sweet lady?&quot; chuckled Cirre as he cast a sickeningly sweet smile towards Vanalin.
<br><br>
Suddenly Fildaren felt a rush of blood to his head. The ground seemed to rise up around him and he staggered forwards unable to maintain his balance. He almost fell to the ground before Vanalin rushed to his side and caught his arm. She gave him a sympatheitc smile and assisted him down to the ground.
<br><br>
&quot;Careful there handsome&quot; she said. &quot;I’ve cast some healing spells on you but you are a long way from healthy yet. You took quite a beating there.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren slowly rubbed his temple which seem to help him gain some clarity. He glanced up to see his new companions watching him patiently.
<br><br>
&quot;You must forgive my rudeness my friends. We have not met under the most appropriate of occasions.&quot; Fildaren gingerly lifted himself to his feet once again, being careful not to raise himself too quickly. He stooped and swept back his hand in as good an approximation of a bow as he could produce in his condition. &quot;I am Fildaren, of Felwithe. Scholar of the Guild of Magicicans and missionary for the Crusaders of the Soul.&quot;
<br><br>
The tall High Elf returned his greeting with flourishing sweep of his hand and an eloquent bow. The beautiful Wood Elf gave him a delicate curtsey, never once taking her piercing gaze from him.
<br><br>
&quot;I am Cirre, also of the great city of Felwithe. Scholar of the Wizards Guild and as yet unaligned with any of these new militia that seem to be sweeping our land. My hyperactive companion here is Vanalin of Kelethin. A ranger from amongst the ranks of Faydark’s Champions. We are at your service.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;It is I who should be at your service.&quot; Replied the young mage. &quot;I take it I have you to thank for my salvation. That skirmish did not go as I had planned.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You mean you had a plan?&quot; smirked Vanalin. &quot;Are all you High Elves such brilliant strategists? Rush the gates of Crushbone and hope to Tunare that you don’t get your head lopped off?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Lets not be so harsh Vanalin&quot; soothed Cirre. &quot;I think eagerness is our friend’s only failing here. When we came upon the battle you seemed to be doing quite well with those few centurions. Alas these orcs are like ants. There may be a few scuttling about on top but when you kick the anthill more swarm out. Fighting alone out here is a dangerous pastime my friend. You would do well to align yourself with some companionship.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren nodded in agreement. &quot;Indeed. I have learnt a rather painful lesson here. One I’ll not forget.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Well see that you don’t&quot; chirped Vanalin. &quot;It would be a shame to lose such a fine looking elf as yourself.&quot; Fildaren let out a shocked gasp as the petite Wood Elf reached over and slapped him on the behind. Vanalin gave him a mischevious wink and turned to go loot the orc corpses.
<br><br>
Fildaren turned his bewildered gaze on Cirre. &quot;Watch out for that one my friend.&quot; warned the wizard. &quot;She a siren. You’ll be ensnared by her song and before you know it you’ll be dashed upon the rocks.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I’ll make sure to give her a wide berth&quot; chuckled Fildaren. &quot;So what brings you this deep into the woods? This is more than a little way off the traveled highways.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;A lot further away than I wish to be. I was traveling along the Great Eastern Road towards Kelethin. I am to meet some associates of mine there. The Guild of Wizards is becoming increasingly concerned about the level of orc activity here in the Great Forest and they had planned a meeting to discuss their role in matters. I was travelling there with some of my guild brothers and sisters when we were attacked by a band of forest bandits. We managed to kill a few of them but the attack was swift and sudden and in the ensuing fight I got separated from my party. Each tree in this forsaken place looks the same to me. Luckily I crossed paths with the charming Vanalin here. She can identify each tree like it is a personal friend. She is leading me back to Kelethin now where I am hoping the rest of my party is waiting for me. We’ve been happily disposing of a few orc patrols along the way as well.&quot;
<br><br>
Fildaren heard Vanalin gag as she made her way back down from the Crushbone entrance. &quot;Phew! Smells liked fried orc up there. I don’t think I’ll be able to eat for a week. I got some nice loot from them though.&quot; She jingled her purse and it sung with the sweet sound of coins.
<br><br>
&quot;Well done.&quot; said Cirre. &quot;Single handedly assisting Emperor Crush in deplenishing his wealth. A fine and noble cause.&quot; All three chuckled at Cirre’s jest.
<br><br>
&quot;Well,&quot; concluded Vanalin &quot;if that is all then I guess we should be on our way before…&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;WATCH OUT!&quot;
<br><br>
Cirre barely had time to shout the warning before the orc legionnaire was amongst them, its curved blade slicing through the air in lethal arcs. The two High Elves dove to the ground in a desperate attempt to evade its dangerous reach. The air suddenly rung with the sound of steel on steel. Fildaren turned his gaze up from the ground to see Vanalin, her shining blade swirling before her in a flurry of strikes and parries, as she stood her ground against the legionnaire. If it wasn’t for the seriousness of the situation Fildaren almost could have laughed. The tiny, delicate frame of Vanalin was dwarfed by the massing hulk of the legionnaire and yet it was the orc that retreated as the young Wood Elf continued her assault. It was almost like a dance. Vanalin swung her blade through the air with a lethal precision, balanced on the balls of her feet as she turned and pirouetted. The orc legionnaire madly attempted to deflect her blade with his own but the tide of battle was against him. Vanalin spun and kicked the orc in the midriff causing it to stagger backwards. She thrust forward with her sword and pierced the orc through the left shoulder. The legionnaire let out a scream of pain but managed to shove Vanalin back off balance. The ranger was not discouraged and continued to push home her advantage, continuing her flurry of strokes against her wounded opponent.
<br><br>
&quot;Get back Vanalin. Let me cast&quot; shouted Cirre. Fildaren watched as the wizard surrounded himself with a red corona of power.
<br><br>
&quot;I have it under control&quot; came the irritable reply.
<br><br>
&quot;You are in the line of fire. Let me help.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I can handle it&quot; snapped Vanalin over the clash of swords.
<br><br>
Vanalin’s opponent made use of her temporary distraction and swung a vicious blow towards Vanalin’s neck, intent on relieving her of her head. The Wood Elf deftly ducked beneath it and delivered a swift kick to the right knee of the orc, sending it toppling off balance. Suddenly the air was ablaze with power and Fildaren watched as the red corona around Cirre compacted into a burning fireball and was sent hurtling towards the unfortunate legionnaire. It impacted in a fiery blaze. The orc bellowed and dropped to the ground writhing in pain as Vanalin leapt forward and repeatedly drove her sword through the chest of the fallen legionnaire until it struggled no longer. She immediately spun on her heel and stomped angrily towards Cirre.
<br><br>
&quot;You idiot! You almost killed me with that fireball. Look! You burnt my hair.&quot; She brandished a singed lock at the Wizard accusingly.
<br><br>
&quot;Well that’s gratitude for you&quot; replied Cirre calmly. &quot;I save your life and all I get is abuse.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Saved my life?&quot; fumed Vanalin. &quot;Saved my life!? I told you I had it under control. That orc had all the fencing skills of a three legged elephant. I was about to finish him off when you tried to roast the both of us.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;She’s actually madly in love with me&quot; confided Cirre to Fildaren. &quot;She is just having difficulty dealing with her emotions.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Madly in…I…you…&quot; stammered Vanalin, her anger strangling her words. She threw up her arms with a shriek of frustration and stormed off into the forest muttering about arrogant High Elf wizards.
<br><br>
&quot;I am sorry about that&quot; apologised Cirre. &quot;Sometimes I cannot resist.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;No need to apologise to me.&quot; said Fildaren. &quot;I would not provoke her so openly though my friend. She is an interesting mix. Both beautiful and dangerous. I would rather have her fighting with me than against me.&quot;
<br><br>
Cirre gave Fildaren a friendly slap on the back. &quot;It seems you hear that siren song already my friend.&quot; Fildaren rolled his eyes and grinned in mock amusement but he secretly considered that the wizard was not far from the truth.
<br><br>
&quot;I think the time has come to leave&quot; suggested Fildaren. &quot;We risk more orcs attacking if we remain here. I’ll have to return to Felwithe to report this encounter to the Crusaders hierarchy.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You should join us on our journey to Kelethin. You should rest there before you take the long road back home.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Thank you for your gracious invitation. I accept.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You will have to tell me more about these Crusaders along the way. I have heard a few reports about them. Do you think they would accept a wizard amongst their ranks?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I am sure they would welcome it.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Let us catch up with Vanalin then. She is just as likely to leave us stranded here.&quot; With that Cirre dashed off in the direction that the ranger had vanished.
<br><br>
Fildaren took a final moment to cast a glance over the scene about him. The bonfires still blazed away defiantly despite the fallen that scattered the ground. The standard of the Crushbone orcs still whipped and fluttered in the icy breeze as a symbol of rebellion against the Elven people. Fildaren realised that he had gained but a small victory in a raging battle. This was an undeclared war of attrition and it would only be complete when one solitary combatant was left standing. He spun on his heels, turning his back on Crushbone and followed Cirre into forest. Even as he walked away he felt deep within his bones that he would return.
