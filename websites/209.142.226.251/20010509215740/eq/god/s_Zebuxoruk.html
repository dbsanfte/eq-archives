        <p><b>Zebuxoruk is neither evil nor good. Legends place him as evil and 
          other legends untold place him on the side of good. To the other deities, 
          they ALL dislike him or simply couldn't care less. Zebuxoruk was at 
          some time in the form of mortal man and trod upon the surface of Norrath 
          after escaping the Plane of Justice or the Void. Mortality was either 
          something forced upon him or something he may have wished for. Zebuxoruk 
          is known as the Forsaken One, The Disgraced and other such names among 
          the pantheon of deities and heroes of the Outer Planes of Influence. 
          </b></p>
        <p><b>There is said to be a hidden city on Norrath that honor, not worship, 
          the 'Ungod', Zebuxoruk. Something not even he truly cares for. This 
          city has knowledge of his history both true and false and the community 
          is mostly comprised of fallen priests, shadowknight, paladins, any who 
          have been forsaken by thier deities and either seek a pathway back or 
          seek true neutrality among the planes and and understanding that the 
          deities are more mortal than they think. </b> </p>
