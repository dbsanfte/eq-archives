<TD WIDTH="77%">The Prince of Hate<BR>
<BR>
Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven race who regard him as their "Father." They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative force in the universe. Creativity born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it. It is only through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath.
