      <p><b>To begin the quest, talk with an NPC named <font color="#990099">Vilnius 
        the Small</font> in West Karana /loc (p170 x n6705). You discover that 
        he is waiting for some hired help that is late with an errand.</b> </p>
      <p><b>You say: 'hail Vilnius the Small' </b></p>
      <p><b>Vilnius the Small says, "Montys, just because I am short don't mean 
        I can't bounce your Wood Elf rump all over these hills. Now, do you have 
        something for me, or are you just in search of a rump bouncing?" </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "Why are you Vilnius the Small" </b></p>
      <p><b>Vilnius the Small says, "Vilnius, as I have told you. And yes, I am 
        not as large as most of my kin. But that is a blessing, because my brain 
        is bigger than that of an Erudite. I am a Facilitator. I.. facilitate.. 
        jobs. You want something somebody else has, I can arrange for you to have 
        it.. even if that something is their life. That is why I am here now, 
        waiting on something to turn up in my hands before I pass it on to my 
        client. Though I am a bit tired of waiting. My hired help seem to be delayed." 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "What delayed" </b></p>
      <p><b>Vilnius the Small says, "Yes, delayed. She has always been prompt 
        in the past, but she is several days overdue, and I know for a fact she 
        completed the job. I am beginning to wonder if something happened to her. 
        I would go check, but I run the risk of missing her if she shows up here." 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "I will help"</b></p>
      <p><b>Vilnius the Small says, "Oh, really? So you are willing to wade into 
        Qeynos to track Malka down, or to find out what happened to her? Willing 
        to take up the job if she failed? Willing to risk the wrath of the entire 
        Circle of Unseen Hands? Wonderful, I do so appreciate enthusiasm! Send 
        Malka back to me, or deliver the pouch she was hired to steal, either 
        one. If that works out, maybe we can do more business, I am always looking 
        for new people to help me... Facilitate." </b></p>
      <p><b>This leads you to Malka Rale, who can be found in the Qeynos Aquaducts.</b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "Hail Malka Rale" </b></p>
      <p><b>Malka Rale says, "Whew! I thought you were one of Hanns' goons. These 
        sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next. I really 
        wish I could get out of here." </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "I can help you get out of here" </b></p>
      <p><b>Malka Rale says, "Aye, Tyras, out of here. I am stuck until the heat 
        dies down. The Circle has all the exits covered, though they are not stupid 
        enough to send someone in here after me. I HOPE! In any case, I can't 
        get back out to West Karana to meet my contact, and I was paid quite a 
        lot of money to do this job. I hate having unfinished business." </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, "I can help you do the job" </b></p>
      <p><b>Malka Rale says, "Ok! I am trusting you. Take this pouch to Vilnius 
        in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one 
        of the bandit camps. Be careful, since he does not know you. Just give 
        him the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed. While you are doing that, 
        I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, 
        the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got 
        away. That means they won't be looking for me here" </b></p>
      <p><b>Handing the Pouch to Vilnius the Small will apparently get you started 
        on three jobs that need to be done... collecting sets for his clients 
        (NOTE: These subquests may not be needed to finish the quest) </b></p>

      <p><b>Job 1: Collect a set of 4 swords: Pain Bringer, Flesh Ripper, Mithral 
        Two-Hander, Giant Zwiehander. The reward is a Jagged Diamond Dagger (9/22 
        lore, magic) </b></p>
      <p><b>After completing the first job, he has this to say.... </b></p>
      <p><b>"Very good, though how you managed to lug around all these oversized 
        blades amazes me. I feel we can do business now, and Maltra still has 
        not shown up. Take this dagger. I had an old client who didn't, um.. pay.. 
        so this was extracted from him. Right after it was inserted in him. For 
        your next job, I need a collection of robes. The robe of the Ishva, some 
        Shining Metallic robes, an Oracle robe, and a Robe of the Kedge. I am 
        not even sure where all these come from, but they are on my list here, 
        and Rokyl is one of my best clients, so I figure that is your job." <br>
        (NOTE: Rokyl is apparently just part of the storyline and not a key npc 
        for the quest) </b></p>
      <p><b>Job 2: Collect s set of 4 robes: Robe of the Kedge, Robe of the Ishva, 
        Shiny Metalic Robe, Robe of the Oracle. The reward is a Cazic Dagger (8/23, 
        Magic, Effect: Shadow Vortex, No Drop Lore) </b></p>
      <p><b>Job 3: Collect a set of 4 rapiers: Burning Rapier, Eyerazia, Martune 
        Rapier, Well Balanced Rapier. The reward is information to further your 
        quest. </b></p>
      <p><b>After this point it appears you must give the Pouch over to another 
        NPC named Anson McBale, who is in the smuggler's camp in Highhold. This 
        will spawn an NPC named Stanos. Stanos gives you the most information 
        on finishing this quest and here is what is known so far about what he 
        needs to be done.</b></p>
      <p><b>Stanos wants 2 notes. The first note is found on Founy in Kaladim 
        and the second note is found on Tani N'Mak in Neriak 3rd Gate. You need 
        to pick pocket these notes and your skill should be over 200 before you 
        attempt it. Returning the notes to Stanos will result in him giving you 
        a new note to take to Eldreth in Lake Rathe. </b></p>
      <p><b>Eldrath will ask for some milk and 100 pp, when he then gives you 
        yet another note to take to Yendar Starpyre in Steamfont. </b></p>
      <p><b>Yendar will give you another note back and ask you to fetch the Book 
        of Souls. The book spawns in the chambers of the Maestro in the Plane 
        of Hate. </b></p>
      <p><b>Handing the book and the note back to Yendar will spawn a nasty mob 
        named Redux, so have some friends close to help you kill it. </b></p>
      <p><b>After this it seems there is another nasty mob to kill in Kithicor. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>The key thing to note here is that apparently Stanos will give you 
        all the information you need to finish this quest, so the above should 
        get you well on your way to completing this quest. </b></p>
