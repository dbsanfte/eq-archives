      <p><b>Talk to <font color="#990099">Kurron Ni</font>, who can be found near 
        the docks in the Outpost, in the OverThere. </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'hail Kurron Ni' </b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'Out of my way, stranger, I am on a delicate mission. 
        Interfere with my search and I shall relieve you of your head! Bother 
        me no more.</b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'What do you seek?' </b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'I have traveled here in hopes of finding a soul worthy 
        of assisting me in completing my mission.</b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'I am worthy'</b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'I doubt it, but I have been wrong before. Before I 
        share with you the details of my mission, however, you must first prove 
        your worthiness. Agreed? </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'Agreed' </b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'Very well then, my new friend. I have an acquaintance 
        that stands in need of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires the 
        breast, greaves and helm to complete his set. I also must pay back a loan 
        that has come due in the amount of 900 platinum. Return this to me and 
        I shall share with you my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that 
        will be earned at its completion. Show your face here without fulfilling 
        my request and I will offer you on the altar to Innoruuk himself. Be off!</b></p>
      <p><b>The Darkforge Armor items are all seperate quests. For the Breastplate 
        you need Decayed Mail and Decayed Breastplate, and 2 bars of enchanted 
        platinum. The two decayed pieces of armor are dropped in Temple of Cazic-Thule. 
        All you need to do it get a big group of people around the temple. Then 
        split up into groups and kill everything. You will probably come across 
        at least one decayed mail and decayed breastplate. The two bars of enchanter 
        platinum you can get from enchanters. For the Greaves you need Decayed 
        Left Legplate, Decayed Right Legplate, and two bricks of Melatite. The 
        decayed is dropped in Temple of Cazic-Thule and the Melatite is dropped 
        off of clockwords in Solusek A. People can be found selling them for 50pp. 
        For the Helm you need Decayed Helm, Decayed Visor, and two Freeport Militia 
        Helms. Freeport Militia Helms can be gotten rather easily by sneaking 
        into East Freeport and waiting for the guard that walks by the dock (provided 
        no one is camping the guards by the gates). He is pretty low, and is far 
        enough away from other guards that, as long as you have him darknessed 
        and kill fairly quickly, he won't aggro any others. </b></p>
      <p><b>Take the three items plus 900 platinum and give it to Kurron Ni. He 
        will respond: </b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'Well done, {your name} , I honestly didn't expect 
        to see you again. Yes, yes, this is perfect! My mission is nearly complete! 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'What mission?' </b></p>
      <p><b>Kurron Ni says 'My mission was to find a pathetic shadowknight and 
        bring him closer to Innoruuk. You volunteered. By exercising my superior 
        powers of persuasion, I have now taken from you a fine suit of armor and 
        enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping neither soberly nor alone 
        for quite some time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel 
        the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That 
        is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. 
        My mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall 
        take your head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal 
        rogues! </b></p>
      <p><b>At this point Kurron Ni will start attacking you. He is a level 55 
        rogue and resistant to all spells except for disease and poison DoTs, 
        and the Wizard Lure Spells. You will need around one group of level 50-60 
        players. You might want to bring more because you definitely do not want 
        to die on this part of the quest. </b></p>
      <p><b>Once killed, loot Letter to Duriek from his corpse. </b></p>
      <p><b>Duriek, I have searched this godless pit for what seems to be an eternity 
        with nothing to show for my efforts. I pray to Innoruuk that you have 
        made some breakthrough in your research. Please update me as to your progress. 
        In the meanwhile I have run into some unexpected expenses and will need 
        some funds to carry on. An additional ten thousand should suffice. Regards, 
        Karnett </b></p>

      <p><b>Now off we head to Paineel, to locate <font color="#990099">Duriek</font>. 
        He is upstairs in the tower, which looks out onto the newbie grounds. 
        Hand him the note and he will tell you the story of his apprentice. Ask 
        him "what apprentice" and he will give more background information. Next 
        tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you 
        to prove your worth. First he asks you to get him a Cough Elixer as he 
        is getting older and is in need of one. Head off to Neriak and talk to 
        Smaka who can be found in the Foreign Quarter. He can make special cures 
        but they do cost a lot. Pay him 1000pp and he will create the Cough Elixir 
        for you. </b></p>
      <p><b>Once you have obtained the Cough Elixir, hand it to Duriek and he 
        will inform you that he was trying to create the Corrupted Ghoulbane, 
        but alas he is in no condition to search out the necessary components 
        anymore. He needs you to first locate a Tome for him, which is dropped 
        by Ratman Guards who can be found in the Hole. Once you have obtained 
        the Tome, hand it to Duriek and he will then tell you the items you must 
        collect to create the Corrupted Ghoulbane. </b></p>
      <p><b>The four items he requires are the Blade of Abrogation which is obtained 
        through a quest in the Plane of Air, the Soul Leech which is dropped by 
        Cazic-Thule in the Plane of Fear, the Ghoulbane which is dropped off the 
        Shin Lord in Upper Guk and the Decrepit Sheath. To obtain the sheath, 
        head off to the Qeynos Sewers and locate Teydar who spawns in the middle 
        of the Blood Sabers lair. He will tell you that he is in need of some 
        items before he will hand over his loot. He would like you to bring him 
        a Decrepit Hide which are dropped by Ashenbone Drakes in the Plane of 
        Hate, a Drake Spine which is dropped by Rharzar, a rare spawning Drake 
        in the Rathe Mountains, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar. Handing all three 
        items to Teydar will result in the Decrepit Sheath. </b></p>

        to Lhranc who can be found in the City of Mist. Lhranc spawns in the middle 
        hut near all the Goo's at loc [0,0]. He will tell you that he is in need 
        of three items before he can forge the weapon for you, the Heart of an 
        Innocent, the Will of Innoruuk and the Head of the Valiant. </b></p>
      <p><b>Off to Toxxulia Forest to locate Knarthenne Skurle who spawns near 
        the docks. If you hail him, he will tell you that you do not have the 
        heart of an innocent. If you ask about the heart of an innocent, he will 
        hand you a soulcase and tells you to combine the soulcase with the heart 
        of someone who is pure. Now we head off to the Hole and head down to the 
        Jail Area. Locate Caradorn and he will give you a lot of background information. 
        Basically Caradorn just wants to be released from this hell and needs 
        you to locate the key for him. The key to Caradorn's cell can be found 
        on various Mimics who can be found past a secret door near the bank. Once 
        you hand Caradorn the key, Kyrenna will spawn and they both will attack 
        you. Loot Kyrenna's corpse and you will discover the Blood of Kyrenna 
        and the Heart of Kyrenna. Place the heart in the soulcase and hit combine, 
        it will become the Heart of an Innocent. </b></p>

        two different versions of Marl. The first will give you a quest and upon 
        completing it, will spawn the other Marl. To see if you have the correct 
        one, ask him "what prophecy". If it's the first Marl, you have to deliver 
        a letter to Gerot Kastane who can be found in Paineel. He will in turn 
        hand you back another item, which you hand back to Marl. You will gain 
        faction and the second Marl will spawn. </b></p>
      <p><b>Once you ask Marl, "what prophecy" he will give you a background story 
        on Glohnor and Lhranc. If you tell him "I will complete the ritual" he 
        will tell you that you need to create a Dark Shroud. To do this you will 
        need the blood of an innocent. Hand him the Blood of Kyrenna and he will 
        reward you with the Dark Shroud and will tell you to give this to Glohnor 
        who can be found in the Hole. Handing this item to Glohnor will cause 
        a Mummy of Glohnor to spawn, which you must kill. Loot the Mummy Wrappings 
        of Glohnor and the Head of Glohnor from the corpse. Return to Marl and 
        hand him the wrappings (again make sure it's the second Marl) and you
