        Najena. The third page is dropped off of a Bloodthirsty Ghoul within Lower 
        Guk. They are level 38-42 and spawn in the same room as the frenzies do.

        by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is contained in it. But you know 
        all these things, I am sure. Are you interested in obtaining the Element

          For these quests you need to have good faction with the Temple of Solusek

      <p><b>Jinalis Andir says 'Let us dispense with pleasantries, Ronaldor . 
        I am Jinalis, as you know. I imagine you want to control the Elements. 
        The Element of Water, which I possess, is the most powerful of the Elements. 
        With it you can control the water which falls from the Air, erodes the 
        Earth, and extinguishes Fire. It is a pity you do not focus on the Prime 
        Element, but if you wish to follow that fool Magi'kot to your doom, I 
        will not stop you. Bring me the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Water held 
        by the last of the Kedge, the Tears of Erolisi held by a dirty and rotten

        <li><b><a href="mage/Staff_of_Elemental_Mastery_Water.jpg">The Staff of 
          Elemental Mastery: Water</a> is dropped from Phinigel Autropos. The 
          Phinigel Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard. He can be taken out 
          by around 2-3 groups that work well together. He enjoys dispelling people 
          (usually your enduring breath.) He is also very difficult to kill because 
          he is guarded by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well. (Level 
          Needed) </b></li>
        <li><b><a href="mage/Tears_of_Erolisi.jpg">The Tears of Erolisi </a>are 
          dropped from Captian Rottgrime. He is a level 55 warrior that spawns 
          every 5 minutes at (p2471, p2138), near the outpost. He is said to be 
          100% magic resistant but this is not confirmed yet. He looks like an 
          Iksar Skeleton. Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just need lots of 
          tanks and clerics. Casters who have pets can help, but I don't think 
          any other spells will be useful against him. Pulling him from the outpost 
          in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon 
          was pulled along with him. He is usually standing near the southeast 
          corner of the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 
          50. You'll probably want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will 
          be much easier to do at night when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer 
          things to aggro). I don't know the exact method that was used however. 
          You will take a Venril Sathir faction hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently 
          it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful if you're used to being able 
          to travel there (evil races and classes, for example. </b></li>

          need lots of druids in that area with tracking. Once you have the three

        Fire, Water is comprised of it, and Earth cannot restrain it. Knowing 
        this, do you seek the Element of Wind? </b></p>

        an Elemental Binder, and a cloak fashioned from the feathers of a Pegusus.

        <li><b><a href="mage/Crown_of_Elemental_Mastery.jpg">The Crown of Elemental

          loot from Elemental Warriors in The Hole which is connect to Paineel. 
          They spawn near the entrance and are level 38-42. The Binder is a semi-common 
          drop. </b></li>
        <li><b>Finally, the <a href="mage/Pegasus_Feather_Cloak.jpg">Pegasus Feather 
          Cloak </a>is a very rare cloak from the Pegasus, Quillmane in South 
          Karanas. Its too bad that once you get the cloak you almost immediately 
          have to give it away because this cloak gives the effect of Levitation 
          when worn. Very useful. Quillmane is a rare spawn level 30 warrior, 
          but he can spawn anywhere in the zone. Most commonly he is found in 
          the interior of the zone, away from the zone walls, but he can be out 
          there, too. He wanders almost constantly, and is killed almost instantly 
          by any who see him (because the cloak you need for the quest is All/All 
          and has unlimited charges of Levitate...). This sucks, but it means 
          it takes some real effort to get the cloak. Because Quillmane spawns 
          randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is to go to South 
          Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can gather. 
          More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them 
          all. Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get 
          a SoW, and then run around the zone killing anything that wanders. Static 
          spawns like the Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside 
          splitpaw, need not be killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there 
          will always be people camping the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway). Anything 
          else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves, lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, 
          treants (although there is a faction issue there) -- is fair game. You 
          want five trackers with you because they can always home in on a mob 
          and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant something 
          shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it. And the reason 
          you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane 
          and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it 
          before it opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak! Even one 
          high-level tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp. (To put 
          it another way, one tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane 
          when he pops, is better than wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane 
          by yourself!) If you have even one or two ranger or druid friends who 
          can help, then your life will become immeasurably easier. Nevertheless, 
          even with your entire guild scouring the zone for Quillmane, expect 
          to spend at least several hours on getting the cloak. Give the three 
          items to Kihun Solstin in the Plane of Sky. </b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Once you have given him the three items you will receive the Element 
        of Wind. Also, the Master of Elements will spawn (Thought to spawn in 
        the middle of the Quest Room in Plane of Sky but unsure). Be sure to have 
        all four elements when you hand in the three items to Kihun. Give the 
        four elements to the Master of Elements and he will in return, give you 
        the scroll Summon Orb of Mastery. Scribe this spell and then summon your 
        epic weapon. It is very useful that this is a summon spell because if 
        you accidentally delete it or something happens to it, you just summon 
        it again. </b></p>
