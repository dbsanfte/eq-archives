      <p><b>Go to: A presence, is found in the Plane of Sky, and is the Place 
        Holder for the Fist of Air. The presence seems to have a respawn time 
        of approx 2 hours. He has the model of a shadowed man, but carries no 
        items, so is invisible apart from his name. </b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#CC0000">Note: The Charred Scale does not have to be 
        cycled through Kaiaren's true form before being given to 'a presence', 
        so this part can be skipped, but it is advisable to follow the story as 
        intended</font></b></p>
      <p><b>If you travel to sky, rather than paying for the keys, kill the fairies, 
        and have everyone loot a miniature sword. If you then kill the thunder 
        spirit princess, she will spawn Sirran the lunatic. When everyone hands 
        in the mini swords, you get a key of swords back. As with many guides 
        on Sky, do not speak, (use /ooc instead) as if anyone says the key word 
        [hassle] he will despawn. It is advisable not to buff people up until 
        you are in sky, as zoning up removes all buffs. Now find the 'soapdish 
        ashtray key platform thing' <font color="#000000">{Hotrod's term, not 
        mine}</font>, and drop the key on to use it, and it takes you to Dojorn 
        isle, where the presence and Gwan are. </b></p>
      <p><b>Hand the Presence the <font color="#0000CC">scale for the following</font>: 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>a presence says <font color="#000066">'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell 
        to the likes of you? I'm not surprised. So, I guess this means you're 
        here to challenge me. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time, but since you've 
        defeated my younger brother, I suppose I'm obligated. I'm ready when you 
        are, tell me when you're [prepared]. </font></b></p>
      <p><b>At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in the 
        same location as a Human monk dressed in shiverback named Gwan. Telling 
        him <font color="#0000FF">'I am prepared'</font> causes him to attack. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>He doesn't respond to hails, and is lvl 57. He procs Fist of Air, 
        which a lvl 57 resisted every proc with a MR of 120. </b></p>
      <p><b>He has approx 14khp, (parsed by Sister Loani of Druzzil Ro) hits for 
        165, and the Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, and like other 
        mobs of this level, enrages. </b></p>
      <p><b>Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and 
        gasps, <font color="#000066">'Trunt! Prepare yourself!' </font></b></p>
      <p><b>Tactics:The 'a presence' is on Dojorn's island, and has the look of 
        a shadowed man. Dojorn and the bladestorms, also on the island, have been 
        confirmed that they will not attack and help, or KS Gwan. </b></p>
      <p><b>You cannot trade (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) with the presence 
        while it is in the windmill. Give the scale to a presence, Gwan will spawn, 
        then pull him into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is recommended 
        to be done while in Melee range, i.e. walking backwards with him. Running 
        off will cause him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. 
        It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill. </b></p>
      <p><b>It is possible for 6 people to kill Gwan (although it is recommend 
        to have more, the original group was high 50's-60th lvl). Gwan is 100% 
        MR, and only the lure line spells seem to hit him. He also required melee 
        range for even Lure line to stick. </b></p>
      <p><b>He drops nothing but the Breath of Gwan, which id's as Item Lore: 
        Remains of the Fist of Air. </b></p>
      <p><b>Loot : Breath of Gwan ( hold )</b></p>
