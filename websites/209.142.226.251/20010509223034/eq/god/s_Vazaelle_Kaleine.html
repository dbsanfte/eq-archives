        <p><b>An Erudite by heritage, Vazaelle lived among those who were ousted 
          from Erudin for necromancy. During her lifetime, she was a dedicated 
          devout Cazicite, though a combination of religious zeal and prophetic 
          visions stripped from her any semblance of sanity. Lifted up by her 
          deity and given her own domain, the power of her madness shaped it into 
          the semblance of old Paineel after its destruction. From her realm, 
          Vazaelle occasionally foresees an event in the future of some unsuspecting 
          Norrathian citizen, whose life will change drastically when that event 
          occurs. Depending on the severity of Vazaelle's mental state during 
          the vision, that poor individual will know some degree of madness for 
          the rest of their days, suffering from the touch of Vazaelle the Mad.
