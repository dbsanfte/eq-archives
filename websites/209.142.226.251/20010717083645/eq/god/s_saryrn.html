        <p><b>Born a woman of striking beauty, she now rules the Demi-Plane of 
          Pain, a hot, damp and uncomfortable place with no flat surfaces on which 
          to walk. Instead the ground is cluttered with small, closely placed, 
          stalagmites of smooth obsidian. Saryrn busies herself by spending personal 
          time with those cursed enough to live in her realm. She captures and 
          torments her subjects mentally and physically and completely at random. 
          The length of their torment before she releases them again, is also 
          completely random - based mainly upon her whims. Those who fall into 
          her hands may suffer but a few moments or for months at a time. All 
          live with the fear that at any time, she may choose them as a partner</b>.
