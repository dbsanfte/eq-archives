        - Peg Leg in Butcherblock Mountains<br>
        - Iksar Outcast or Manslayer in the Field of Bones. </b></p>
      <p><b>Since different Shaman races have different dieties, and since I have 
        also read reports that these NPC's have different responses based on your 
        choosen religion, I am guessing that which NPC you initiate your quest 
        with may be tied to your race and diety. </b></p>
      <p><b>I will post the spoiler as it starts with Capt. Surestout as that 
        is the only one I have seen confirmation of so far. </b></p>
      <p><b>You begin in the Ocean of Tears with Capt Surestout. You have to kill 
        him to get a Lesser Spirit to spawn. The Lesser Spirit wants to know why 
        you killed Capt Surestout. Tell him he threatened you and say you wish 
        to know more and the Spirit will give you a Tiny Gem and have this to 
        say.</b></p>
      <p><b>"That is good, Player. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the 
        clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this 
        gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call 
        it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give 
        him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits." </b></p>
      <p><b>Next, you have to travel to North Freeport and find an NPC named Bondl 
        Felligan, who is hiding aat the openings to the sewers of Freeport. Give 
        Bondl Felligan the Tiny Gem and he will say how he could drink for a month 
        on what he can sell this gem for. Wait for him to move then follow him 
        out as he walks away. He will soon stop and then say to you.</b></p>
      <p><b>"What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? 
        Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? 
        Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy 
        some booze with this or not?" </b></p>
      <p><b>Tell him that he can buy booze, and Bondl will instantly sober up 
        and command you to follow him. </b></p>
      <p><b>Bondl leads you to the Jade Tiger's Inn, where upstairs you will find 
        a Greater Spirit waiting. (note: You can make this spirit spawn any time 
        by saying "You can buy booze" to Bondl). The Spirit asks if you follow 
        [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]. Your response is based on your race... 
        Justice=Barbarian, Hate=Ogre, Fear=Iksar and Hate=Troll. This spoiler 
        is based on a Barbarian players work so he picked Justice. </b></p>
      <p><b>After this, the Spirit directs you to go to the next room and talk 
        to another Greater Spirit there. This Spirit has much to say about [True 
        Spirits], [Wisps of Consciousness], and especially the [Heyokah]. Ask 
        about the [Heyokah], and the Spirit should give you another Gem. </b></p>
      <p><b>After you get the gem, tell the Spirit you will walk the path of the 
        Heyokah, and he will go into details about the process of becoming Heyokah, 
        and then despawn. </b></p>
      <p><b>"You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of the 
        Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn 
        patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great 
        water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies 
        and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and

      <p><b>When Ooglyn runs off she goes under the water to a spot near loc (n1600

        and another gem from another Greater Spirit. Abe talks to you about himself

        awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done.

        many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks 
        attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine 
        intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. 
        He is a paragon fro the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks

        another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival 
        will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present 
        to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling

        I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made 
        it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming 
        season as "none were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all 
        been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It 
        seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm

        shortly." </b></p>

      <p><b>"Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our 
        Queen Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching 
        the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized 
        the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search 
        for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal

        and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped 
        in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent 
        replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me

        is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National 
        Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their 
        masses, then I'll be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment 
        of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. 
        I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend 
        more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have 
        to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking

        the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. 
        We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge 
        to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that 
        the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and

        good measure a few pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond 
        the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon however is that the relationship 
        between the royal couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small 
        personal habits between the two that implied a separation of intimacy 
        during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade 
        of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as Kirn left the city only a few 
        weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak' Ashiir 
        reflected his despair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well 
        known fact that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his 
        illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this 
        point it would mean little to the public."</b></p>

        and place the order tomorrow." </b></p>
      <p><b>"2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. 
        Payment must be sent to the contract holder tomorrow." </b></p>
      <p><b>"3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen 
        finely made vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very 
        firm that I do this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill 
        the order, rumours abound of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane." </b></p>

        for the shortage of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should

        may have the intelligence to figure the symbolism." </b></p>
      <p><b>"5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church 
        as discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early 
        and discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. 
        I cannot decide whether to place it ourselves with the help of our Black 
        Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people 
        that know of this the better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant 
        who found it within the sheets." </b></p>
      <p><b>Book 3 </b></p>
      <p><b>"Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights 
        to practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kirn 
        was given the hallowed title that contact between the sexes became tolerated. 
        While Kirn wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve 
        many great victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle 
        known as the Bone Rending when Kirn lost his fabled whip, Thriaxis' Tail, 
        as was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only. 
        Before this battle many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a 
        leader and patriot for the people." </b></p>
      <p><b>"However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious 
        crusade and duty convinced the public that celibacy had its place in divinity 
        but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine 
        depicting Kirn among many women was constructed in remembrance of his 
        controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial 
        as it was lost far across the ocean among distant brothers on faith."

      <p><b>"Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we 
        thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of 
        affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making 
        it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place 
        of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect 
        the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old 
        temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what 
        you learn afterwards." </b></p>

        Kirn. The Icon is a simple spawn in a small bag inside the City of Mist 
        in the temple at loc apx -200, -350. It lies on the floor in a room of 
        the temple near where three Phantoms spawn. You can pull and clear all

        can see through Invis to Undead. </b></p>

        On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen

      <p><b>The Conclusion to the Quest</b></p>
      <p><b>Here are the final stages of this long involved quest</b></p>
      <p><b>Return the Engraved Ring to Neh`Ashiir in the City of Mist who will 
        then attack you. Kill her and loot her Diary.</b></p>
      <p><b>Neh`Ashiir's Diary: </b></p>
      <p><b>"..another bazaar.. I was asked to judge..wrestling contest. It must 
        have been the ten thousandth one... .week. Oh how I grow weary of...political 
        monotony. The earlier days were much..exciting, crusades against..unworthy 
        and smashing our opposition. Kirn's life must be epic indeed. He.. at 
        me again during.. match. Hmmmm." </b></p>
      <p><b>Take Neh' Ashiir's Diary to the Spirit Sentinael in the Emerald Jungle 
        (The one at loc p3685 x n640) who then has this to say.</b></p>
      <p><b>"So, the truth is found! Nak mourned over the loss of his child instead 
        of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High 
        Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect 
        of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the 
        key! If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and 
        the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find 
        the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the mantle's 
        foundation crumbling! Now, go!" </b></p>
      <p><b>Now you must find and kill the Iksar Child. The Iksar Child is found 
        on the Plane of Fear in the little pyramid at loc -630, -360. He is an 
        easy kill to anyone who is actually fighting in Fear. When you kill him, 
        loot the Tear off him and return it to Lord Rak' Ashiir back in the City 
        of Mist. </b></p>
      <p><b>Lord Rak' Ashiir has the following to say when given the Tear.</b></p>
      <p><b>"A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule 
        as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body 
        would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he 
        knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing 
        but [betrayal] and I immediately set out to abandon Cazic-Thule." </b></p>
      <p><b>and this about [betrayal].</b></p>
      <p><b>"Kirn was right. Before he left my side and that of Torsis he told 
        me I would have the blood of my own people upon my hands. How could I 
        be so foolish? Even my idiot wife could see the truth. How could I begin 
        to fathom the depth of a god's mind and the reasons for his actions? Kirn's 
        prophecy has come to light. You have shown me the truth and now I have 
        no more use for this. Take it away from me, please, and do with it what 
        you will. My father was as much a fool as I have been." </b></p>
      <p><b>Details are sketchy at this point, but either by dialog with him, 
        or by killing him you must obtain a Scale from him. He is the toughest 
        battle by far yet, and has a very nasty AE Fire spell. Some people have 
        reported that a good tactic is to send in Fire Elementals to do battle 
        with him, while everyone else stays out of the AE spell range. </b></p>

        rarely in need of melee power at this level. There is also the other items
