        <p><b>Morell-Thule,the Lord of Dreams rules the Demi-Plane of Dreams where 
          he is responsible for the rich texture of sleep visions. He creates, 
          animates and thoroughly enjoys the creatures who romp in his realm. 
          Though nearly seven feet tall and well built, he has handsome and youthful 
          features. His body habitus is that of a pure white centaur with the 
          tail of a lion. His silver hooves sparkle constantly because of the 
          unicorn-like horn on his brow. That horn is not made of hair as with 
          most such protuberances, but is purely a thing of light. His long hair 
          grows down his spine and ends in a glistening white mane which, with 
          his pale skin, set off his beautiful green eyes. </b></p>
