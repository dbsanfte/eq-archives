      <p><b>The quest starts in Lake Rathe where you must retrieve the Unjeweled 
        Dragon Head Hilt. It spawns underneath the three aviak spawn tower. If 
        you go straight down underwater (you will want endure breathing for this) 
        you will find a cave. Go through the cave and you will find a tower. The 
        Hilt is somewhere around here but the spawn location is unknown. Beware 
        that there are high level goblins there that can see invisibility. I speak 
        from experience. When going down here, it would be ideal to have about 
        two groups. One can be of high levels that take care of the goblins, and 
        the other can be people with Greater Light Stones, searching for the Hilt. 
        Next you need one diamond, one black sapphire, and one jacinth. These 
        drop in the planes, high level dungeons such as Karnor's Castle and Sebilis, 
        and can be bought for high prices in trading zones such as Greater Faydark. 
        Take the items to Wenden Blackhammer, a level 50 Dwarf in East Freeport. 
        He will give you back the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt. </b></p>

      <p><b>Next, retrieve the Damaged Dragon Head Hilt from the Chessboard in 
        Timorous Deep. The location is (n6500 x p3000). It spawns at the base 
        of the King Piece. Get a druid to come with you so that they can cast 
        SoW and Levitate. This way you won't have to swim the entire way or loose 
        levitate half way there and have to swim the rest of the way. Next, get 
        a Giant Sized Monocle from a Mountain Giant Patriarch in the Dreadlands 
        (rare drop). This is a level 47 mountain giant that spawns around the 
        giant fortress. One way to get them to spawn is to kill absolutely everything 
        in the fortress. The Patriarch should then spawn shortly. These Giants 
        has tons of hit points so be careful when killing them. Take the Monocle 
        to Mentrax Mountainbone in Frontier Mountains. He is at the giant fortress 
        at the very end of the mine. You might have to do a little bit of fighting 
        to get there. Mentrax will give you in return for the Monocle Rejesiam 
        Ore. Next, head to the Plane of Fear. You must loot the Ball of Everliving 
        Golem from either Fright, Terror, or Dread. These are all level 50-52 
        named golems and personal guards of Cazic-Thule. They spawn at the temple. 
        Take the Hilt, Ore, and Ball back to Wenden Blackhammer and he will give 
        you the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt. </b></p>

      <p><b>Now, go to The Freeport Authority and purchase a Keg of Vox Tail Ale. 
        This will cost only 150-200 platinum depending on your charisma. Now go 
        to Permafrost and kill An Ice Giant. Note: You must kill the Ice Giants 
        in Permafrost. These are level 38-42 and put up for a very hard fight. 
        They hit for over 100 damage rapidly and have tons of hitpoints. A major 
        pain in the butt. Sometimes they will drop A Block of Permafrost. This 
        is one of the items you need. While you are in Permafrost waiting for 
        one to spawn, kill some goblin wizards and loot the heart of frost. You 
        will need it later in the quest. Now, if you have high tinkering skill, 
        create two Rebreathers. If you don't have high tinkering skill, then you 
        can purchase these from players in Greater Faydark. They go for around 
        2-3k a piece. Turn in the items to Denken Strongpick. He can be found 
        on the aviak island in Ocean of Tears. He will give you the Ancient Sword 
        Blade.</b></p>

      <p><b>Go to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. Hail him and say I will 
        do you a favor. He gives you a wax sealed note. Take this note to Oknoggin 
        Stonesmasher, a named ogre in Feerrott. He can be found standing next 
        to the stone bridge. He will give you a Tiny Lute in return for the note. 
        Take the Lute back to Kargek in exchange for a Book. Take the book to 
        Tenal Redblade in East Karanas. He is at the very end of the canyon next 
        to the ramp to Highpass. Tenal will give you a Frozen War Totem. Give 
        him the Frozen War Totem and the Heart of Frost (That you looted while 
        hunting Ice Giants). He will give you the Totem of Fiery War. Now you 
        need a Red Scale. This is most commonly dropped by Lord Nagafen, a level 
        55 dragon in Nagafen's Lair but can also be found off of Zordakilicus 
        Ragefire in Solusek, or Talendor in Skyfire. Now find the Green Scale 
        from Severilous, a level 60 sarnak dragon in Emerald Jungle. This mean 
        dragon slashes for 500 and has a wolf pet to help him. You need many many 
        groups to kill this bad boy. Take the red scale, the green scale, and 
        the Totem of Fiery War and give them to Tenal. Tenal will give you the 
        Mark of the Sword. Now go to The Plane of Hate and kill the level 53 Follower 
        of Innoruuk, Maestro of Rancor. He can be found sitting at his piano. 
        Be careful with this guy because he has a 200 hp AOE lifetap spell. Loot 
        the Hand of Maestro from him. This is a rare drop so it might take a few 
        kills to get it. Turn in the Hand and the Mark of the Sword to Tenal for 
        a message to Kargek. Now go to The Plane of Air and kill The Spiroc Lord. 
        This is one of the hardest creatures in Plane of Air. It is level 63 and 
        looks like a rainbow aviak. Take the note and the Spiroc Wingblade looted 
        from the Spiroc Lord to Kargek. He will reward you will the Red Scabbard.
