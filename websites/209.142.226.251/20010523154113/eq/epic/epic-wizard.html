      <p><b>This quest is started by talking to Solomen within the Temple of Solusek 
        Ro. Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of the temple, 
        third floor, between the two undead knights, one room away from Lord Seafire. 
        The end result of the quest is not known, but it is thought to be a blunt 
        sceptre type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle effects 
        when held. This is the mother of all wizard quests. </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'hail Solomen' </b></p>
      <p><b>Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study 
        and scribe the history of magic in Norrath</b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'what history?' </b></p>
      <p><b>Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings 
        of magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been 
        very generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history 
        there is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. 
        I have seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest 
        to Solusek Ro become corrupted by their power. </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'what wizards?' </b></p>
      <p><b>Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things 
        right now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an 
        envelope that I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in 
        the wizard tower in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose 
        knowledge rivals my own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task? </b></p>
      <p><b>You say, 'I agree.' </b></p>
      <p><b>Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey. </b></p>
      <p><b>Solomen hands you a note that you must give to Camin. Now the real

        behind the first door upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent 
        or apprehensive to everyone. Hand him the note that was given to you by 
        Soloman and you will receive positive TrueSpirit faction. (Note: Since

        did not come cheaply. </b></p>

      <p><b>Camin says, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with 
        your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers 
        who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro 
        himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. 
        I know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. 
        He used to specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir 
        has been hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly be going 
        by another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue 
        my research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.' </b></p>
