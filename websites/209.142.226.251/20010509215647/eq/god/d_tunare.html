			Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's children. The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which
			they believe to be a living and breathing Being, to blossom and grow. Followers believe that the world of Norrath
			gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth. Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land, followers
			are paying homage and respect to The Mother of Their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them. Followers
			of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all it's forms. Many Druids, Rangers, and a great many Elves
			follow the ways of Tunare. </TD>
