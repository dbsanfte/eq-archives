        <p><b>Druzzil has white hair which is held back from her face by a massive 
          platinum crown with a single white gem that blazes like a brilliant 
          white star upon her brow. She is tall, youthful in appearance, with 
          a resemblance to Erudite in skin and body structure. The Demi-Plane 
          of Magic became the home of the goddess of magic. In its natural state, 
          it is an infinitely expansive plane of perfect white and unblemished 
          marble under a gray and featureless sky, though one would likely never 
          glimpse her plane in such a state. Through the will of Druzzil Ro, her 
          home takes the shape, form and features that reflect her current mood. 
          Her plane is simply a canvas for her art. </b><BR>
