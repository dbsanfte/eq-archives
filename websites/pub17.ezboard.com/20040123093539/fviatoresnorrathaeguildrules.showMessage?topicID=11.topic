Please note it includes a rules list we no longer use.<br>
********************************************<br>
WE ARE A REAL GUILD NOW!<br>
 <br>
I had planned on being in Freeport to do the event but I had a System Crash and could not get to Freeport in time.<br>
So we did the event in front of Felwaite.  Morowind and Wyrdlan were in attendance.<br>
 <br>
Found out some stuff...I have to be in the same zone to invite someone.<br>
Also found out have to invite you to the guild first then make you an officer or the Guild name does not show up.<br>
 <br>
Only I can make officers...each officer can invite members....Please remember all new members are to be initiates first.<br>
Once they have completed the trip...then we vote on their membership...then we extend an invite for membership.<br>
Each officer is allowed to invite up to 3 members but not before we vote on the new member.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
WE HAVE BEEN APPROVED!!!!<br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Congratulations!<br>
<br>
Your guild, Viatores Norrathae, has been approved. We look forward to seeing your<br>
guild throughout the lands of Norrath.<br>

Latest Charter/Guild Idea:  <br>
This is a letter to initiate a New Guild into the game EverQuest.<br>
 <br>
My Game Name is Zapo. 13th Level Wizard.<br>
 <br>
Meeting Minutes:<br>
 <br>
A meeting was held on 08/03/99 to discuss ideas for the guild<br>
Those players attending:<br>
    Zapo<br>
    Kardek<br>
    Morowind<br>
    Zasx<br>
    Wardon<br>
 <br>
Items of discusion:<br>
 <br>
Membership:<br>
    Initial Membership should be limited to up to 3 invitees per Officer = 64 members (16 officers plus 48 members).<br>
    History of limitation: We found large guilds beget Chaos...case in point &quot;Controllers of the Sky&quot; which broke up after too many people with no direction.<br>
    <br>
    If 3 Members of the guild agree on a potiential initiate...then an officer with an available opening<br>
     will make an offer of initiate status to the player by Email.<br>
 <br>
    Initiate invitations: Are by Email from a single officer with membership openings.<br>
 <br>
    Membership limits can be changed by a vote from all officers (simple majority)<br>
 <br>
    All new initate members will not be given membership until they have completed certain assgined tasks<br>
        Currently this is suggested to be a trip on foot between the citys Qeynos and Freeport....witnessed by an officer..<br>
                    could be their sponcer.  No gifts including buffs are allowed during the trip unless paid for within thier means.<br>
        All New initiates will be assigned a sponcer.  The sponcer will guild the initiate through the requirements for membership.<br>
 <br>
    Twinking: Gifts to any guild member or initiate are limited to spell buffs and items that could be reasonably obtained within<br>
                    5levels of the characters current level.<br>
    <br>
    Membership can be revoked by a majority vote from the officers of the guild.<br>
 <br>
    Evil Characters: Must require at least 2 officers to vouge for the player before initiate status can be given.<br>
 <br>
Theme of the Guild: Travel<br>
    The Guild will promote travel to all areas of Norrath.  To provide data to members and others on what can be found there.<br>
    <br>
Moto of the Guild: Where no Player has gone before<br>
 <br>
New Name Taken: &quot;Viatores Norrathae&quot; --- The travellers of Norrathe roughly translated<br>
    We thank &quot;Aegetorix&quot; for providing the Latin Translation<br>
 <br>
Guild Officers: 10 Officers comprising the 10 charter members of the guild.  Additional officers must receive a 3/4 vote from all officers.<br>
 <br>
Governing Body: The Guild will be ruled by council comprising of the officers of the guild.<br>
 <br>
Charter Rules:<br>
Admendments to the Charter: Can be put forward by a qorum of the officers.  All amendments must be voteded upon by all the officers with a 3/4 percentage vote.  Note: lack of responce from a voting officer constitues as Abstaining.  Voting period will be 1 week unless otherwise stated or if all votes are received prior to the week deadline.<br>
 <br>
A Set of Bylaws may be drawn up by the officers: All Bylaws require a simple majority vote.  Again 1 week deadline.<br>
    Note: A member of the guild may offer up a Bylaw for a vote.  An Officer must 2nd the Bylaw being put forth.<br>
            Only officers may vote on the item put forth.<br>
 <br>
Motions: A motion for an event or general statement from the guild may be put forth by any member and requires a simple majority vote by all members of the guild.  All motions must require a 2nd to be put forward for a vote.<br>
 <br>
Guild Meetings:<br>
    Will be held using the Instant Messageing program ICQ: <br>
            Click here to download ICQ:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.icq.com/">www.icq.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
 <br>
Guild Leader: EQ requires a Guild Master...I stand forth as first nominee...an election can be held once a quarter for a new Guild Master.<br>
 <br>
Guild WARS: Not a valid recourse for this guild.  All matters of guild disputes will be resolved by other means.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guild Benefits: Help from other guild brothers...for free when they are available in the same zone.  Help can consist of Buffs, Bindings, Food and water, Summoned items, Travel information, Body retreival, and small gifts.  And later Teleports between long distance locations.  Grouping assistance when available and the level differance is not an issue between guild brothers.<br>
 <br>
Major Awards: The officers of the guild will from time to time present a Quest usually involving travel to members of the guild.  Upon completing the quest an Award of some sort will be provided by the guild to the winner of the quest.  In some cases all those completing the quest will receive an award.  Details of each quest will be handeled primarily by the Officer donating the items to be awarded.<br>
 <br>
Membership Dues:<br>
    Dues will be in the form of service to the Guild, Items of value, money paid to an officer.  Please note the amount of the current dues are Zero until changed by a vote from the officers.<br>
 <br>
Officer Duties: The following duties can be spread out over multiple officers...one of which must be the team leader of the duty involved.<br>
    Treasurer: Maintain all items owned by the guild..includeing cash..award items..etc.<br>
    Secretary: Provide for a Newsletter and keep track of all voting issues.<br>
    Web Master: Provide for a web page for the guild to include information about the guild and current events<br>
    Hearld: Records the EQ player deeds of the Guild and the members within for later historical referance.<br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Please Note: Some of the more droll items of having a Guild charter I formed off the top of my head...if you have any problem with these thoughts or ideas I am open to hearing from you on possible changes.<br>
