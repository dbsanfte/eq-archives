I can't imagine how we will be able to organise a Dragon or Plane raid anytime soon. So far I've been lucky that old friends like Moro or Dalana keep me invited to such high level actions.<br>
BUT there will always be a &quot;Guild first&quot; approach in all those raids and Dalana already asked me to make up my mind if I want to play like a high leveler finally hehe :-)<br>
So unless this merger gives enough power to finally start some raiding in Sebilis, planes and other higher level places, it will not really change anything for me.<br>
<br>
Sooooo I see Taugur moving into one of the &quot;high level guilds&quot; (if they want me in the first place) with old friends i.e. Moro or Dalana myself.<br>
But I would always have one of my mid level chars (Wintermorgen or Katinka) around to port people and to keep the chat channel open :-)<br>
Currently Viatores is much of a chat/support guild for mid level game. I don't really know if we will manage (or want to?) to morph into a powerguild anytime soon. And playing in a european time zone does not help either.<br>
<br>
The question for any lvl50+ is:<br>
When will we do our first Viatores Raid on a plane, when do we organise getting keys to Sebilis for everybody...?</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#110d03><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ulevinma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>levinma</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>1/1/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>8:06:41 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=5><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: There has been some talk</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well this is my two cents.  And yes I can be a stick in the mud.<br>
<br>
Litvak is my primary and at this time will STAY in viatores.<br>
<br>
If there is to be a merge why is there no discussion of them joining us, instead of us joining them.<br>
<br>
I am all for grouping and working together.  And have many times left what I have been doing, and even changed characters to allow me to group.  As matter of fact, I created bearblood my warrior now 26th level, to allow myself to play with then newer and lower level players.  For a while we had a good core group of mid 20's going, but then life happened and we could not get together consistently.  But bear is still waiting for that group to allow him to be played.<br>
<br>
I understand and sympathize with Taugur and Rebby on wanting to do higher level raids.  But the fact is we can, we just need to make it happen.  Unfortunately it seems to happen when one player WANTS something and then others are willing to join in.  I would like to do a higher dungeon, or any dungeon for that matter, because we want to group together not just so one individual can get a neat item.<br>
<br>
Sorry off the subject.<br>
<br>
For the merge.  I am all for alliances, but i believe we should focus on strengthen Via instead of diversifying its possibilities.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>

I am not into all that . Those of you that think that are very wrong. I left on Reb due to the fact that Malevolent ask me to go into his new guild. If you have noticed hell I dont even play reb that much now a days the one I play is Trin and more than likely when she gets inot her 50's she will leave to be in his guild as well. Not for the fact of items and raids hell I been there done that . More than likely when she gets into her 50's she will camp out as well. Something with me and the 50's I just dont have that aruge to play them as much any more. Call it stubborn call it crazy but I get tired of all the ppl wanting this and that and I cant wait on this lvl . I Love to play that is the only reason they even lvl up. One day I will run out of chars and I ponder what will I do then. I have 2 other chars after Trin hits 50's that I can play but after that some real desicions will have to be made as to what I want to do. Grouping and such . Yes it is needed guys . I only brought up LoV cause I trust them. You ask why are they not willing to come into Via. Well here is your answer:<br>
<br>
They was merged with a guild This guild gave them problems. As in well they got Powerful and started making Silly assian rules as to YOU had to do this raid and then when you do them you will get points the one with the most points gets to be on Looto for a item. It was not the only thing but that one I remember them speaking of to me. It was a bad experience for them. I also know that this other guild was going behind LoV's back and trying to Recruit its higher memebers out of it to go into theirs. That is wrong as well. This is just that they are leary of how it was with them . THEY just got out of it and got all their chars back into LoV, its not saying they do not trust our guild but they are willing to be apart of of our family hell who knows what will happen. I just gave you a ideal No one Not me Not them has said to merge. I seen ppl talking about it and they didnt know what to do. I said well I know a guild but god almighty YOU dont have to . I brought up LoV cause I seen PPL talking about a merge with another guild but damn guys , You dont have to choose them. I just brought it to yall's attention that this is a guild I know and trust. I did not want Via to leave I didnt want ppl hurt that is why I suggested them. If you think there is another guild or that there is someone yall can trust then by all means go for it. I just was thinking about Via Family and did not want it hurt so when I seen PPL talking about a merge I brought up their names. They did not come looking for us . I ask some said sounds good So I talked to them about it. You dont have to go. You dont have to merge. I just didnt want yall to merge with a guild and have a bad experience like what they had Call it me looking after My Via family. </font><P>Rebelyoung Evil-
