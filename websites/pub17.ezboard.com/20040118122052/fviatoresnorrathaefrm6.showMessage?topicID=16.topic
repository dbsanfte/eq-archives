Is it just me or is the price on trade skill supplies VERY high, I mean people want 1pp per medium quality skin/hide, and that is a lot of money when I give away the armor. I have also seen people pay 5pp for Morning Dew and Cinnamon Sticks. (okay, I took them up on the offer when they offered that, but come on...5pp for a foraged item? I get it for free, every time I turn left I forage...) I will be from this point foward saving a lot of pelts to donate to the guild bank if they want it, if not, I will start a bank Alt. Wystbank will be his name and I will try to get him to Shadow Haven near the bank. (easier to get to)... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> I will store all the ruined pelts I find right now, then all the medium pelts that I can get after I level past them, and I will also try to get A WHOLE LOT of high quality rockhopper hides, they work the same as bear hides for backpacks.<br>
I will also be doing studs when I get the time, I will sell them for 1.5pp for 2 studs, so for a stack it will be 15pp. (this is still a loss most of the time). I also told Qiara that I would be making Wu's as soon as I can and first Donate a set, and then sell it for cost or a slight loss.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  How hard are Heady Kiolas to make?<br>
I guess I should also learn baking, I mean I am a Halfling... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I wish that Verant/Sony would make an easier way to get Pelts/hides, maybe a store that sells them for about 3/4 of what PC's are selling them for now...like 1 gold per ruined, 3 gold per low quality, 7 gold per medium quality, and high quality would depend on size, like wolf 5pp, cat 8pp and bear 15pp or so. make a limited quantity, like 20 of each spawns on the merchant per hour....make him wander...whatever...just a thought...(you would think with all the poachers that there would be a merchant that sells and buys hides at a good price...)<br>
Also Spiders seem to never drop silk for me, I killed 8-12 Large spiders last night in Kelethin area and commons, and NONE of them had silk? I was thinking of going to rivervale and just hunting wolves and spiders to extinction...and then goblins...<br>
anyone have any good ideas for a way to get my Tailoring up quickly and cheaply? I went from 100pp in the bank to 30pp in the bank just making studded armor... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I hate to tell you that it really will only get worse. Like INSANELY worse.<br>
<br>
Tailoring is the hardest most expensive skill to level. I don't speak from experience, I speak from listening to others who are trying. Namely Nordiran/Wyrdlan who has the highest tailoring in our guild (180ish) so far and Minladar (130ish).<br>
<br>
As Minladar put it, tailoring is masochistic. And when he hears someone who has a high level in it, instead of congratulating them...he pities them.<br>
<br>
And having grouped with Nordiran/Wyrdlan for many times I can tell you that he never passes up a spider without whacking it....THAT'S how many silks you still need *giggles madly*<br>
<br>
Not trying to discourage you, not at all as I like to tradeskill also. But I will never tailor hehe<br>
<br>
Talk to Nordiran and Minladar...they can probably best help you.<br>

People charge what they can get.  If you are too lazy to hunt, or shop vendors, then you pay for the convience of the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Than been said - the greatest source of these supplies is vendors, but you need to LOOK at a lot of vendors.  I am Talking EVERY vendor in Freeport, Kelethin, Qeynos, Kaladim, and all the freestanding ones in between.  Of and the ones in Cat city (cant recall spelling).  Of course after you have spent 3 days scoring all these locations and paying for ports ... 10 minutes in the bazaar doesnt sound paid.<br>
<br>
Time  = Money<br>
<br>
Now for the ludicrous parts (i.e. what crap I do):<br>
If I find Spiderling Silks for sale for 2 P or less on others in the Bazaar I buy them and resale for 5 P.  These will always sale within 6 hours.<br>
<br>
Spider Silks if less than 4 P I buy and resale (10 p, 24 hour turn over), but recently the market has been flooded with these so I have stayed out of the market.<br>
<br>
Bone chips - buy if 5 gold or less - sell 1 P each - Turn over (about 3 days).  Sound stupid, I was in LOIO the other night, all night long someone was advertising they wanted to buy a stack for 10 P).  For double the moeny they wouldnt have to search all night.<br>
<br>
Stein of Moggok - I would run this quest ALL the time.  People would haggle me down from 200 P to as low as 160 a couple of times.  I would give based upon if I was ready or not to get another.  When the bazaar opened people would tell me I was ver charging and they sell for 100 P in the Bazaar.  Wel supply and demand have meet and the going price is now 250 to 300 for a Stein. Now if I see one for under 190 and I dont have one, I buy theirs and resell for 250.  Turnover about a week.<br>
<br>
Water - yes water - I buy them from a VENDOR in the BAZAAR (told Zapo today where I get them) fo a silver - Resale 1 G each.  Yes almost every night one person will BUY me out.  Not a big profit (2 P on a stack but ...).  Now who is the bad guy?  Me for turning a profit?  Or the person buying for being too lazy to visit all 8 vendors in the bazaar?  If I am then fine I will stop buying and selling the water and you can take up the mission.<br>
<br>
Heady Kiolas have made me rich - At this point I can give them for free to Guildies - I make headies, they at trivial at 46 - which at that level, without a bunch of DEX gear (dex about 100). Fail about half the time.  I get my skill upto 102 just so it wouldnt be so annoying.  Material to make Headies 2 Kiola Saps (major cities in Norrathae, NONE on Luclin (I have looked)) One water, one bottle, combine in Still.  Note this is not a portable Still like the sewing kits, this is the few they have sitting around.  Prices - Kiola Sap - I think these are like 1G 1S 5C each, water 1S 1C, Bottle 5C - Total cost to make 2G 4S 5C.  How much do I sell them for?  Well I started selling them for 5P each, but I couldnt keep up with demand so I raised my prices to 6P.  Now others are getting in on it, so if others are selling its 4 P if I am the only one then 6 P.  If someone else is selling for 3 P I buy them out.  Oh I forgot my other costs: port down and up 20 P each way.  Hey for the kinda money I am making I dont want to wait 20 minutes for the Nexus.  And of course the time, takes me about an hour to fill an 8 slot bp with stacks of headies (of course my 3 yo daughter distracts me).<br>
<br>
Funny thing is I once did Headies before as Beggerina (thanks to Nords need for Headies, he was paying me 50 P a stack which I felt was too much (LOL now I get 120  a stack and the people thank me)), so I tried marketing them by going around selling them zone to zone, I had a TERRIBLE time trying to sell them for 20 P a stack.  People would try and try to argue me down to 10 P a stack, which given my failure rate would have ment breaking even (obviously I was trying to make a little money).<br>
<br>
Anyway, once again if you need some just ask, I am usually on as SLOAKE rarely as SLOAKEN or SCHIELD and possibly FIDDOE if rearranging.  Oh my vendors name is BLUMOON.  You can of course just buy them from me and ask for a refund when you see me, yes I would be VERY happy to refund your money.  Needless to say, I assume you wont be reselling them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#223344><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/usloaken.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sloaken</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(9/4/02 11:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Need Spider Silk?</span><hr size=1> Ok the best place I have seen - <br>

<br>
Make them in Sanctus Seru. (Bazaar-&gt;nexus-netherb-&gt;maru seru-&gt;sanctus seru)<br>
<br>
That's what I do. there are several brew barrels and vendors real close that sell bottles, and heady kiola sap.<br>
<br>
However, I would love to buy some from you at cost because it takes 4 kiolas to make a wu's, and my hands are dying. My tailoring skill is now 131, my wisdom is 248 with KEI (252 if I can do bearform but sanctus people hate bearform), and I am about ready to throttle something.<br>
<br>
Tailoring, quite honestly, sucks big time.<br>
<br>
I will finish all the wu's supplies I have, then attempt my 5th, and then the 6th when I get the supplies, and if that fails, do more wu's. But I hate hate hate hate hate hate tailoring. (I  do have a tailoring geerlok).<br>
<br>
Wystaan, tailoring only gets worse. I have /no/, that's right /no/ pity for you. I have /no/ pity for the tailors I gouge selling tailoring supplies. I've done every tradeskill, and the only way one can succeed in tailoring is if they are willing to spend 3 years on it, or are very very rich and buy their way up. As soon as I finish with my coldain prayer shawl quests, I am done with tailoring, and will never look back. I don't find farming the silks fun. I don't find farming the pelts fun. I don't find making 4 heady kiolas for /one/ wu's combine fun. My hands hurt. My bank account hurts. My head is sick of wu's. I am bored, I am pissed off that there are no, yes /no/ alternate skillup routes in tailoring (unless you skip and do really high combines which cost you a *lot* in supplies and failures). In brewing, if you get bored of skull ale, make jumjum juice! In baking, make wedding cakes or 10lb pies. In pottery, there are bands and steins, plus idols. <br>
<br>
But in tailoring there is only /one/ route. That means /everyone/ farms the Karana spiders, the lguk spiders, everyone is buying silk at outrageous prices, everyone is buying the same damn pelts and nobody wants to buy the items. The market for acrylia stuff is glutted. I bought an acrylia cloak today for 1k. 1k!!! They were 4k before the bazaar. and that involves 4 acrylia studs (at least 200 pp storebought) + 1 superb hide (250 plat), which means the tailor, on his successful combine (not guaranteed), made 550 plat. That's it. And if he failed, poof, there goes your profit.<br>
<br>
Alchemy is almost as bad in this respect because none of the potions post 95 are profitable except titans, and at skill of 111, I fail on 75% of each titan's combine, so a 190 10dose potion of titans actually cost me 400 plat to make. But I sell shrink and sow potions through the roof to cover the 210 plat loss for making that titan's potion for skillup purposes. So the bazaar is barely paying for me to skill up in alchemy to my levelcap. <br>
<br>
Alchemy is a different rant though, I'll get back to that one later.... <br>
<br>
Back to tailoring.<br>
<br>
Tailors have a choice to go this route. There's the prestige. There's the high prices you pay for a full set of arctic wyvern (good for shammies, I want some legs...), there's the formerly high price for acrylia. But until these things trivial for you, you won't turn a profit. There are just too may tailors trying to skill up for the shawl.<br>
<br>
All those tailors == a glut on the market, prices go up.<br>
<br>
And I have no pity for any of them.<br>

I am pretty much out of the CE business.  I have supplies for 2 stacks, which I would be happy to make for you.  The reason I am out of it, is I was basically competing for customers with Zapo, who showed me how to make them.  So now I plan to just resell his at a higher price.  My customers will be the truly lazy or when he runs out.<br>
<br>
yes Headies are tiring ... one stack is one thing ... making a whole backpack ... well ... like I said its about an hour of monontony.  But the money is sweet.  Hmm how much does a horse cost?<br>

I leveled my baby enchanter to 8 so she makes magic clay for me while she vendors... I can pick up the rest of the CE needed as finances (or ports) permit. And bank space. I need to clear out my bank space badly.<br>
<br>
The cheapest horse costs 8k.<br>
<br>
I bought one on Friday. Wow. I can solo-nonstop! While you are sitting on a horse, and not attacking, you are medding. You can swap spells without sitting. You can jbb while you are medding, or canni while you are medding. So during 1 battle, I go up a full blue bulb of mana. Sweeetttt...<br>
<br>
My nag's name is Horsie. She's black (I splurged, black and white cost 1k more than brown or tan). She's rope bridle, so she moves slower than jbboots. She starts and stops slow. But since I don't use her for real travel (just pulls), and can click her off and run at sow speed, she's great for medding back my mana while I root/rot/dot/jbb/canni. She also doesn't gain sit aggro. She has nice safe fall, but can't get up steep cliffs or mountains. She looks cool. And she eats food like a pig... she went through an ENTIRE stack of patty melts in 6 hours. BAD HORSIE. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your mount and you are both thirsty.&quot;<br>
<br>
After I buy some nice pants and a shield, I may consider upgrading her to the leather bridle, it's faster than jbboots. I definately love my horsie. That one costs 27k, but I'm making good money selling superb and flawless hides from my favourite hunting spot. (sow potions just enable me to skillup in alchemy, no profit there until I reach my level cap). I can sell her back for 7.5k, so I just need 20k <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Pants and shield first though, I'm still wearing soiled breachcloth and a charred guardian shield.<br>
<br>
Dunno how much longer my good hunting spot will be db, though. I'll have to find a new niche market after that.<br>

<br>
Acrylia Tunic:<br>
1 Superb Hide = 250 plat.<br>
4 acrylia pieces = 200 plat (50 plat each).<br>
<br>
So that's 450 plat in one try.<br>
<br>
*one* try.<br>
<br>
203 -  204  Gold + Sapphire  115pp 5gp <br>
205 -  207  Gold + Ruby  141pp 7gp 5sp <br>

221 -  223  Platinum + Turquoise  105pp 1gp 1sp 5cp <br>
224 -  226  Platinum + Hematite  105pp 1gp 5sp 7cp <br>
227 -  228  Platinum + Cat's Eye Agate  105pp 2gp 1sp <br>
229 -  231  Platinum + Bloodstone  105pp 5gp 2sp 5cp <br>
232 -  234  Platinum + Onyx  105pp 6gp 8sp 2cp <br>
235 -  236  Platinum + Jasper  105pp 7gp 8sp 7cp <br>
237 -  239  Platinum + Carnelian  105pp 8gp 9sp 2cp <br>
240 -  242  Platinum + Star Rose Quartz  106pp 5sp <br>
243 -  244  Platinum + Amber  107pp 6gp 2sp 5cp <br>
245 -  247  Platinum + Wolf's Eye Agate  108pp 3gp 6sp <br>
248 -  250  Platinum + Jade  108pp 6gp 7sp 5cp <br>
<br>
<br>
So the most 1 try between 200-250 is 141 pp.<br>
<br>
Plus you can do it all at one vendor.<br>

Jewelcraft IS very expensive, for starters.  If you take the time to enchant the material, you will make a profit from 207 to 250.  You just need a nest egg of about 5k.<br>
<br>
Tailoring is cheap and easy if you farm your own things, you only need about two or three months of time and a nest egg of about 150k, give or take.<br>

Wu's at this point take 2 swatches per try, until 151 skill. each swatch is 2 silks. Next, to 158, it takes 3 swatches a try. So it's going to take a lot of spiders. <br>
