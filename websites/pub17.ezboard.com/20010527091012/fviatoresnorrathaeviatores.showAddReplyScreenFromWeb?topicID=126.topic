Yet another of my friends has decided to leave EQ and he has meaning and depth to why. It gives you alot to think about and makes you go WOW the good ole days . When you have a good 15 minutes to sit relax and read you might want to visit the site. All I can Say is that Skyrain will be missed by the Rebby Girl.<br>

I read your post and I must say that I to have pulled back from the game as well. I started looking at the aspect of the whole game and when I did I found out that I got pure disappointed with it. What you say is true that ppl are looked upon with lvl gain and item gain with more upstanding atmosphere on there. You got the power you can do it. <br>
Then you have the newer players that are well I must say this coming on the game and trully turning into power hungry lvling item wanters. When you and I started this game we learnt this game the hard way you go kill you acquire money , you never begged you never ask cause we all knew we was all struggling to get there too. The new ones come on and say hey you got some items for this low lvl char and can you power lvl me some cause I really want this lvl before tonight. And god forbid you say no cause then you get called all kind of names and it turns into a headache and you sit behind your screen going WTF man I earned my way on this game. <br>
Sky when we played we played to have FUN I mean down right laughing in your chair . Tears coming out the eyes from so much laughter. We didnt think about how we wanted this or how we needed our next lvl tonight , We thought I cant wait to get on there and see if my buddies was on and lets tussle with a few nasty mean mobs and DIE!! <br>
The concept of the game for us Old timers on there has changed and due to that they are loosen alot of the old time players like us to . The new hungry gotta get crowd is moving in. I sat with some new ones and played for awhile with them and it was sadden after it was done . No one cut up ppl would scream throw tantrums get angry cause they did. No talking in the group it was none stop pull PULL PULL I want my lvl. The game to us old timers on there has and always will be about the friendship . <br>
Game issues, Well to me they messed up on the items you have to require for the quest they just started cause you have to have a HUGE guild in order to recieve the benifits . The lower lvl char's on the game do not have a chance in ---- to get them . If you are not in a guild that is big enough to handle this issue then you are bascially out of luck. <br>
Another game issue, My option is that they also messed up the spells that are dropped off mobs. It has turned into a money hungry exchange for spells, Ppl kill mobs on here and a spell drops .They cant use the spell what do they do they auction they have your spell YOUR SPELL the one your char can use . They cant use it but instead of saying ok here I dont need it anyway what do they do . I tell you what they do they CHARGE you ALOT of money for this spell. Now when I was lvling up on the game I did it for my spells. Ohhh I cant wait to get that lvl new spells for me .Giddy with Joy when I got that lvl. Now when you hit past 50 . You cant go and buy your spells for the few plat it ask . You have to bargain with another person that has your spells CAUSE you see the spell is drop off this mob and its a random Mob and its random on your spell. So you get charged by another players up to 2 K . THAT is one spell guys. I dont know about the rest of you but that took alot of enjoyment from me. You see they are pushing that issue about you have to be higher in lvl and you have to be strong enough to do it. Or you get run over by the other higher lvls and they take not only your fun but you Spell then tell you PAY ME!!!! <br>
Yes I still play just not as heavy as I use to but more on tha point of I log in to speak with the ppl on the game that I battled with in my younger days on there that are still playing but I am finding more and more that are leaving it. They are sadden by what has taken place. <br>
Sky you are missed by this Rebby girl and I remember all our good times on there. Maybe one day you will come on there and I will be there and we will just kill Greenies and bust up laughing and hanging around with all the oldtimers and look at the newbies power lvling up and go you just dont get it but you will soon.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>
