<br>
I used the helm of Rile until i gain a Froglok crown, i tried to do the helm quest but the bugger only spawns once an hour for about 5seconds, i spent about a week there RL trying to get him, finally gave up on it and just got the rile helm for free, just zoned into kc and asked if anyone was selling one. picked it up for less then it cost to make a cab scale helm.<br>
<br>
For the Pauldron, **bring a druid** i spend 30hrs just foraging for the moss, a druid friend took pity on me and stopped by not 30secs after she zoned in she foraged it, might have been just lucky but.. ya never know..  also if your doing this quest your gonna want to make sure your brewing and cooking are both above adverage, and at this point your smithing should also be there as you need a master level to make your mancatcher.  The ice is in the mountains HIGH above the Giant fortress there, its a ground spawn on a 5min timmer, there is no argo up there just make sure your a good climber or you have some form of levitation to get back down.. as its a 10k fall from up there. That fall kinda brused my tail a little bit..<br>
<br>
For the Vembraces.. just camp the building outside of the goblin fort in the woods on the same side as the field of bone is.  it may take a little while but you can also get a decent earring there if you keep the outbuilding cleared, only 2 or 3 spawns i think.. just bring along someone to help you stay alive, and keep ya company 20-30 min respawn i think..<br>
<br>
For the Breastplate, your going to have to ask another Legionnaire, as I never compleated that quest, I just ran to the Sarnak fort in the Burning Woods little building near there can find a treeweave, half the time the dru or nec there let them rott or sell them for cheep i traded a set of small banded for it.<br>
<br>
For the Greaves, the tome drops in the lake,  in the heart of the fortress  there you can get the iron bound tomb a decent group of mid 20's to early 30's should be able to hold the room, i know there were 2 groups fighting there when i was there, us and another &quot;group&quot; working on there key quest.. the book drops from the same mob, so can always ask them if they got an extra and make sure you let them know that its for a quest, offer a little something to take it of there hands.. be it just a glass of our finest green death ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For the Guantlets you gotta drop Blackhand in the Field down in a cave near the waters hes a rogue and WILL stab you in the back if your go to run from him ( i tried at 20... OUCH)  but i asked a nice shadow knight(49) that was working on cab faction.. (about a year and half ago, so was actually wanting to help us not rob our people) anyway she had no problem with him, i havnt gone back to see how tough he is but i think tiss low 30's..<br>
<br>
For the Gauntlets, i would reccomend taking a good group into dalnar (all of us iksar have quests in there) i dont really remember where he is as i bought a trooper bracer and had bracer of scavenging(Sp) i went back when i hit 40 with my friends mage she killed the entire zone and i found it on one of the corpses, i think was near the exit.. sorry.<br>
<br>
The boots were a pain in the tail, i tried a couple time at 36 to kill the guy but he was to tough solo, so i snaged a group of mid 30's from the fort (lots of healers for some reason...) and we took out the cave with no losses, course the high priestess that was there watching over the ranger that was with us..<br>
<br>
One word of advice though do not try to solo these quests.. bring a partner at least as i didnt and went from 35 --33--36--32 (got frustreated and kept charging back in)<br>

I had a shaman sit there with the 34 pet. As soon as he spawned it was F8 to target and /pet attack. He is bugged and actually ends up warping to the hallway /shrug Easy kill though.<br>
<br>
FYI, he spawns there in the dining room in the doorway with the collasped rock.<br>

<br>
kerosh blackhand is nasty rogue hes about lvl 30-35 i think probably need a partner to take him out <br>
<br>
bargrin the evil casting badger ok hes a 35ish mob too but as most casters dont trust the con he hits weakish but has a lot of nasty spells he throws your way. one thing tho he isnt always in the cave on the 2 times i have killed him he was wandering near the giant fort (ie with no friends) dont know wether this is normal pathing or what but easier to take him here<br>
<br>
the iron bound tomb can be bought in bazaar nowadays sells for 20-40pp and usually a couple for sale<br>
<br>
as for the BP have to agree i didnt get mine but helped friend get theirs (tips get a non kos person to pull for you trying to dodge every mob in the zone and pull them just doesnt work<br>
they can pull to a zoneline where u can fight and they zone to avoid faction hit oh and dispell them if you can the both have DS that are vaery annoying at lvl 35 ish it alomost killed me. took a grp of lvl 30+ish evil races to take em out with good buffs)   Too be honest get a treeweave its better stats and probably easier<br>
<br>
and one last tip try asking in the zone i got most of my set of trooper at around lvl 32-35 on my own basically cause i got lucky asked in the zone if any1 would help and they did<br>
   have helped 4 times on these mobs myself was just running thru and decided to kill em on way past to help others<br>
<br>
<br>
oh and just for kicks get a 1hb weapon and the iron bound tomb and pretend to be a shamy lol silly sofskins cant tell the difference<br>
<br>
hope this helps sheesh kebeb warrior of the 54th season <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.showPrevMessage?topicID=166.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.showNextMessage?topicID=166.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sunset/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.emailToFriend?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.threadControl?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sunset/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub17.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="championsofcabilisgeneral">General<option value="championsofcabilisfrm8">News<option value="championsofcabilisfrm5">Events<option value="championsofcabilisquests">Quests<option value="championsofcabilisitems">Items<option value="championsofcabilistradeskills">Trade Skills<option value="championsofcabilisfrm10">Recruitment<option value="championsofcabilisfrm9">Guild Bank<option value="championsofcabilisfrm7">Private<option value="championsofcabilisofficers">Officers<option value="championsofcabilisfrm15">Alliance Officers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#cc9933>- </font><a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bchampionsofcabilis>Champions of Cabilis</a><font color=#cc9933> - </font><a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fchampionsofcabilisquests>Quests</a> <font color=#cc9933> - </font><a href="http://www.championsofcabilis.com">Champions of Cabilis</a><font color=#cc9933> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
