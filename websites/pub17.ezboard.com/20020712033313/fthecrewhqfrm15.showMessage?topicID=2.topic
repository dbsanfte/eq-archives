<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"> -- Primal Honor uses a Point based distribution system.  Points that are earned by guildmates and friends of the guild who raid with the intent of joining Primal Honor.  While no loot system is perfect, earned points are the fairest way to distribute raid dropped loot with the least amount of fuss.<p> </center></font><br>
<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff">Earning Primal Honor Points </font></center></b><br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"><br>
 -- Through the course of playing the game there are 3 ways to Earn Primal Honor Points (PHP's).<br>
<br>
 -- <b> Active Membership </b> -- Every member is important to Primal Honor, especially active ones.  Active members will recieve 1 PHP per week.  Only mains will accumulate this weekly point, and each member will designate who their main character is.<br>
<br>
--<b> Guild Raids </b> -- Raiding is where the bulk of PHP's are earned.  Every Official Primal Honor Raid will be worth 2 PHP's for every player that is there from begining to end.  If a a player is late in coming or early to leave, but stays for at least half the raid, they will be awarded 1 point.<br>
<br>
--<b> Peer Recognition </b> --  Members of Primal Honor can be nominated for recognition by there fellow guildmates.  These nominations will be reviewed by the Officers and those found worthy will be awarded PHP.  These nominations should never come lightly.  These are to recognise the many selfless acts of guildmates that can too often go unnoticed.  Recognition of these acts not only raises the reputation of the member nominated, but also will inspire other members to emulate their actions. </center></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff">Point Allotment</font></center></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"> -- Points earned through the methods above are not available to be spent until they have been posted to the official board.  Points are posted every Thursday before midnight cst.  Only points that are posted to the boards can be spent.<br>
</center></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff">Spending Primal Honor Points</font></center></b><br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"> -- Points can only be spent on Official Primal Raids.  Pickup grps, Minor  kills that require just a couple grps etc do not require PHP's to be used.<br>
-- Official raids will be announced that the Primal Honor Points will be used for all items.<br>
-- When an item drops, the stats will be announced and The Loot Master of that raid will ask for bids.  Anyone eligible for the drop then sends a single tell with how many points they are offering for the item.  The bid is silent to discourage bid wars of any sort.  Once the Loot Master has asked for final bids, the highest bidder will be anounced in the Raid chat... and the congratz's and woohoo's commence.  <br>
-- Any ties will be announced in the chat chanel, and  will be settled with a quick random conducted by the Loot Master.    <br>
-- Once a player has won a bid on an item, the points they bid are gone.  No player can go knowingly into the negative on points.  Abuse of the system will not be tolerated.<br>
-- Items can only be bid on by a player who is present on the raid and will use the Item.  There will be no sharing of points, or bidding for alts.<br>
-- If an item recieves no bids, it will be randomed to the entire raid.  The winner can do as he sees fit for items won in this matter.  Once a player wins an item in this fashion they are ineligble for future rolls of this sort until everyone has won in this manner.</center></font><br>

<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff"> What Constitutes an Official Primal Honor Raid</font></center></b><br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"> -- All Reserved raids will be announced in the sign up post whether they will be using this point system.<br>
-- Primal Honor realizes most raids will not be reserved and sometimes barely even planned.  This is where the <b>Justicars</b> come into play.<br>
<br>
-- <b>Justicars</b> are preordained members of Primal Honor whos duty it is to keep track of and determine whether Primal Honor points are being used.  Once a Justicar has declared a raid official, it becomes worth PHP to attend and will use PHP for loot distribution.  If there is no Justicar present, then it is not an official raid.  <br>
-- Each raid will assign a Justicar to keep track of who is in attendance.  It is the duty of the Justicar to post the names of those who attended the raid.  It is from these posts that the point database will be updated every thursday. </center></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff"> Non-Members </font></center></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman"> -- Primal Honor realizes many prospective members would like to raid with us before joining.  All non-members that raid with Primal Honor may do so, and they earn points for the raid just as if they were a raiding member.  These points will however not be available to be spent until they have been posted on the thursday after the raid.  This means non-members will not be able to bid on any dropped items during the course of their first raid.  <br>
-- Those who are serious about joining Primal Honor will understand this, and those who wish only to come to get phat lewtz will hopefully be dettered from even coming. <br>
 </center></font><br>
<b><font color="#993333" size="4"><font face="times new roman" color="#ffffff"> Unusual Situations Clause</font></center></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="3" face="times new roman">-- No loot system no matter how well thought out can cover every possible situation.  The above rules are the guidelines for all official raids.  If for any reason the rules above do not clarify what needs be done with an item, the Motto ... Honor First, all else follows... will be the guideline.<br>
