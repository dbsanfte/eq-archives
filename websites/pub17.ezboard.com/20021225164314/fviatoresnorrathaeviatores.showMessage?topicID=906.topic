I'm making a definitive post on the matter... Whoeve the brainiac at Verant was that said &quot;Hey, what a good idea, lets make it so SEQ has to use the EQ machine to get the key!&quot; was just signed their own termination papers... or if that persons boss is smart, that's what would happen.<br>
<br>
The fact is, with the lid blown off of the Linux version, forcing us to use a leech on the Windows machine, there is absolutely, positively no reason not to have a WinSEQ... and it is now inevitable anyway. If we don't do it, someone else will... because the port really is trivial.<br>
<br>
The social contract that we've enjoyed for so long has been broken by some idiot brain (hows that for an oxymoron?) and the corporate suit who agreed with it (who obviously had absolutely no concept of the implications of his or her actions)... and since it's been broken... as I say on the main page... Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war!<br>
<br>
I hope Verant is prepared to ban $100,000's in revenue... because the download staticsics on the new libEQ.a were startling, even to me. I had no idea so many *UNIQUE* people were using libEQ.a.<br>
<br>
In one way, it's sad... it's the end of an era. In another way, it's funny... the absolute hell and damnation they have just brought down upon themselves is staggering. Prepare for an onslaught of thounds upon thousands of users using SEQ ... prepare for mass bannings. Prepare for chaos and stupdity... but in the end, SEQ will still exist and Verant will be out HUGE monetary sums from the bannings.<br>
<br>
Welcome to your own little corner of Hell, SOE... you have no one to blame but yourselves for this. I hope the millions of dollars per year of lost revenue will make up for banning the *mostly* responsible SEQ users out there.<br>
<br>
SOE can't stop SEQ... that's what at the root of the humor. It will always be there, in one form or another. They had a nice little deal going here, keep it contained and as responsible as reasonably possibe, for ZERO development and operational costs. Now, not only are they going to have to expend resources to find and detect SEQ users, but they will ALSO lose revenue with the banned accounts. This is a NO WIN situation for Verant. There is no possible financial benefit to this move, ALL POSSIBLE outcomes are detrimental to the profitablity of EQ as a commercial entity.<br>
<br>
Instead, they've chosen the path of chaos, and not even Sony can tame chaos in any meaningful and lasting way. So let them reap the chaos whirlwind they have sown. I will not hold it in check any longer. Let the Windows versions flow! Let the commercial products SELL. LET THEM RUIN THEIR OWN GAME with the thoundsands of moronic idiots using SEQ.<br>
<br>
The bar has been broken, there will be NO barrier to entry now, and there WILL be a bannings aplenty, make no mistake. I expects hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of bannings. I expect utter horror and chaos, ridiculous actions by SOE and othe opposition. But in the end, this will only harm us, the players, because the game will be ruined in new and imaginitive ways... because Verant can't stop them all... and they will keep coming, and coming... and coming. But by harming us, they harm themselves, because they slowly erode their player base.<br>
<br>
I wish good luck to the Verant programmers, because I know their life just turned into a living hell... most just don't know it yet.<br>
<br>
I liken the new order to Echo Star hacking. The smartcards DTV and Echostar use for encryption are INFINITELY more secure than the joke crap that Verant could use (because the smart cards are ASICs designed SPECIFICALLY AND SOLEY TO do FAST, SECURE decryption)... but Dish and DTV can't stop the signal theft? Why? Because you CAN'T STOP the dedicated hordes of people that work for free. You CAN'T thrown enough money at a problem to overcome thoundands of people, working together and seperately for a common goal... all for free.<br>
<br>
If Huges Networks, and Echostar can't defeat the problem with sophisticated smart cards and tens of millions of dollars spent per year to prevent people from intercepting HEAVILY encrypted signals, do you think the piddly little budget of EQ can even get close? Haha, not a chance.<br>
<br>
Anyway... it was a good show the whole time and very enjoyable. I'm sad that it has come to this. The rushing flood waters are already speeding towards the little EQ village... what will remain standing after the wave crashes over the town limits is anyones guess. I feel I played fair and did my part in the whole EQ deal and there was nothing more I could have done, so I am comfortable. Now it's SOE's job to pick up the pieces in the aftermath. I don't envy anyone that job, and I feel bad for some of you that are going to get washed away (banned) by the flood. The only advice I can offer you is DON'T BE STUPID. Think about what you are doing before you do it. If you don't feel comfortable with your conclusions, ASK... and then weigh the risks. I also suggest you pick up a good C++ or VB book and figure out how to write your own key sniffer.<br>
<br>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a war to fight. Oh wait... no I don't... I can just let the waves of inevitibility wash over our opponents and crush them far quicker and easier than I could ever manage with my meager resources. Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war indeed...<br>

Its a hack.  And considered against the EULA.<br>
<br>
As a general stance our guild does not consider the use of any 3rd party program that has not received approval by Verant to be against the guild rules.  To do otherwise could risk the guild being disbanded by Verant.<br>

<br>
Before:<br>
<br>
Cheating is hard.  Only a few people cheat.  You don't care if maybe 100 people on the server can see what is in the zone before you get to it.  You have rare spawns stolen from you rarely.<br>
<br>
<br>
After:<br>
<br>
Cheating will be easy.  Every idiot willing to cheat will be able to cheat.  You will never see a rare spawn, because some dork will be sitting on the spawn spot waiting and know before you do whether it is there or not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#223344><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bviatoresnorrathae.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tbeanie1>Tbeanie1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(11/1/02 7:16:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=906.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perhaps I am a dolt..</span><hr size=1> <br>
