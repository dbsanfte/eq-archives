(And to be honest, my hands were shaking a bit through some parts, but the facts as best I can sort them are laid dsown in as clean and clear terms as possable.<br>
<br>
Based upon a knowledge of real life reptilian anatomy I have set up a brief lesson here, depicting what I have summized to be a consice and acurate depiction; dispelling myths, and explaining about the misconceptions surrounding Iksar Anatomy. <br>
<br>
And so I give you &quot;Iksar Anatomy 101&quot;<br>
<br>
Iksar reproductive organs are kept inside the body. At a first glance it would appear that there is nothing there. That is done so thet the strong, scaled hide can protect a vulnerable weakness. The genitals can be brought out by sexual stimulation of, primrily, the crotch or under-side of the tail, where the nerves are the most dense, and thereby, most sensative.<br>
<br>
The penis, properly refered to in reptiles as a &quot;hemipenis&quot;, due to the way it is formed internally, is not scaled. It is flesh. While it is inside the body, it is much like keeping your tongue inside your mouth, and as such, when it comes out or goes back in, it is not painful.<br>
<br>
On Females, the reproductive organ appears similar to a female softskin, with a few variations. A layer of thin, fine-scaled flesh covers it when it is not in use.<br>
<br>
When reptiles mate, the male lays atop the female, both front-down. The male genital must be long enough to reach at least partway around the female's tail (keeping in mind that the female's tail can be somewhat pushed aside). This points that an Iksar's penis would be somewhat thin, but lengthy.<br>
<br>
Solid Excretion (eew) - While an Iksar's genital is cept inside the body, it would appear as a hole, covered by scales. A short distance arther down the underside of the tail is a second hole used for the excretion of solid matter. it is highly recommended no one gets the two mixed up. The Genital holw is about centered, slightly higher, in the crotch, the excretion hole is level with the ring of scales that circles the very base of the tail.<br>
<br>
Tongues - Iksars are not snakes. They are most related to Crocodilians and the larger, heavier forms of Lizard. Their tongues to not come out of a hole within their mouth. The tongue structure is quite similar to a humanoid one, sae that the tongue itself reaches out about 4 times as far as a humanoid's tongue (can reach up to an Iksar's eyes and front snout areas, inherant from reptiles' methods of cleaning their face). It is very slender. I have, at time claimed Gannor's tongue to be forked, but recent research has avtually proven otherwise. Iksar tongues are *not* forked, but come to a single , somewhat rounded point.<br>
<br>
Ear Rings - Technically, based upon the audio-receptive devices of most reptiles, an Iksar's &quot;ears&quot; are actually mere holes in the sides of his head, therefor I find it more likely that &quot;ear rings&quot; are cept on the topmost (dominat) spikes on the sides of an Iksar's head, and thus, would properly be caled, for the Iksar, Spike Rings or Horn Rings.<br>
<br>
Lips - Iksars, like lizards, do, in fact have lips. The lips arehotizontal muscles around theedges of the jawlines, with a thick layer of adjustable scales, making it both properly maneuverable for speach andproperly proactive as scales.<br>
<br>
Fingers - If you look on either the old or new model, you can distinctly see that Iksars have, aside from the thumb, only 3 fingers on each hand, and four toes per foot.<br>
<br>
Claws - Iksar claws are (if properly kept) an average half inch to three inches in length, and are solid bone. Although they are bone, they continue to grow after an Iksar has fully matured in age (proof - look at Venril Sathir's claws). They do not feel. they can break, but, being bone, are quite sturdy. An attemp to break an Iksar's claws would be morel ikely to break his/her finger first.<br>
<br>
Nipples - Iksars do not have nipples. Not males nor females. Females to not have &quot;boobs&quot;. Both genders have pectoral muscles, but that is the full extent. They lack such glands because they do not nurse their young as mammals do. The eggs are fertalized as embrios, inside their mother, once they reach a certain size, the eggs are laid, and some time later, they hatch, as fully functional, 16 inch (based upon the &quot;An Iksar Broodling which spawns in PoF) versions of adults. Being fully developed like this when hatched, a new &quot;born&quot; Iksar broodling can immidiately eat solid food, like small bugs, worms, bread, and soft meats.<br>
<br>
Jaws - Iksars' jaw structure obviously has more in common with a Crocodile than a Lizard. The teeth, the jaw shape, and the placement of the tongue. What this inferes is that their jaws are also internally crocodilian. What this means -<br>
Crocodiles have a unique muscle overlapping the upper section of the back of their jaw which allows incredable crushing power behind the jaws themselves. This means that an Iksar's bite can be quite bone breaking if they really try. And considering Doomsar constantly builds his Jaw muscles... never let him bite you.<br>
<br>
======<br>
I know that many of the subjects covered are of an &quot;unclean&quot; nature, but this was intended as a fact sheet, with no aim to offend or disgust *anyone*. If there is something you see here which you feel is wrong, please feel free to politely, and in as much detail as possable, explain why. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer.<br>

(&quot;I don't care how you choose mates, I just wanna know, do you, you know, DO it, or do you just pee on the eggs after the fact?&quot;) I told her the eggs were fertilized internally. Got my rez. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Neat to see someone actually did some research that backs up my assumptions.<br>
<br>
I also like the tongue thing; I've never RPed having a forked tongue and I tend to tease other Iksar who speak with a lisp (I just assume it's a relatively common birth defect since so many people do it). But I've always imagined them having rather long tongues, and whenever some softskin asks me to teach them to speak Iksar (&quot;so I can speak to you in a proper language that won't grate on you so badly sir&quot;) I usually threaten to cut their tongue &quot;to loosen it&quot; so they can get the proper mobility to pronounce the language.<br>
<br>
When you mention a hole for &quot;solid waste&quot; are you then implying that there's another outlet for liquid waste, or does it all come out the same place? I've always thought the latter. Gave me a good one-liner once. Got in some argument with a softskin, who snapped, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.&quot; I deadpanned, &quot;Actually I have a cloaca,&quot; and as I recall that ended the discussion. Hehe.<br>
<br>
Here's another question for discussion: how many eggs do you suppose an average female lays at one time? Crocodiles lay a ton, but that's to compensate for the low survival rate of the young, and they're MUCH smaller relative to the parents.<br>

Only thing i would disagree with you here is how closely related Iksar are to gators and crocs then they are to lizards.<br>
<br>
First thing I noticed is the tail. Crocidillian tails are taller and thinner than a lizard's tail. Like a lizard, and Iksars tail is wider than it is tall. This brings me to my second finding...<br>
<br>
Swimming. with the old, non-luclin models on (or by watching the old model Iksar guards) you see the 'spiral&quot; through the water. Crocs 'wiggle' from side to side, using their tail as a paddle.<br>
<br>
Still, a very indepth post on some things most fleshies wouldn't even bother with (everybody knows how they 'do it').<br>

I've always thought personally that it would fit a race of disciplined, cold lizards out to terrorize the other races, that all eggs laid are gathered in a hatching ground somewhere. That's how my guild usually roleplays it; the females lay the eggs there, then leave, their duty completed. A separate caste tends the eggs, uses some sort of divinatory Shaman magic to assign a caste (class) to them. So Iksar are hatched into a class, and can immediately fend for themselves. The weak hatchlings that will only be a burden on the Empire are destroyed. Yes of course scraps of meat are thrown to them, but those who can't keep up with the strict training are removed, end of story. There is no coddling or nurturing.<br>
<br>
I've always thought of Klingons or the Aliens movies, in other words an alien, cold race. Creepy huh. Perfect to spread fear to all no? I'm only saying all this because of the number of times I've heard Iksar speak fondly of their mothers. That just makes no sense to me. And you're suppose to be scary and tough? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(Heh, we're in the same guild, and I was part of figuring out that explanation.) Perhaps, though, the Iksar that speak fondly of their parents had the egg-guardian caste as their biological parents or something. That could explain the personal closeness, as the egg-guardian caste members would be the only ones that do anything vaguely resembling nurturing. And I can see those caste members taking extra special care of their biological offspring, as they have a greater connection to those than to the other hatchlings. I don't usually question it too closely. To each their own.<br>
<br>
About lizard milk, I've roleplayed it previously as being a juice that really resembles milk from a fruit that grows only near Cabilis. *shrug*<br>

Female Iksar, sexy? <br>

IC: Sexy to other Iksar? Well, of course! Though I think the degree of 'sexiness' would ICly probably depend on the individual's personality as well as how close it is to mating season. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sexy to softskins?

Hello Korrgan!<br>
<br>
Hurray, another one who plays a female Iksar who agrees! *grins* oooh don't even get me started on this topic. I also think the new models are... pathetic. I wiggle my butt when I run. I stare at the floor, all demure and passive, and sit all dainty like. Yeah, I look really fierce and scary *sigh*. I cannot STAND the new models for that. After years of D&amp;D, I chose Iksar *because* I wanted to try something different. If I wanted to look all cute, I'd play a woodelf <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

...then luclin came along and gave you male tails <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Needless to say, I only turned on the luclin models long enough to get the picture under my name to the left here.<br>
<br>
As for a couple other things:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First thing I noticed is the tail. Crocidillian tails are taller and thinner than a lizard's tail. Like a lizard, and Iksars tail is wider than it is tall.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, Lizard tails tend to be very slender and very long, where as crocodilian tails are thicker and shorter, proportionally speaking.<br>
<br>
As far as caring for eggs, your speculations are as good as mine. I thought that as the eggs were lain, the perants would take it to the mystics for casting, then they would care for it for the youngest years of it's life. As the hatchling became aware and capable of making descisions (I'm guessing about 2 years old? 4? /shrug ) the would leave their biological familys and would be overseen by a teacher/master/perant figure, who would teach them the basics of survival and fear. As they reached an age where they could take charge of their life, the age of rebirth, they recieve an invite into the guild to which they had been assigned at egghood, and that is where the real story begins.<br>
But that's just how I always pictured it. Doesn't matter for either of my characters though, Gannor's (49 warrior) perants couldn't even afford to care for the egg, but his father has a small favor with Warlord Zyzz, whom he gave the egg to and Gannor was raised and trained by the Legion of Cabilis from hatch. Doomsar's (27 Shadowknight) mother was raped by Bloodscale the Vicious (and thusly, traumatized for the last 3 years of her life), and Doomsar grew up in the wilderness of Warsliks Woods, blessed by Cazic Thule with the power to spread fear and suffering. When he returned to Cabilis, Doomsar found it an easy task to join the ranks of Thule's holy knights, the Crusader of Greenmist.<br>
