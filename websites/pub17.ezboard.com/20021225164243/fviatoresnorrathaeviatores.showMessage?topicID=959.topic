Such groups shall maintain thier own web board area.  These groups will have a select number of members which are of sufficent level and skill to attempt various zones on Norrath.  The groups will select a night on which to raid or grind once or twice a month.  This is an attempt to set up a pre-planned grouping method for fun, experiance and skill learning.  Having the groups predefined helps get things organized much quicker (as you can tell we need work on this area).  Up till now this idea has been discussed in private but its time we take it to the rest of the guild so there is no misunderstanding.<br>
 <br>
Getting entrance to one of these groups should be voted upon based on a members grinding/raiding skills and the level they have obtained. Additional groups can be set up for various levels. Each group board area can be password protected so they may discuss issues pertaining only to that particular groups needs.<br>
<br>
Voting for membership to a group shall be made in the public forum. Voting method can be discussed under this post.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the method we used to add to the Order of the Arrow a special honor group for scouts. To get into the OA you had to be a certain rank in the troup and be elected by your Scout Troup. So you fellow troup members who were not even in the OA elected you to the OA. This type of voting gives the entire membership a hand on who gets to become a member based on the skills we are looking for.<br>
<br>
Side note: I have heard our activities may have led to someone leaving the guild...hearing this makes me upset we havent taken this to the guild sooner. The idea was to keep people not to lose them. There is no reason we can keep these ideas and keep the guild informed of the idea and thier eventual chance to join such a group.<br>
<br>
For me to draw up a full set of guidelines on the spur of the moment expecially with having to deal with RL issues cant be done right away. I think we can debate the guidelines issues via email or online in the officer area. But I love the idea but I agree with some others we need not keep it from the rest of the guild but we can control the access to the board area via password.<br>
<br>
I am not unopposed to using the EZboard membership method of access (as it stands now) if members of the group are voted in publicly.<br>

<br>
That's really all I could say about all of this. What was supposed to be a postive way to build groups and get together was turned into some ugly thing by one post. <br>
<br>
The reason for the bookclub was not to intentionally hurt anyone or be considered elite. It was being kept under wraps in the beginning until it could be established. We wanted people to know about it...but we wanted it to be a solid thing first. <br>
<br>
NOW...it's become rules and voting and guidelines....all things we were trying to avoid. Wyrdlan and I never intended for rules and voting...basically we wanted to group together with like minded people. If they had fun, great. If not they don't come. It was a simple as that or was supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Who was going to choose who was good enough? That was never an issue. There was not good enough, it was &quot;I want to learn&quot; The initial names were chosen as people who we could think of that would best be able to teach others eventually.<br>
<br>
Fedral,<br>
I'm actually really suprised at your accusations. How could you say they were not a personal attack? It was completly a personal attack and was way uncalled for. You could have voiced your reservations in a much better way than to call us elitists and other names. <br>
<br>
You chose the way of another guild to see the things in the game you wanted to see. To get the items you wanted to get. We wanted to see and do those things with VN...we thought that this was a way to do it. <br>
<br>
Hagas did know about it, I talked to him about it as Renah when we were in Burning Woods. <br>
<br>
Frankly scrap the whole thing. It's not worth it. The rules and guidelines and voting and all that Zapo...it's too much. In my opinion...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>DON'T make it public Zapo.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Just let it die. You posted in the officer section and now that it is getting out it is doing exactly what we were afraid of...Ven has left and I am sure others will to. <br>
<br>
I'm glad I'm not in the game right now...this has made me so very sad...<br>

<br>
I really don't know what the hell to say here. Unfortunatly, this is exactly the type of thing that I thought that this group was supposed to avoid.<br>
<br>
I had thought that Wyrdlan had made it clear what the purpose was. This was an idea that WYRDLAN formulated for HIM to have fun. He invited to this forum (a place outside of the game where those chosen could talk about plans outside of the game) those that HE liked grouping with. This wasn't started out as a super-secret society that met in darkened hallways wispering passwords and crap. It was a grouping designed BY HIM to maximize HIS play time.<br>
<br>
Did you get that? In case you missed it, let me say it again. This was an idea by him to maximize his limited play time. This was NOT, I repeat NOT an idea that was voted on by the officers of the guild. This was not even really a guild function, although it started with members of this guild because thats who we know. It was a last ditch effort to have fun in the guild again.<br>
<br>
Apparently that has failed. (pardon me Wyrd if I put words in your mouth there)<br>
<br>
I had decided weeks ago that I had outgrown the guild. I don't know half the people in the guild anymore because some of our officers went completely crazy with the /guildinvite command. Every day I log in and meet new people that I don't know and that dont know me. Im tired of some of our less mature guildmates treating others in the guild as thier own personal bots to be commanded and pestered untill they get thier way. <br>
<br>
When we DO actually get a function (raid, exp grind, whatever) off the ground Im tired of listening to those that did not bother to read the damn message of the day or the message boards to find out about it whine, bitch and complain that they didnt know, and that they want to come but are too low, and that we never plan stuff for them, or they need a rez at the zoneline cause they tried to come and got womped on anyway and on and on and on and on.....<br>
<br>
Ive been in this guild since June of 2000. I remember when we were afraid our guild was gonna get whiped in the server wipe a few years ago cause we went sure if we had 10 members in the guild anymore. I remember when we almost got absorbed by another guild, but just mamaged to hang on to enough people so that the guild would grow again.<br>
<br>
And grow it did. Its one of the older guild around. It has a good reputation. But now its time for me to leave. <br>
<br>
Its nothing personal. Its a game. Its supposed to be fun. But when someone decides to get all bent out of shape over something that I decide to do with an IMMAGINARY person in an IMMAGINARY game that it suddenly gets to real, and thats when I have to ask for my bill and check out of the room, because thats just to much.<br>
<br>
It's been a fun ride. I'm grateful to the people I've had a chance to meet and the places that I've gone with you. But I can't stand the garbage anymore.<br>
<br>
Given the statues of the guild, if I decide to come back someday, Im pretty sure I will be invited back. Maybe it will happen. Maybe it wont. We'll have to see what time brings.<br>
<br>
I still consider you all to be my friends, and will group with any of you in the situation arrises. But I wont be wearing a Viatores Norrathae tag for awhile. Its gonna be different. <br>
I'll still drop by the boards occasionally to say hello. I'll still look you all up in the game.<br>

This is exactly what I was talking about with the secrecy itself causing problems ..... if the &quot;Book Club&quot; had been posted as a board with a password I would have had no problem with its concept. The fact that only certain members were invited is in itself an example of what I was speaking about.<br>
If you had wanted a PRIVATE group in Guild to do this ... why invite people that you havent spoken to about it ... like myself and Hagas who claims not to have ever recalled any conversation about this topic.<br>
I had no idea what this was about until I started reading the posts.<br>

We told people online as we found you. I'm sorry that Ven left because of the secret of it. I wasn't going to remain secret.

Ven left Thor left and we are basically inactive.  But you know why I like earth and beyond you dont need a group to lvl or have fun.  I cant tell you how many times I would log on and ask if anyone wanted to group and got no response not like I dont have a character in almost all lvls so I did skill work and such and again no lvling<br>
We need tanks so I got bammer out of moth balls got her to 43 and then screeching halt no one want to group and believe me a warrior is not a soloist.  Who is to choose who is the privledged ones to be in a group.  And can we say clicky.  If I wanted to group with the same people all the time how many in a group 6.  Then I would join a guild of six.  This game is suppose to be fun but stops being so when some people can choose who gets to play and who doesnt.  I can understand why you are losing members lets get real we are a family and a family means helping out when you can and sharing and sometimes having to take a back seat to someone elses needs.  But I think that designated groups would suck cause who is on and does that mean when I log on I cant group with some of the guildys cause I am not their favorite?? How sad it would make me feel to be left out of a group and how sad would it make others.  I personally dont want to be responsible for hurting someone else by leaving them out cause they are not on a list.  Who is the one that is going to choose the list?  Well this is just an opinion but me like Qiara said I am glad I am not playing right now I have left the game in tears before and believe me that is not a stress relief to be hurt by a stupid game.<br>
<br>
Just an opinion and I am sorry that some of my friends have chosen to leave but they will still be my friend and I would group with any of them anytime if I do choose to come back more.  <br>
<br>
Again even a group hug seems to be out of the question at this point.  I logged in the other day and didnt see anyone on that I recognised except for the vendors in the bazaar I personally wish that when vendors are in bazaar they are anon so they arent on guild roster its frustrating saying hi and not getting a response back.  The Bazaar has in some ways ruined this game its become about loot and better loot and plat and more plat.<br>

Seabammer, and anyone else trying to level tanks around that lvl.  Vrusk Faarrgo and I group every Friday(almost) in Burning Woods Renah comes along when she can.  The purpose is to get some tanks to the lvl for raids(and get another chanter while we are at it)  Please give me a tell in game (Hagas, Faarrgo, Dentla all in Via) if you are interested. If the day isnt good I could change to Saturday as long as it is early on Saturday.  Prefer tanks but with the problems everyone is having we will take anybody.  Hagas is there for buffs and a couple heals only. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#445566><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bviatoresnorrathae.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zapostormlight>Zapo Stormlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guildmaster</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(11/23/02 9:59:58 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.eq-viatores.org/pics/Qiara-0401-0349.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Book Club groups</span><hr size=1> For an update Ven is Back.

Thor, Please dont leave it would be a great loss to this guild if we lost you.  In fact if any of you leave over what you all want...which is a friendly family guild with some time to really game when you can plan to.  Then your leaving for a reason we all agree on now anyways.  The only thing we need to do is figure out the hows.<br>
<br>
As its been said time and time again this was suppose to be a good thing.  Not ment to be a bad thing.  I think it still is a good idea and I do plan on taking it to the guild.<br>
<br>
We will set up various groups within the guild that can plan thier own grouping schedules.  These groups will be broken up by level and skills.<br>
<br>
I would like the support of all my officers on this new Book Club plan.<br>

Okay thats it time for a reality check from Mr. Furious. I can understand what the idea behind this Book Club is however to me it has nothing to do with what Via is all about. Now all i can say is listen up and listen good (This does NOT make me important but just trying to point out half this guild wouldnt even be in freaking EQ had i not introduced them to this game and VIA would not even exist.) Rule one VIA is family. Screw leveling, screw equiptment, you want that, go play somewhere else. I have my fun characters (VIA) and I have my power characters (UoP). When im done with the preasure and doldrums of power play I come back and play a VIA character. The one thing I have always loved about VIA is that everyones oppinion matters. There is a need for officers and the private areas to discuss things amongst themselves before putting this to the general populace. Do not misunderstand, I am not hurt at not being invited to this club, i could care less about how i rate with other people, however I am upset at the fact that we are promoting secrets even from other officers. If this was a personal idea for personal reasons as Thor stated then, it should have been on another board. Im gone for a while and i get an emergency email staing VIA is in trouble. I HATE what im seeing. I love you all and enjoy playing with everyone. Get your collective feelings, emotional problems, and bi-polar rantings out of the way now and lets get back to the fun!<br>

<br>
Wyrdlan and I proposed a &quot;bookclub&quot;, a group of same level individuals to meet and do things. Each would have a choice to pick a place, go get something (ie epic piece) just DO something on a specific night every other week. <br>
<br>
Did it start out secret? I suppose. We didn't want to answer the &quot;what is the book club and why am I not invited&quot; questions just yet. We planned to make a core group of people and then start incorporating others into it as they reached higher levels. It wasn't going to remain a secret, on the contrary, we would have rather it been something people strived to be a part of. We just wanted to get it established.<br>
<br>
Instead it's become some huge blown out of proportion thing all because there was a separate section on the board that others couldn't see yet. *heavy sigh*<br>
<br>
Whiteclaw, no offense but you are part of the problem. I've been told that if I want to see &lt;&lt;insert zone here&gt;&gt; or have &lt;&lt;insert item here&gt;&gt; I have to leave VN. So is my option to be like you and take Qiara to another guild in order to do that? It's a source of pride for me to NOT do that.<br>
<br>
I want to stay in VN, but I want to see places too. Places you already see. Places you talk about daily in the officer channel.  Do I fault you for taking Whiteclaw to Union of Power? No. Because at the moment it seems far easier. Qiara is recruited on a daily basis by other guilds. I stay in VN because I love VN and we dwarves are insanely loyal. <br>
<br>
Wyrdlan and I just tried to change some ways of thinking. Anyone who knows us knows that we bend over backwards for this guild. But we are growing restless and frustrated that nothing can be done without huge chunks of play time being consumed on mundane things like getting everyone to the zone.<br>
<br>
I'm told time and time again that Viatores is a family guild. You even say &quot;screw leveling, screw equipment that's not what Via is about&quot;. Why? Why can't we try and do some things? I'm not delusional to ever think we will be a power guild nor do I want it to be. But is it meant only to be a chat room? If thats the case I will quit trying. Because it would be easier to move Q out and leave my alts in as you did. <br>
<br>
I just need to know because frankly I have a headache about all this. <br>

I guess I am the bad guy here ... thats right ... its is all Fedrals fault .... I am the ONLY one who got mad about a &quot;secret invite only &quot; part of the forum ..... yup , I was the only person in the whole Guild who got mad about it .<br>
Even though Ven left over it.<br>
Even though the first person I told about it (Hagas ) was about to leave for another Guild when he found out.<br>
Even though the second person I told about it (Whiteclaw ) took 5 mins before I could knock him off the ceiling so he could make a post.<br>
But I am the only person in the Guild who had an objection too it.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
I was just the first person to FIND OUT and the first person to voice an objection.<br>
<br>
There is still a question that has remained unanswered :<br>
<br>
Why wasn't it just put in a passworded forum ?? Why was it important to hide it from most of the &quot;uninitiated&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats the part that still puzzles me ??  If this was meant to be a fixed group affair between Wyrd , you and a few others ... couldnt you have discussed on the officer board , or in E Mails ? My SOLE objection was the secrecy involved in this matter . Did it REALLY need to be hidden ??<br>
If as was posted that &quot;we were waiting to organize it better before revealing it to the rest of the board&quot; not an exact quote but something close , I still don't see the reason for something that has the appearance of impropriety even if it is meant for the most innocent of reasons.<br>
I just wan't you all to know I do love you , but I am an old man and have seen this kind of thing blow up in peoples faces too many times.<br>
<br>
Lets just roll the clock back and start with a fresh premise:<br>
Wyrd , Zapo and Qiara start a board with a password as an invitation only raid forum for the purpose of starting a monthly/weekly raid to maximize play time . The officers and members are informed about this on the main and officers board with the comment that since there will be very blatant and no holds barred critiques on raid performance and as such it will be password only to the members so no ones dirty laundry is exposed in public.<br>
The rank and file of the Guild look at it .. shrug and go back to their business  and laugh about the latest joke thread in on the forum and wish Jubbs happy birthday  , no one feels overly slighted , no one feels the urge to leave the Guild and the only comments are ... I would like to be a fly on the wall of THAT forum after a failed raid.<br>
<br>
Premise 2<br>
Forum is kept secret but secret gets out as they always do ...<br>
One member leaves over real or imagined slight ...<br>
Two or 3 other members consider leaving when informed.<br>
Fedral finds out and instead of blithely posting in the &quot;Where we should go first? &quot; thread , gets angry and in best Al-Queda style , and detonates a 100 megaton post that bruises a lot of egos and causes hard feelings among the Guild members who didn't see what the &quot;big deal&quot; was in the first place. <br>
<br>
I think the first premise would have been the way to go with it and I have said so numerous times in my posts these last two days and I have said it before and I will say it one last time <br>
<br>
I THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS GREAT BUT I SAW NO REASON TO KEEP IT HIDDEN FROM THE GUILD !!!<br>
<br>
Well thats my rant for this evening and thats all I have to post on this subjest until someone decides to take THIS post as a personal attack ( WHICH IT ISN'T ) I just felt it should have been handled better<br>
<br>
P.S. Do I feel I may have overreacted with the venom of my original post on the BC Board .... after reading it ... perhaps yes ... but I want you to understand that the very nature of a secret board SO offended me that I spoke from my anger and that was what seemed to offend most people .<br>
Also I would like those that supported the secret forum to take a deep breath ... step back and look at it from an outsiders view and tell me if YOU wouldn't have had a problem or been offended if some of your fellow Guildies were running their own private place that you couldn't even see ... regardless of what the reason for it was.<br>

<br>
All i ever wanted to do was play with my friends and have a good time. I was very proud to become an officer but i will not vote on people that i feel MAKE THE GRADE that are able to play in certain areas on certain nights. <br>
<br>
If all i wanted to do is get my characters to level 65 then i would never joined the VN guild i would have looked at a uber guild to level as fast as i could.I spend 90% of my time helping others hence the name if you haven't noticed. I have been 46, 47 for almost four months now. I thought that VN was a family guild and if so would never sit there and allow one family member over another. <br>

You did attack calling us elitists. Not personal? Your quote: &quot;I would like those that supported the secret forum to take a deep breath ... step back and look at it from an outsiders view&quot; You're saying anyone who deemed it a good idea was wrong. Don't you think we did that? <br>
<br>
I'm sorry Fedral but can you come off of your high horse for one moment please? I teasingly call you guys the &quot;boys club&quot; but some of that isn't too far off the mark. Up until yesterday when Hagas posted...when did you guys ever offer up coming to group with you? I had to initially invite myself along as Renah, and granted you've invited me after, but never have I ever heard you guys say &quot;Hey we are going to go grind in Burning Woods anyone level 40ish wanna come?&quot; <br>
<br>
When someone wanted to know if Viatores could do the ring war in Great Divide, your comment in guild was &quot;What a colossal wipe out that would be&quot; and &quot;I've been there, done that, have the T-shirt&quot; Well ya know what? I haven't. And I'm on short supply of T-shirts.<br>
<br>
Yes my feelings are being hurt over this. Your initial post stated if we had a &quot;SHRED of honor or LOVE for their fellow Guildies to boycott this idea and forum until it is made public&quot;<br>
Ouch. Do you want to question my support of this guild? Do you want to compare notes on what we have done for the guild? <br>
<br>
Frankly, any of the proposed ways of doing the &quot;book club&quot; idea will be taken badly. The first time someone leaves because they are not invited? They are offended that they got told what to do? We don't invite them along anymore? What do we do then? This whole thing, to use your phrase, is a colossal wipe out. You think there would have been any less hard feelings if we had made it public from the outset? You honostly believe they would have shrugged and moved on? I know they wouldn't have. Because I know this guild.<br>
<br>
It's already gone that way with Ush and Ven. They both know how much I love them. They are two of my oldest EQ friends. But because they weren't &quot;Initial invites&quot; merely because of their level...They think horrible things about this all. Ush saying he wasn't &quot;privledged&quot; enough to be invited in that forum. I think he would have felt that way if he could see it or not. (Sorry Ush if I'm putting words in your mouth) Honostly we invited level 50 plus at first only because we thought those were the people who could best help us set this up.<br>
 <br>
No it's not that you are the bad guy Fedral. Apparently that is me, or Wyrdlan, or anyone else that thought it was a good idea. <br>
<br>
So you wanted to know &quot;Why wasn't it just put in a passworded forum ?? Why was it important to hide it from most of the &quot;uninitiated&quot;?<br>
<br>
What kills me is that we were going to email it out. We were telling people as we saw them in game. I guess what we shouldn't have done is made a place on the board that couldn't be accessed by everyone until we were done setting everything up. We had hoped to get input from the ones we invited before we had everyone asking questions. We wanted to not have any hurt feelings. Hindsight and all that.<br>
<br>
I wash my hands of all of it. I'll just continue as I have been, grouping with friends and other guilds to get my T-shirts. I'll see you guys in January when I get back.<br>

I think at this point guys there is no reason to keep discussing this point, other than to dig trenchs in our positions and hunker down for a lot of hurt feelings. My post was only to express my feelings on the issue not to hurt anyone elses and I'm sorry if I did. Unfortunately its very hard to really discuss things on a post as you cant really clarify what your saying as someone is reading it, you just need to wait for their reply and see how they took what you meant. I have NO doubt that what the Book Club started out as was a genuinely good idea with good intentions that unfortunately, in its execution ,made for hurt feelings and shock amongst the officers. <br>
Just to clarify a quick point on my post... I'm not saying Via will never be able to get anything, there are many raid areas Via will be able to do but, some that will be FOREVER unatainable due to the nature of casual gameplayer Via tends to have. Small raids and the like are fine and I will support them with any of my characters, however (and the reason Whiteclaw is back in UoP after years of trying and failing) we have tried over and over again to get raiding off the ground and i just does not seem to work. I dont want to seem like a quiter and to many of you I might but, it is just easier to go where you need to go to obtain the items you need and then return to Via.<br>
Qiara, I hope to see you back soon January is a long way off. Anytime any of you would like to come on a raid with UoP and meet the minimum level requirements (unfortunatley raids are 55+, 58+ and 60+) depending on where we are going.<br>

<br>
Wyrdlan, might I suggest you open up the forum and let others see what it was meant to be rather than the bad word of mouth that is circulating.<br>
<br>
Whiteclaw and Fedral, I apologize. I felt punched in the gut and retaliated. I'm sorry I said things harshly to you.<br>
<br>
Ven, Ush and any others that were offended by this idea, I'm sorry that it came out all wrong. We honostly just wanted to get something done. It got blown way out of proportion.<br>
<br>
I will be on vacation until the second week of January with no access to EQ (probably a good thing) but can check the boards and read my mail. I'm with Whiteclaw, there is only bad feelings about it all we need to let it die.<br>

I told all involved in this that this would happen .... I was made to feel like the worlds biggest @#%$ for posting my STRENUOUS objections to the concept of a &quot;private hidden forum&quot; . I said that this would cause strife when it got out ... and it did ...... I TRIED to warn everyone yet I was made to feel as if I had done something evil and wrong . I wash my hands of it ... I am sick of being made to feel as if I had done something wrong by objecting to something on moral grounds.<br>
<br>
This Guild has always been about friendship and family but the attitude that has been shown here has caused this rift.<br>
<br>
And just for those of you who were not lucky enough to be &quot;invited&quot; to the private forum , this was the copy of the thred I posted on that private board when I was made aware of its existnce and this was my attitude towards it<br>

   And you REALLY think this is a GOOD idea <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Just throwing my 2 cents in and my 55 gallon of high octane fuel on the fire <br>
I was &quot;invited&quot; this little soire because I had met some unknown &quot;pre requisite&quot;<br>
I got news for you folks ... this little &quot;secret society&quot; your little board here has the potential to totaly demolish this Guilds cohesion and the love and TRUST that we have .<br>
Notice TRUST is in CAPS folks thats because this Guild was founded on love and trust.<br>
This &quot;secret forum&quot; is as blatant a slap in the face of that trust as I have ever seen.<br>
If you wanted a little &quot;club&quot; and forum that you wanted to form for the purpose of raiding then do it in the OPEN and explain that it is meant to train the higher levels in the art of raiding<br>
Secrets like this ALWAYS get out and when they do this Guild will see a fracture and loss of trust that it will NEVER recover from.<br>
The U.S. Army trusted me with a Secret Clearance so I can keep my mouth shut about your dirty little secret here but I catagoricaly REFUSE to take part in anything as long as this forum and its purpose and existance remain closed to the rank and file of this Guild and I urge any members that have a SHRED of honor or LOVE for their fellow Guildies to boycott this idea and forum until it is made public<br>
<br>
Oh one more thing ... If I am REMOVED from this forum and blocked from observing the foulness that goes on here , I make promise that I will report its existance and contents to the whole Guild and do my best to cause EVERY member I can get to leave the Guild and never associate with any member of this private little clique.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Was it overly dramatic : YES<br>
Was it overly critical : YES<br>
Was it meanspirited : perhaps<br>
<br>
Was I totaly outraged because the revelation of this forum had caused someone I liked a lot to leave the Guild : YES<br>
I will say again , I was taking what I saw as a MORAL stance against something I thought was as wrong as wrong could be .<br>
I dont like secrets of any type , hate them , they disgust me.<br>
Thats my rant and if anyone needs to make any comments you can e Mail me at Bspinelli@CFL.RR.COM   I welcome your comments whether you support my stance or not <br>
