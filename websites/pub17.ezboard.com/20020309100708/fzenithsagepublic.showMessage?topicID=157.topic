Is that the way it works at the high end whoever gets in first gets the Plane? I understand you have no use for the Fennin Ro calender and since Verant doesn't support it that's cool.  I read your boards and it seems you work hard at not KSing and jumping on others kills at least if it's a guild that you percieve can hurt you. I took particular note how you worked things out about kills in TOV. I guess it's different to &quot;plan&quot; a TOV raid than a fear raid. Well, I am glad to see you at least rezzed the previous nights wipeouts. That was the only reason I bothered staying at the portal when you all started showing up and made it clear that you didnt care that we were there. I do appreciate the one member of 40 present who at least aknowledged you didn't bother with the calender So anyway the fact we were organizing at the portal before a single ZS member showed up and you still went ahead and  organized a jump is that what it was shows me the honor in your hearts. What really bothered me most was that I was not familar with your guild and had told the wizard who showed up first that i was sure he would be welcome to come with us.

We were at the portal before you. Just the facts. I just wanted to keep it straight. No flames just the truth. I didn't want it to appear you helped us in anyway...you didn't other than ruin our hunt. So that is the deal if you zone in first it's your zone? Gathering at the portal first doesn't matter? FYI you  you whine about other guilds being ruthless how were you not?... Not in a million years would I or anyone I would bother grouping with ever start to set up a raid after someone else told me that they were just waiting for more to arrive and invited me on to join them in it. The words ruthless and rude come to mind. Is that what your guild does or  was what happened an an exception? I have just asked a question  and told you what i thought about what you did? Was it right?  If so this isn't a flame. if it was wrong well i for one understand people get a little screwed up over phat lewt and lose there values...maybe that's what happened to you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uwrowin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wrowin</A> at: 11/23/01 7:17:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uwrowin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wrowin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 4:59:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1>  Yes calender is pathetic it might give the newb guilds a chance to raid ...o wait  our boards are older than yours not a newb guild one of the older guilds...just one with different values than yours... people before loot<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ufabforever.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fabforever</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 5:04:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1> Kenny...

But I can take any and all personal experiences and observations into account to come up with a justified view of your guild.<br><br>In your news section, you talk about someone training your guild to preserve a spawn for his guild.  The comments you make on that page all insinuate that you frown upon such dishonorable acts, and you quote as to saying &quot;We shall obtain our victory by way of a human being.&quot;  What seperates a human being from other animals?  The ability to act in a civilized manner and show compassion for those around them.  When you jump ahead of our forces to jump into the Fear plane before we can assemble all the people that were going to join us is not acting in a civilized manner and most definetly not showing compassion.  These transgressions contradict what you say you are all about.  I suppose it is alright for you to obtain victory by way of something other than a human being, but the second it is done to you, it must be reported to a GM.<br><br>The Fennin Ro calendar has never been enforced by VI and probably never will.  It is something that higher lvl guilds ignore, but probably paid close attention to them when there were other people that would steal it from them.  There are many social laws that have more or less become recognized in the three years or so Everquest has been around.  Lets take for example the camping policy.  VI does not recognize camps, but what if a group came to one of your groups and attempted to take a camp from you?  Nothing can be done about it by the GMs, you will have to share the spawn.  I imagine we would all agree that the person trying to steal the camp from you acted in a dishonorable manner in the eyes of the average player.  <br><br>You did the same thing to us.  Instead of our group camping a spawn, we were getting ready to a Plane, which is recognized as a one raiding group place by Everquest players.  There is no recourse we can seek from VI, but that does not change the fact that you acted in a dishonorable manner.<br><br>When you do things to screw ppl over, it does give us the oppurtunity to judge your values.  It may not have as much creedance as you would get from a guild member, but we can still make a fair judgement.  The only way a non-guild member can make any sort of judgement on a guild is by personal interaction.  On Saturday, November 17 we were all given the chance to personally deal with your people.  Rather than leaving with a deep respect for an honorable guild, we were left with the amount of respect usually felt towards a high school drop out.<br><br>Sage:  proceeding from or characterized by wisdom, prudence, and good judgment.<br><br>It is possible that you made a poor judgement on 11/17.  But I would tend to think a guild calling themselves &quot;Zenith Sage&quot; would be incapable of doing so.  I don't normally judge anyone by their guild tag or those they hang out with.  But after seeing 30 or so members of your guild act in such a poor manner, I have no choice but to look upon your guild as an uncivilized group of people only capable of showing courtesy to those in a position to further their own interests.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/usqualls77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squalls77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 12:18:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1> hmm I think one cant camp things he cant kill...well i mean he can try camp it, and tell his guild to fast come to kill it when the mob spawn, but he cant claim it and not letting other people who are ready and have enough to kill it.

All that were on was just saying one thing &quot;we planned PoF, go away.&quot; <br><br>We do what we can with what we have. Last thing, I'm sorry we mess up you guy's plans, but we were on limited time to reach our goals. We cannot wait for all Sacred Guardians to wake up, and then wait for you guys to proceed with your plans. Things changes. <br><br>good hunting - Gargo<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ujimjim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jimjim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Prince of Aeroplane</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 1:23:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1> Woot Gargo your English express very well !!<br>Nothing meaning lol ~ <p><h3><blink><I><font color=Red >Jimjim</I></font></blink></h3><h5>Halfling Cleric</h5></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uwrowin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wrowin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 1:31:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1> not true i was the Sk and we would of been glad to let you take Cazic. I got a reaponse from onme member who only told me you didnt use calender.  When we did hate TMO came in and did inny no problems at all. WE DIDNT WANT CAZIC WE WANTED WHAT TO YOU WAS PROBABLY YARD TRASH. I was hunting the necro waiting for more to arrive. You had full knowledge we planned to go in, in 2hrs when your first member the wizard showed up.  After all  i had told him he could join us if he wanted to do fear. We new Ruiss was in fear  they are SG allies and we had checked calender. The  yard trash we wanted would of been respawning.  Yours and a few high level guilds can't use calender the rest of Fennin RO does. MAybe if you started using it more woul d and you wouldn't have 2 or 3 guilds that were going with us thinking so little of you now. Saturday morniung I asked one of yours if he would like to come and group with us. I probaly shouldn't of told him we were raiding then maybe you wouldn't of all been there an hr later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ukiratano666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiratano666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 1:39:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1>   Hmm, i really dislike reading such threads that are insulting my guilds values and saying that we did a dishonourable act.<br>  I have been on countless raids and played EQ for over 2 years and i am proud to say that when i joined zenith sage i met some of the friendliest and fairest players that i had the pleasure of meeting in my eq life so far. Please do not judge a guild or its members by a misunderstanding of sorts, i find it to be offensive and assuming. Raids are events that cater for large amounts of people, usually people in a guild together.     Certain zones and mobs are a challenging target for guilds and the players benefit from it in many ways. They are involved in a social activity where teamwork and tactics are used to achieve ones goals, the bottom line is that it is a fun thing to do, regardless of what loots or etc is involved. Now getting on to my main point :  if what you state is true, that you place people values before loots then think about this please. I as a member of Zenith Sage am not aware of your guilds plans, i have never seen this calendar that ppl speak of, and i attend raids to have fun with my friends. If there are 40 members of ZS gathered together and are ready for an event, do you think that it is right of you guys to have 3 people stand at the zone in and claim it as yours? I dont think that it is nice or honourable to expect a full turn out of guild members leave because a few ppl are planning to go somewhere later. Do you expect a ZS officer to say to the 40 members that gathered there to log and go to sleep because another guild is going to gather their members in the next few hours? To me that doesnt make sense. This situation reminds me of a long time ago when i used to group in OS and you would have a full group ready to move to King or Chef or etc. but there would be 1 or 2 persons claiming that camp from zone in. If what u say is true, that u value people before you do loot then i think you will understand what i mean because that is exactly the way i think too. <br>  <br>Anyway, be safe and good hunting in the lands of Norrath. I am a well wishing person and all the best to Sacred Guardians.

It unfortunately does require planning for us to do raids like fear and we can't just on a whim decide lets go do CT and who cares if anyone else was trying to have some fun today.<br><br>Selfish greed rules EQ and has for a long time. <br><br>It would not have been that big a deal for you to give us a few hours to have some fun and hopefully get some of our members some gear that they would not otherwise be able to obtain. We both know that SG is not capable of killing CT so it's not like you had any reason to fear us taking him from you.<br><br>What this boils down to (and ZS are of course not the only offenders) is that the larger/higher level guilds don't remember when they were small and low level and have no respect for their fellow EQers. Fine you were shouting out loot but would you not have been complaining about there being too many players in the zone? and it would have caused you lag problems had we zone our forces in while you were trying to clear the zone and kill CT. Also the loot was only half the reason for going to fear and it would be foolish to zone in there risking death and possibly wasting your time CRing us just to sit on out butts and wait for the drops.<br><br>I feel sorry for people and guilds who think EQ is just about the loot and have no fun playing. Why bother playing if you take no joy from the game, only care about loot and step on the little guy at every opportunity to satisfy your greed?<br><br>I suggest you take a good look at TKR and TMO and learn from their example. Both those guilds have changed their ways 180 degrees and as far as I can see they are not suffering by being a bit nicer. You don't have to be assholes to do well in this game and you'll probably have a lot more fun.<br> <p>Bamorm Canisrufus, Beloved of Clarissiana Moira - 57 ShamanSacred Guardians</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ukiratano666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiratano666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 2:04:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  a reply to Vhaevictis</span><hr size=1>   You are well spoken Vhaevictis, but i think you have misjudged the whole situation and did not talk with ZS officers because you thought we do not care. We were not there to farm armor, we have no need for it. If you guys would have talked to our officers i am sure that you could have had it all. Our target was Cazik Thule and we cannot sit down at zone in and wait for 6 or 8 hours  for you guys to clear the zone before we can go in and attempt Cazik. I think it is fair to say that u guys would not have been attempting Cazik. A final note : people do not go to the PoF for experience, i remember my early days of going to planes raids and i also remember usually losing exp. U guys wanted the armor and you could have had it without worries. If you would have attempted to communicate with ZS officers it probably would have ended up with you guild not having to kill anything just chilling out while we kill stuff and you loot all the armor you want. I wonder if you would be thinking the same of ZS in that case as you are atm. Communication is essential, and a good way to make friends and work things out. <br>    Bye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Kiratano Hyperclaw<br>Grandmaster of Drunken style kung fu ( can i have another stack of elven fish wine and oggok swamp khalish please? hehe) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/ubalbanbattlefist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balban Battlefist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 2:45:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: a reply to Vhaevictis</span><hr size=1> I can't remember in recent history TMO, TKR, DoA, RoA or any other guild checking with us about what we are planning to kill.

We do something else.<br>I wasn't even aware the calander still exsisted.<br>I'm also pretty new to ZS but I have never witnessed them act in a rude fashion. If you were in there already killing or about to zone in we would have left and done something else. Thats the way 90% of guilds I have seen work. And us complaining about another guild TRAINING us to KILL us while we fight a mob is not even remotely comparable to this situation.<br> Kiratano is right, its rude to expect 40 people to wait and waste their time. I understand that because we have no ally guild and we have the power to move about quickly and kill what we choose that we may seem aloof and arogant, but ZS members are among the nicest people I've met in the game.<br> I have to stress and I'm not sure if you guys raid velious much. Its normaly first there with the power gets it, no disrespect to the faster guild.
