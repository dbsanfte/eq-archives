I said the same thing earlier to someone who was whining, and because of that, I was basically told I was no longer in the guild. It hurt my feelings greatly, which is why I don't hang out around you guys anymore. <br>
<br>
There will always be people who want the world handed to them on a silver platter. Well, I've done 61 levels and never have I had a group ready and waiting for me. I do the LFG dance, I solo, I tradeskill, I fish, I entertain myself. The burden of enjoying this game lies upon you, not your guild. It will always be that way.<br>
<br>
Friends are great, guilds are great, but a guild is NOT obligated to powerlevel you, entertain you, provide raids for you. If you want these things, you must initiate them yourself. That is how I got my epic done, that is how I got my 8th shawl done (nearly), that is how I got to level 61. You make choices, and you live with them, but bitching doesn't accomplish anything. If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.<br>
<br>
As it is, I know that people in Via will forever &quot;blame&quot; me for Barc going away because I told him the same thing - to quote &quot;Clerks&quot;, @#%$ or get off the pot. But life is too short to coddle some people... who would I rather be around, someone who is complaining that they can't get a group, or a person who is trying to start up a group in &lt;x&gt; zone?<br>
<br>
I removed Yvanna from the guild because I saw less and less people I knew, and more and more people who just wanted stuff from me and I had no clue who they were. I didn't feel like part of the family anymore - when I asked for help on a rare spawn that I had camped for over a day, I got told &quot;why don't you ask your new guild&quot; by Oakbeard, even though Yvanna had just sold several sow potions at guild prices and port potions at cost to Viatores members, buffed Viatores members in the nexus, gave items to Viatores members... That day I removed all my alts from Viatores, and stopped giving Viatores guild prices. <br>
<br>
And then there was the day I asked a certain guildmember personally come to my final epic fight - planned it all around her - and not only was she TWO hours late, she made it sound like an inconvience, even though I planned it all around HER schedule, even rescheduled for her. Instead I ended up wasting four other people's time who now have a very bad opinion of her. It is a pity, cause her epic bit dropped during the first fight which she missed, which I had reserved for her, which was one of the reasons I wanted her there, but it went to the other people cause she wasn't there.<br>
<br>
Since then I have never asked Viatores for anything. I am doing my shawl event soon, and I thought of inviting Viatores, because I thought it would be fun, but I don't, because I know it will be &quot;why don't you ask your new guild&quot; (who are coming in spades, by the way). Or you will be two hours late, and upset that we don't stop and wait for you, when it is a moving event that cannot go back for stragglers. So I don't invite Viatores to events anymore.<br>
<br>
I still love the Viatores members that I know, and will still group gladly with them, offer them help and advice, but I got tired of people complaining because *I* leveled faster than them, *I* made choices they didn't like, *I* got my epic... well, guess what! I get that behavior from my jealous sister. I have to deal with that in IRL, I won't deal with it from strangers. Good things come to those who work for them. Comparing yourself to anyone is stupid, they are different people, they have different motivations, and different luck.<br>
<br>
And that's all I have to say really, other than I am still here for my friends, but I have seen the ugly, selfish side of Viatores, and have NO desire to return.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eq-viatores.org/pics/Harvyst-1030-0800.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I basically agree with most of your points, however...<br>
<br>
There are a few errors I had noticed in your post.<br>
<br>
First off, regarding Barclaral's departure and the posts that had to do with it, it was stated that you were not THE guild.  It didn't mean you weren't PART of the guild.  That had been let known to you, both in posts and tells because I had been one of the people to have sent you a tell about it in game.  I'm not going to rehash this again.<br>
<br>
Second, about your battle in which you had asked Qiara and Oakbeard for help.  You had sent me a tell asking if there were any Viatores on, a cleric and melee duo, that could help you out.  I told you that I would check.  No one on was of sufficient level save for Qiara and Oakbeard that I had mentioned above.  So it was I that had told you to ask them to see if they were free.  Was I also to assume that I was to send each of them a tell to let them know they were needed by you for your quest?<br>
<br>
Did you know that Oakbeard was a new invite, a close friend of both mine and Qiara's?  Did you know that he wasn't around to see you guilded and unguilded from Viatores?  Did you also figure out that unless Oakbeard had been in the guild for a sufficient amount of time, he wouldn't have known that your alt was Yvanna?  And did it ever occur to you that if he had done a /who all Harvyst, he wouldn't have seen [61 oracle] Haryvst &gt;Viatores Norrathae&lt;, but instead [61 oracle] Harvyst &gt;Sanctuary of the Silver Moon&lt;?  Why then, would he want to help a non-guildie?  Or did you have all that explained to him beforehand?<br>
<br>
Did it also occur to you that the two of them were already engaged in a group, or busy doing something?  Were they to drop everything and rush to help you?  From what I had been told, it sounded as if you expected them to do exactly just that.  If your own newfound guild wasn't to help you, why would you, why should you expect us to run and help?  Do you see my reasoning?  We could have been wondering why you didn't ask your guild in the first place.  If I had known you were to 'demand' help, I would have never referred you to them.  And for that, Oakbeard and Qiara, I deeply apologize.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, and lastly, to quote you:<br>
&quot;bitching doesn't accomplish anything&quot; and<br>
&quot;I have seen the ugly, selfish side of Viatores, and have NO desire to return.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh really?  What about the times you bitched in guildchat about the many combines you had to do until a trivial, the amount of plat you're losing because of it, and the pain in your wrist due to carpel tunnel?  What about asking repeatedly of the guild to buy your items, at cost or even slightly lower so that you could have more space to do even more combines?  Sure, you made it sound like it was doing US a favor, to help us increase our CHA stats, and for us to sell at higher prices for a little bit of profit.  But it was all a means to an end, an end in which resulted in you benefitting in getting to a higher skill in pottery and whatnot.<br>
<br>
And what of the times when someone posted a request for help on certain projects or quests?  I've seen nothing but GLOATING from you.  More often than not, I've seen posts from you not offering to help, saying &quot;Sure, I'll be there to help&quot; but instead I've seen posts saying, &quot;This &gt;insert mob here&lt; was so easy! All it took was a group of &gt;insert high level range here&lt; and you just needed to &gt;insert instructions here&lt;.  I got this item in &gt;insert time here&lt;.&quot;  What, we didn't know what it'd take to take those mobs down?  If we didn't, we wouldn't have been asking for help from others to help complete it!  <br>
<br>
As for the ‘ugly, selfish side of Viatores,” don’t associate a few people’s reactions or doings with the entire guild.  Not unless you can tell me there are no selfish people in your current guild, not a single one.<br>
<br>
So remove me from your friends list if you want, since I'm not even sure I was ever on it.  Even after I got help from you in making the steins, I'd tried to keep in touch with you, to say hi when I saw you on.  But really, whenever, if I even do, get a tell from you, it was to ask me or Viatores to help.  So now, I've seen the &quot;ugly, selfish side&quot; of YOU.  If you want to tell me different, go ahead.  Perhaps we can still be friends.  But unless you prove otherwise, I won't bother even saying hi to you anymore even if you were right in front of me.  Then again, you probably would think I'm just some lowby who doesn't even deserve the attention from you.<br>
