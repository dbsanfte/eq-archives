An actual letter from home from a Marine with the multinational force in Bosnia: <br>
<br>
Dear Dad, <br>
<br>
A funny thing happened to me yesterday at Camp Bondsteel (Bosnia): A<br>
French army officer walked up to me in the PX, and told me he thought we<br>
(Americans) were a bunch of cowboys and were going to provoke a war in<br>
Iraq. He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on<br>
the support of France. I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War, their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface [again] at some point in the near future anyway. <br>
<br>
I also told him that is why France is a third-rate military power with a socialist economy and a bunch of pansies for soldiers. I additionally told him that! ! America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to do, and France's support, if it ever came, was only for show anyway. Just like in ALL NATO exercises, the US would shoulder 85% of the burden, and provide 85% of the support, as evidenced by the fact that this French officer was shopping in the American PX, and not the other way around.  He began to get belligerent at that point, and I told him if he would like to, I would meet him outside in front of the Burger King and whip his ass in front of the entire Multi-National Brigade East, thus demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight in him than the average Frenchman. He called me a barbarian cowboy and walked away in a huff. With friends like these, who needs enemies? <br>
Dad, tell Mom I love her, <br>
<br>
Your loving daughter, <br>
<br>

You are the President of the United States. Scientists have <br>
discovered that a meteor is headed straight towards the <br>
earth. They have calculated that it will strike France in <br>
2 days at approximately 2:30 A.M eastern time. The meteor <br>
is large enough to completely wipe France from the face of <br>
the earth forever. <br>
<br>
France and the United Nations have urgently requested that <br>
the United States fire all of its missiles at the meteor <br>
and that it send all available ships, troops and aircraft <br>
to help evacuate the country. Many of the ships and planes <br>
you could be sending are being used to fight the war on <br>
terror overseas. <br>
<br>
As the President, you must decide: <br>
<br>
Do you stay up late on the night of the impact to <br>
watch the coverage live on CNN, or do you tape it <br>
and watch it in the morning?<br>

&quot;The French are a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any<br>
better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore. True, you can sit<br>
outside in Paris and drink little cups of coffee, but why this is more<br>
stylish than sitting inside and drinking large glasses of whiskey I<br>
don't know.&quot;<br>
--- P.J O'Rourke (1989)<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, the French remind me a little bit of an aging actress of<br>

the face for it.&quot;<br>

&quot;You know why the French don't want to bomb Saddam Hussein? Because<br>

&quot;I don't know why people are surprised that France won't<br>
help us get Saddam out of Iraq. After all, France wouldn't help us<br>
get the Germans out of France!&quot;<br>

----------------------------------------------<br>
I thought it was funny.  I would just like the French to know and understand where we are coming from.  Perhaps if the Effiel Tower were the target of the Terrorist planes thier opinion on war would be different.<br>

Like the US cares about one dictator, they sponsered enough off them during the cold war ! <br>
<br>
Saddam included. Anyway the fact the moral justification for war only surfaced after a few months of calling for war with Iraq makes me severely doubt its the reason.<br>
<br>
Oh and as a side note I'm not anti american, I like most americans. Could hardly play Everquest where the majority of players are from the US if I didn't, and I mentioned Al Queda having no connection to Iraq as being a possible reason for the French not supporting the present war drive because Zapo said he felt the French didn't understand how Americans felt after Sept 11th. <br>
<br>
What I dislike is the insults being thrown at France for having a different view on the best way towards disarming Iraq. Its not even like they are saying he shouldn't be disarmed.

Would have given you a link to the right articles but the Irish Times web site went pay to access a while back. Its a good paper as its keeping itself neutral to the whole issue, and is reporting both sides and views quite well, although all papers mess up some facts.<br>
<br>
From the March the 12th Issue of the Irish Times is a headline 'France is proud of Chirac's stance on trying to avert war'. From the same article 'Rarely if ever has there been such unanimous praise for a French leader.' The whole article is alot bigger with quotes from several French pappers. There are some french people who disagree but are discribed in the article as 'If the Left was laudatory, the Right - with the exception of a handful of Atlanticist deputies worried about the state of France-American relations - went beyond effusive.' I can write up the whole article if you want.<br>
<br>
Also from poles done here, in England, and Spain the majority in each country is in favor of avoiding war. lol not that Irelands view counts for much but the other two are more important. Odly enough Chirac got alot of votes in the last French election because the favorite, according to the poles, supporters didn't show up in large enough numbers to get him into the last two candidates. The other candidate was basicaly a facist and this lead to a huge turn out of voters voting for Chirac just to stop the other candidate getting elected. While Blair who has been very popular is now facing serious problems in his own party and droping popularity ... luckly the other parties in England seem unelectible so only realy has to worry about the trouble within his own party. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#445566><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bviatoresnorrathae.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nuanil>Nuanil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(3/16/03 9:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1084.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sounds like...</span><hr size=1> .. teh state of POlitics here in Canada as well.

If you do oust Saddam it's gonan take a tonne of money and more than a lightyear of patience to get to rebuild the country economically, politically and socially.  <br>
<br>
THe americans get a bad rap in countries liek that due top intense censorship and the, wuite honestly, the US's habit of playing policeman for the world.  Need I mention the Helms Burton Law?  A trade sanction that they try to enforce on other countries just because Fidel Castro is in charge of Cuba. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#223344><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bviatoresnorrathae.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morraganeverhate@viatoresnorrathae>Morragan Everhate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(3/16/03 9:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1084.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sounds like ...</span><hr size=1> Well America is likely to stay in Iraq and enforce a pro US regime ... hopefully that won't involve putting somebody as bad as Saddam in charge(which IMHO is the reason for the war, espically with the growth of fundamentlist factions and anti US feeling in Saudi).<br>
<br>
But there are other problems. The Iraq military is likely to deploy mostly in the cities, while this won't stop the US from beating them will lead to increased losses to the US and civilian deaths. Also Iraq has had anti american propaganda for the last 12 years using things like the embargo of medical supplies to make alot of the Iraq citizens hate the US. Rebuilding Iraq will be complicated by the three factions that make up Iraq, the Kurds who are planing to land grab when the war starts and want independence from any Iraq state, and the two muslim factions.  Thrown in the fact fundementalist muslims will view this war as an attack on muslims as a whole which will lead to increased recrutment for terrorists and there are some nasty side effects. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#445566><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bviatoresnorrathae.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zapostormlight>Zapo Stormlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guildmaster</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#D3D0CB>(3/17/03 12:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1084.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eq-viatores.org/pics/Qiara-0401-0349.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sounds like ...</span><hr size=1> Well the current public opinion here in the US was reported to be 2 to 1 in favor of military action by the President for removing Saddam.  Looks like we are fed up with Saddam as much as the president is.  History shows with this kind of support for the war that we should win quickly.<br>
<br>
I guess we feel Saddam has declared war on us some time ago so we are just aggreeing to his own declaration; however although he could never carry out his threats except though terrorists.  We now take such threats as true acts of war and we will end it.<br>
<br>
I am sure no one will disagree that Saddam has threatened the US and its President.  Well now that we can see what terriorist are capable of we wont take such threats lightly.<br>
<br>
From TV reports from Bagdad we can see their are those that do not support Saddam but for fear for thier own life they remain quiet.  Hopefully we can liberate them to a Free Iraq.  In fact there are reports that Bagdad will have an Elite team of US Marrines and Pro US Iraq exiles (who make up a large part of the team) will be night dropping into Bagdad the night of the start of the war.  Their job will be to distrupt the internal communications and efforts by Saddam in Bagdad.<br>
<br>
It looks like Saddam has one last chance...leave or else.<br>

  He and his countrymen have ove 1 billion, yes billion dollar, US dollars, tied up in selling arms and pieces to make arms to Mr. Suddam.  Also, Mr. Chirac is a devout totalitarian himself,<br>
 take the actions of about 3 years ago, where he tried to push his anti-any religon but Roman Catholicism, thru the government in France.  That was staved off by a small, but once again mostly US demonstration.  <br>
 Anti-war facts:<br>
 The US put Suddam in the postion he is in.. we gave him the bombs and guns we are now trying to get him to dispose of.<br>
  The anti US sentiment in the mid east is growing to even encompass governments we once counted on as being friendly, namely Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
  Hope this lets you guys in on some perspective on why France is not jumping to kill Suddam.  This is also the same reason that the Russians will not back a vote in the UN, but we are not picking on them...<br>
  <br>
  O and one more issue to bring up, why are we all avoiding looking at N.Korea, who has Neuclear bombs and is just as threatening as Iraq.... hummm makes you think.<br>
<br>
  No matter what happens in Iraq, I will never blame the people like the lady in the letter that started this.  I will support our vets and combat fighters to my dying day.  I might rant and rave at the man behind the curtain giving the orders, but I will never make the mistake of blaming the ones who carried out the orders given to them by their elected commander in cheif.<br>

It may certainly influence Chirac alot or at least a bit, but I doubt the majority of French people give a damn about that, the majoritys against war in Germany, Spain, and the UK certainly don't. The fact that France and Russia can make deals with Iraq might also make them belive that Saddam can be reasoned with or that they might be able to influence him.<br>
<br>
Chirac wasn't that popular in France untill this started (having gotten alot of votes just because the alternative was alot worse), which I'm sure is part of the reason he is against war too as his popularity in France and other sections of Europe has increased dramaticaly. <br>
<br>
The anti any religon but roman catholicism is new to me but I don't think the French government would have gone for it and very few other coutries in Europe either, if any. Religion should never be connected to government like that, even the Irish government worked this out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I know why we are all avoiding looking at North Korea ! Its cause the death tole there would be much much higher ! Much more likely to end in a peacefull solution because of that alone.<br>

Yeah the French guy in the letter was acting like an idiot.

Korea is because they do have a maniac who has his finger on the button for Nukes.  Its much easier to take on a maniac who does not have Nukes backing him up.  That however does not mean we wont try and stop the crazyness that N. Korea is trying to get away with.  But to go running in trying to stop someone who can launch a nuke today is much harder then going against someone who dreams of owning his own nukes.<br>
<br>
It would not suprise me if the North Korean goverment has some sort of Coup where the current leadership suddenly dies.  Out of which we find someone more friendly with the Democratic nations.  This is a lot less risky.  I dont think we will let the maniac continue to add more nukes to his arsenal.<br>
Many have described the N. Korean leader as a maniac...but a very shrewd one.<br>
<br>
Should he become nuts enough to launch a nuke strike I am sure we would strike back quickly.<br>
<br>
I am more afraid for the people of Iraq of being killed by Saddam and then blaming it the invading US forces.  This I feel is the main reason the President is allowing the press much greater freedom to go in with the US forces and monitor what they find as well as any combats.  This will keep Saddams attempts to create lies to a minimum.<br>

As a side nickpicking note isn't a coup done by the military ? I would have thought they are big supporters of the present regime in N Korea ... hard to imagine a represive regime working without the militarys support. A revolution might happen but with N Koreas military I'd image it would be short and bloody.<br>
