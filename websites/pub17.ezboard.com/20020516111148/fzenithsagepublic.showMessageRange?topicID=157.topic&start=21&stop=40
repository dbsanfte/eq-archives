I got into the heat of an argument and as usual I go for the jugular.<br>
<br>
I was not in a place to discuss anything with the officers of Zenith Sage.  I was not one of the raid leaders or a member of Sacred Guardians for that matter, so I did not see it in my place to start doing the compromising myself.  I myself logged on when about half of Zenith was in Fear and did not know the full scope of things until recently.  I know a lot of emotions ran high and continue to do so, clouding my judgement.  <br>
<br>
I should not have called Zenith Sage a dishonorable guild.  However, I do stand by my description of this as a dishonorable act.  There were things that could have done by both sides and weren't.  From what I understand, members of SG tried to communicate with your members to no avail.  This was an unfortunate incident that could and should have been avoided.  I still feel Zenith should have given more consideration to all the guilds that had made it a point to wake up at that time and get to Feerott to go on Fear.  I see your complaints about having to wait 2 hours or so, but some of us were waiting a month to go on that raid, including myself.  Lower lvl guilds such as ourselves have just as much rights to planes as other guilds, we just can't do them as easily, as Bamorm said.  Also, when Bammy mentioned we wanted to go there for experience, it wasn't in terms of that overrated orange bar.  We want the experience of raiding a planes, doing stuff by ourselves.  Higher lvls take for granted their efficiency with raiding, and we are trying to better ourselves by practicing it.  That is the experience Bamorm is talking about.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, compromising would have been the easy solution and was overlooked.  But try to remember what it was like for you guys even before Kunark came out.  Remember how excited you would be going on your first fear raid, or hate raid?  That was taken away from several people that day, and it should not have been.  The only reason the EQ calendar is ignored these days is because the higher lvl guilds pay no attention to it.  It really is a shame, because that is the fairest way to do things.  If only people would remember how Everquest was a year and a half ago, things would be different.  Oh well, times change and as half the guilds grow more and more powerful, the other half either die off or reach a complacent state. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uyappmithrenblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yapp Mithrenblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/23/01 3:18:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: made this clear ok?</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;I suggest you take a good look at TKR and TMO and learn from their example.<br>
<br>
Hehehe, learn from TMO. Dunno much about TKR because frankly, I don't see them around EQ much. But TMO? They'll be the last guild I'll be learning anything from, no offense.<br>
<br>
Thing about the calender is that it's pretty much defunct for the past year plus. EQ is a game, and you cannot force any kind of calender system on any guilds. If you want to abide by it, fine, go ahead, but it'll never get enforced by Verant. Can a guild claim anything in ToV a month ahead? No. Can a guild claim Trakanon a month ahead? No. Can a guild claim VS a month ahead? No. If you want to kill the mob, gather faster than any other guild and kill it. If you don't have enough people and another guild has enough people to kill it, then they have the right to try first. That's it, simple rules that the GM can go by.<br>
<br>
And btw, don't try to be all judgemental on how other people play EQ. What might be fun or brings joy to another guild might not be fun for your guild. What might be important to another guild's progression in the game might be different from yours. You have no right to judge how our guild functions because frankly, you are not in it. You have no right to judge our principles too.  <p><b>Wolfgan Amedeus<BR>

Lots of shots being fired and frankly I think both sides are at fault here. <br>
<br>
Heres my 2 cents. Sorry SG but we did not ruin your hunt. It's you that ruin your own hunt for placing emphasis on a calendar that's not used by some guilds or is it acknowledged by Verant. Being an unofficial resource means you can use it at your own risks. If you wish to use the calendar to plan your raids, you should expect at anytime some misunderstandings like this to happen. It's not our fault that the game is designed this way, but there is no such thing as a 'Booking' a zone. ZS has never booked anything and if a guild were to be already in the zone (any zone) with a raid on, we wouldn't be gathering there in the 1st place. It's sort of like a Ragefire situation, noone can book him. <br>
<br>
For POF we were primed and our target was CT not the common spawns, but to reach him we need to clear the zone. I understand that you were only interested in the normal mobs and  I'm sure if you asked us we would happily have u tag along for it. Sorry if we ruined your plans but u can't place the blame entirely on us. I have to admit our fault was our oversight for not inviting SG along for the item drops which we didn't need. But then, all I heard in /ooc was 'we booked this and that'. Things weren't that rational that night, proper communication has always been a problem in EQ. It's never our intention to have conflict with anyone or guild. <br>
<br>
You can time a PoF raid (12hrs respawn) but it's harder to plan a CT raid. You cannot use the calendar for a Uber mob raid (CT, Dragons, Gods etc). That's why everything has to be adhoc. <br>
<br>
So many different responses, we have 1 guild not happy with us and another grateful for the CR.<br>

<br>
I've been in ZS for quite awhile and the utmost reason I joined and stayed in ZS is because of their friendliness and fairness they demonstrated to me.<br>
<br>
EQ is a game with ppl around the glob. There're lots of things that we planned to do but other guilds gathered the force and downed it before we have enough (ie. our peak hours). We would never complain to them because its their right. Its not fair to say its dishonorable act. <br>
<br>
Its not rare that we have a couple members sitting next to the boss or camp when other guilds are raiding, but we never tell them to go away because we plan to have the boss in xx hours time later. In fact I think thats quite dishonorable.<br>
<br>
Assume all ppl do what you guys expect, we would have tons of &quot;campers&quot; sitting around the world claiming everything and ask others to &quot;show courtesy&quot; and leave the camp alone until they have enough to do it. It will not work out.<br>
<br>
If our raiding hours (peak hours) are close enough, lets focus more on establishing better communication and understanding between the 2 guilds so future conflicts could be solved in better ways.<br>

You have posted something on the &quot;calendar&quot; and expect the whole world would know this? We started our raid when seeing no other guild with capable force attempt to do it and this is our bad?? You think a single player ask 40 players to leave &quot;his zone&quot; is reasonable??<br>
You stand on the &quot;calendar&quot; we stand on &quot;first come first serve&quot;, this arguement could probably never ends. Let us drive into the same track - &quot;Respect each other&quot;. We already told you we do not use the calendar why bother forcing it between you and ZS? You could tell one of our officers that you want to share the zone and I can assure you none of us will say no because we know what is &quot;play nice&quot;. I know how frustrating if a long yearning plan got ruined but the fact is we &quot;planned&quot; doesn't mean we &quot;owning&quot; or we need not to respect another person's plan. If you guys want to keep better communication with ZS about raids planning please use /tell in game or use this forum. One of you guys said that your raids need quite some time to plan so it is not difficult to inform us before any conflict comes out. Just let us know and we shall not plan any raid in the same zone at the same time.<br>
Frome the day one this game released there is no &quot;Fair&quot; in Norrath. The server down time, the respawn timer make a single guild able to claim a number mobs for over a year just because they are in the appropriate time zone. Verant will never improve this but still she collecting monthly fee from all over the world. Who would cry for the another half of the global, huh? They don't get any discount on their monthly fee, no? Try to &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;compromise&quot; before we can see &quot;fair&quot; does exist. <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

When  I saw your 2nd third and fourth member arrive and told you we were going in with in an hr or two still silence.  Finally when 20 or so of you were present someone aknowledged that you didn't use calender rather than ignoring me.

<br>
<br>
IF there had been 40 ZS there when I arrived I would of said Oh-well and moved on but there were none there when I arrived. So, don't tell me about telling 40 people to log.

You guys obviously knew we had planned that raid... and decided to not take it into account!<br>
<br>
Offfff cooooourse! you UBBER! Meaning everyone else is buls*** and not worthy to be noticed?<br>
<br>
First one first served, uh? I guess you must say the very same thing to everyone you jump in like that! How easy it is! Talk about an organisation! Must be like: &quot;hey some guild is planning to do a raid! Come on everyone! so we can outnumber them and zone in before them!&quot;<br>
knock knock! Hello? this is EQ guys! tap tap<br>
This is not just a game between you and mobs! There are also other people! yes! You can believe me! Never noticed them?oh!!! I know why! Just a hint: entering a zone do a /who, and quit typing /who all 60! You'll see! I promise!!!<br>
<br>
Now do not make me laugh this is time lag story! You are not the only ones living outside the US you know! Did you ever thought about people that can rarely get online (I am one of them)? I was looking forward that day, saturday being for me one of the very few day I can get online... So do not tell me YOU have very limited time, this is a very poor excuse!!!<br>
<br>
Ohhhh! and I am soooooo sorry we bothered you and cut you down the fun!!! That is right! I forgot again! only YOU have the right to have fun!<br>
Please excuse us for being there!<br>
<br>
About the loots? well! You thought we would follow you around the zone during your cleaning, so we could have some &quot;leftovers&quot;? sighs... That's so pathetic... We might not be a big ubber guild, but this is not pleasant to be compared to a what?.... &quot;dog&quot; ? yeah I think that is the word...<br>
<br>
To be honest I never liked big ubber guilds, and I am sure not going to change my point of view!<br>
<br>
I did not know your guild, but don't expect me to regard you amiably... I might be a &quot;newbie&quot; to you, but I do not care... EQ is not just for level 60 guilds!<br>
<br>
But of course, I do not expect you to undertand that... Do not even know why I post that LMAO! Maybe I was thinking there &quot;might&quot; be someone that could understand how it feels to be treated the way you did treat us... Of course it would have been different if it had been the other way, uh?<br>
That's what I thought...<br>

SG is an old guild that purposely didn't pursue that path that's why I joined them. I guess around 55 or 56 the SK will be retiring since I just would of felt horrible doing what you did. I aknowledge that you do not believe you did anything wrtong and respoect that. My difficulty has been in that I would never do what you did and would of deguilded if my guild did. people are different, values are different. I wish you luck and hope that if it ever occurs again you give us an hr or two to kill some of your yard trash before you go in so we can both have fun rather than just you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9999cc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/usqualls77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squalls77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/24/01 7:16:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: wrowin agree?</span><hr size=1> Lol<br>
first come first serve, since we believe it, u dont see we place 1 person in any place shout or ooc that place is camped even though we dont have enough or we plan to do it later.<br>
It does not matter you are uber or small guild, this method of getting a camp is just a joke.  The only thing 1 can camp is the thing he/she can do and is doing.  For example, i can go lguk, and claim supp/ass camp cus i can actually stay in the room, killing ph spawns, and continue to do so until i decide to leave.  I cant stay at the entrance and shout or ooc that place is camped or will be camped cus it is not mine yet unless i am actually there and can hold the camp.<br>
You cant claim a camp if you are not there, for you guys not even inside pof at that time, staying outside and shout or ooc means nothing.  If you guys are already in Fear, then it makes more sense that you have right to have Fear.  You cant claim a camp if you are not there, and claim a camp while you are not even in the zone makes it even more absurd.  Planning ahead does not mean anything, for anybody can say oh we plan to do this and that etc.  Uber guild and small guild has nothing to do with it, if a small guild like yours gather faster and quicker than u, sure they can go in and take pof as well.<br>
And I dont really care wherever you live and how precious your time is, we pay the same $$ to play this game, and why should we (about 40pp) wasted our time to wait for you guys who clearly not ready for Fear.  Anybody has the right to have fun, it is true, like this morning, we plan to do hot and kill doz, but found out it was killed before we were there, what can we do, we did not flame the people who killed it.  We did what most normal people would do, do something else.<br>
Just because you did not get a Fear raid doesnt mean u cant have fun, i am sure a small guild like yours will have plenty of fascinating small raids.  Dont blame us for ruin your fun, you can only ruin your own if u cant find any.  Lastly, about the leftover comment, i find this very offensive.  we say u guys can come along with us, not like dog (u said that yourself) but as companions.  I know you guys would like the experience to try fear on your own, but in the case i mention above, you obvious dont have the right to own fear.  So what a good gm would normally say, share ^_^ P<br>
We never say u guys cant come along with us, we just want CT as we mention earlier.  But you guys were stubborn, and just wanted fear to yourself, what can we do?  The fact is that day, you guys ignored us, we ignored you guys, there is no communication between the two, the result is not a happy one.  Now, I hope something like this wont happen next time, but if it does, we must try to solve it by showing more respect and most importantly communicate.<br>
<br>
p.s. please dont give those uber and small guild crap, it is just who has the ability to muster a force to do something faster than others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uwrowin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wrowin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/24/01 8:09:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fzenithsagepublic.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>   Just the facts not flameage</span><hr size=1> As you were zoning in to Fear in /ooc we were informed only those in the raid were to go through portal.

<br>
If I'm not mistaken, you guys where the first ones to mention the time restraints, and what Fab was talking about was the fact you aren't the only ones with time constraints.  He was not complaining at all, and you insinuate that he was doing just that.  Also, you mention why should you guys waste your time for people who are gathering to take Fear on.  So, you are wasting time while playing Everquest, lets take a figure and say its 2 hours, just an estimate.  Now in 2 hours time, you are playing a GAME and can't find something to do.  If that is the case, why do you bother to play the game?  Hence the reason I hope I never catch the big guild bug.  I am not saying I won't, because I don't know what my state of mind will be 10 lvls from now.  The game becomes all about raiding and getting another epic at that point.  Of course its nice to get something better than what you have, I enjoy a new weapon or piece of armor just as much as the next guy.  However, I am not willing to sacrifice my character and moral values by pushing over the small guys that are in my way to do so.  It feels great to get something, but I have come to realize it feels better to do something for someone you don't know.<br>
<br>
Everything could and should have been cleared up on the day of that raid.  There were many mistakes made by both guilds, mainly the lack of diplomacy.  You mention we should have just tagged along with you, and could have.  However, at no point was this made clear to any member of our raiding party that we could do so.  Our guilds respect what are essentially unwritten codes.  When a guild is going to a plane, or it is open, you respect what the raid leader's plans are.  Without consent to join you, I myself would consider it unproper to barge in during a raid that you are doing, unfair or not.  I am sure my friends feel the same way, because they are my friends for a reason.  <br>
<br>
There is never going to be any true way to say who is right and who is wrong.  What I don't see is both sides admitting they made mistakes.  I know a few people from ZS have admitted they could have acted in a more civilized manner, and there have been people linked with SG that have done the same.  There are way too many supports to both of our cases that can never be solved because there is no third party involved.<br>
<br>
At this point it doesn't really matter what happens, because what is done is done.  Everybody should follow an assortment of cliches that apply to this case; &quot;live and learn&quot;, &quot;forgive and forget&quot;, take your pick.  <br>
<br>
I disagree completely with what you guys did on 11/17.  There is nothing that can be done about that.  I do, however, respect all of your members coming out to defend your guild, which is what has made me re-think my position on this to one of more neutrality.  Rather than letting the problem build further, I suggest all parties involved work to fix the problem.  That can involve whatever you want, talking, joint raid, drunken fun at the arena.  It doesn't really matter, I'm not in this game for the items I earn but the friends I make.<br>

However things went out of hand and no one was communicating as they should be that day. As I will mention again, noone can claim of book a zone unless they are already raiding it. Sitting in front of the door shouting the room is mine doesn't mean anything. I don't understand how a reasonably seasoned player of EQ would even consider that. Verant doesn't condone the practise and would never do that. I'm sure if a GM was present and seeing 30 ppl from one guild primed and ready to raid the zone would have ruled in our favor. Call it bad luck guys, but you weren't ready for the raid. It can be frustrating since you planned it for months. Maybe it's time to think of other alternatives and get things planned faster? Rather than put the blame on another guild can I suggest you make some changes to your own policies? Yes EQ is about having FUN, when ppl get too serious about it, it's better to log off, after all we get too serious IRL. You point is you claim we ruined your fun but why didn't you look at your own gathering methods 1st? If you had gathered faster and move in we would have left and let it be done with and do something else. It's strange that you keep busting us for not being NICE to you. How can we be so when the only thing you /ooc was 'we planned this raid, can u please leave' 'does zs use the calendar' etc. Why didn't you offer options for a joint raid? Why do you focus on the calender in every conversation? Put it this way, everyone assumed the wrong thing. You weren't very courteous and we weren't accommodating after that. I don't know, maybe you felt intimidated after watching 20 to 30 zs suddenly pop up in from of the portal. Your sign of displeasure was clearly written in /ooc. Another sign of human nature? Basically we lost alot of faction with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   can I say this was all a communication breakdown? it's hard isn't it since everything is through the keyboard. Can't read body language signs and what we type is very important right? <br>
<br>
<br>
We didn't break any rules. We didn't train you dead to claim the zone. If you were  already PoF with a reasonably force to take clear the zone,  we would never be anywhere near feerott. We wouldn't even be there if CT wasn't up. And he presents too juicy a target for any guild capable of taking him down. If we didn't do him, some other guild will. <br>
<br>
<br>
I can tell you guys are nice ppl but I think this discussion is getting nowhere. It borders too much on human nature and how bad communication can lead to misunderstandings. What I offer you is a suggestion that you look at your own gathering and planning policies. How you can do things fast, gather fast, adjust your timing so everyone logs in at the same time. So nothing like this can happen. Take this as an experience as growing guild, you won't learn if you don't make mistakes and we all erred in a way. Hope you're mature enough to take this objectively. <br>

I believe it was communication problems and maybe you mean what you say about allowing us to join forces.  I promise you i will never do what you did it is fine by VI like demanding to share a spawn in LGuk but morally wrong for me. I will not impugn you I understand where you are coming from and recognize you did not break verants rules nor do you believe what you did was wrong. i wish you well on your endeavers you have opened my eyes in some good and bad ways. i hope maybe you guys will look at things a little differently. <br>
