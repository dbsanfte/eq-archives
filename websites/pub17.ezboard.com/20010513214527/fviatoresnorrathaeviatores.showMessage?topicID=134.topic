<br>
I logged in one morning and found ppl talking in guild about how ppl are leaving and what can we do about it and someone mentioned a possiable merge with another guild. I seen that and said ok guys I can give you a suggestion on a very good guild and they are my RL family small in numbers like us and range in the lvls that we are as well. The name of the guild is Legacy of Valor. They love to always group up and have fun. They are very into the being together when they see each other online. Some of you are sitting there going ok reb this is your RL family so why are you not in their guild. Well giggles me and mister Coharie butt heads and when it concerns things we get VERY emotional. I went my own way from them cause I did not ever want to loose my Best friend and her family cause I love them all . They just play different than I do is all. They are more worried about faction hits and such and I as you all know just get on and have fun and done worry about the little things. Laughs. They are my family . I love them and I have recommended them to many ppl on EQ due to when they ask me do you know of a good guild that likes to hunt together I go yes I do and send them to LoV. Now you say well why not Via then . Guys yall know why not Via - we dont group up. Sad fact but so true. Yall are now seeing that this is a problem and want to change it but we are so spread out with our lvls now that it is hard to get together and actaully tussle good. Guys LoV I have spoken to and they agree that is sounds like a wonderful ideal for us to merge together and start playing with each other and when needed to help one another out on things. I have made the effort to try and get us set up for a more union and to have ppl we can expand and call our family as well as just Via. Time now is in your hands and you myst put a effort to either say yes I want this or no I dont. I listen to you all in guildchat . I recommended LoV cause I know them . I trust them . I love them. They wont ever hurt us or do us wrong. The ball is in your court now to do with as you see fit on this issue that has been brought froth you all. </font><P>Rebelyoung Evil-

I don't have a problem with this idea.  However Coharie and I need to get together to discuss details on admitance to each others guild.<br>
The choice of joining a secondary into the other guild will be up to the individual.<br>
I would like to hear each of your thoughts on this idea.<br>

I can't imagine how we will be able to organise a Dragon or Plane raid anytime soon. So far I've been lucky that old friends like Moro or Dalana keep me invited to such high level actions.<br>
BUT there will always be a &quot;Guild first&quot; approach in all those raids and Dalana already asked me to make up my mind if I want to play like a high leveler finally hehe :-)<br>
So unless this merger gives enough power to finally start some raiding in Sebilis, planes and other higher level places, it will not really change anything for me.<br>
<br>
Sooooo I see Taugur moving into one of the &quot;high level guilds&quot; (if they want me in the first place) with old friends i.e. Moro or Dalana myself.<br>
But I would always have one of my mid level chars (Wintermorgen or Katinka) around to port people and to keep the chat channel open :-)<br>
Currently Viatores is much of a chat/support guild for mid level game. I don't really know if we will manage (or want to?) to morph into a powerguild anytime soon. And playing in a european time zone does not help either.<br>
<br>
The question for any lvl50+ is:<br>
When will we do our first Viatores Raid on a plane, when do we organise getting keys to Sebilis for everybody...?</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#110d03><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/utaugur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taugur</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>12/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>6:12:37 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=3><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">just a test</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">wondered about the unregistered flag</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#333333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/uzapostormlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zapo Stormlight</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>12/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#cc9933>12:12:43 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub17.ezboard.com/fviatoresnorrathaeviatores.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=4><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: just a test</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well there seems to be a consenus to merge our primary characters into a single guild.  However would like to request everyone maintain a 2ndary in our guild.  If for no other reason but to maintain our future options.<br>
<br>
This does not mean Viatores Norrathae will close up shop.<br>
But instead we will continue to maintain our tried and true of a group of friends with no strings attached...always welcomeing our friends to and from our fold.  As always I have allowed our membership to do whats best for thier characters.  As you know we at Viatores Norrathae accept the player into the guild not the character.  So keep in mind any who may move thier primarys into LoV will still be welcome back at any time.<br>
<br>
I still need to work out any details on such a merger with Coharie.<br>

And yes I can be a stick in the mud.<br>
<br>
Litvak is my primary and at this time will STAY in viatores.<br>
<br>
If there is to be a merge why is there no discussion of them joining us, instead of us joining them.<br>
<br>
I am all for grouping and working together.  And have many times left what I have been doing, and even changed characters to allow me to group.  As matter of fact, I created bearblood my warrior now 26th level, to allow myself to play with then newer and lower level players.  For a while we had a good core group of mid 20's going, but then life happened and we could not get together consistently.  But bear is still waiting for that group to allow him to be played.<br>
<br>
I understand and sympathize with Taugur and Rebby on wanting to do higher level raids.  But the fact is we can, we just need to make it happen.  Unfortunately it seems to happen when one player WANTS something and then others are willing to join in.  I would like to do a higher dungeon, or any dungeon for that matter, because we want to group together not just so one individual can get a neat item.<br>
<br>
Sorry off the subject.<br>
<br>
For the merge.  I am all for alliances, but i believe we should focus on strengthen Via instead of diversifying its possibilities.<br>
<br>

I am not into all that . Those of you that think that are very wrong. I left on Reb due to the fact that Malevolent ask me to go into his new guild. If you have noticed hell I dont even play reb that much now a days the one I play is Trin and more than likely when she gets inot her 50's she will leave to be in his guild as well. Not for the fact of items and raids hell I been there done that . More than likely when she gets into her 50's she will camp out as well. Something with me and the 50's I just dont have that aruge to play them as much any more. Call it stubborn call it crazy but I get tired of all the ppl wanting this and that and I cant wait on this lvl . I Love to play that is the only reason they even lvl up. One day I will run out of chars and I ponder what will I do then. I have 2 other chars after Trin hits 50's that I can play but after that some real desicions will have to be made as to what I want to do. Grouping and such . Yes it is needed guys . I only brought up LoV cause I trust them. You ask why are they not willing to come into Via. Well here is your answer:<br>
<br>
They was merged with a guild This guild gave them problems. As in well they got Powerful and started making Silly assian rules as to YOU had to do this raid and then when you do them you will get points the one with the most points gets to be on Looto for a item. It was not the only thing but that one I remember them speaking of to me. It was a bad experience for them. I also know that this other guild was going behind LoV's back and trying to Recruit its higher memebers out of it to go into theirs. That is wrong as well. This is just that they are leary of how it was with them . THEY just got out of it and got all their chars back into LoV, its not saying they do not trust our guild but they are willing to be apart of of our family hell who knows what will happen. I just gave you a ideal No one Not me Not them has said to merge. I seen ppl talking about it and they didnt know what to do. I said well I know a guild but god almighty YOU dont have to . I brought up LoV cause I seen PPL talking about a merge with another guild but damn guys , You dont have to choose them. I just brought it to yall's attention that this is a guild I know and trust. I did not want Via to leave I didnt want ppl hurt that is why I suggested them. If you think there is another guild or that there is someone yall can trust then by all means go for it. I just was thinking about Via Family and did not want it hurt so when I seen PPL talking about a merge I brought up their names. They did not come looking for us . I ask some said sounds good So I talked to them about it. You dont have to go. You dont have to merge. I just didnt want yall to merge with a guild and have a bad experience like what they had Call it me looking after My Via family. </font><P>Rebelyoung Evil-

To tell the truth I agree that a merger with a guild with similar ideas and values would be very much to the advantage of the members of the guild. I know that some of you started this guild and have been here since it's inception and many of you are Zapo's real life friends and family, however, what is Via really about. Well to me is not in the name but in the people behind the guild. It is about friends talking and having a good time getting away from real life for a little while. I have always been one with the more the merrier approach. I think that if we can add to the family regardless of the name then we will be better for it. Many of you will be benefited by having more opportunities to group and they will be benefited by having you in their guild. Both guilds will become stronger and more diversified in its knowledge and talents. <br>
<br>
In saying that I at 50 now have the same problems that Taugur has even more so as a warrior. It is very difficult for me to find a group anywhere I go. I spend much of time online now running between zones shouting for a group. I too have been asked about interest in joining guilds that are more into raids. However, it is not for raids or items that I leave if I do in fact leave. It will be for the opportunity to increase my ability to find a group as opposed to wandering aimlessly for an hour getting frustrated looking for a group and logging. It is a very difficult decision to leave Via. I do considered you friends and family. I have had a blast grouping with all of you that I have grouped with. Min has helped me on many occasions including helping me fininsh the Wurmslayer quest.<br>
<br>
I also want to say that I know that Rebby has all of our best interests at heart. She has been a dear friend to us all. I do not think that she brings this up lightly but it was in response to some concern brought up by other members of the guild in guild chat after Zullu and Hagas and left the guild.<br>
<br>
I do not take this decision lightly nor should any of you but don't think of Via as a name but as an idea and a set of values. In the words of Shakespeare &quot; a rose by any other name is just as sweet.&quot; I will leave my secondary in Via no matter what I decide to with Banthar. I will consider you as the reason that I made it to 50 instead of getting bored with the game and quitting at 15. I will never forget my first introduction to Vyncent shortly after I joined the guild he brought to Sylvor to Crushbone and introduced himself to me and we sat and talked and killed but mainly got to know each other. I consider him a kindred spirit, a brother, a friend not only in game but in real life even though we have never met except in Norrath. I could say the same about many of always there when it was really needed. The little that we did as a guild was always a blast. To me that is what the guild is all about and no matter what the name of the guild or where we go after Via that won't change. So I say that if adding to the family even if it means changing the name could bring you all closer together.<br>
<br>
My thoughts. I hope they help.<br>

 I thought it would be proper for me to speak on the matter of the merger, I know there are some skepticism about the merger, I understand exactly how you feel about it, LoV went throught the samething sometime ago with at first an alliance, then the induction of our high levels into their guild, everything went well at first, but then I found out later that he had other adjendas in mind, some I do not approve of, which we won't get into that right now, I just wanted you all to know I understand about being skeptic about this<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
 When this was first brought to my attention about a merger, I understood it to be secondary Chars, when I talked to Zapo &amp; Min, I found out that some expressed about moving their primaries over &amp; some even their secondairies as well, that's all fine &amp; dandy with me the more the merry, but I encourage those that decide to make the move over, to leave one behind to keep Via up &amp; running, I do not wish to see Viatores disappear, hell I'll even move one of my secondaries over to Viatores to help keep it alive, but you need to keep your options open, I'm speaking from experence in this matter, keep your guild alive it is your home as is LoV was mine when I was in Heros of Mithril Hall, I did'nt like what they stood for I packed up &amp; went home so here I am<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

 LoV has always had 10 officers not including myself, my wife or those that have been assigned a specific task, such as ambassador to another guild or advisor, yes I have an advisor<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   the Ambassador &amp; Advisor does not perform normal officer duties( unless there are no other officers online ) there will be 5 oringnal LoV officers,along with 5 Viatores officers, Zapo, Min &amp; Sleistak filling 3 spots with 2 left open, Zapo will make the selection for those spots, when Zapo makes the move over, I will appoint him as my( First Officer ), if he will take the job, if not I would like for him to appoint someone to take the job, this will bring the total officers to 14, that includes Me , my wife , Ambassador &amp; Advisor, that will be as big as it gets<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
 Now as far as raids go, for now all raids are put on hold until things settle down after the merger, we might try &amp; shoot for the Sat. before the Super Bowl, possibly even as early as next weekend, starting with a mid level raid of some kind, as far as planes ready members, LoV has me a 47 warrior, a 52 wizard, 51&amp;50 pallies so far with the 51 coming from Viatores, with those close to planes level, we have a 45 druid, 43 ranger &amp; 42 Bard, there maybe a few more planes people joining as well but not sure at the moment &amp; it also depends on how many more planes ready people will make the move over from Viatores, after we get a clear headcount of planes ready members, then I can begin talks with Noble Crusaders about an Alliance to do joint planes raids &amp; possibly some dragon raids too, they're in the same boat as we are, not enough planes ready people so they want to disscuss an alliance for such joint ventures<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
 So now that all is said &amp; done, all I ask is for some patience &amp; some time to get things going &amp; if all goes smoothly, we just might be able to pull off a planes raid in early Feb. thats the best I can offer maybe even earlier, &amp; for those that have not decided weather or not to join us I only ask that you think about the possibilties of where this will go<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
 Now that I have took up most of your message board with this longwinded reply I will take my leave before ya'll ban me from this Board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I understand the anguish this merger has caused in fact I have been requested to keep Zapo in Via.  I will respect that request and keep Zapo in Via.  I understand all of the opinions and agree that each have a point.  I have always and will always respect the individual.  The right they have<br>
with thier character will always be thiers.  I do not wish to see Viatores disolve away but I understand the real threat of that with this merger...having said that...I also understand the fact that many feel the great need to do more with thier characters in a greater number.  I would like to find a better solution to this problem but I dont see any at this time.  Any solultion but a merger will keep people from chatting on a regular basis with a larger group.  As always I feel that once we accept you as a member of Viatores...we will always keep you as one of our own...even if you leave.  The door will always be open.<br>
------------------<br>
I will move one of my secondaries to LoV to maintain contact with those that made this move.  However as I have stated I will keep Zapo Stormlight as Guildmaster of Viatores Norrathae.  I invite any that have worries about such a merger to do the same...ie move just a 2ndary.  This will give you a chance to login and chat with old friends...even arrange for a Raid with your primary from Viatores...I am sure LoV will keep a standing order to allow for Guild Alliance for guild raids.<br>
<br>
I wish I could say more but I must get ready for a trip to New Jersey...yes again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I will try and stay in touch...keep in mind folks its a game...and we just want to have fun and keep our family ties.<br>
