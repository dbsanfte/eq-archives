OK folks This is to let you know what happened and why there seems to be a great deal of problems and strife from one point of view.<br>
There was an awesome idea put forth by Wyrd , Qiara and some others of the 50+ people. Their idea was , in a nutshell , to maximize their playtime and to get practice at raiding by having a monthly/weekly (hadn't been fixed yet) get together that had hard rules about attendance and a rotating system to decide where they were going.<br>
This in and of itself was a wonderful idea and the ability that it would have given for people to experience new places and gather raid experience and pass that on to the rest of the Guild was very admirable.<br>
There was just one problem that caused all this strife in my mind.The planning of this new group , dubbed &quot;The Book Club&quot; , was done on a &quot;private forum&quot; that was only able to be seen by invitation of the boards administrators and unless you had been invited , there was no way for anyone to see what was there.<br>
The people on that board have said that the board was going to &quot;go public&quot; as soon as they had worked the kinks out of all the rules that they were hashing out. <br>
I was invited to this forum without any warning and when I realized it was a secret forum I posted a VERY ugly objection to it that can be read in the Book Club posting above.<br>
PLEASE don't take all I said to heart folks ... it was meant to be a wake up call to the members of that forum and only meant to get their attention by slapping them in the face.<br>
Since then other people have left over this incident and I am sorry that they felt a need to go . One of the warnings in my original rant was on that subject.<br>
<br>
This is to let you know that the people involved werent trying to block people out , nor were they trying to form a Guild within a Guild . They meant well but I believe the path they took to get there was incorrect and I told them that . This is what the blowup was over. <br>
<br>
Please remain calm and if you have any comments or need any clarification , post here or E Mail me at Bspinelli@CFL.RR.COM<br>

I want to post my opinion about this matter. Yes, I'm new in the guild. Yes, I don't read the boards often enough. Yes I'm positive that I wasn't considered for this 'book club'. This is coming from a new person into your guild. ( I don't even feel like its my guild yet)<br>
<br>
Kuron and I have discussed this irl ( we live and play together ) Every night we get on, we say hello and then we proceed to go hunt. ( we hunt in a lot of different places per night ) When we get established, we /gu the guild offering if ANYONE wants to come play. We're not mid levels ( not really ) and we're not on the higher side ( 45 to be exact ) and yet we don't hardly get anyone to group with us. For silly's sake, I'm a cleric and he's a beastlord. What we've been discussing, Does anyone like to group together in this guild at all??<br>
<br>
We've had the pleasure of grouping with Nuanil regularly ( thank you Nuanil!! ) and just met Usuaia last night, and I think we've grouped with one or two more once. I don't know what ya'll are expecting in groups or in the guild. In my last guild ( On Tarew Marr ) we were a family guild, also 3 years or so old, and we actively grouped together. We were smaller than VN but we managed to get things done because we liked each other. It wasn't rare to see at least TWO guild groups going a night.<br>
<br>
I can see where the book club could be a good idea and I can also see where other's feelings were hurt. I hope this will work itself out and we get to grouping and raiding together. This is game is so much more fun with people you like.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Hello,<br>
<br>
I've been AFK for a bit, though I've lurked on the forums<br>
from time to time.  <br>
<br>
What have you been doing, Jappers? one might ask.<br>
<br>
Well, I've been largely focused on my fiction writing.<br>
Working towards my goal of getting published.<br>
Hasn't happened yet, but I've got a story out for<br>
consideration and I'm well along my way with a new<br>
one I'm writing. Look for a post soon saying &quot;I'm<br>
getting published!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Have been completely absent from EQ or any other<br>
online RPG for a few months. Saw a post from Sea<br>
about &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot;. I've read a little about it<br>
but haven't delved into it. I've been watching<br>
Asheron's Call 2 develop but haven't picked it up<br>
either. Anyone in Via tried it out yet?<br>
<br>
Have seen a few posts lately where members have<br>
been offended and some have quit.  The latest<br>
round seems to be centered around &quot;Book Clubs&quot;,<br>
though it sounds like that hopefully has been<br>
cleared up as the simple misunderstanding it<br>
was.<br>
<br>
My 2 cp :<br>
It's very easy for people to be offended in an online<br>
environment. Typing just doesn't communicate well<br>
enough and leaves too much for the imagination, I<br>
believe. Unfortunately, it's been my experience that<br>
what gets filled into the gaps by the reader's<br>
imagination is often negative. The other person is<br>
imagined to be mean or rude or whatever, when<br>
the reality is it was just a miscommunication. It's<br>
happened to me in EQ and other online games where<br>
people concluded I was being incredibly rude or<br>
excluding people or whatever. The funny thing is<br>
that I get along with nearly everyone I meet in RL.<br>
At least, people _seem_ to get along with me (starts<br>
looking suspicious).  <br>
<br>
I ran into trouble with the old guild I used to be leader<br>
of in EQ where one person thought I'd formed an<br>
exclusive club within the guild for certain 'private'<br>
events. At the time, I thought it was an odd conclusion<br>
as I was the only person running guild events for<br>
months on end and had two or three going on a week<br>
for a while. But, it still happened and caused no end of<br>
stink while I worked to clear up the misunderstanding.<br>
Just life in the online world, I guess. Actually, the<br>
story is kind of a funny one of what _really_ happened,<br>
but I won't go into it now.  To all involved in the<br>
recent mess regarding &quot;Book Clubs&quot;, you have my<br>
sympathy.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I've felt it ironic (see, I'm thinking like a<br>
writer - hehe) that EQ bills itself as a social game yet<br>
goes out of its way to encourage exclusion. The<br>
whole level-based grouping bit is the culprit, I<br>
believe. That's why the uber guilds exist. Takes care<br>
of all the exclusion problems as everyone in the guild<br>
is in the topmost level range and thus can join in<br>
on anything. But, for the non uber level ranges, the<br>
problem remains. It's a lame part of how EQ works<br>
and it has always caused strife and frustration,<br>
in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Bye for now. Have a good day everyone.<br>
<br>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Ok just to put in my thoughts.<br>
first off just to let ya know I have been thinking of leaveing VN over this and still undecided. but as far as those who have a prob with someone keeping a group secret to f...ing bad I group with people I know how to play. Unless it is a raid and I can help someone learn that is the time to learn not when Im trying to kill Vox or something else big I want those who have their crap together by my side. Now Im sure this post is going to piss off alot but to be honest I really dont care anymore. I have spent the day in game alone today becuase I wanted to just be melow alone. <br>
