Well, I for one am getting excited!  We have tons of high-level firepower at our disposal, and I think it is high time we opened some cans on some of these top mobs around Norrath.  Our Field Officers, led by Patryn, are working diligently, laying out a raid framework that will lead us up to planes and dragons.  Want to be a part of things?  Tell Patryn you are locked and cocked and ready to rock!<P>
On the membership side, Surkull's team of officers are canvassing our current membership to update our lists to pull from for raids.  Be sure he or someone on his team has that info.<p>
Also, if you are 45+, we are working on a minimum equipment list, and we will work hard as a team to make sure you have that equipment.  Of course, anything you can get for yourself is best, and this is not a "wish list" The right equipment makes for successful raids, so count on Imperial Dynasty to come through.  If you have suggestions as to what designates "minimum equipment", tell Patryn your ideas.<p>
A guild is not a static thing, so we have had some membership and leadership changes, as outlined below:<p>

<font face="Bell MT">Finally updated the Members Page with "correct" levels,
class and new members. If I have forgotten anyone or still have wrong info,
please fill out the member info form for me. It really is the easiest way
to get the information to me. Also added several new member pics and removed
old members pics. Updated the Alt Char and the Inactive Member lists too.
Still have to update the Members Only page, but hoping to get a few more
email addresses before I do that. I have also created a redirect URL that
leads to the guild page for those of you who still have trouble remembering
the real one. Hope it helps you out a bit when you want to send a friend
to our page. The redirect URL is: <a href="http://embark.to/imperialdynasty">http://embark.to/imperialdynasty</a>.
Both the real and redirect URLs will work :p</font></dd>
