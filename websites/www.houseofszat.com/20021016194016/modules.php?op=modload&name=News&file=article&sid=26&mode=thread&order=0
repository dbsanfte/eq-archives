<font size="2" color="#505050">This is the story of the House of Szat, written by myself, that has to do with the beginnings of the guild.  It's more from a role playing stand point, but I'm quite proud of it and find it entertaining =)<br /><br /><BR><BR>The wind howls through the northern town of Halas during the night as the moon of Luclin glowed with a pearlescent aura illuminating the barbarian town. A number of hearty warriors patrol the town, equipped with heavy platemail armor lined with polar bear fur, a large round shield hanging on their back, an enormous sword sheathed on their left side and a brightly glowing torch to light the way and provide warmth for the men. <br /><br />"Halt!" shouted one of the guards, "Who goes there?" <br /><br />A unsettling size party of magnificent warriors appeared from the darkness of the Everfrost Peaks approaching the town of Halas. At the sound of the guards voice, they all stopped in their tracks as one of them approached the guard. <br /><br />"I am Sir Edwin Motte, Holy Paladin of Qeynos under the rule of Antonius Bayle. A large band of warriors came through these parts a year ago today in search of the vile white dragon, Lady Vox... and we have had no reports of their return." spoke the warrior. <br /><br />"What business have you then with Halas? There is no dragon here Sir Edwin Motte." replied the guard. <br /><br />"This I can see guard, but my men are tired and would like to stop at the inn to get some well-needed rest." said Sir Edwin Motte. <br /><br />The guard eyed the Paladin and the party of warriors behind him inquisitively, "You may enter." <br /><br />The band of warriors marched into the town, footsteps in unison. As they approached the inn, a few citizens looked out their window to see what the commotion was about. Seeing as nothing is very important in travellers passing through these parts, they returned to their beds and fell back asleep. <br /><br />Sir Edwin Motte entered the Inn and approached the desk which had a beautiful woman operating it, carefully polishing an extremely well-crafted blade. <br /><br />"Hail, Ma'am, my entourage and I request four rooms." Sir Edwin Motte stated. <br /><br />"We only have three rooms vacant, so you can either squeeze in, or some of your men will just have to sleep with the dogs." said the inn keeper. <br /><br />Sir Edwin Motte gazed at the barbarian woman, confused at her apprehension of him. "Ma'am, I meant no harm if I said anything to offend you. Three rooms will be fine." <br /><br />"Another human, another day, another dragon slayer... it gets rather old, quickly Paladin. When will you learn that Lady Vox will not be destroyed by the likes of you or your "wonderous" Antonius Bayle?" replied the woman. <br /><br />"Hold your tongue woman! How dare you speak poorly of the great Antonious Bayle!" boomed Sir Edwin Motte. <br /><br />The woman lifted a hand to her mouth, letting lose a pre-emptive yawn. She returned her eyes to the attention of her knife and began polishing it again. <br /><br />Sir Edwin Motte's face turned red with anger and embarrasment, he slammed his platemail gauntlets on the desk, causing a pile of papers to fall upon the floor. "Listen mere Woman, you dare harass a Holy Paladin of Qeynos? Ungrateful wench!" He shouted but two inches from her face. <br /><br />Within half a second's time, the barbarian's knife was pressed fiercly against the throat of Sir Edwin Motte. Fire roared in the woman's eyes and she stared fiercly into the Paladin's, "Watch what you say here "Holy Paladin", we are not subject to your laws, and a mere shout from me and you will be thrown out of Halas, with or without your consent..." she whispered quietly into his ear. <br /><br />The paladin nodded slightly, and slowly backed away from the knife nearly piercing his neck. "I apologize Miss...?" <br /><br />"Miss Innkeeper will do fine, now just get your men in here and get out of my sight." she responded. <br /><br />Sir Edwin Motte opened the door to the inn and signaled his party to come inside. As the last warrior walked past the front desk and up the stairs, the woman opened her hand which held a small pouch in it. She opened it up as sparkles of white light flickered in her eyes. <br /><br />"Punqr strikes again." she whispered to herself as she put the pouch of stolen platinum into her trousers and continued to polish her knife. <br /><br />---- The Next Morning --- <br /><br />The icy cave of Permafrost sent chills up the Qeynos' Army's back as they delved deeper into the never ending caverns. Occassionally a goblin would peer his ugly head around a corner and scamper off through the maze. <br /><br />Sir Edwin Motte signaled for the party to stop with a single gesture of his hand as he looked around a corner. He then signaled back to his men to follow him. <br /><br />"This is it men, the lair of the ice dragon herself. Be prepared, we return to Antonious Bayle with her head." Motte said honorably. <br /><br />The men drew their weapons and held their shields tightly as they slowly approached the entrance to the enormous cavern. With a single warcry in unison the band of hearty warriors and paladins rushed into the cavern at full speed to confront beast who has slain many travellers throughout hundreds of years. <br /><br />All the warriors came to a sudden halt... before them lie the corpse of a large dragon made of pure ice. <br /><br />"What in the name of Antonious Bayle is this!" came a shout from the party. <br /><br />Motte approached the corpse carefully, keeping his sword drawn and at attack position. He carefully poked at the corpse to see if any life remained, perhaps the ice dragon had passed away due to old age he thought to himself. As he inspected the corpse, it quicly pulsed and shrunk in size. Startled, the paladin jumped back and held his sword so tightly he lost all blood in his hand. Another pulse, more violent then the prior one, and the corpse shrunk in size again. It continued to pulse, more violently and the contractions shorter... until all that lay before the warriors is a small egg, completely encased in ice. <br /><br />"What trickery is this..." Motte mumbled to himself. <br /><br />Suddently the cave rocked with immense power... stalagtites fell from the cieling of the enormous cavern. The party of men lost their attentative stances as they fumbled for their weapons and faced their backs to eachother forming 360 degrees of vision. Another thunderous boom shockwaved through the cave, then another... and another... then stopped. <br /><br />A shimmer caught the eye of Motte as he turned his gaze towards the general direction ahead and to the left of him. He watched in disbelief as a woman of immense beauty, emerged from deep within the caven behind the lair of Lady Vox. Her dress shimmered such brilliant light it nearly blinded him and his men. It appeared to be made out of thousands of blue diamonds adorned brilliantly throughout the flowing garment. He noticed the woman wore no sandals, or anything to protect her feet from the nipping cold of the frozen wastelands. Her skin was of greyish tint, similar to the color of platinum, and her feet were nothing short of perfect. He sized her up, his eyes following every seem of her dress, every curve of her body as he made contact with her eyes. He jumped suddenly, lost his balance, and fell to his feet... the clanking of his sword against the icy ground echoed through the caverns. <br /><br />"Witch!" Motte shouted, still stumbling on the ice, "What victory you have robbed from the Great Antonious Bayle!" <br /><br />The woman did not move a twitch, she merely focused her gaze on the egg of Vox which lay on the ground, innocently. She slowly walked towards it as the men backed away from her. <br /><br />"STOP!" shouted Motte, "One more step witch, and your head will be the one I return to my King with." <br /><br />The woman then spoke, her voice boomed through the cavern with such magnificent force that it most certainly must have rumbled through the heavens above. Her voice was overlayed with many different tones displaying such harmony the world of Norrath had never seen before. <br /><br />"Insolent Fool!" she shouted, "You will learn respect when you are face to face with the Queen!" <br /><br />Her eyes focused straight into Motte's soul as he slowly lowered his head as if paying respect. <br /><br />"What are you doing to me?! Men, kill this witch where she stands!" Motte's finger pointed sternly towards this mysterious woman as his men drew their swords and charged towards the woman of utmost beauty. <br /><br />"Lower your weapons, or my fury will reign down on your kingdom one thousand fold leaving the lands of Antonious Bayle in rubble." the woman spoke, her voice itself causing the army to stop dead in their tracks. <br /><br />"I said kill her, why are you just standing there!" Motte shouted. <br /><br />"Sir Edwin Motte, I grow weary of your consistent whining. Be silent, or you and your men will die here, unhonorably, and at the hands of the Queen." she stated calmly, yet assertively. <br /><br />"What Queen? There is no Queen of your kind, your eyes are not recognized by any race that I know of. The only Queen of notable interest is that which resides in the dark elven city of Neriak." Motte said. <br /><br />"Then perhaps it's of a race that you do not know of?" the woman condescended, "You can't pretend to know all the wonders of my creation." <br /><br />Motte forced himself to his feet, he drew his weapon, and shouted at the woman, "Queen of the witches! What creation?! You are speaking jiggerish, I will give you one more chance to identify yourself, or your blood will fill these halls!" <br /><br />The woman sighed as she gazed into Motte's eyes, suddenly his lifeless body collapsed to the floor. The army of men yelled in hatred at the woman, but still unable to move. The woman then placed her hand upon the forehead of the lifeless corpse, and Motte's eyes opened once again... he slowly raised himself to his knees. <br /><br />"I have taken your life and given it back at whim... do not question my authority again, I will not be as forgiving." the woman said. <br /><br />"I command you and your men to take this egg back to the barbarian woman in the Inn. If you fail to do this task, your kingdom will be no more, and Antonious Bayle will be tortured for eternity." The woman continued on. <br /><br />"Vile witch... Antonious Bayle will not stand for this intrusion, you take your demonic egg to her youself if you're so powerful!" Motte shouted in response. <br /><br />A flash of light appeared along side the woman, a well-seasoned adventurer appeared out of light, his armor of sky blue and glimmering like none other. The men stared at him in disbelief as he approached Sir Edwin Motte. <br /><br />"Son, do as she requests... You dare to challenge this mysterious woman, but do you dare challenge Mithaniel Marr?" the man's voice boomed. <br /><br />"My liege, it is really you... " Motte said as he dropped to his knees in a prayer's stance. <br /><br />Mithaniel Marr continued, "You fifteen travellers have been sent on a quest by Her. You are the first mortals to ever set eyes on our Queen, and you are never to mention of what happened here. Your hatred makes you ignorant, before you stands Veeshan -- The Wurm Queen and creator of our world, and yet you treat her like a peasant dog! Now take the egg of Lady Vox, and bring it to the barbarian woman in the Inn, and say nothing other than 'The egg will form the house'. Do you understand?" <br /><br />The men all stood there, eyeing the woman in disbelief, but as their God has told them... this is the one, true Veeshan. The Wurm Queen, ruler of the Gods, creator of Norrath, but a mere woman? Something isn't right here they thought to themselves. <br /><br />The woman turned her back to the men and slowly walked away, each step she took shook the cavern with enormous force as if she were a creature a thousand feet tall weighing that of a mountain. Her image slowly faded away into nothing, looking back at where Mithanial Marr stood, he was gone as well. <br /><br />There were two more eggs as well, that of Lord Nagafen, the dragon of fire... and Trakanon the dragon of Poison. Both were given to their subsequent holders in much the same manner, the three travellers met together in the land of Velious... and from that day forth, the House was born. Led by the Iksar Monk Kobrah and his first officer Punqr (the innkeeper), and the troll who's name holds more power than he could possibly understand: Tvesh Szat. Thus formed by the original members, holders of the three eggs of the dragons, the House of Szat was born. <br /></font>
