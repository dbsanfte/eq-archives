	"Bear WITNESS to these words, all ye, friends of this pair. Vigdis, steel-bright maiden, dancer of
	swords; Dindawen, earth-muted man, weaver of dreams; Children of Gaeia, who would share a path,
	and light the darkness of their lives.  Many have wandered the forest, though few have seen the
	Lover Trees.  A bound pair, twisting, twining about each other in gentle embrace, holding each
	other, sharing the light ... and the darknes, sharing the gentle raid ... and the lashing storms
	which so often uproot the weak.  Bear witness to these, the Lover Trees, uplifting, binding, sharing,
	holding.  May they ever grow to one another, and shelter the seedings which are sure to follow."<br>

      Meranai was the sole Crew that died and I am sure she wants her revenge.  After that
      a few of us headed to SolB to participate in the Naggy raid. Unfortunately
      a few LD's

      down.  The good news is both Chasar and I survived Naggies fiery breath, AE fear and 
      huge claws.  The bad news is Naggy was a stingy old goat.  Nothing of real value dropped
      and neither of us won the roles for the items that did drop.  There will be a next time for
      me at least, and hopefully he will drop some good stuff.</font></td>

Saturday we were all about Hate.  It was an unholy early hour but thanks to the tip from Odessy, ex crew and Stoic Beguiler, and, in my case, an early morning call from Jarmir (damn he's demanding at 7 in the morning), we all 
wiped the sleep crust from our eyes and hit Hate en masse for one of the first times in Crew history.  Grats, um, me on a Indo BP, Meranai on her Indo helm and boots, Ralena on her purple gloves and arms, Cadogan_Bot_001 on his purple boots and
bracer, Gundan on his Epic Maestro Hand, and Jarmir on his Epic Tainted BP.  Extra special grats to Ground_Rot_001 for its
new shaman arms and bracer, enchanter boots and gloves, and random other iksar warrior crap (wtf makes an iksar warrior anyway?) - 
may Bish and Klaj wake up earlier next time!<br>

(Hate image thanks to Mer. She don't win any photography prizes, but we love her anyway)<br><P>

Sunday, as previously planned, we hit Hole with Relentless Storm and Mistical Dawn.  Everything went as expected (except for, uh, that cramped ass corpse retrieval in the tower) and Katheryn, Faendrill, and Sckarr
killed Jael for their epic and Moleemi finished the shammy piece.  Get used to claustrophobia, though.  We have to visit the lovely
accommodations that Hole has to offer
for Jarmir (who's Keeper wasn't up /flip Keeper) and our up and coming rangers and shammies.</font>

Just call today "Epic Day."  We were pounding out the epic pieces and showing Norrath to fear The Crew.  Ralena is now to the end of her
rez stick; Klajorne has finally started his shammy spear; Megil began the leaf blower and helped out as we took on the corrupted dark elf for Dindawen's own scimitar; we also nabbed the corrupted elfie again
for Faendrill's lightening blades.  It was a truly fantastic sight, watching fourteen of our mates bum rush the corrupted and wipe him out so 
quickly Faendrill was busy yelling "I'm running my ass off trying to get back!!!"  Anything that makes Faen lose his cool is fun in my book.<br><P>

Tonight The Crew, Relentless Storm, and Sun Storm Rising played a little game:  who was the best .... <br><br>

On the other hand, we all learned a lot. Back up = back up. Camp out = /q da f00k out now. And TRAIN = Woot, there's one of our bodies coming back to be rezzed!! BTW, we _are_ returning, and we are returning with a big ass Crew force to beat those giants into submission. See ya there.<br>

implement he has on his head.  Meranai also nabbed some Moktor Greaves, 21AC 10STr 10STA 15HP, and should be feeling a little more comfortable in her dashing new look.
