 Let it be known that Destiny herself shines with pride 
          on this day as the founding laws of her guild are laid forth by myself 
          and those who stand with me. By this doctrine do we stake our fortune 
          and seek our fate; by this path shall we earn our namesake.</p>

ENJOYMENT AND CAMARADERIE </font></td></tr><tr><td>

<font class="newstext">
We are all on this path because it provides us enjoyment; 
          we combine paths because we treasure the company of our fellow Crew 
          mates. While the creeds we follow are significant and the standards 
          of behavior expected of us even more so, in the end let us not forget 
          that we are here for fun. If something within the guild is bringing 
          a Crew mate sorrow, it is of concern to us all.

EQUALITY & DUTY:   </font></td></tr><tr><td>
<font class="newstext">
We are as different as the faces of Norrath and yet we 
          are equal on our path toward Destiny. One single Crew mate’s actions 
          are never more important than the whole of The Crew. Together, united and 
          bound under one name, the good of the guild and its members comes first. 
          When a guild member requires assistance we shall respond with haste. 
          Only the member in need of assistance rises in priority.

VIRTUE & COMPASSION:   </font></td></tr><tr><td>
<font class="newstext">
We are obligated to help those in need and to alleviate 
          the distress of others, when doing so will not jeopardize our lives 
          or the lives of fellow Crew mates. The weak and innocent are our charges, 
          their defense and safety our duty. The meek may rest weary hands on 
          the strength of our shoulders. In our path toward Destiny we are bound 
          to confront many evils, let selfishness be not one of them. The good 
          reputation of any one member for his assistance to others will grow 
          and will reflect directly on our guild. At the same time we shall recognize 
          the need for self preservation and allow Crew mates to continue on their 
          path without feeling required to constantly and consistently assist 
          others: if that were the case we could never find time for our own destiny.

HONOR & VALOR:   </font></td></tr><tr><td>

 We are heroes, and our actions should so indicate. We 
          honor our names and our guild by behaving in ways that reflect well 
          upon both. We are gallant; we are polite; we treat others with respect 
          when deserved. No member shall engage in dealings that conflict with 
          the these interests. Nor shall anyone engage in dealings that will taint 
          the guild’s reputation. Such offenses include, but are not necessarily 
          limited to, theft, participating in a fraudulent transaction, price 
          gouging, kill stealing and looting. Pending an advisory review by the 
          Great Council, such dishonest actions shall be grounds for removal from 
          the guild.

LOYALTY & DEDICATION:   </font></td></tr><tr><td>
<font class="newstext">
 We will stand by each other at all costs. An implicit 
          expectation is that members will keep a certain level of participation 
          in the guild, although we are all cognizant of the need for vacations 
          and breaks from Norrath. We will fight any threat to the Guild or our 
          Crew mates with full intensity and at no time abandon our companions. 
          No member is to partake in the slandering of the guild or any member, 
          and we are all expected to actively protect the guild should others 
          slander our reputation. No one is to ever abandon another member in 
          a hostile situation. 
<BR><P><P>
        But above all walk with dignity, my Crew, and take these 
          words with you: YOU are the people that make Norrath great, YOU are 
          why the fights are worth fighting; YOU are the reason we call this guild 
          our home. Take pride in our guild, as I take pride in calling you all 
          family.
