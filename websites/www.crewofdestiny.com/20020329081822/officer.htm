Please note that we are in the process of re-working the officer structure 
and induction guidelines and policies.  We will update the page when the changes
are complete.  In the meanwhile, this is our present guild structure:

<hr size="1" width="100%">
<table width=%100 cellspacing="5">
 <tr><td width=720 bgcolor="#470000" align="center"><font class="newsheader">Great Council</font></td></tr>
<tr><td>

<font class="newstext">The decision making body of The Crew is a council. The Council has final say in all matters concerning 
          the guild. They are responsible to the rest of the guild to provide 
          adequate leadership and a sense of enjoyment to all and to consult with 
          other members when discussing matters of importance. Only members of 
          the Council may add or remove other Council members. This in no way 
          should stand for the proposition that others within the guild have no 
          say on guild direction or decisions. The Crew is a guild of equality 
          and the Council shall listen to and integrate all opinions on an issue 
          before making a final ruling. If any ruling is heavily contested, in 
          that two or more non-Council members feel a larger opinion base is required, 
          the issue shall be opened up to all guild members and all members shall 
          have a chance to vote.
<p>

		The Council is made up of seven positions. They are 
          involved in all the day-to-day tasks of the guild.  The six titles 
          of the council members are as follows: <br><P>
        

 <b>Protection</b>:
The Master of Protection shall act as the 
            protector of younger guild members in times of dire need.<br><P>
 <b>Alliance</b>:
The Master of Alliance shall act as 
			the liaison between our guild and other friendly guilds with 
			which we plan on conducting combined raids. <br><p> 
<b>Strategy & War</b>:
The Masters of Strategy & War shall advise on the 
            planning and mechanics of raids. They shall also act as the generals for large
			scale combat and raids.<br><P> 

<b>Growth</b>:
The Master Growth shall ensure the continued 
			growth and prosperity of the guild.  Growth is responsible for induction
			and recruitment.<br><P>
<b>Vault Keeper</b>:
The Vault Keeper is the holder of the guild bank.
			The Keeper holds these items of worth and is the sole decider as to whom 
			within the guild the items shall be awarded. <br><P>
<b>Web Master</b>:
The Web Master is the keeper of all things WWW-y.  Web manages and updates the guild web page.
