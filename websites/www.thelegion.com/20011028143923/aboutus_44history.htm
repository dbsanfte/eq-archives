      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The American Legion Kapperman Post 44 was 
        organized in late 1919 and received its charter in 1920. They first met 
        in the old Masonic Building on State Street but with only 24 charter members 
        and dues of $1.50 per year, they found they couldn't afford to pay rent, 
        so Dr. Muntz offered them his office, located above the Newburgh State 
        Bank at State and Jennings Streets for a meeting place. Later they moved 
        to the basement of the building and continued to meet there for around 
        seven years.<br>
        <br>
        Near 1935 they purchased their present building. It had been erected by 
        Eugene C. Sargeant, Owner of Sargeant Coal Co. at the intersection of 
        State Street and Sharon Rd. The purchase price was $1200. The building 
        had played a major role in the industrial history of Newburgh. The Sargeant 
        Coal Co. was established in 1897, incorporated in 1907 and the present 
        building erected in 1920. It served as an engine room and housed the shower 
        rooms for the men employed at the mine. The present shelter house was 
        constructed on the foundation that formed the floor of the old shower 
        house before Mr. Sargeant built the new one.<br>
        <br>
        The Sargeant Coal Company owned a second mine located on the present site 
        of Kight Lumber Company and during the time of operation had the largest 
        payroll of any business in the Newburgh area. Eugene Sargeant was well 
        known as a progressive leader and supporter of the town. The property 
        adjoining the Legion, now known as Bootz Hill, was the Sargeant Home. 
        Five generations of the family have lived there.<br>
        <br>
        Around 1931, a fire at the mine destroyed all the other buildings that 
        were constructed of wood and the present brick building was the only one 
        left standing.<br>
        <br>
        In 1970, a 24 by 60 ft. addition was built on the east side of the original 
        structure. It is used as a meeting room for the American Legion members 
        and the American Legion Auxiliary members. It is also used for social 
        events at the Legion Home.<br>

        <b>HISTORY OF NEWBURGH</b><br>
        <br>
        The Settlement of Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        Located on the Ohio River and settled in 1803 by John Sprinkle, it is 
        the oldest town in Warrick County and was purchased by the U.S. Government 
        on June 4, 1807. The town is comprised of 205 acres, and Chester Elliot, 
        an early surveyor, laid out a part of the town for John Sprinkle in 1818 
        and called it Sprinkleburg. Another settlement was named Mt. Prospect.<br>
        <br>
        In 1837, by a special Act of the Indiana Legislative, Mt. Prospect and 
        Sprinkleburg joined to become the town of &quot;Newbourg.&quot; Gradually 
        the &quot;o&quot; was dropped from &quot;Newbourg&quot; and in 1924 an 
        &quot;h&quot; was added to spell &quot;Newburgh,&quot; because of frequent 
        mix-ups in the mail service between Newberry, Indiana and Newburgh, Indiana.<br>
        <br>
        The Transporation in Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        Earliest &quot;paved roads&quot; were built from Newburgh to Boonville 
        in 1833, 10 miles of plank laid side by side was known as the &quot;Plank 
        Road.&quot; A toll was paid by the farmers to travel this highway, bringing 
        their crops to the riverport.<br>
        <br>
        Early transportation between McGarry landing (now Evansville) and Newburgh 
        was often by foot. Gradually the foot paths became wagon roads and eventually 
        necessity warrented the operation of the Newburgh, Evansville Stage Coach 
        lines by Samuel Weed. Daily trips (except Sunday) were made every morning 
        from Newburgh returning in the afternoon.<br>
        <br>
        In 1888, tracks and rails were laid for the E.S. &amp; N. railroad from 
        Evansville to Newburgh. Within 2 decades new interurban cars were purchased, 
        using the same tracks, but by electricity. In 1907, a new line E. and 
        O. V. passed through Newburgh connecting Rockport and Evansville.<br>
        <br>
        Business and Industry in Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        The first merchants were Elmer Luce and Samuel Short in 1818. That year 
        Jacob Keel began another industry paying a $2.00 license to establish 
        a ferry. Also that year a third industry began--that of coal mining. Between 
        the years of 1818 to 1850 many coal banks were opened along the Ohio River 
        from Newburgh to Cypress Creek.<br>
        <br>
        War Time in Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        So far as anyone knows, the War of 1812 passed over, and Peace was declared 
        without any affect on the residents of Newburgh, but citizens of Newburgh 
        made way to the Mexican War, some coming back with laurels. A company 
        was organized at Newburgh, Thomas F. Bethell as captain. It was known 
        as company I of the 16th Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers.<br>

        Newspapers in Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher Oscar Martin<br>
        &quot;Newburgh Times&quot; editor George Sueint<br>
        &quot;Warrick Herald&quot; J. V. Admire<br>
        &quot;Newburgh Ledger&quot; W. C. Root later Keith and Slaughter<br>
        Now the paper is called the &quot;Newburgh Register.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Postal Service in Newburgh<br>
        <br>
        Mail first brought to Newburgh on river packets. Abner Luce was the first 
        postmaster of Newburgh from 1829 to 1849. The first post office building 
        was in 1868. It was moved several times until 1897, when J. W. Welden 
        had the Post Office in his grocery store on the corner of Water &amp; 
        State Street. During the 1937 Flood, the Post Office was moved to the 
        Sitzenberger Building. Today the Post Office is located on State Street 
        &amp; Posey. The Postmaster is Gleenwood Glenn today.</font></p>
