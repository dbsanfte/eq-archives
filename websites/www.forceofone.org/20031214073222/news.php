I have decided to finally quit the addiction for good. 
<br><br>
EQ is a game in which I can't play casually. I either play full throttle or I don't play. I've decided there is so much more in life I want to accomplish than just playing a video game for hours on end. I know I quit before and came back, but I know I will not come back this time. 
<br><br>
I want to wish everyone that was in FoO the best of luck in life. Remember, life goes by fast, do everything you want to do now. You may die tomorrow. 
<br><br>
I will keep these boards up until March. I won't be renewing the website's yearly fee. 
<br><br>
Signing off for now...
