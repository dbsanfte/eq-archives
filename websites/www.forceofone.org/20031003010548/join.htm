<BR><BR>
If Force of One has sparked your interest and you are one of our needed classes, we invite you to post an application <b><font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=4">here</a></font></b>.  
<BR><BR>
<b>A list of items you <b><font color=red>MUST</font></b> include in your application can be found <font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3">here</a></font>.  Remember, first impressions do matter.</b>
<BR><BR>
If your application is accepted, you will be contacted by an officer. You will then begin a pre-trial phase in which you must attend a minimum of two raids.  During your pre-trial phase, we strongly encourage you to make an effort to group with our members on non raid nights.  For information on upcoming raids, you should contact an officer (Aleck, Waltz, Kimutav, Chenko, Tarkkin, or Asacol).
<BR><BR>
If your pre-trial phase goes well and the guild is happy with you, you will then be tagged as a trial member.  Your trial membership will last anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, not to exceed 3 weeks.  During this time the officers will make a final decision on your membership.

A very insightful quote from one of our members, in a post to someone who felt they weren't accepted by us. I think this is something everyone needs to know.<BR>
" I hope you do reconsider. Part of being a family, whether it be a raiding guild, social guild, a real life family or whatever, is the acceptance that we aren't all the same. We have different needs, different desires, different skills and different personalities. You have skills that are useful to the guild as a whole, and obviously a personality that people enjoy and treasure. That is a color on the guild palette that would be missing if you were to leave. We are beautiful together. All families have personality issues. However it is beneficial to everyone to try to work those issues out. So what if your real life makes it hard to come to most of the raids.... that does not mean that the contibutions you "can" make aren't just as valuable as anyone else's to the growth of the guild and the enrichment of all of us, not only in gear, but in knowledge and skill. I hope you stay, I hope I have a chance to get to know you better, and I hope that in some way I will be able to enrich your life as well."
