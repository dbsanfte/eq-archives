Force of One is a small raiding guild, so we require 100% raid participation.  We understand real life issues, however choosing to XP over raiding won't fly with us.  Please understand that not everyone will make it through their application process.  It's not because we dislike you or think you are a bad player, but we need to be very selective with who we fill our slots with, because we rely heavily on those we raid with.
<BR><BR>
Some information about the guild:
<BR><BR>
* Our players are mostly in the Eastern and Central standard timezones.  When raid times are announced, they are in EST, unless otherwise specified.  If you cannot raid during 7-12pm EST/CST, then we probably are not the guild for you.
<BR><BR>
* We are a high end guild that focuses on raiding and is famliy orientated to ensure everyone is happy with the attention they recieve and deserve. We will accept family members 55+ with the full member who brought them in being responsible for that person. Members sub 60 will not recieve loot on raids unless it is not needed by anyone else. Our suggested application levels are listed on the table below. We will only be accepting 65+ on classes we do not have a demand for, however if you are leveling fast it is encouraged that you apply so by the time you hit 65 you are allready aquainted with most of us.
<BR><BR>
* You must have a full member sponsoring you, and we do not allow members to sponsor more than 1 person a month. Officers can sponsor up to 4 people a month, and have the right to deny any app.<BR>
* Our acceptance levels are not set in stone. We do not set these level limits because we think we are better than anyone. We set these limits when we get to many apps of one class. To ensure our current members get enough loot and have time to blend in, we shut down that class or set the limit to 65. This helps reduce the influx of apps.

* The officers of Force of One award loot.  We take the following into consideration:  raid participation, how much prior loot the person has recieved and how big of an upgrade it is to the person and guild.  As a pre-trial and trial member, you will not be eligible for loot, except at the discretion of the officers. All non no drop items awarded by the guild are to be handed down when you upgrade the item, unless okay'd by an officer. Anyone caught selling guild items w/out permission will be subject to immediate removal.
<BR><BR>
* People are free to bring Alts (another toon on same account as main) and Bots (main toon on a seperate account) to raids.  Alts will only be awarded loot if no main character needs.  Bots will be awarded loot if they are being used to their fullest, just like any main character.  If you are going to bring a Bot to a raid, you need to be able to control all the characters you bring at the same time.
<BR><BR>
* FoO is currently Thurg and CoV aligned.  We will soon be targeting NToV mobs shortly.
<BR><BR>
* Some form of mount is required for pure casters.
<BR><BR>
* We don't allow our members to have membership in multiple guilds.  If you have 3 alts in numerous guilds, you simply cannot give us the time we need.
<BR><BR>
* We prefer an older crowd, although there are some great younger players out there.  As long as you don't get the plug pulled on you by mom for not cleaning your room, it's okay.  The majority of the guild (95%) are 25+.
<BR><BR>
* Our goal is to have a well rounded and outfitted guild who attack with strategy and skill in lieu of mass force.
<BR><BR>
* Members are not allowed to sell or trade guild items without the prior consent of an officer. All non droppable items awarded to you by the guild must be handed over after that item is upgraded, or in the event you leave the guild.

<BR><BR>
If Force of One has sparked your interest and you are one of our needed classes, we invite you to post an application <b><font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=4">here</a></font></b>.  
<BR><BR>
<b>A list of items you <b><font color=red>MUST</font></b> include in your application can be found <font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3">here</a></font>.  Remember, first impressions do matter.</b>
<BR><BR>
If your application is accepted, you will be contacted by an officer. You will then begin a pre-trial phase in which you must attend a minimum of two raids.  During your pre-trial phase, we strongly encourage you to make an effort to group with our members on non raid nights.  For information on upcoming raids, you should contact an officer (Aleck, Waltz, Tarkkin, Asacol, Anglades, and Ragnaok).
<BR><BR>
If your pre-trial phase goes well and the guild is happy with you, you will then be tagged as a trial member.  Your trial membership will last anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, not to exceed 3 weeks.  During this time the officers will make a final decision on your membership. 
<BR><BR>
A very insightful quote from one of our members, in a post to some one who felt they weren't accepted by us. I think this is something everyone needs to know.<BR>
" I hope you do reconsider. Part of being a family, whether it be a raiding guild, social guild, a real life family or whatever, is the acceptance that we aren't all the same. We have different needs, different desires, different skills and different personalities. You have skills that are useful to the guild as a whole, and obviously a personality that people enjoy and treasure. That is a color on the guild palette that would be missing if you were to leave. We are beautiful together. All families have personality issues. However it is beneficial to everyone to try to work those issues out. So what if your real life makes it hard to come to most of the raids.... that does not mean that the contibutions you "can" make aren't just as valuable as anyone else's to the growth of the guild and the enrichment of all of us, not only in gear, but in knowledge and skill. I hope you stay, I hope I have a chance to get to know you better, and I hope that in some way I will be able to enrich your life as well."
