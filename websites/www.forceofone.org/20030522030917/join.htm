Force of One is a small raiding guild, so we require 100% raid participation.  We understand real life issues, however choosing to XP over raiding won't fly with us.  Please understand that not everyone will make it through their application process.  It's not because we dislike you or think you are a bad player, but we need to be very selective with who we fill our slots with, because we rely heavily on those we raid with.
<BR><BR>
Some information about the guild:
<BR><BR>
* Our players are mostly in the Eastern and Central standard timezones.  When raid times are announced, they are in EST, unless otherwise specified.  If you cannot raid during 7-12pm EST/CST, then we probably are not the guild for you.
<BR><BR>
* We are a high end guild and are planning to stay small to ensure that everyone is happy with the attention they recieve and deserve.  The table below lists classes we are currently looking for.  If your class is not being accepted now, check with us later.

* The officers of Force of One award loot.  We take the following into condiseration:  raid participation and how big of an upgrade it is to the person and guild.  As a pre-trial and trial member, you will not be eligible for loot, except at the discretion of the officers.
<BR><BR>
* People are free to bring Alts (another toon on same account as main) and Bots (main toon on a seperate account) to raids.  Alts will only be awarded loot if no main character needs.  Bots will be awarded loot if they are being used to their fullest, just like any main character.  If you are going to bring a Bot to a raid, you need to be able to control all the characters you bring at the same time.
<BR><BR>
* FoO is currently Thurg and CoV aligned.  We will soon be targeting NToV mobs after our current members are outfitted with Skyshrine armor.
<BR><BR>
* Some form of mount is required for pure casters.
<BR><BR>
* We don't allow our members to have membership in multiple guilds.  If you have 3 alts in numerous guilds, you simply cannot give us the time we need.
<BR><BR>
* We prefer an older crowd, although there are some great younger players out there.  As long as you don't get the plug pulled on you by mom for not cleaning your room, it's okay.  The majority of the guild (95%) are 25+.
<BR><BR>
* Our goal is to have a well rounded and outfitted guild who attack with strategy and skill in lieu of mass force, and to remain small enough so everyone feels important in what they do, and not just #87 of that class.
<BR><BR>
* The selling of everquest items on websites such as ebay or playerauctions is strictly prohibited.  Members are also not allowed to sell or trade guild items without the prior consent of an officer.

<B><font size="+1">The Application Process</font></B>
<BR><BR>
If Force of One has sparked your interest and you are one of our needed classes, we invite you to post an application <b><font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=4">here</a></font></b>.  
<BR><BR>
<b>A list of items you <b><font color=red>MUST</font></b> include in your application can be found <font color=red><a href="http://www.forceofone.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3">here</a></font>.  Remember, first impressions do matter.</b>
<BR><BR>
If your application is accepted, you will be contacted by an officer. You will then begin a pre-trial phase lasting from 1 to 2 weeks.  During your pre-trial phase, we strongly encourage you to attend our raids and make an effort to group with our members.  For information on upcoming raids, you should consult our <b><a href="http://groups.msn.com/ForceofOneXev/calendar.msnw
">raid calendar</a></b> or contact an officer (Aleck, Waltz, Kimutav, Chenko, Drixane and Ragnaok).
<BR><BR>
If your pre-trial phase goes well and the guild is happy with you, you will then be tagged as a trial member.  Your trial membership will last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks.  During this time the officers will make a final decision on your membership. 
<BR><BR>
If there are any questions or comments, please feel free to contact Waltz or another officer in the game.
