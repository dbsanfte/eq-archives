Force of One is a raiding guild, and we require 100% raid participation.  We understand real life issues, however choosing to XP over raiding won't fly with us.
<BR><BR>
Some information about the guild:
<BR><BR>
* Our players are mostly in the Eastern and Central standard timezones.  When raid times are announced, they are in EST, unless otherwise specified.  If you cannot raid during 7-12pm EST/CST, then we probably are not the guild for you.
<BR><BR>
* We are a high end guild that focuses on raiding and is famliy orientated to ensure everyone is happy with the attention they recieve and deserve. We will accept family members 55+ with the full member who brought them in being responsible for that person. Members under 60 will not recieve loot on raids unless it is not needed by anyone else. Our suggested application levels are listed on the table below. We will only be accepting 65+ on classes we do not have a demand for, however if you are leveling fast it is encouraged that you apply so by the time you hit 65 you are allready aquainted with most of us.
<BR><BR>
* You must have a full member sponsoring you, and we do not allow members to sponsor more than one person a month. Officers can sponsor up to four people a month, and have the right to deny any application.
<BR><BR>
* Our acceptance levels are not set in stone. We will not pass on ANY good players but our recommended list is below. If you do not meet the table requirements, you must have good references and raid experience.

* The officers of Force of One award loot.  We take the following into consideration:  raid participation, how much prior loot the person has recieved and how big of an upgrade it is to the person and guild.  As a pre-trial and trial member, you will not be eligible for loot, except at the discretion of the officers. All droppable items awarded by the guild are to be handed down when you upgrade the item, unless an officer says otherwise. Anyone caught selling guild items with out permission will be subject to immediate removal.
<BR><BR>
* People are free to bring Alts (another toon on same account as main) and Bots (main toon on a seperate account) to raids.  Alts will only be awarded loot if no main character needs.  Bots will be awarded loot if they are being used to their fullest, just like any main character.  If you are going to bring a Bot to a raid, you need to be able to control all the characters you bring at the same time.
<BR><BR>
* FoO is not associated with any particular faction at this time.  We are targeting giants, dwarfs, and dragons.
<BR><BR>
* Some form of mount is required for pure casters.
<BR><BR>
* We don't allow our members to have membership in multiple guilds.  If you have 3 alts in numerous guilds, you simply cannot give us the time we need.
<BR><BR>
* We prefer an older crowd, although there are some great younger players out there.  As long as you don't get the plug pulled on you by mom for not cleaning your room, it's okay.  The majority of the guild (95%) are 25+.
<BR><BR>
* Members are not allowed to sell or trade guild items without the prior consent of an officer. All non droppable items awarded to you by the guild must be handed over after that item is upgraded, or in the event you leave the guild.
