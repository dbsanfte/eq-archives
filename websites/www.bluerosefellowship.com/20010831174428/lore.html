       The Fastest Item Camp Ever!!:)<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR></CENTER>
<P>
It been a few weeks past that Euramon be askin me to help 'im get some sorta boots offa one o them stinky frogs in Guk. Accordin ta he, some no good High Elders, of about the 45th ta 50th Circles Me'd say, were tryin ta kick th poor lad from where he be campin. So Me decides ta lend 'im a hand. With me not knowin th way ta 'is campin spot me shouts out ta th hole zone askin where he be. He shouted back by given me some o them new fangled GPS dealybobs. After a bit o time scartchin me head, me Dwarven Senses done kicked in, and me grabbed me chalk and started markin me path every 10 ft., just in case me be needin to find me way back.

We Dwarves ye see have an excellent direction sense, but that aint gonna do ya much good when yer gettin whacked and spun arround in circles, so me marked me path like th Elders taught me in Kaladim.

Marked me way closer and closer ta th spot Euramon been given me, headed up some stairs and bent over ta mark me spot when Lil Billy Boo come screamin from me pack.

"ARGIE LOO" be comin from Lil Billy's tiny voice when he be cut off by a loud "KTANG!!!" o th dirty frogs blade hittin me trusky shield, BashoRam, which Me leave on me back when travlin. 

Me jumps and rolls, as we all been taught in th guild, and comes up with BashoRam and me trusky blade, Ms. Pac-Man. Me swings a couple times and Ms. Paccers be finder her path real good and chopps th nasty frog up bad so th bugger starts runnin way. When Me turns to follow Me spys Euramon standin there lookin shocked like, had me not been battlin th frog, Me woulda laughed at the gawker whos jaw was tanglin near 'is knees. 

Me shoots Euramon a "yo" and takes off after the frog who bruised up Lil Billy Boo real bad when he smacked BashoRam, the blow compressed me pack, and smushed poor Lil Billy up good. Duckin and rollin me way down th stairs Me spied the frog buggar makin its way down on the right, so Me calls on the power o Brell, "STUN HIM!", I be askin while doin the ritual hand motions, and me bein on good terms with Brell he obliges me and th froglok be soon unable ta move an inch.

With the frog unable ta move Ms. Pac-man an me close in for th kill. Me give it a good bash with BashoRam ta make sure he not be movin any and lets Ms. Paccers cut in deep. Just as Ms. Paccers hit the bone the frogs skin damn near explodes.....Me was shocked!!.....did na know Ms. Pac-Man could make them frogs do that...not th live ones anyway....

Me gets up and starts goin through th corpse, and buggar me!! It be th boots Euramon be lookin fer!! Me turns to tell him and he be right behind me wearin a big grin on 'is face, with 'is hands still smokin a lil. Standin behind him be them High Elder buggars who be tryin ta steal me mates camp lookin all shocked like. Told Euramon th boots he be lookin fer are on the smolderin pile that once be a froglok. He snatched them up as soon as he could, while me be askin Brell fer th good healins he can do. Then we be headin out to th uppergrounds, laughin over our successful camp, and how em High Elders be humbled by a 31st circle Paladin. 

That'll learn em to doubt the might of Dwarven Paladins. Har Har!!</P>

<P>Th only thin that coulda made th time better was iffin we had some brew...but Lil Billy be fond o th drink, Ms. Pac-Man does na like it when Me do na fill her sheath with stout Dwarven Ale, an BashoRam keeps demandin to be shined with the stuff. So me's never any left fer celebration, and what be a Dwarf without his Dwarven Brew?  :(

If ye be wonderin why Me be callin me sword Ms. Pac-Man that not be me call, she be sittin next to the mystical Seven-Elven-Eleven long tim go, and she be mesmorized by the hearins of a Lady who could gobble up dem ghosts real good like.

An fer them who be wonderin who Brell be, he be me god, and th god of all th best Dwarven Paladins in Norrath.

An Lil Billy Boo, he be me trusky travellin companion Dolly, quite a boozer 'e is.<BR>
