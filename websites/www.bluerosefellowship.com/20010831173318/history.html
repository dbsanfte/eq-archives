<p><b>GUARDIANS..</b>

<p>Long ago, yet another guild was formed by a small few who claimed they
Felt a vacuum in Norrath. A tiny necromancer  gathered together those of
pure heart. His own heart, however, was corrupt, his vision flawed, and his
plans soon failed. Little beknownst to the rest of his family, he'd formed
pact with the devil, promising a larger guild that his own would be a
stepping stone to it, his family members swallowed helplessly in the
process. Between the necromancer and his right-hand man there came a great
power struggle. As membership grew so their greed did also; lies and deceit
became them and the shaky foundation on which they'd formed their guild soon
began to crack and crumble. Innocent members were used as pawns,  scapegoats
for these leaders' own gain. A psychotic witch fueled their, spinning lies
to manipulate them, pitting one against the other and  meetings into
massacres...

<p><b>THE PURE..</b>

<p>Within, their eyes open, fought for all they held true,  desperately to
steer the guild back on the right path. When confronted with evidence,
leaders and the psychotic witch fled. The family was left torn, in the
rubble.

<p><b>THE WEEDING PROCESS...</b>

<p>Good prevailed, and leadership was left in the Hands of the righteous. A single man began the slow process of rebuilding
all we had lost. Standing in the ruins he quietly surveyed the area about
him.

<p>The soil, he noticed, was too unstable yet. The right-hand man had stayed
behind to "help" but was later revealed to be a manipulator, using the new
leader's trust in him as he needed. Several once-sturdy rocks showed signs
of decay, weeds around them grew rampant throughout the realm and would have
to be plucked. Through the mist, he saw the evil, eight-legged witch slowly
crept up on his family. Messengers arrived, bearing Outrageous gifts from
her. In an attempt to purchase their loyalty, influence and manipulate, she
continued to spin her web, in order that she might gain entry back into the
realm, re-gaining power. Members were torn in their decision, past issues
once again re-surfacing to tear at his family. Pain of seeing his family
tattered and torn, his hand could no longer be stayed.

<p>He quickly closed the door, denying her access.

<p><b>THE SEPARATION:</b>

<p>Efforts to rebuild were soon underway and new areas of interest were
explored. A democracy was set in motion, members were encouraged to voice
their opinions, and more attention was given to family needs. The
manipulator was chased from the group. Efforts were made to get members more
involved; the public meeting place was given a face-lift and the area
re-designed to cater more to the family as a whole. He thought to lead his
family through a portal to a world very similar to  their own at this time,
entrusting the lives of the few who were unable to make the trip in the
hands of a druid named Menian, whom he had faith in.

<p>The family would exist in two worlds, multiplying in each. Cornerstones
travelled with him, swearing loyalty and promising to assist him in
rebuilding in this new land. Shortly upon their arrival in the new land and
lured by Eternity's Trinkets and their own greedy thirst for power, members
slowly left family one by one, abandoning all they once high and swore to
defend....

<p>It was at this time that The Circle of the Blue Rose was secretly formed as
a safe haven for those of honor and integrity of character, to defend the
values they held true. Word made it to him that turmoil broke out in the
homeland, in the meantime; it appeared the druid he'd trusted to care for
them had abandoned remaining family members without good-byes.

<p>Shattered and betrayed by those he loved most, he gathered remaining
Family members about him and journeyed back to his homeland. Though the new
world would have been ideal, he knew the disease had already established a
foothold and spread rampant throughout.

<p>Once home, the pain behind them, his merry little band met up with those
who'd remained behind, picked up their hopes and aspirations and began anew
with Blue Rose. Thus, the circle was formed.. Like a ring it has no
beginning or end; a small family who are devoted to each other and serving
the needs of the innocent. Armed with the knowledge that greed corrupts and
kills, we fight side by side in Norrath to keep hope alive.
