  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#6666FF">The Aiel</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">East of the dragonwall and west of the cliffs and chasms of Shara lies the Aiel Waste. Called <i>Djevik K'shar</i>, "The Dying Ground" in the Trolloc tongue, it is as hard, rugged, and all but waterless land that
  appears uninhabitable. Yet this Waste is home to the Aiel, a race of people as fierce and hardy as their rugged environment. These tall and fair-haired people are lethal fighters and skilled trackers, with both men and women serving as warriors. Believed to be the most deadly fighters on the continent,
  if not the world, they veil their faces before they kill and have established a well earned reputation for defending their land from outsiders.
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#6666FF">The Maidens Of The Spear</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">The fighting men had established a fairly sizable group by the time the first women joined them. Named Morin, she was a mother whose young daughter had been stolen from her. She came to the warriors for help, but insisted
  on joining them for the rescue, fully aware that it would mean permanent exile from the wagons and her family. Up to this point no woman of the Aiel had ever participated in battle, though several had come to the warriors for aid. The legend tells that a spear was shortened to fit her, becoming the
  prototype for the now famous Aiel stabbing spears used by both men and women alike.<br><p>
  Morin is said to have sworn that she had left her old life and husband behind and was now only married to her spear. She proved herself in battle and became the first of the Maidens of the Spear.
  Even today no Maiden may marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight while carrying a child, though apparently nonmarital relationships are quite common. Any child born to a maiden is given to a family to raise with no one knowing the true identity of the mother or her child.
  The current ultimatum recited to a woman becoming a Maiden is "<i>You may belong to no man, nor any man belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child and your life</i>" 
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#6666FF"> Norrath and Beyond</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Very little is known about this time in Far Dareis Mai history. Our scholars are researching the old books and sacred scriptures in hopes of finding more information in regards to the journeys of Elyeena Guidinghope and the birth of the Far Dareis Mai in the vast lands of Norrath.
  When the old language has been studied and translated, the information will be posted here for all to see.<p><p>
