</u></font></b><font size="3">Raids should be an occasion when people work together to achieve something. The main reward of attending such a raid is the pleasure of striving together. Someone well respected in the game once said<br>
<br>
"Raids require two things: A leader who knows what he's doing, and a group of people who can take orders."<br>
<br>
They were only partly right. It also takes people who like to work together and take pride in the success of others. If you want to attend a raid so that you personally gain game experience, or a nice item, then
<b><u> DO NOT COME</u></b>, you should not be there.<br>
<br>
If you are there to gain experience in how to fight in a group and with your fellow guild members, and will cheer when whenever a nice item is looted no matter who gets it, then we want you on our raids.<br>
<br>
If you are not at the raid to gain EQ experience points and you will not get much loot, why come? Three major reasons&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<br>
If all raids fitted the definition above then they would not happen until characters got into the high 30s at the earliest. Thus to ease people into the swing of things PP will call certain types of guild get togethers 'raids'. Thus in PP there are three basic levels of raid. These are:<br>
<br>
<font size="4">A) Fun/learning/recruitment raids.</font> Typically chaotic and with no one knowing what is going on. Referred to later as Fun raids.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">B) Experience/loot/quest raids. </font> More structured and most people should know what is being attempted. Other guilds call these practice raids and that is what I will call them later.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">C) Epic quest/planes/dragon/guild raids. </font> Very structured and everyone should know what is to be done. These are what most other guilds call raids.<br>
<br>
All these raids will have co-ordinators and all are essentially structured the same way. The main people involved in the raids are as follows:-<br>
<br>
<font size="4">1) Supporters. People there to stop others dieing and generally to help out. You will not get many of these in a planes raid. Occasionally they will support a guild raid, for example a very high cleric would attend a Vox raid to rezz all who die.<br>
2) The troops. Lowest of the low :) but without them there would be no raid.<br>
3) Group leaders. Responsible for getting their groups to do what the raid leaders want.<br>
4) Secondary leaders. Usually the guild's raid officer will be one of these. They are responsible for organising people in groups and ensuring that orders are relayed to the appropriate people.<br>
5) Raid leader. Responsible for the success of the raid. This is a big job. It can be summarised as - defining where people go to fight, what mob is hit, when it is hit, who hits it.</font><br>
<br>
All raids will obey a fixed set of communication rules. Obviously for raids with inexperienced players allowances will be made. As the level of the players increases much stricter adherence to the rules will be expected.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>AUCTION</u></font>	used by supporters to communicate with the other players and for troops to ask supporters for help. When no supporters are present then this is ONLY to decide who gets what loot.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4"><u>GROUPSAY</u></font></b>	used at your discretion mainly to co-ordinate the activities of a group. This should be used when clearing all easy mobs. Simple rule being is a single group is to kill it then use groupsay, if two or more groups are going to be needed then use OOC.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4">GUILDSAY</font></u></b>	in general this is NOT to be used on a raid night at all. Whether you are at the raid or not, ONLY the most dire emergency should be broadcast on guild. It is still the mechanism to use when someone is to be recruited. As always people can only be invited into the guild if two officers approve AND no one on-line at the time objects.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="4">OOC </font></b></u>		is for important messages, do not use it for trivia. It is there to alert EVERYONE that something significant has happened like a major mob being pulled. This channel is NOT for getting information!!<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>SAY</u></b></font>		use at your discretion. Be aware that only the few people near you will see what you type.<br>
<br>
SHOUT		is for the use of the raid, group, and secondary leaders. No one else should use. The raid leader uses this to tell groups what to do. Group leaders use this to notify everyone that they have achieved an objective or have a problem doing what they should be doing. For example, if a group is told to move to a particular room and cannot because several in the group are LD. Expect to hear shouts like /shout group 1 move to king room, and /shout ice giant diplomats cleared.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4">TELL</font></u></b>		usually only used by group, raid, and secondary leaders to talk to each other. Troops will NOT use this to talk to a raid or secondary leader.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u><b>NOTE:</b></u></font>	The guild leaders are NOT the person to ask when the raid starts etc. Do NOT send tells for raid information to the guild leaders unless they are the raid co-ordinator for the raid. On raid nights they have more than enough to deal with. Read your MOTD and know who you should be contacting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4">PRE_RAID</font></u></b><br>
Someone will want to hold a raid. It is up to them to become or find someone to be a raid leader.<br>
<br>
The raid leader's first task is to check that the raid is 'doable'. There is no point in PP trying to hold a raid to fight a level 75 dragon, one day perhaps but not for a long time.<br>
<br>
Part of the 'doability' is checking that the raid can be done at a day/time when key personnel are available. Even if 50 level 50 players can attend a Vox raid there is no point in attempting it if you cannot get some clerics and preferably some enchanters to attend. For the more serious raids another part is to check www.tholuxe.com to see if there is already a raid taking place in the zone you want to use OR a raid on the preceding days which will kill the mob you want.<br>
<br>
The next job is to set the date/time with the guild raid officer and to start booking people and places. The guild raid officer will take responsibility for putting raid information onto the guild web site and for advertising the more serious raids The guild raid officer is responsible for notifying www.Tholuxe.com when this is appropriate. The guild raid officer is also the guild's events diary keeper. It is his responsibility to make sure that events do not clash. For example, raids to help someone get their epic will normally take precedence over non-epic events. The guild raid officer and the raid leader will pick a raid co-ordinator. Normally this will also be the guild raid officer but it does not have to be. There will ALWAYS be at least two people organising a raid, the leader and the co-ordinator.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>The raid leader will prepare for the actual raid. The raid leader is responsible for
:</u>-</font><br>
<br>
1) Ensuring that the co-ordinator knows the numbers, classes, and levels of people who must be present for the raid to go ahead.<br>
2) Setting the experience level limits for attendees, both upper and lower.<br>
3) Setting the level/type of raid and in particular setting the loot rules.<br>
4) Ensuring that any preparatory work is done. In particular scouting the area where the raid is to be done and working out how the objectives are to be achieved.<br>
5) Working out alternatives should an optimal number of people not be present. If too many people attend where will everyone fight?<br>
6) Working out how to accommodate late attendees. Particularly when raids are likely to last more than 2 or 3 hours.<br>
7) Arranging for supplies to be present. In particular, food, drink, bat wings, fish scales, jaspers, peridots, coffins. In particular peridots and coffins.<br>
<br>
The raid co-ordinator will ensure that an MOTD is put up about two days in advance of the raid summarising where/when/what is happening.<br>
<br>
The raid co-ordinator is responsible for the organising of people. This will normally be The guild raid officer but can be anyone. The guild web site will advertise the raid and clearly state who it is. They are responsible for getting any key people to commit to attending and for advertising the raid. All queries about what the raid is attempting to achieve, where to meet, when, who is attending, how to get there, et al should be addressed to this person. NOTE: the raid leader is not responsible for any of this.<br>
<br>
Both the raid leader and the co-ordinator are responsible for chasing specialists to attend. For example, a Vox raid should NOT be undertaken without a sufficient number of healers and chanters/bards.<br>
<br>
The raid leader and co-ordinator are responsible for setting the loot rules for the raid and ensuring they are advertised. In particular and loot reserved for the guild or particular players will be spelt out. In general reserving one or more non-epic items for the raid leader is NOT acceptable. Loot rules must be fair to all. In practise this has to be bent. Some classes of player have to be bribed to attend.<br>
<br>
Where extra resources are required from outside the guild, the guild raid officer will be the primary negotiator with other guilds/players.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>NOTE: the guild leader has not had any part in this. </u></b></font> The guild leader must be informed that a raid is to take place and has the right to cancel any raid. Clearly this will not be done unless the guild leader has a very good reason. Usually such a reason will have to do with the price being paid to bring in extra resources. For example, committing the guild to kill Innoruk six times in return for taking down Vox is not a bargain for the guild.<br>
<br>
For all raids, players will notify the co-ordinator that they will attend.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>IMMEDIATELY PRE-RAID.</u></b></font><br>
<br>
In the hour or two before the raid officially starts the raid leader will check that everything is in place. Further, where possible, they will enter the zone and notify all people currently in it that a raid will take place, the nature of the raid, and the probable scale of the raid. They will also take care to check that people already camping spawns know what is happening and that they will NOT be disturbed. Where convenient, people already present will be invited to join in.<br>
<br>
At about the same time the raid co-ordinator will be on line and will start making sure that porters are available.<br>
<br>
Druids and wizards porting players in for the raid will log in at LEAST 30 mins before the meet up time.<br>
<br>
All players participating in the raid will make arrangements to be at the meeting place(s) at least 10 mins before the meet up time. It is NOT acceptable behaviour to log in 10 mins before the raid start and start pestering for a port. It is NOT acceptable behaviour to log in late. All attendees are advised to go to the meeting place(s) the day before the raid. If you will need a port on raid day you must pre-arrange it. Of course real life causes problems, if it does then you should be ready to apologise to the raid co-ordinator and be prepared to NOT take part. If you know you will be late see if you can join in later.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>The raids and their structure.</u></b></font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">A)</font>	Fun raids. These raids are there mainly for training and recruitment purposes. The group leaders should ensure that all members of their group have autosplit on and that significant items are rolled for within the group. If the raid is there to get a particular item or two OR something unexpected and uber drops then they should ensure that the everyone participating in the raid gets a chance to roll for it or that it be taken to a guild banker.<br>
<br>
Supporters:<br>
	Are there out of the goodness of their heart. They should expect to loot nothing and generally be pestered for buffs and favours.<br>
<br>
Troops:<br>
	Should expect to die and are there to learn. They should get a little money and one or two will get a nice item. They are there to learn their role in a group.<br>
<br>
Group Leaders:<br>
	Are glorified troops and should expect less than the troops get. They should try to get their groups to work together and inform the raid co-ordinator of personnel problems and changes. They may invite extra people into their groups but must keep the raid co-ordinator informed. This is a hard job and the group leader should not be expected to do a lot of different tasks. It is hard for pullers and main tanks to be group leaders.<br>
<br>
Raid co-ordinator:<br>
	Will face lots of hassle and will try to balance the groups as best as possible. In general they will act as a supporter and not take an active part in the groups. They will also try to co-ordinate the supporters with the groups. Rule number one for a raid co-ordinator, NUMBER THE GROUPS. Rule number two, make sure the group leaders know what their group number is. Try to make sure the raid leader knows what the ability range of each group is. Keep track of who is in which group, what their level and class is.<br>
<br>
Raid leader:<br>
	Will try to keep people focussed on what they should be doing and deal with requests for harder or easier camping places. One of the most important tasks being to ensure that the groups can cope with the area they are in. Often they will not take part in the groups and will be a supporter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4">B)</font>	Practice raids. These raids are for many different purposes and will often attempt to achieve several different things. The group leaders will appoint a master looter for the group (possibly themselves). The rules for NODROP items will be clearly stated before hand. Group leaders will be strict about the looting procedure. If people do not like it they may leave.<br>
<br>
For the vast majority of these raids each group will make a contribution to the guild, for example with an item to be passed on to other guild members or an amount of money or stacks of trade supplies (e.g. spider webs). Where raids are in zones of sufficiently high level to warrant the use of Runes and Symbols then the cost of the stacks of jewels may be claimed from the guild.<br>
<br>
Supporters:<br>
	Are there out of the goodness of their heart. They should expect to loot nothing and get no experience. Players participating in the raid should show them great respect and do what they can to make them welcome. They are free to leave whenever they want and especially if raid participants become over demanding.<br>
<br>
Troops:<br>
	Should expect to die. They should get gain money or experience out of the raid and some will get a nice item. Be prepared to get nothing. They are there to learn. To learn about their role in a group, the way a group fights, the power of a group, a particular dungeon, the dangers of particular mobs, and possibly most importantly to learn who they can trust and who they cannot.<br>
<br>
Group Leaders:<br>
	They are glorified troops and should expect less than the troops get. Their main jobs are to keep their group alive and communicate with the raid leaders. Group leaders have a demanding role to play and should have tried leading groups before attending such a raid.<br>
<br>
Raid co-ordinator:<br>
	Will balance the groups as best as possible. Normally they will play a full part in the raid but should not take a busy role that demands a lot of attention all the time.<br>
<br>
Raid leader:<br>
	Will try to keep people focussed on what they should be doing and direct people to camping places and spawns. One of the most important tasks being to ensure that the groups can cope with the area they are in.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>NOTE: </u></b></font>      As for the low-level raids a support group is a nice idea, but NOT a really a good one. Raids need to be wiped out. It is by far the best way to learn what you can and cannot handle. When you're taking down Innorruk later, you're not going to have a support group there to help you out if you're in trouble. Have the support group there to help with CR, and really nothing else. Try to hold these in Mistmore and Kithicor to learn how to do the planes early. Mistmore is a LOT like pulling Hate, and Kithicor is exactly like PoG and PoF. In Kithicor, you can pull dread/dreaded/enraged dread wolves (levels 30, 35, 40 respectively, very high MR, hit very hard for their levels, ton of HP) to mimic some of the more uber mobs [or average plane mobs]. They will deal with mobs that heal, HT, Fear, Snare, all that nice stuff. Use Runnyeye, Guk, and Permafrost too but there is not enough weird pathing in them to make them a real challenge.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>C) </u></b></font>	Raids. These raids are for many different purposes but each will normally try to achieve a single thing. The RAID leader will appoint a master looter for the entire raid party (possibly themselves). The rules for NODROP items will be clearly stated before hand. If minor mobs are present then GROUP leaders MAY be allowed to loot them. ALL money will be given to the master looter. Group leaders will be strict about the looting procedure. If people do not like it they may leave.<br>
<br>
Most of these raids are in zones of sufficiently high level to warrant the use of Runes and Symbols thus the cost of the stacks of jewels may be claimed from the guild, as may the cost of any use of coffins and/or rezzes.<br>
<br>
	The role of the raid co-ordinator will normally be split between two people. In addition, well BEFORE the raid starts the main tank and the main assist will be appointed and advertised along with other raid information at least 3 days before the raid starts.<br>
<br>
Supporters:<br>
	Are unlikely to be present.<br>
<br>
Troops:<br>
	Should expect to die, probably lose experience, and be prepared to get nothing. They are there to learn and be part of an achievement. A rare few will get to roll for very nice items. In a 12 person raid over 3 hours in Kael, 6 quest armour pieces would be normal. Thus at most 6 people will get something worthwhile out of such a raid.<br>
<br>
Group Leaders:<br>
	They are glorified troops and should expect less than the troops get. Their main jobs are to keep their group alive and communicate with the raid leaders. Group leaders have a demanding role to play and must be experienced at leading groups before attending such a raid.<br>
<br>
Raid co-ordinator:<br>
	There will be at least one raid co-ordinator and usually two. One in charge of forming the groups and passing orders to the melee troops. The other in charge of the casters and in particular making sure buffs are prepared and cast at appropriate times. Casters should not cast on the main mobs unless directed by this person.<br>
<br>
Raid leader:<br>
	Will try to keep people focussed on what they should be doing and direct people to camping places and spawns. An important part of this is keeping the entire party informed of what is happening and doing what they can to keep people enjoying the experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>Advice to all raid attendees</u></b></font><br>
<br>
Before the Raid:<br>
<br>
1. If you do not sign up, do not expect to walk on at the last minute and go.<br>
<br>
2. Be there early. If you are late, you may be told you have missed the raid. Move to the meeting places well in advance.<br>
<br>
3. If you show up late, or did not sign up, and you do not go, do not whine about it. If you do whine expect to never go on another raid.<br>
<br>
4. Sign up to raids on the web site and make sure it is clear in your sign up post which character, by name, level, and class, is signing up for a raid. Without this information, the raid leaders cannot make effective preliminary raid plans.<br>
<br>
5. Reserves. Sign up for reserves if you miss the main signup. Show up for the raid; there is always someone very tardy or just plain not showing at all. If you are on the reserves do not EXPECT to go, just hope.<br>
<br>
6. Be prepared to see the raid rescheduled by either time or date, cancelled, or even retargeted based on other data received by the raid leader during the sign up period. (For instance, we may find out that someone we know was already planning to raid XYZ so we will either reschedule, cancel, or retarget the raid.)<br>
<br>
7. Check back frequently on the raid thread in which you signed up in order to stay abreast of breaking news. In particular try to check the day before.<br>
<br>
8. Try to use just one post in each signup thread to minimize noise. If you think the raid leader missed something important then add a new post but if you are updating name, level, class, etc., please just edit your first post.<br>
<br>
9. You should prepare before a raid. At the very minimum be sure you know how to get there. Where possible look at maps of the zone and have one to hand while playing. Know the names of the major places in the zone. By default PP will use the maps from eqatlas.<br>
<br>
10. If you expect to have a symbol or rune cast on you then bring peridots for your Clerics and Enchanters (symbols and runes will be needed for tanks, pullers, clerics, and enchanters), do not rely on the clerics and enchanters to bring enough.<br>
<br>
11. Have your assist key macro setup before the raid begins. Read the board or check with your group leader to determine who the main and secondary assists are. Hardcode two assist keys to (a) assist the designated person, and (b) optionally, announce to your group who you are assisting. Before the raid gets under way know which person you will be assisting but be prepared to change to the other. An example assist key macro might be two lines as follows:<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>/assist Faedaer<br>
/groupsay Assisting Faedaer against %T</u></b></font><br>
<br>
12. Always bring your resist gear to raids! You never know what boss mob will show up for you. Area effect spells from boss mobs really hurt. Check if any particular resists will be extra useful. Cold resist gear is good in Permafrost and next to useless in Nagafen's lair.<br>
<br>
13. Bring plenty of food, drink, arrows, and anything else you need in normal play. There is no where to shop in the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
14. Sell up and dump excess coin. Do not be overweight at a raid. If you do get some loot and money make sure you have space to take it.<br>
<br>
During the Raid:<br>
<br>
1. If you're confused because it is your first time, be a follower, watch carefully, and learn. Quit spamming the communication channels with stupid questions.<br>
<br>
2. DO NOT COMPLAIN! With 30+ people on a raid, it is hard enough to keep the majority of the people happy, let alone you. Do not complain just because your group does not have a bard, chanter, cleric, etc.<br>
<br>
3. Raid coordinators and leaders: Be experienced. Do not try to organize something if you cannot type fast, think fast, and stick to your guns. Keep everybody organized. Take several hours the day before preparing canned /shouts for the zone to keep the crowds calm while you organize the groups. Spam them every now and then so everybody knows you're working for them. Be a leader. If you can not then do not do it.<br>
<br>
4. Everybody else: Be a follower. Nobody cares that you've been on 12,000 dragon raids. If you do not have faith in the coordinator as evidenced by their actions LEAVE!! Let the coordinator do their job and for gods sake BE A FOLLOWER FOR ONCE! A little humility and quietness will speed up the raid and improve your trust in leaders other than yourself. You will benefit from it.<br>
<br>
5. If there is a big crowd of people huddling together, they are doing it for a reason. Do not go out in the open just because your framerate has dipped slightly. You will make the whole zone pay for it in their deaths when you accidentally aggro something and delay the raid.<br>
<br>
6. Do the following things to help your framerate:<br>
<br>
   Turn off PC and NPC names. Turn off particle effects.<br>
   Turn your clip plane all the way in. Turn off corpses.<br>
   Turn off other peoples hits, misses. Turn off PC spell casting.<br>
   Turn off Damage Shield damage.<br>
   Turn off bard song.<br>
<br>
Use server side filtering to reduce packet count reaching your computer.<br>
<br>
There are macros for all of these. Put it into a single macro and name it RAID.<br>
<br>
Now keep it in a safe place and use it. This will reduce the likelihood of your going LD during the raid.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of slash commands that you can put into a macro. You can put<br>
semicolons between them to get more on one line in your macro:<br>
<br>
/dynamiclights off<br>
/hidecorpses all<br>
/inspect off<br>
/serverfilter on<br>
/showspelleffects off<br>
<br>
The rest you will have to do manually via the options menu.<br>
<br>
For example, go to Options -> Display and turn particle effects as low as you can stand (off preferably), turn off sky (none in Hate), etc., to minimize graphics load and reduce LDs during the raid.<br>
<br>
Be sensible with this as some classes need information ... such as does the mob have a damage shield. Certain classes (enchanters and clerics come to mind) should be particularly careful when selecting what effects to turn off. But do try to minimize your chances of going LD.<br>
<br>
7. Do not beg for buffs. Buffs are prepared carefully just before you go kill the main mob. LET YOUR BUFFS DECAY!! It will speed up the raid process (and you will find out how when you get there if it is your first time). Also be prepared to get buffed and camp. It is not quite in the spirit of the game but camping and going to the chat room until called is a good way of preserving buffs until they are needed.<br>
<br>
8. Being a raid leader is very stressful. If you do not understand how difficult it is and keep screwing around you will put the raid at risk of being a disaster. Try not to put the leader under pressure. If you see someone messing up stop them.<br>
<br>
a) If someone asks you for a buff, do not move around trying to target them. Instead just use the /target command (like "/target Faedaer") to get them targeted. Then just stand up and buff.<br>
<br>
b) No AoE damage spells unless/until raid leaders give permission.<br>
<br>
c) No pets until raid leaders give permission. In general keep pets under tight control. Enchanters will very rarely use their pets.<br>
<br>
d) Do NOT med against the wall in the portal area! (Plane of Hate)<br>
<br>
e) Do not push mobs through the wall in the portal area! (Plane of Hate)<br>
<br>
f) Casters do not nuke until mob is 60% or below, you do not want to play ping-pong with mobs. While learning 50% is a better mark. Nuke too early and you will die and make it hard for the tank to get aggro back.<br>
<br>
g) Before you zone into any Planar Zone /assist OFF.<br>
<br>
h) Do not attack until the main or secondary assist CALLS FOR ATTACK.<br>
<br>
i) Do not break mez! By the time you go on raids this should be second nature but because there will be multiple groups you will often not be told which mobs are mezzed and which not. USE YOUR EYES. If something is not hitting or casting then it is probably mezzed.<br>
<br>
j) Snare anything that can be snared. Not quite as important as not breaking mezz but nearly. People who can spare the spell slots should also have root ready. If the mob start to run it must be snared or rooted.<br>
<br>
k) Clerics and enchanters have first priority on Clarity and other mana boosts, shamen and int casters next, and all others after. If your raid is dead, it does not matter what buffs you had.<br>
<br>
l) Main tank has priority on heals, clerics and enchanters next, all others after. Generally a cleric will heal themselves, but a useful tactic is to leave healing of the main and secondary tanks to the cleric and have a secondary healer heal the cleric and chanter. Thus if a cleric is being clobbered someone can be healing them up while the chanter and tank get the mob off them.<br>
<br>
m) Druids and wizards have your evac spells permanently mem'd and have a hotkey to announce in CAPS that you are about to evac. Try to use the key at least twice before starting to cast. Know under what circumstances you should be evac'ing and whether you may need to protect some members of the group when you arrive. DO NOT LET YOUR MANA GET SO LOW THAT YOU CANNOT CAST YOUR EVAC.<br>
<br>
n) ONLY designated players loot mobs. All gems go to loot dealer to be dealt out at the end of the raid, unless otherwise instructed by your raid leader.<br>
<br>
o) Do NOT loot an item REGARDLESS OF YOUR ROLL until the loot dealer says so.<br>
<br>
p) NO RUNNING AROUND. Where you should be on any raid will be explained to you. Stay there!<br>
<br>
q) Do not ask for certain types of mobs to be pulled. The pullers try to pull everything, but some stuff has to come before others due to physical location. If you have a special request that would not normally be done, something like the broken golem in Fear, you need to have this info included in your signup so the raid leader can plan accordingly.<br>
<br>
r) Leave your self interest at home. If you are worried about loot, experience or dying, then do not attend.<br>
<br>
s) Come with a serious attitude. Stay focused on what you need to be doing on a raid. When the raid starts to get organized, the horsing around should stop. It should only return during down time. When the down time is over, put your game face back on.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>t) DO NOT SEND THE RAID LEADER UNSOLICITED TELLS.</u></b></font> Communicate with them through your group leader.<br>
<br>
u) Accept the leadership of a raid leader. When they talk, pipe down. Listen to them and do what they say quickly and to the best of your ability. Never argue with them about a decision they make during a raid. You can tell them your thoughts after the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><u><b>Advise to raid leaders and to a certain extent raid co-ordinators.</b></u></font><br>
<br>
As raid leader you are responsible for your raid, NOT anyone else. As a minimum you need to take the following issues into consideration.<br>
<br>
The specific goal of your raid, examples might be killing Vox, clearing first floor of Hate, killing all non-temple mobs in Fear, etc.<br>
<br>
Specify a time limit for your raid and then stick to it. Raid leaders who try to extend raids beyond the given time frame by trying to guilt trip raiders who have made other commitments are not going to remain popular. Good raids can turn into a disaster if people become tired or are distracted because they want to leave and cannot.<br>
<br>
Be clear about start times, assembly times, group insertion times, etc. Starting a raid thread with "Raiding PoF this weekend sometime" is not going to get anyone to sign up. If you have alternate times, post the alternates and request that signees specify which time slots they can be available.<br>
<br>
Know how to get people in AND out of the zone and ensure they are told BEFORE they attend. If wizards must be used then book them. HAVE AN EVAC strategy. If everything goes wrong and you have to abort the raid then know how to get people out.<br>
<br>
Attempt to provide as much advance recon to your raiders as you can possibly gather. If this is a new zone and there are no maps, and no one has killed Mob X before, then of course this is going to be limited data. But most mobs and zones in Norrath are well understood. Give your raid the maximum chance of success by providing references to maps, zone descriptions, strategies, etc.<br>
<br>
Be as clear as you can about your loot rules. If any items are pre-awarded, then that needs to be stated up front so that those signing up can be aware of this.<br>
<br>
Find people you trust and delegate authority down to them. Name a lead enchanter. Name a lead cleric. Specify who are the pullers, first assist, and second assist are going to be.<br>
<br>
Form groups as early as possible in the signup cycle. A 30 person raid, with groups set beforehand, can easily accommodate 4 or 5 no shows by maintaining group structures and backfilling from your reserves list.<br>
<br>
Always maintain a reserves list and encourage reserves to come to the assembly point. There will always be people who cannot make it due to real life considerations. If that number is small, you can still have the raid by backfilling.<br>
<br>
Some people will not show. Although there are times the raid should wait, in general, do not. If you're lacking on an important group like clerics then call the raid off. They will learn to show up on time eventually. If you have too many no-shows or too many people show up late, then do not be afraid to cancel the raid. Furthermore, if someone does this to your raids on a consistent basis, then do not group with them at all. You, as raid leader, are under no obligation to coddle someone who acts in a repeatedly inconsiderate manner. When it happens a few times, that is not a problem but someone who exhibits that sort of behaviour consistently over time is showing a huge lack of respect to the other 30 or 40 people who were present and on-time for the raid.<br>
<br>
Make use of out of game material before the raid. At the very least you should read and understand any tactical information presented in the sign up posts.<br>
<br>
Be prepared with in game material. Bring spell reagents, food, water, arrows, pick locks, throwing knives, bat wings, etc....<br>
<br>
It is simply too easy to screw up and kill EVERYONE.<br>
<br>
You never leave a Corpse Recovery in progress if you ever want to be a raidleader again. It can be that one dumb guy that somehow managed to run into the king room in Sol A while you were not anywhere near there - you get him recovered, and THEN think of booting him from the raid.<br>
<br>
If someone can possibly misconstrue something you say, they probably will. Every order you give needs to be able to understood perfectly. If you find half your raid went the wrong way when you said to move in a direction, they may be morons, but it still ultimately falls on your shoulders. Think of your raid as one big, mean monster. Are all the melees in your raid buffed? Have haste? No? Then the one big monster only has half as much health and does a third of the damage it normally does.<br>
<br>
Many would say do not try anything too challenging, because failure disappoints people. Others disagree saying challenge the hell out of them. Make sure you know what you are asking people to do.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="6" color="#FF0000">ABOVE ALL BE A LEADER !!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
You do not take orders from anyone. That does not mean you should not take advice; it just means the decision is ultimately yours. You will hear a lot of "pull soandso mob please," to which you should promptly respond, "We will get to it, so either shut up and wait, or gate."<br>
<br>
Lastly, and very importantly, motivate your people. Get them laughing, keep their spirits high. Not every raid is going to be easy or succeed (unless you are willing to bore some people to death), and you will have people that will get frustrated or upset. What you say and do affects the mood of your guild, so be very careful about being negative - it is the surest way to get people to throw in the towel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5">Some additional notes for those who want to become great raid leaders.</font></u></b><br>
<br>
Know the troops. You want to know what they are capable of, what they want out of a raid, and how their personalities mesh with one another. Do some of them feel raids are a waste of time? If you force them to come they will just bring down morale. Do some people enjoy trying new things (even when guaranteed of dying), or are some just interested in the bottom line of was the raid successful or not? Do some play the game for what is in it for them, or what is in it for the guild? You have to know your people, because it determines both what you should raid, and how high you should set your goals.<br>
<br>
For instance, if most of your troops really just wants to go xping in fast small groups, and they feel they are being pulled into raids, then you are going to need to find a different group of people to raid with. On the other hand, if you have 24 bored players that just want to do _anything_, you can have your pick of most any target.<br>
<br>
The larger a raid is, the less allowances you are able to make for individuals.<br>
<br>
People will refuse to come to your raids if you start 2 hours late because every time someone linkdies or has something come up and the raid is held up for them.<br>
<br>
Try very hard to have redundant people in larger (more than 2 group) raids, so if someone critical drops off the face of the earth, the raid does not grind to a halt. Case in point, you are raiding some spot that really needs crowd control. You do not want to have a four group wipeout because your lone enchanter linkdies. You do not want to have to stop the raid and say, 'Hm, our puller is linkdead, anyone else know this area?'<br>
<br>
Try to have contingencies, so you can have things flow seamlessly. That counts for YOU too! It really helps to have a second in command in case your cable modem just rolls over and dies.<br>
<br>
As raid leader you are expected to be one of, if not the most, knowledgeable person there. Research heavily any area you are going to be going into. Take a scout force a day or two earlier to get a general feel for an area.<br>
<br>
New things have to be tried and everyone has to go through the learning curve, but if you can, try to minimise the damage to the troops.<br>
<br>
Do not gather up 40 people and promise them success when you have no idea what you are up against. You can be the smartest and most resourceful player on your server, but if your troops associate you with failure, they will not support you.<br>
<br>
Recognize that some failure will happen. Players need to adapt to fights with 3+ groups. Clerics will let the enchanter in another group die, not knowing they need to heal him. The person designated as an assist will target the wrong mob, and some people will assist early leading to unmezzable mobs that kill everyone. Some wizard will probably evac out a group by accident. Some new guys will bombard you with so many tells you will have a hard time concentrating on the raid. Some guy will heal the monk on a feign pull causing a train that wipes out the raid. It happens. It happens an awful lot.<br>
<br>
People make mistakes. Keep your cool, correct them, and move on.<br>
<br>
Your first raids should look nothing like your 80th or 90th raid. People will need to adjust so give them time, and do not be too hard (or too lenient) while they are learning.<br>
<br>
Think of the absolute worst case scenario that could happen for a raid. Assume it is your responsibility to prepare for that, because no one else will. If you are trying a raid where it is impossible to CR from the zone after a certain point, then one of the worst possible scenarios is everyone dying after this point. Take account of this and be prepared for summoning the corpses of everyone that died. If you cannot make these arrangements then you certainly should not hold the raid.<br>
<br>
Try to get a feel for when something is overkill, and when it is not. You never want to use more time than you need to, but if you REALLY need 2 minutes to prepare for the healers to get back mana, then take it.<br>
<br>
Be aware of how your raid is: how is everyone's mana? How are buffs going? Is that high level warrior that arrived late covered by a healer? Did that healer-heavy group that had some people log split up into other groups? And so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of tiny details that you will want to pick up on. A big part of being a leader is making sure these details are being dealt with.</font></p>
