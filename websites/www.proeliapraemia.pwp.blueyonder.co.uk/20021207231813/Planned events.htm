      <b><font size="4" color="#000000"><br>
      This dungeon is generally regarded as one of the two most deadly dungeons on the continent of Antonica. It is divided up into two general areas, the "Live" side and the "Dead" side, named for the life/unlife status of the majority of the frogloks within. There are general dangers for the dungeon, as well as for each side, that I will mention before going into specific dangers.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Lower Guk has as its main defense the confusing nature of how it is set up, as well as lack of ready access to the deeper areas of the dungeon. It is quite easy to get lost if you don't know where you're going in these tunnels, and this is especially noticeable in the maze area on Live side. Also, getting to a particular point in the dungeon from which to pull is not an easy task for most, because they are deep in and past many aggressive creatures. The use of invisibility is helpful, but only with large cautions to it. First of all, the distinction between Live and Dead side is not absolute. On Dead side there are many "live" creatures that can readily see through Invis v Undead, most noticably the vampire bats. On Live side, it is possible to encounter undead creatures because of infrequent trains to the exit, although this is much less likely. Also, there are occasionally creatures that can see through invisibility as you travel through, so be careful as you go. Now onto each individual side.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Live side is a typical dungeon that you are likely used to, in the vein of the Solusek dungeons. The only specific danger to this side is that hunting here can seriously hurt your froglok faction, which for many is important in order to safely travel Upper Guk as well as most of Live side. If you are unfortunate enough to lose faction when you didn't want to, killing undead frogloks will increase your faction with the living ones. Dead side's only real danger is the number of undead monsters. This is a big bonus for those classes with special skills in this area, but for the others brings with it the fun that fighting the undead always brings. Most of Dead side is also very far away from any exits, so you had better have an evacuator in case of trouble.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      There are few specific dangers to note in Lower Guk. The few that exist are that there are quite a number of shaman and wizard frogloks in this dungeon, which can be very problematic because of the DoT and DD spells. Most groups tend to remove them from battle sooner rather than later. The Huge Water Elemental is important to note on Live side, because even if frogloks are your friends, he will attack you and the nearby frogloks will assist him. He can see through invisibility.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="5" color="#0000FF">Benefits<br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#000000">There must be something that keeps bringing people to Lower Guk, because it traditionally has been one of the most packed dungeons around, and you were able, in the past, to walk nearly freely as the frogloks were dead within seconds of appearing in their homes. Things have gotten a little bit less crowded in there, but the draw is the same: experience and loot for high-level characters.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The items in this zone are probably the most sought after items in the game for this level range. Skimming through the listing reveals mainstays of high-priced auctions, like Short Sword of Ykesha, FBSS, Runed Falchions, to name a few. Most people come here to hunt with the dream of ancient froglok treasures to carry them into the swamps.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This is also a great area for experience for higher level characters. It is also something of a training ground for fighting in the higher level dungeons on Kunark, as the skills that you develop here for advanced grouping are absolutely essential when you move to the even more dangerous dungeons of that once-lost continent.&nbsp;<br>

      <P align=center>
      <b><font size="4" color="#000000"><br>
      There are several entrances to Lower Guk from Upper Guk. Specifically, there are three entrances that come out in relative proximity in Dead side from Upper Guk. Two of these require a short swim through the rivers, and the dry one is closest to the front entrance of Guk. The one entrance to Live side is the deepest into Upper Guk, and isn't as commonly used.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Other than using the entrances from Upper Guk to leave, there is one additional exit. From the King's Room on Live side there is a zone exit in the back that will take you to Upper Guk right beside the entrance to the swamp. It isn't an exit for casual use, as it leads you directly past the toughest monster in Lower Guk, but it's there if you need it.&nbsp;</font></b>

              <p><b>Blackburrow is the home of the Blackburrow clan of gnolls.
              It is something of a combination between underground dungeon and
              above ground hunting area, and represents the only pathway to get
              from Everfrost and the home of the barbarians to the Qeynos Hills
              and lands beyond. The overall structure of Blackburrow consists of
              two entrances and a ring with a deep hole in the middle. There are
              multiple tunnels to the lower levels where higher level gnolls can
              be found.</b>
              <h3><b><font size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">
              D</font></font><font color="#0000FF">angers</font></b></h3>
              <p><b>This level is quite dangerous, mostly for two reasons. The
              first is that it is famous for its &quot;trains.&quot; Trains are
              created when a gnoll runs to the lower levels after being
              attacked, encounters some of its fellows and recruits them to help
              him to return to the top. Invariably, the gnolls at lower levels
              in Blackburrow are tougher and more dangerous, and I've seen
              trains of almost a dozen Gnoll Elite Guards running through the
              area. Since they are all above 10th level and the average level of
              a character on the top is about 8th or so, these trains leave a
              trail of bodies behind them and a large number of high level
              characters running to the exits /shout'ing &quot;run&quot; and
              &quot;zone&quot; and &quot;TRAIN!!!&quot; Quite satisfying.</b>
              <p><b>The other danger is that there is a large variance in the
              strength of the gnolls who spawn at the top, which is made more
              dangerous by the fact that there really isn't a good, safe place
              to stand and keep an eye on the spawn spots. They spawn all around
              you and have a wide range of levels, so you can wind up attacking
              a much more powerful gnoll if you don't /con first. Needless to
              say, this happens often, and people will be running past you with
              gnolls chasing them.</b>
              <p><b>The other problem, and this is more of an annoyance than a
              danger, is that there are 15th level warriors sitting at the top
              killing scrawny gnolls when they appear. What I mean is, there are
              a lot of high level people who don't go kill gnolls their own
              levels in the lower dungeons, but instead hunt on the top. This
              can mean slim pickings for us lower level people. It can also mean
              more trains, because a very low level monster will flee when
              attacked by one of these guys, and if they aren't quick enough or
              smart enough to catch it before it runs down its hole, you can bet
              a train is on its way.</b>
              <h3><b><font size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <font color="#0000FF">B</font></font><font color="#0000FF">enefits</font></b></h3>
              <p><b>This area, although dangerous, does provide some good
              benefits. First of all, the gnolls are generally pretty wealthy.
              Most of the gnolls you kill will either have a weapon or some
              cloth armor item, all of which are worth cash. You'll find that
              every time you go home, you'll feel rich for having hunted there.</b>
              <p><b>The other reason people hunt here is for quest items, mostly
              monks coming out of Qeynos looking for items for the quests. They
              can only be found here, so monks are seen here frequently with
              their parties. There are quite a few other quests that can be done
              here, looking for various items for use in the surrounding towns,
              so the place is a hub of activity.</b>
              <p><b>The character of hunting in Blackburrow has changed
              significantly over the past few months of Everquest, and I have
              changed this guide to note that. When the average player was about
              10th level, Blackburrow was swamped and it was almost impossible
              to get a kill in anywhere in the dungeon. Trains happened about
              every 5 minutes, and you had to play at 3 am in order to get a
              shot at camping the Elite Room. Now things are different. The
              dungeon is much more open as people have improved the levels of
              their characters, and you can actually hunt here.</b>

              <p><b>There are two entrances to Blackburrow. The first is on the
              southeast segment of the canyons of Everfrost, which can be hard
              to find given that the area is confusing. I'm not sure why, but I
              get lost there about every other time even though I've travelled
              that path about a hundred times now. The tunnel is guarded by
              several gnolls, and has up to three of them down through it, so
              you'll often see barbarians who are timid to go into Blackburrow
              itself hunting out here. The tunnel itself is long and dark, and
              used to be impassable without a light source. I believe they've
              improved it, but not by a ton, so don't count on it being vastly
              lighter.</b>
              <p><b>The other entrance is through Qeynos Hills, and the entrance
              is in the northeast corner of the zone. There is no path to it,
              but it is east of Surefall Glade and north of the zone to the
              Plains of Karana. The gnoll head canopy is hard to mistake. There
              are several good spawn sites nearby for gnolls, especially a few
              for gnoll watchers in groups that are fun to take out for lower
              level groups. The tunnel here to Blackburrow is much lighter and
              shorter.</b></p>
