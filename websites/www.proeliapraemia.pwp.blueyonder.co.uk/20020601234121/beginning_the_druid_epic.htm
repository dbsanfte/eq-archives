<p align="center"><b><a name="Beginning the Druid Epic!"><font size="7" color="#FF0000"><u>Beginning
the Druid Epic!</u></font></a></b></p>
<p>The Druid Epic starts with talking to Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods. He's
hidden in a grove of thick trees near to the Skyfire zone usually around 3200,
2900. He’s very easy to find on tracking if you zone into Burning Woods from
Skyfire. Start up your tracking and you should be able to find him easily.<br>
<br>
Ask him &quot;what action&quot; and he will give you a note. If he won’t
respond to you, you need to do the Muffin Quest (see Epic Faction Fix guide).</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="wornnote.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
Now that you have the note, you need to give the note to Faelin Bloodbriar in
Greater Faydark. She spawns around 1500, 500 near Orc Hill and the entrance to
Crushbone. She has Orc Pawn placeholder that is standing between two trees (add
loc). Make sure that you continue to SoW yourself. When she does spawn, she
immediately SoWs herself and takes off running! When you see her on tracking
take out the note and start running to her. She runs in a circular pattern and
will not stop if hailed. Run up behind her and give her the note. Once you have
given her the note you will receive a ring and she will despawn.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="133" src="ring.jpg" width="317" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
Your next step is to go to the Kithicor Forrest. Once there, head towards the
entrance to High Hold Pass. Start your tracking and find Giz X’Tin. He is a
dark elf, but will not attack you. Hand him the ring you received from Faelin
and he gives you a dark metal coin.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="131" src="dmcoin.jpg" width="318" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Handing him the ring will spawn a level fifty Dark Elf Reaver but with SoW or
wolf form you will be able to run away without a problem. Killing the Reaver is
not recommended. You will be hit with negative faction, and may not be able to
redo this portion of the quest if necessary.</p>
<p><br>
Now return to Telin Darkforest and give him the dark metal coin. He will give it
back to you as worn metal coin and tells you to find Athele.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="132" src="worncoin.jpg" width="316" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
<a name="Now is when you will need to bring a few friends along">Now is when you
will need to bring a few friends along</a>. You are about to do several trades
in a row which will cause a spawn of three Reavers. You should not need a huge
group of people, only enough to keep three NPCs busy (they are all about level
fifty). Park your friends up the hill from the Barbarian Farm, about neg 1500,
neg 1000.&nbsp; You need to make sure to do all the trades in order.&nbsp; If
you do not complete all the trades you will have to start over.<br>
<br>
Go to Athele. Athele is in East Karana north of the barbarian fishing village.
Give her the worn metal coin and receive a Braided Grass Amulet.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="138" src="braided-grass.jpg" width="329" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now track Sionae. Give the Braided Grass Amulet to Sionae. From Sionae
you will receive a Frayed Braided Grass Amulet.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="135" src="frayed-grass.jpg" width="321" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and give it to Nuien. You will receive
the same amulet back. Finally hand that amulet to Teloa. Teola will say to
follow her, instead run/gate back to your party.</p>
<p>A Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers will spawn near your party. The
Corrupter is your target. If he is not attacked within ten seconds of spawning
he will despawn (and you start all over again). Easiest way to handle this, is
for you to take care of the Corrupter and have your party take care of the two
Dark Reavers.</p>
<p>The Reavers will try to kill all the druids/rangers that you were just
dealing with. You do not want this to happen! If the NPCs are killed before you
finish killing the Corrupter he will despawn. Kill the Corrupter, loot the
Fleshbound Tome from his body, and then kill the Reavers. (suggestion here, an
enchanter can make this VERY easy, as they can mez the two Reavers until the
Corrupter is dead).</p>
<p align="center"><img height="141" src="fleshbound.jpg" width="323" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
If the Reavers kill Athele wait one hour of real world time and Athele will
spawn again. Give her the tome and she gives you an Earthstained Note.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="140" src="earthstained.jpg" width="321" border="0"></p>
<p>Bring this to Ella Foodcrafter, a Halfling running around in Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
Like Faelin, she constantly runs, so you have to chase her. Give her the
Earthstained Note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give
you her mixing bowl. It is a container so make sure you have a free slot in your
inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mixing bowl she hands you is the Shiny Tin Bowl.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><br>
<b><font size="6"><a name="The Hardened Mixture"><font color="#FF0000">The
Hardened Mixture</font></a></font></b></p>
<p><br>
You need to forage four items from different zones to combine in the mixing
bowl. The items are:<br>
<br>
Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost<br>
Sweetened Mudroot from Misty Thicket<br>
Speckled Moldy Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp<br>
Heartfruit from Greater Faydark<br>
<br>
You can forage these items at anytime. All you need is over one hundred in
foraging (which is level twenty). [Edit] There has been a change to foraging
that seems to allow you to forage these items at anytime.&nbsp; So you may not
need one hundred in foraging any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you forage these items below fifty one keep them! It will save you
time later.<br>
<br>
Once you have all four items, combine them in the mixing bowl and you will
receive the Hardened Mixture. You can now dispose of the mixing bowl.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="152" src="hardmix.jpg" width="379" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b><font size="5"><a name="The Runed Bowl"><font color="#FF0000">The Runed Bowl</font></a></font></b></p>
<p><br>
Now you need to go to the Chessboard in Timorous Deep. If you are level 52 or
higher take the barge from the Oasis docks, get off on the first island, and
cast Egress. You will port to the Chessboard. If you don't have it egress the
alternative is to levitate and SoW and run to the south. You should eventually
be able to track Alrik Farsight. If not his loc is approximately -6500, 200.<br>
<br>
When you find Alrik, hail him then say &quot;How do you make an ancient
bowl?&quot; and &quot;I can take the artifact.&quot; He will then give you a
crushed pot and send you to Felwithe.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="132" src="crushedpot.jpg" width="316" border="0"></p>
<p>In Felwithe you need to find Farious Elianos. He is in Felwithe South at the
merchant building near the caster’s guild (you can find him with tracking).<br>
<br>
If he isn’t willing to respond to you then you need to refer to the Epic
Faction Fixing page under the Keepers of the Art quest (batwing quest). You can
also gain positive faction by killing Kizdean Gix in West Commons (dark elf near
the inns).&nbsp; You must be at least amiable with the Keepers of the Art before
he will respond to you.<br>
<br>
Once Farios cons amiable and will talk to you, give him the pot and in return
you will receive a grocery list.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="133" src="grocerylist.jpg" width="317" border="0"></p>
<p>Take the grocery list to Merchant Nora in the Shop of All Halos in Felwithe
north, near the cleric guild. She will give you a bag of provisions when you
hand her the grocery list.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="130" src="bag.jpg" width="317" border="0"></p>
<p>Bring the grocery list to Farios and he will give you a receipt for the
ancient bowl.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="131" src="receipt.jpg" width="318" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
Now return to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep. Give Alrik the receipt and he
will give you an ancient pattern.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="ancientpattern.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
The pattern instructs you to combine the pattern with a piece of enchanted clay
and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. Don’t worry if you don’t
have any skills in pottery there is no skill check.<br>
<br>
To receive the platinum speckled powder you must first forage a Rose of Firiona
in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The rose is
not no drop, so if a druid/ranger happens to have one of them, you could buy or
be given it. When you give the rose to Merdan you will receive back an Old
Wooden Painting.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
<img height="150" src="woodpainting.jpg" width="381" border="0"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the old wooden painting the human skeleton in Frontier Mountains. He
will show on tracking a “A Human Skeleton”. Give him the painting and he
will crumble into pieces (this is ok!) and you'll have a silver chained locket
in your inventory.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="150" src="sclocket.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Return to Surefall Glade and give the locket to Niera Farbreeze. When you give
her the locket she will hand you the platinum speckled powder.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="platspec.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
Next you need to find the enchanted clay. Go to Kaladim and find Kinlo Strongarm
in Kaladim's EverHot Forge. Once you find Kinlo ask him &quot;what mud&quot; and
&quot;do it for me&quot; Kinlo will tell you that he would like to have a
colored axe for his service. He wants a Jade Reaver that can be looted off the
Black Reavers in the City of Mist.<br>
<br>
Be forewarned the Black Reavers are a serious mob to deal with. They are
approximately level 50-52. One will spawn, and when you kill him either he will
drop or another will spawn immediately in his place. This can happen up to seven
times! Make sure to bring a nice solid party with you for this mob. Most of them
are behind a locked door so you should bring a Rogue with lockpicking along just
in case.<br>
<br>
There is an upside here. The Jade Reaver can be purchased from other players. So
if you are unable to put together a group for City of Mist you do have that
alternative.</p>
<p><br>
Hand Kinlo the Jade Reaver and you will be handed the enchanted clay in return.
Now that you have the clay, combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery
wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="rune.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5"><a name="The Stones"><font color="#FF0000">The
Stones</font></a><font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font>&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p>Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and
the rune crested bowl. She will then make you a softly glowing stone. Ella now
will tell you to find one such as yourself. She is referring to Foloal
Stormforest in Firiona Vie.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="softly.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
You can find Foloal on the wall that circles the city of Firiona Vie at the
north end. Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself?&quot; &quot;what
answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot; She will tell you to
bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on
Venril Sathir. (luckily she means the spawn of Venril Sathir’s remains not the
true Venril Sathir!)<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir is found in Karnor’s Castle, in the Dreadlands. Venril
Sathir’s remains will spawn twenty four hours (approximately) after Venril
Sathir is killed.</p>
<p>When the remains spawn, go into Karnor’s Castle and hail him. First he
wants a Globe of Fireflies. This is a level five spell for those that forgot
they even had the spell.</p>
<p>This spell can only be cast at night.&nbsp; You might want to go ahead and
make yourself a globe ahead of time, so you aren't having to wait at the spawn
for night to fall.</p>
<p>Hand him the globe and a new Venril Sathir will spawn. Give the new Venril
Sathir the level 49 Cleric spell Resurrection (this spell is purchased at any of
the Cleric guilds). When you hand the remains the spell he will now attack you.
Kill the remains and loot one of the Pulsing Green Stones (he drops two). This
is where you can make a druid/ranger friend. Rangers also need this stone for
their epic. So you can normally have others help you knowing that two people
will benefit.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="132" src="greenstone.jpg" width="311" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Take the Softly Glowing Stone and Pulsing Green Stone back to Foloal Stormforest.
She will give you a warmly glowing stone. Foloal will now tell you to take the
stone and walk your path. The path she is referring to leads back to Ella
Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="132" src="warmstone.jpg" width="316" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Give Ella the warmly glowing stone and you will receive the Elaborate Scimitar
(10/30 +9 wis, +10 mana, +5 sv poison and disease).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img height="124" src="elaborate.jpg" width="314" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
She will then ask you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and
Kunark and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
<br>
<b><font size="5"><a name="The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica"><font color="#FF0000">The
Cleansed Spirit of Antonica</font></a></font></b></p>
<p><br>
Go to North Karana and find the Withered Treant. It is at the far north end of
NK, at the base of a mountain wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hail the Withered Treant and ask him &quot;What Sickness&quot; and he
will respond that he wants you to cleanse Antonica of its sickness.</p>
<p><br>
All three mobs start out as a tainted mob first. When you kill a tainted mob you
have a chance for the corrupted mob to spawn. The corrupted will spawn right on
top of the tainted corpse.<br>
<br>
The Tainted/Corrupted Mammoth. He is approximately level twenty and spawns in
Everfrost Peaks. Mammoth Calves are his place holder. If he isn’t up kill
Mammoth Calves to make him spawn. Kill the Corrupted Mammoth and loot a Chunk of
Tundra.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="chunk.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
The Tainted/Corrupted Aqua goblin Shaman. The Aqua goblin is found in an
underwater tower in Lake Rathe (loc of the tunnel is 2831, -912, -221 and is
underwater). You should keep enduring breath on yourself and also be in wolf
form (less agro problems).</p>
<p>It is easiest to snare the mob and run back up to the island (above water) to
fight. You can hide behind trees to keep his arrows from interrupting your
casts. Only bother to kill the goblins at the top of the tower. If the Corrupted
is not up keep pulling/killing the goblins in the tower and eventually the
tainted will spawn.</p>
<p>Don’t bother Deep! She is a major nasty and will spoil your day. Use
harmony to single pull and you will be fine. Kill the Corrupted and loot a Clean
Lakewater. The Clean Lakewater looks like a globe of water.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="clean.jpg" width="379" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
The Tainted/Corrupted Hill Giant in Rathe Mountains. You want to hunt in the
hill giant area near the hill with the Guard Tower, where Cyclops can also be
found. As with all the others, kill hill giants until the Tainted spawns. Kill
the Tainted to spawn the Corrupted Hill giant. Kill Corrupted and loot an
Ancient Rock from it.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="153" src="ancient.jpg" width="381" border="0"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give the three items to the Withered Treant in North Karana and receive the
Treant Heart.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="139" src="treant-heart.jpg" width="322" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Now go to Yeka Ias in South Karana. He is normally found to the east of the
bridge and along the water. Give him the heart, and he will give you back the
Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="150" src="antonica.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p align="center"><br>
<font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><b><font size="5"><a name="The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer"><font color="#FF0000">The
Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer</font></a></font></b></p>
<p><br>
Now travel to Lesser Faydark and find the Pained Unicorn. Ask him &quot;What
Corrupt&quot; and he will ask you to collect items from the Corrupted Seahorse,
the Corrupted Cyclops, and the Corrupted Brownie.<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Seahorse is located in Kedge Keep. The Corrupted Seahorse is a
challenge. He is approximately level fifty two, hits for 150ish and is also a
Cleric (yep, he can complete heal).</p>
<p>Bring lots of extra fish scales for Enduring Breath and some strong parties.
And Enchanter or Bard is almost a necessity here due to adds. Bring strong
tanks, and healers also!</p>
<p>He will normally spawn near Estrella. When you kill the Corrupted Seahorse
loot the Kedge Keep Crystals.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="153" src="kedge.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
The Corrupted Seafury Cyclops is next. The Corrupted Seafury Cyclops spawns on
an island west of Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears.</p>
<p>Take the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock Mountains. Get off on Sister
Island, and head west.</p>
<p>The first island is the one with a mage spell vendor in a tower. The next
island to the west is Sea Fury island. There's around a half dozen Sea Furies,
which are Cyclops.</p>
<p>You can pull them to the shore or other island until a Tainted spawns. Be
careful some of these mobs do summon.</p>
<p>Kill the Corrupted Seafury Cyclops and loot the Ocean of Tears Seavines.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="152" src="ocean.jpg" width="380" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
The Corrupted Brownie is in Lesser Faydark. He is a druid so be prepared for a
serious fight.</p>
<p>His placeholders are the Brownie Scouts. Use wolf form to reduce your agro
with the Brownies. You can find these scouts at loc 0,0. Like the others, kill
until tainted/corrupted spawns and then loot the Green Heartwood Branch.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="green.jpg" width="379" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Now head back to the Pained Unicorn. Give the Pained Unicorn the crystals, the
seavines and the branch and he will give you a Gleaming Unicorn Horn.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="134" src="horn.jpg" width="316" border="0"></p>
<p>Hand the Gleaming Unicorn Horn to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'Anon to get the
Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines at the far north of the zone,
on the left side of the green river. If your faction is bad with Gnomes, you
still should be ok going in invisible.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="152" src="faydwer.jpg" width="380" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b><font size="5"><a name="The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark"><font color="#FF0000">The
Cleansed Spirit of Kunark</font></a></font></b></p>
<p><br>
Find Ulump Pujik in Swamp of No Hope. He can be located near the froglok village
at location Neg 100 Neg 1770.</p>
<p>He is a level fifty five warrior with almost 100% Magic Resistance.</p>
<p>Lull will still land but very little else will. Two good groups can do this
very easy. This mob takes a very tank heavy group to kill. Make sure you load up
with clerics and tanks. Casters won’t be of much use here (including
yourself). He double attacks for 250DMG and has 30k Hitpoints so it will take a
bit to kill him.</p>
<p>He has also been known to run at 30 % health.</p>
<p>Kill him and loot Froglok Essence.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="152" src="essence.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
Now its time for more corrupted mobs! The three corrupted mobs of Kunark are the
Corrupted Gorilla, Corrupted Barracuda, and the Dragon Faydedar.<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Gorilla can be found in the Emerald Jungle. Place holders for the
Corrupted Gorilla are the Tottering Gorillas. Keep killing Tottering Gorillas
until the Corrupted spawns and then kill Corrupted. The Corrupted drops the
Green Tree Bark.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
The Corrupted Barracuda is found in the main lake of Lake of Ill Omen. You can
normally find the barracuda spawns at neg950 neg900.</p>
<p>Kill the Deepwater Barracuda, until the Tainted spawns.</p>
<p>Be warned this mob can take a LONG time to spawn. An easy way to see if the
tainted will spawn the corrupted is to pull the tainted barracudas onto the
land. If they follow the Corrupted probably spawn after.</p>
<p>Be warned the barracudas are not an easy kill! You should probably have
backup help for this mob. Once you kill the Corrupted Barracuda loot the Pure
Lakewater.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="152" src="purelake.jpg" width="381" border="0"></p>
<p><br>
The last mob is Faydedar. This is not an easy dragon. He however is spawn able.<br>
<br>
Take the boat from the Oasis dock to Timorous Deep. Egress/Succor to the
Chessboard. Now is a great time to have a high level mage friend. If you have
such, he can go to the Oasis where Faydedar spawns and Call of the Hero you all
over. If you don’t have such you need to swim or levitate/run to neg 11300,
neg 3500. This is a wall in the water. Swim down underwater and you will see an
entrance to the Oasis.</p>
<p>Once inside you have to find the second entrance through the second ring. The
second entrance is on the north side of the inside ring.<br>
<br>
For tactics on Faydedar look the links for Faydedar specific guides on the main
Epic Page. They are very good and have a lot of information. I will put the
basics here.<br>
<br>
As with many dragons Faydedar dispels. So load up everyone with “junk” buffs
(resist poison, resist disease, see invisible etc. You will want resist fire, so
don’t use that yet). Once everyone is buffed up then cast the beneficial buffs
like Skin like Nature, and Resist Fire. You will want your Fire and Magic
resists as high as possible! Bring some bards along they are great help here.<br>
<br>
Now remove your SoW and turn run off (Faydedar can also fear). The most
important thing for people to realize here, and I can’t emphasize this enough.
DO NOT SIT DOWN. EVER. If you sit while the fight is going on, you guarantee
agro from Faydedar.<br>
<br>
To spawn Faydedar go to Dolgin Codslayer. Give him the Froglock Essence you
looted from Ulump.</p>
<p>Dolgin will give it back to you and then despawn. Be ready for Faydedar next.
Don’t laugh at him (he’s tiny) but has all the power of a full size dragon!<br>
<br>
Once you have killed Faydedar loot the Pod of Seawater</p>
<p align="center"><img height="151" src="pod.jpg" width="378" border="0">.</p>
<p>Now travel to the Overthere. Hand the Froglok Essence, the Green Tree Bark,
the Pure Lakewater and the Pod of Seawater to Nekexin Virulence in Overthere.
When you hand him the four items he will despawn and you will have the Cleansed
Spirit of Kunark.</p>
<p>He is by the water at the far north end of the zone, to the east of the evil
outpost.<br>
<br>
Be very careful here. The guards of Overthere are nasty with a fairly large agro
range. Easiest way to avoid them is to either come along the zone from the
Frontier Mountains/Overthere zone and keep going along the east side of the
zone. Or take the Bloated Belly (the evil boat to Overthere that leaves from
Oasis docks) and as soon as it zones into the Overthere jump off and swim to
shore tracking Nekexin.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="6"><a name="The End"><font color="#FF0000">The
End</font></a></font></b></p>
<p>You’ve done it! You have finished all but one task to obtain your epic! Now
go back to North Karana, find Xanusus the Treant and hand him the three Cleansed
Spirits and the Elaborate Scimitar. Once you hand him these items you will be
given in return the Nature Walker’s Scimitar!</p>
