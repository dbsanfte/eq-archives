<p>Take a look at a clearing strategy that was posted on the EQ Vault message
boards by Perdunk on Rodcet Nife. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, this is the scoop that so many people have been waiting to hear. I
can't tell you how many people ask me in game Perdunk just how do you do it.
Well.. it is way to complex to explain in a tell or a say. And it is too
dangerous just to try and show someone as it is going on. So let me see if I
can accomplish the impossible and explain to everyone just what fear plane is
all about. </p>

<p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>*Please dont try this at home -Smiles-*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, lets try to describe the make of fear<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>plane and how you must think of it as you
are entering<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>or walking about. There
are numberous mobs in there and each pretty much has its own section of the
zone. Each section is made up of roamers and stationary targets. For this
writing im going break the zone down into 7 sections. Fear itself is basically
one big square pied out into those 7 sections. Unless you spend hours apon
hours in the zone you will probably only see parts of 3 secs while your puller might
acutally spent a great deal of time in 5 section. There are 2 sections of the
zone that are just extremely hard and more then like youll never get to (sorry
druids, warrior, and Sks because the bulk of you drops are in these two hardest
sections to get<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>too).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*okay time for everyone to switch their minds into a gemometric kind of
view*</p>

<p>As you break in, the safest spot to start out at (and we will call this the
SW corner or Camp 1) is Camp 1. This is absolutely the hardest single one thing
for a group to do, that is getting the mass numbers you need to this spot so
you can make your presence know. You see the gate in or portal is the apex of 3
of the section. Roamers from the first 3 sections like to meet up at the
portal. So when you zone if your not careful, fast and have a head on your
shoulders it is very possible that you attract mobs that roam from all three
sections. Which isnt fun because once you do this you have effectively stired
up the zone and make it twice as hard to get in. So people say you need to go
in with invis, invis undead, and invis animals, but in my opinion this doesnt
work at all if you make it to camp one that way its because you happen to have
caught the mobs in there open spot as they roam to other locations in there
repective section. You see when a mob roams it moves for about 30 secs then
stops and looks around then decides to move again to there next nav point in
their section (standing still time is about 30 secs also).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three sections that you deal with when you first zone is a long strech
the goes from portal past the yellow scareling town through all the boggiemen
to the back gorgon nest, then there is the portal section or about 5-6 mobs
that acutally spend their whole life circling the portal (the meanist being the
singlar scareling in that section), and last of the first three sections that
you encounter is the section that goes from the portal past the Fited house
back along the fire wall till you reach the section that houses Cazic himself.
The mobs you will encounter that roam to toward the portal are Scarelings (huge
argo radius 1 in portal section 1-2 in boggie section, and 2-3 in section that
leads to cazic), spine chiller spiders found in portal area and section to
cazic, Shiverback apes found in portal area and section leading to cazic, Fited
fiends found in all three areas, Amygladan warriors found in portal area and
boggie section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay now that you know the make up. Easiest way to make it to SW corner or
camp 1 is to first try to take in a group of 12-18 that acutally know where
this spot is so they can get there quickly. Then dont bum rush the spot with
all 18 becuase you know people just arent made to walk in tight groups. Go one
at a time where at all possible with other trying to let people behind them
know how the gap in the 3 sections just are. Then zone in. One you have zoned
in do a turn to you left head to the spot just next to portal and look down if
you see nothing on hill to your right or left then run straight down til you
hit zone wall. Once at zone wall you need to STOP LOOK AND LISTEN (this is very
important to everyone in your group). If you see nothing coming at you (make
sure you relize scarelings have a huge argo area and you might not see them on
your tail at first) head slowly to camp 1 hugging the zone wall all the way
there. Along the way there alway take a time out to make sure you are not
draging anything with you. If you happen to pick up something along the way for
god shakes dont run it to the Camp 1 spot. Dont run off into the zone just
gracefully sit there and try to gate out. If you cant just die right there and
when you try to come back in again to get to camp 1 spot just corpse your body
with you. If people do die it is very important that you tell them to FORGET
about their corpse they will get it later as zone clears a bit. Last thing you
need is people wandering around the zone once they are in and already at the
camp 1 spot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay you have assembled your army at camp 1 (what ever the numbers may be.
the more people the better but i would suggest at least 18 people if you want
to mark that spot as your permantly but you can pull it off with 12 people).
Time to set up the camp 1 rules:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Rule #1 no one leaves the spot.. always keep your pulls as far up in
the spot as possible and avoide runners</p>

<p>Rule #2 if you get feared or teleported. Stand there like you were coming in
for the first time and make sure you having picked up anything else if you have
been fun having you in the group but you better die or gate out and we will let
you know when its safe to try to come back in. Dont not run hrough out the zone
you maybe with out your corpse till your puller things its okay for him to drag
it back to you, which could be a long time.</p>

<p>Rule #3 Dont bicker in OOC about who isnt or is in your group at the time or
what the loot order is. Most important thing right now is killing about 7-9
mobs so if you do die you can come back in safely. Just keep your mind on the
killing machine and bicker in your repective groups till you are safely out of
camp 1 when there is more time to have coversations because zone is about to be
mastered.</p>

<p>Rule #4 DO NOT succor or evac unless you absolutely have too because if you
can take a couple of death or maybe even have the entire party wiped out but
you get that extra mob that normally you wouldnt of because you succored it
makes the take over of the zone alot easier because once again zone back in if
you die is that much easier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that the primary of the rules are made up and everyone is itching to get
to bisness its time to pull. The puller should be someone that you trust and
that you know if they will die before they bring back too much stuff to the
group. This could be someone of any class. Although i prefer clerics over any
other class because (opps i forgot to mention the Worry worts that are in
section portal and boggie) if a frog jumps them they can DA (devine aura) so
that on the way back with pull the frog cannt evoke fear them all over the
zone. But im sure each person has their ideal of which class makes the best
puller. And it really doesnt matter as long as the puller always acts with the
group best interest over their own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay now the puller jumps down from camp 1 and begin to look. Never pull
anything from the sectioin leading back to boggies and imp tower. Imp tower is
a bad thing because some times there is 4-5 imps sitting there having lunch.
always try to pull singles from some where in between portal and and up to but
not including the fited house in the section leading to cazic. Be patient you
might have to wait for some stuff to come into that area but who are we kidding
we arent in a marathon here we wanna clear and stay alive</p>

<p>*smiles*.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Okay going forwar lets say you have now successfully killed about 9
mobs around the portal from parts of all three first sections. Now the puller
uses his judgement to look around the portal area once you can detremine that
there is no mobs between camp 1 and the fited area. Be patient again for the
roamers to come to you and you should never move till you have at least killed
about 9 mobs. Its time to move to a spot we call Camp 2 or THE TREE. The
location of camp to is along the zone wall on your left as you look at the portal
from camp 1. It is a big open area that can fit 30 or more people confortably
for then next saga of your POF exprience. Infact you will more then like spend
the rest of your time in POF at camp TWO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time you can elect to do 1 of 2 sections.</p>

<p>*COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT boggie section at the moment (once again sorry
druids and bards we will get to your stuff eventually).* </p>

<p>You can either clear your way back to cazic and the cubes (there is another
name for them but they look like huge cubes) or you can proceed to the next
section or the section i call the dragon area (dracholice). If you pick back to
cazic your are going make your mages happy if you pick dragon area youll make
everyone but mages and bards happy. Normally becuase you get a lot of mage
stuff at camp 1 i chose going to the dragon area becuase this area needs to be
pretty dam clear before you think about going to the boggie area again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In the dragon area thre really is only 2 spots to pull from. The best
spot is the ruin thing that is right next to hour glass bridge. *first thing
you must clear for this spot is the 2-3 tentcle terrors on the right side of
hour glass bridge (merry xmas rangers). Then that pull spot is completely open
to pull from. When you get so your standing in that spot just look back through
the dragon area till you see the closest thing in spell cast range that is
vertulally by itself so you continue with single pulls. You are not all ways
going to get single pulls from there but i will tell you that you can out run Fiteds,
warrios, knights so if you get alot of stuff coming at you just run and hope
only the fastest stuff comes the other slow stuff will retrun to spot till you
get close to that spot again (this is called auto pull and ill explain about
that in a bit). Just keep pulling from that spot next to ruin till you no
longer can see a mob in spell cast range. 2nd spot in this area is just ahead
of you the hump at the bottom of the hill you cant see over (very dangerous
spot, in fact this spot kills me so many time becuase before you can see whats
over the hill 4 frogs jump you and its all over *rememer da*) Another thing you
have to watch out for while in dragon area is the dragon himself. Never pull
from this area when dragon is up from because it will wander back to the back
of hte area soon enough. This is when i take the time to switch between dragon
area and section that leads to cazic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have the large amout of dragon area cleared you can start on boggie
area, finish the to cazic area or pull the dragon himself. I would advis that
you fisrt clear the begining of boggie area and the major part of to cazic area
before pulling the dragon so you dont get area feared into bringing more mobs
back with you while fighting the dragon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay to start the pull in boggie area.. you are standing on the spot you
started pulliing dragon area and you turn to your right you see a house. In
this house is 3 mobs. They all will come and they will be either all boggie men
or a mixture of boggie men and samhains. Careful you can out run all these mobs
and you wil have to kind of stop go hand feed them your flesh on the way back
to camp 2 for the pull. Once you have pulled the boggie house. ITs time for
your group to med up full with their buffs becuase the imp tower is next. While
attempting to pull the imp tower you just kind of try to get as close as
possible without acutally hitting any of the imps you will usually get 2-3 imps
if you pray kill those and go back for the last 2-3 imps. Then the back side or
boggie area is open for you to wander through and pull singles. Always remember
the pathing in PoF is not just smack and run becuase mobs dont care how you get
to where your going they will go on their own lil pathing area unless your are
feeding flesh all the way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have cleared PORTAL, TO CAZIC, DRAGON, and BOGGIE sections you can
either move in closer with group to a spot of your choosing to the gorgon next
in back or you can start to pull the CAZIC section himself. *CAZIC has a HT
that will kill someone with 2133 hps instantly so be careful when pulling from
cazic area because his argo range is the largest of all mobs. Once you have
gotten all the stuff from cazic area and cleared the back section or gorgan
nest area you are ready for the 7th and hardest section.Remeber at all times
you havent cleared cazic area because if you bring cazic you will bring the
entire zone because he calls them all. 7th area is the temple behind the fire
wall. Best thing to do to pull this area is to send someone with good magic resist
through the fire wall near the fited house (camp 2). You will get HTed by all
the knights in temple and cuasing a auto pull because i dont suggest you stick
around but beat feat back to camp 2. Nothing will mostly come because you out
ran them just start heading back to cazic along firewall youll see one and two
knights/warriors coming most times till you clear the temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Now once you clear the zone ... good luck you are are ready for cazic.
I say good luck because my server has yet to kill him and it will be along time
before we do probably becuase by the time you get to this point you have been
in fear for 12 hours and stuff is already respawning. AND OR people have come
and gone and your numbers are depleted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*********** AUTO PULL*********</p>

<p>&nbsp;Auto pull happens when you out run something back to pull spot or for
what ever reason something that argoed you didnt follow you back off pull but
returned to thier spots in thier section. Once this happens they transfer the
argo flag to everything around them. So when you get into a range witch you
willl have to determine through your own test, stuff just comes at you.
Normally in ones or 2's depending on how deep you are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In closing i would like to say i also use my sould to pick up the
dopplar effect the mobs are making so i can tell if there is a mob coming or
going near me. And good luck to all servers i hope this helps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*** BE KIND TO YOUR PULLER***</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>it is not unlikely that they will
die repeatedly in a matter of mins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks all for your ears .. i may have skiped some stuff but it isnt easy to
explain how to get through fear but i didnt attempt it for you. NOw you have
something to go by .. use it or not just have fun. If you have any other
questions about mechanics in PoF i will try and attempt to answer them.</p>
