By this time the mass had moved 2 of the giants out into a little more space. What you can’t see here, is the 3 other giants behind these guys. The extra giants were from a bad pull from what I understand from the shouts but who of us has not had a bad pull? In the end they all died.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Yep, it was about here that everyone went link dead for the first of 4, right on top of each other. Death upon death. If it weren't for our numbers, which ironically caused the crash, we would have all been dead with no way back. I'm all fine with the fact that the dragon was beefed up, but when the server crashes when you meet the numbers needed to kill him it makes me go hmmm…</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">For the inquiring minds, this is the faction that get from a fire giant warrior. Also note the 21 points I got from my arrow! Even in the back you can get into the action ;)., when I got done with him he only had 6979 hit points left.</P>
