I had never been here before so I was ignorant of the horror just a few feet ahead but I could feel the panic take hold as Buffs upon buff were thrown on. This went on for more that 20 min. I kid you not. To the point that by the time everyone was buffed and medded up, the buffs were fading off. LOL. My one though about this is at points being over prepared is not as good and being prepared to get the job done at hand. The clerics I can understand though, they were way over worked. All I can say to the young clerics out there, you are needed in the worst possible way on this mission. Thank you to all that came.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Looking the other way, the coast is clear for now. This is a great huge platform to stage a giant massacre. Let them come way out into the platform, a problem I saw is that the tanks jumped in way down at the end there. This caused some to get locked in and with no hope of escape, it also cut off the back half of the giant to surrounded damage. In the end it was all fine.</P>
