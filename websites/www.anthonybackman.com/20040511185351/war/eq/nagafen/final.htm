<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ever want to see the most unpopular NPC in the game? No it's not the Dragon, it's that magicans pet who was standing a bit too close to the door for most peoples comfort. I haven't seen so many screams since DaVinn was let loose on a pile of Newbes. Note to casters with pets: keep them close.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The mighty beast. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. Snagged this baby and strafed to the left to get out of the way. Tried to target to shoot an arrow into the fray but lag was not letting me have any of that. It was impossible to target. I had to target Mugazz in my party and assist him, but the lag was so bad it took forever to even do that. Suggestion: Have your lead be the assist for everyone. Target him/her before you go in and assist when the fight starts.</P>
