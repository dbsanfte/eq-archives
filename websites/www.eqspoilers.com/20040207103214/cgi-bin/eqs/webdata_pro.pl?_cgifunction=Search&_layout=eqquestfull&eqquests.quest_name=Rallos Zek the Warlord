<br>
<font color=#d2d200><b>Description:</b></font><br>
<b>Before We Get Started</b><BR><BR>The Rallos Zek encounter is by far the most challenging pre-elemental event in the game. This is the type of event that will take numerous attempts to complete. You must be prepared to spend a good period of time learning each portion of this event. Even though you have likely killed Tallon and Vallon Zek before, these versions are different, and arguably more difficult. We failed this event ten or more times before we completed it. We then failed it twice more before completing it the second time. Truth be told Rallos Zek is a trickier encounter than anything you will face in the elemental planes with the exception of Coirnav and the Rathe Council. Guilds are often surprised to find how much easier it is to learn the elemental encounters as compared to Rallos Zek. This spoiler will tell you what you need to know and should help you overcome this event much quicker than you would be able to otherwise, but you wiill still fail. Don't be discouraged by failure. The event resets in twenty minutes. Make no doubt you will fail this event over and over again. If you are persistant though, you will defeat it. <BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>Rallos Zek is trackable from the graveyward. You can also invis in to above the pit and see him from there if he is up. When you exit the hallway that is above the pit turn around and look up. You will see a platform above you. If you see an axe twirling around from time to time, then Rallos Zek is up. <BR><BR>Rallos Zek is a three day spawn on success. The event resets in twenty minutes on a fail. You will know that the event has reset when the Decorin Berik and Decorin Grunhork respawn. <BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>For starters you need a determined team. You need a solid warrior and a solid paladin tank. You also want as many enchanters with CoD as possible. Two weaponshield tanks, six clerics, a wizard, a couple bards, a couple feign death pullers and a whole lot of DPS. Elementally equipped guilds should be able to take down Rallos Zek with 50 players. Pre-elemental guilds should bring as many as they can muster. <BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>Gather your forces at the graveyard and buff up. Everyone should have two junk buffs before buffing. Everyone also needs to have a clickable buffing item ready to be used. Hendins dispel magic and you will be fighting many of them. <BR><BR>You will need to assign a main tank, second tank and a split tank at the minimum. You will need at least two pullers pulling in tandem (taking turns). This is a timed event and you need the pulls to come nonstop. <BR><BR>You need to have your bards memorize Divine Aura and have it ready for later in the event. If you are short on bards then have shadowknights memorize it, as well.<BR><BR>MOST IMPORTANTLY everyone needs to bind just outside of the entrance to the Plane of Tactics. Casters can bind melee here. Bind at the stones. This is extremely important.<BR><BR><b>Starting the Event</b><BR><BR>Once the raid is buffed and ready to go you should begin pulling trash mobs to the zone in. Head straight down the hallway from the entrance until you reach the overhang above the pit. On the other side of the pit you will notice a hallway (straight ahead). This is where you need to get the raid to. I recommend pulling the mob at the bottom of this hallway and the first mob up the steps to the graveyard. This is because these mobs will sometimes have AE knockback. You don't want anyone being knocked in to the pit. Once those two mobs are down you can move raid in to the hallway and up to the top of the steps. You will now be at a T intersection. You will pull to here for a while. It is very important that everyone fights near the back wall by the edge of the steps and does not venture out in to the hallway. The pullers need room to operate. If the raid gets out in to the hallway they will be trained. <BR><BR>Before we get started let's give a refresher course on the trash mobs you will be fighting. By this time you should have experience killing these mobs from your raids on Tallon and Vallon Zek. <BR><BR>Hendin Shadowmasters have an unresistable point blank AE spell which throws you back and does 800 points od direct damage. It is very important that you place these near walls so that noone gets thrown in to other mobs. Clickable buffs are also important when fighting these.<BR><BR>The various Gindan mobs will split into two during the fight. It is important to have an off tank assigned for these splits. Paladins make the best off tanks because they can grab aggro quickly with stun. When the mob splits, the off tank should first assist the main tank to see which mob is being attacked, then manually target the other mob. It is important that noone sits while you are fighting these mobs. Sitting players will get aggro from these and die a horrible death.<BR><BR>Decorin Lieutenants are similar to Gindans, except that they can not be mesmerized. It is important for the pullers to let the raid know when these are coming in advance. Target the Lieutenant and let the raid know, "Lieutenant is incoming, assist me for target." The main tank can then assist the puller on incoming and you can mesmerize the other add. If you have two lieutenants then you will need to off tank the second.<BR><BR>Finally there is the Hinvat Deathbringer. This is a rare spawn mob who will occasionally spawn in this area. He has area effect rampage so use maximum melee range and don't pull him back near the casters. He drops a rather poor shadowknight only 1HBlunt and Ornate Chain Leggings.<BR><BR>In order to initiate the event you must kill Decorin Berik and Decorin Grunhork, within a couple minutes of one another. Different guilds handle this step in their own ways, but I am going to tell you the way that we personally do it. I'm not saying that this is the best way, but in my experience it is the safest way of doing things. It does take a little longer, but it works well.<BR><BR>First you should start pulling the left hand side of the T. You should have two pullers doing this job and taking turns. You should never bring mobs in to camp until all of the mobs in camp are clear, and you should never bring more than two mobs. The puller should drag the mobs close to camp and then feign death while you keep an eye on the mobs in camp. Stand up as necessary to keep them near you. When the last mob is almost dead bring your pull to the raid. Remember that Gindans will split, so don't pull bring two mobs to camp while they are killing a mob that will split.<BR><BR>Another thing to note is that there is a side passage down the left hall (and the right one for that matter). You do not need to pull any of the mobs in the side rooms, they will not aggro.<BR><BR>Once you have cleared the left hallway for quite a ways you will come to Decorin Berik and two guards. Leave him there for now and start pulling the tunnel to the right hand side of the T.<BR><BR>Pull the right side tunnel just as you did the left, but this time you will stop pulling when you reach the final guard at the end of the long hallway. To the left of this guard will be two more guards and Decorin Grunhork. You will notice this area is symetrical. Once you have all mobs pulled except for the one at the end you should move the raid to the right hand tunnel. This is where you will set up camp for the two Zeks. You want to the raid to be towards the middle of the hallway just before this last guard. You don't want to get too close to that guard just yet. You want to be located in between the two paired spawn points in this hallway (where there is a guard on each side). Once the raid is there you should pull the guard at the end of the hall. You should then pull the named Decorin on this side solo. This is easy to do. When you feign death he will corpse camp, but his two guards will not. Let them reset and pull him to the raid.<BR><BR>DO NOT KILL THE NAMED DECORINS YET. Sorry for the capitolization but be sure to stress this to the raid before he is pulled. When he is pulled you want to mesmerize and debuff him. Keep him mesmerized for now. Then pull the two guards who were next to him and kill them. While the raid is killing them a second puller needs to move back to the left hand hallway and pull the named Decorin on that side solo. When he reaches the raid they need to mesmerize and debuff him as you just did with the first. Why are we mesmerizing the Decorin Berik and Grunhork? Because they need to be killed within a couple of minutes of one another. When we kill them Tallon and Vallon Zek will spawn. Tallon Zek will spawn in the hallway where you are currently located. You need for the raid to be in position and ready for him when he spawns. Of equal importance is that you are on a 20 minute time limit from the time the final Decorin dies until you kill Vallon Zek. Some guilds like to kill Tallon and them immediately attack Vallon. The problem with this technique is that if you are very likely to be spawned on during the middle of the Vallon Zek fight or immediately after he is killed. If you are short on DPS you may be spawned on before you pull him. <BR><BR>For this reason you should wait a while before killing the Decorins. Depending on how much DPS you have, this could be a 10 minute or so wait. This is boring, and you should inform the raid if they need to AFK now is the time to do it. Have your puller stand down the hallway so you can see the hallway you cleared near the T intersection. Once the mobs start respawning in this hallway you should kill the named Decorins and spawn Tallon Zek. For details on positioning see below.<BR><BR><b>Tallon Zek</b><BR><BR>You will notice on each side of this hallway there are grooves. Metal bars that stick out. You can use these to corner mobs. More importantly you can use them to block Tallon Zek's AE. <BR><BR>Once the two named Decorins are killed Tallon Zek will spawn in the center of the southeast corridor (where you are located). He is going to immediately aggro the closest player. You need your main tank for this fight to be standing between the rest of the raid and his spawn position. The rest of the raid should be standing towards the back of the corridor. You do not want to go up the steps and towards the double doors where the named Decorin spawned at. Inside of those double doors is Rallos Zek's room and if you get too close to those doors Vallon Zek will aggro you. Vallon + Tallon = a loss. You do want to be far enough down the hall though so that you do not get aggro before the main tank. <BR><BR>I recommend a paladin main tank for Tallon Zek. Tallon Zek is incredibly difficult to hold aggro on. Paladins can hold aggro through it with by chain stunning. If you don't have any high hit point paladins then you may have to go with a warrior, but I would recommend against defensive, and I would let the warrior build up aggro for some time before assisting him. Have the main tank wait between the raid and the center of the hallway.<BR><BR>The healers and casters should be two ridges behind the main tank. Use the metal bar to block his ae. If you have two ridges between you and the main tank you should avoid AE and should still be in complete healing range. <BR><BR>The Tallon Zek in the Rallos Zek encounter does not shadow step. This arguably makes him more difficult, however. You can not spread out and range attack him. Instead your going to have to tank him and deal with his AE. The AE on the "fake" Tallon Zek are also different. He retains his AE resistance debuff which will lower all of your resistances by 300. He does not have the throwback, however. Instead he has an AE which centers around the target and is a pretty harsh damage over time. You will not resist this AE, don't even bother trying.<BR><BR>When everyone is ready kill both of the named Decorins. While you are killing these everyone should be in position. The main tank on Tallon Zek should not be fighting the Decorins, he needs to be in position. When the second dies you will get a broadcast, a moment of lag and Tallon Zek will spawn and immediately begin attacking. He should aggro the main tank since he will be closest, but sometimes he aggros a random person. The main tank needs to start stunning and get aggro on him as quickly as possible. Once you have aggro you need to place your back against one of the ridges. The important thing here is to have your back against a ridge that is facing towards the direction where Tallon Zek spawned. Tallon Zek is slowable, but you should be careful to not draw aggro when doing this. If Tallon Zek turns and AEs the casters you could have some dead casters, and you may wipe.<BR><BR>Take your time to build up aggro before calling in the rest of the raid to begin doing damage. Be aware at all times that aggro management is the key to this fight. If Tallon Zek turns around and AEs the bulk of the raid you are going to have a lot of dead players. I can not stress how important this is. If you think you are going to draw aggro them stop attacking. Patience is key to this encounter. When melee are called in they should melee from maximum melee range. If you melee from maximum melee range and push him in to the corner where your main tank is standing. Once he is cornered, if you are at maximum melee range you will not get hit by his AE. If you get hit by AE then you need to back up some, his hit box is huge. <BR><BR>If you manage your aggro correctly and keep the main tank up then this is a pretty easy fight. It's not uncommon for raids to wipe to this guy a time or two. Once you understand the encounter though, it is not uncommon to defeat him with zero deaths. It's important to have as few deaths as possible, as you are on a time limit. <BR><BR><b>Vallon Zek</b><BR><BR>You have 20 minutes from the time when the second Decorin is killed to kill both Tallon and Vallon Zek. Earlier we sat around for a few minutes in limbo land, but now that sitting around will pay off. You should have a 2-5 minutes after killing Tallon Zek before the hallway starts respawning. Your pullers should stand near the end of the hallway and pull the mobs as they spawn, only on this side of the hallway. Don't worry about the left side of the T. It is important to note that the raid is standing in between several spawns. You may get spawned on. The enchanters need to be ready. Pull all of the mobs in this corridor, up to the two mobs who spawn just outside of the doors. Once they are all clear it is time to pull Vallon Zek.<BR><BR>Vallon Zek can be found inside of the double doors, on the opposite side of the large table. There are quite a few mobs in this room who will all assist him. While it is possible to clear them all or separate him from them, that is going to take too much time, and we are on a time limit. Remember in the preparation section when I said to have your bards memorize divine aura? It's time to explain why.<BR><BR>What you want to do is have a bard run in to the room and cast divine aura. They need to run by and aggro Vallon Zek and train him through the double doors on the opposite side of the room. Their job is to then run him as far down that hallway as they possibly can. You need to try to make it down the steps at the T. Once Vallon Zek reaches a certain point he will warp back to his spawn position, but the other mobs will not. Once he warps back to his spawn the bard can either die or be COTHd back to the raid. <BR><BR>The tag puller will be waiting at the double doors for Vallon Zek to warp back. As soon as he warps they should then tag him with a spell and drag him to the raid. <BR><BR>Another note about the bard portion of the pull. It is not uncommon for the bard to die during this pull before Vallon Zek reaches the warp position. To guard against this I like to have a monk flop to the left hallway from the T. If the bard goes down the monk can then stand up and aggro Vallon Zek and attempt to drag him the rest of the way.<BR><BR>You should corner him as you did Tallon Zek, but this time it isn't as crucial to avoid the AE, it just makes it easier to fight him. He does have the same AE and proc as the "real" Vallon Zek. His AE increases the amount of aggro generated by everyone in the raid, where his single target proc will decrease the amount of aggro generated by his target. That having been said he's still a lot easier to hold aggro on that Tallon Zek. We have always used a warrior to tank Vallon.<BR><BR>This version of Vallon Zek does hit quite a bit harder than the "real" version, however. He hits for about 1200 per attack and he hits very fast. Until he is slowed his DPS is quite high. <BR><BR>Vallon will only split one time, and only in to two additional pieces. The splits only hit for 600ish. One of the splits is unmessable but is slowable. You should have your split tank grab aggro on him. The other split can be mesmerized but is unslowable. I recommend mesmerizing him. <BR><BR>The two dangerous moments in this fight are when he is initially pulled and when he splits. When he is initially pulled he hits hard. We've had our tank killed almost instantly in this fight because he was not defensive. Once slow lands he is not bad at all. When he splits is another dangerous moment. Although the splits do not hit that hard, you do not known which of the two can be mesmerized and they attack random players. It's not uncommon for some players to die before they are under control. If this is the wrong players then you can run in to problems.<BR><BR><b>Rallos Zek</b><BR><BR>After killing Vallon Zek you will have 20 minutes to "kill" the fake Rallos Zek. Rallos Zek spawns inside of the double doors. To the left of the table is a side room where he can be found. Before we can kill him though we need to clear his room and as much of the right side hallway as we can. We will not need to clear the left side hallway (where we are currently located) because we waited on respawn and took care of them already.<BR><BR>You don't have time to wait around after killing Vallon Zek. No patting yourselves on the back just yet. You are on a timer and you need to keep the pulls moving as quickly as possible. Begin pulling all of the mobs inside of the double doors to the raid. Do not move in to his room. The last thing you need is to have someone get knocked back by a Hendin and in to Rallos Zek.<BR><BR>This is a good time to warn the rest of the zone that Rallos Zek the Warlord will be spawning in the pit in a few minutes and that they should leave. It is not courteous to not warn players of this in advance as they will be banished from the zone if he aggros them. Not only that but if he engages another raid (possibly one killing the Overseer, Tagrin or Glykus) then you will not be able to do damage to him. Take the time and warn the zone.<BR><BR>Once you have cleared his room start pulling all of the mobs in the left side hallway (through double doors). Ideally you want to clear all of the mobs all the way down to the end of the hallway around the elbow. We've seldom had time to do this, however. Keep an eye on your time and when you get down to 8 minutes or so remaining then cut off the pulls and let your crowd control team deal with the rest during the encounter.<BR><BR>Once you have cleared as far as you are going to clear before the fight move everyone inside of the double doors. Once inside turn right. The corner you are facing is where the main tank will be standing. He will corner Rallos Zek here. Facing that corner turn left along the wall. You want all of your casters to be towards the middle of this wall. Clerics should be as far as they can from the corner while keeping complete heal range. For the time being melee should stand with the casters.<BR><BR>This is very important. Rallos Zek hits for up to 1072 per attack and he area effect rampages. If your clerics get AE rampaged you will lose. Rallos Zek is slowable with magic slow.<BR><BR>Once he is aggroed adds will begin spawning in each of the side hallways, back towards the T from his room. The adds will immediately run towards Rallos Zek to assist him. These adds are extremely magic resistant. You need to place crowd control teams in each of these hallways to manage the adds. These teams should consist of bards and enchanters. Enchanters should tash and root adds. Work together to organize this. If you have two enchanters on a side have one ensure that they are all tashed and the other ensure that they are rooted. The bards job is to highsun any that get too close to the enchanters. The problem with highsun is that it does not clear aggro. If there are any mobs left in the hallways when they are highsunned they will aggro and you have more adds. If you have cleared most of the adds then this should not be a problem. If you ran short on time then the left hand hallway from the T is going to have a rougher go than the right hand side. You might want to give them more people.<BR><BR>The crowd control is the most important part of this fight. If your crowd control team can keep the adds from getting in to the room then 75% of the battle is won. <BR><BR>Once everyone is in position you should have your weaponshield tank pull Rallos Zek in to the corner. Rallos Zek is magic slowable and he should be slowed while weaponshielding. The main tank should AE taunt before weaponshield expires, but the rest of the raid should not engage for 15 seconds or so, while he gains aggro. You don't want to wait too long for the crowd control teams sake, but don't cut it too short either. If Rallos Zek gets too close to the casters and starts AE rampaging then the fight is done.<BR><BR>Once the melee have been called in they need to melee from MAXIMUM range to avoid the AE rampage. They should push Rallos Zek in to the corner. He has quite a few hit points so be prepared for a bit of a battle. <BR><BR>At around 60% Rallos Zek will despawn and Rallos Zek the Warlord will spawn in the pit. You have twenty minutes from that point to kill Rallos Zek the Warlord. When Rallos Zek gets to 70% a wizard should cast AE Teleport. You should not take this teleport yet, but leave the prompt up. The moment Rallos Zek despawns you should take the teleport. If you paid attention to the Preparation section you should all be bound just outside of the zone.<BR><BR><b>Rallos Zek the Warlord</b><BR><BR>At this point the entire raid should be just outside of the Plane of Tactics. Druids should cast spirit of eagle on all groups and then they should zone back in. Anyone who died during the fake Rallos Zek encounter needs to immediately consent all of the rogues in the raid. The most common losses are the crowd control teams, which also consist of the most necessary players at this point: the enchanters. For this reason I like to have a player with summon corpse invited to their group immediately and have them summon corpses. Enchanters need to be geared as quickly as possible.<BR><BR>Rallos Zek the Warlord will be positioned in the middle of the pit at this point. While it is possible for the raid to drop down in to the pit without aggroing him if they hug the walls, it's not recommended. The raid should instead stay on the top of the pit, on the left hand side above it. <BR><BR>One player should drop down the right hand side of the pit and pull Rallos Zek to near the zone out in the pit. DO NOT click on the zone out. Anyone who clicks on the zone out will be teleported directly to Rallos Zek and killed. Instead aggro him and die in the corner. He runs fast and hits hard. Your goal is just to move him away from the left hand side, where the raid will be dropping down. <BR><BR>Occasionally Decorins will become bugged and will spawn in the pit with Rallos Zek the Warlord. If this happens to you then you need to separate them from him prior to positioning him. You can do this by aggroing them and Rallos Zek and running through the hallway on the right hand side of the pit. Run as far as you can, and just die. Rallos Zek is tethered to the pit. He will warp back once he gets in to the tunnel. The adds will keep following though, and will then corpse camp and not return.<BR><BR>Players who died should loot their corpses, but do not resurrect them unless it is divine resurection. We can not afford to wait on players to gain mana or wait on resurrection sickneses at this point. <BR><BR>Everyone in the raid needs their fire resistances buffed. Rallos Zek has a fire based AE which will lower your hit points by 400 points per tick for 6 ticks, as well as draining your mana by 50 per tick. It is a curse with 9 counters. He also has a proc which lowers the main tanks aggro. With proper fire resistance you should be able to resist these spells as they only have a -100 modifier, so buff up your fire resistance as high as possible.<BR><BR>Once Rallos Zek is positioned and fire resistance has been buffed everyone needs to drop down the left hand side of the pit. If you didn't get Spirit of Eagle outside, be sure to get a levitate now or you will fall to your death. <BR><BR>Once you are in the pit and Rallos Zek is moved out of the way it is time to start getting pets. DPS is key to winning to encounter. The best way to manufacture DPS is with an army of charmed pets. The left side hallway in the pit leads back to the boar pens. Back here you can find ogre pets for the enchanters and boar pets for druids, if you decide to let them charm. Keep the timer in mind and get as many pets as you can. Be sure to snare and debuff the resistances of these pets before charming. What I recommend is one player pulls the pets to the group of charm and debuffers. Once there they debuff, snare and charm while the puller queues up the next pet. <BR><BR>Before we pull Rallos Zek the Warlord we need to go over positioning, as it is very important. We cornered the fake Rallos Zek and were able to get away with it because there was no AE. The real Rallos Zek has AE hit point and mana drain, not to mention his AE rampage. As a result he should be reverse cornered. This is a tactic that you will use later in the elemental planes. What reverse cornering means is that the main tank will not be standing in the corner with the mob being outside of him being pushed in. Instead you want to position Rallos Zek so he is wedged in the corner with the main tank standing away from the corner pushing in, with the wall on his right hand side. The rest of the raid should be on the side of him pushing in, with the wall on their left hand side. The wall we are referring to is the near left corner of the pit from the entrance. The clerics will be standing behind the main tank, as far as they can while retaining complete healing range. Other casters will be behind the clerics. All casters should have the wall to their right hand side while facing in at Rallos Zek the Warlord during the battle.<BR><BR>Reverse cornering has advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages are that the mobs back is against the wall and not exposed, and that some players are going to be considered in front of the mob while they are trying to wedge him in, which makes them vulnerable to riposte. The advantages are that it places additional buffer space between the casters and Rallos Zek. This helps guard against PBAE spells and area effect rampage. <BR><BR>The other key difference between Rallos Zek the Warlord and the "fake" Rallos Zek are the adds. Fake Rallos Zek spawned a good number of adds, the real Rallos Zek will spawn an army.<BR><BR>90 seconds after Rallos Zek is damaged mobs will begin to spawn from the corpses in the pit. Adds will spawn in waves every 54 seconds from that point on. <BR><BR>The pit corpses respawn and their positions change throughout the fight. There is debate over if killing the corpses means less mobs during the fight. There is no debating that the adds spawn from the corpses, however. For that reason I would recommend that if any corpses spawn near the side of the pit that you are fighting on (left hand side from entrance) then you should kill those corpses before they spawn adds on top of your raid. <BR><BR>There are different methods of dealing with the adds duringn this encounter. Some guilds elect to have anyone who is not a DPS class to work on handling adds and not attack Rallos Zek once they begin spawning. Some raids only have the main tank, charmed pets and nukers on Rallos Zek, with everyone else on adds. It's hard to argue with success and both of those methods have been proven to work.<BR><BR>I handle adds differently than the above methods. Those methods both work, and depending on your raids makeup they might be the best solutions for you. The problem with those two techniques is that you lose a lot of DPS because of them. The longer this fight goes the more adds you will need to deal with. This is a long fight and the longer it goes the more dangerous it becomes due to the number of adds and the chaos that results. Here is the approach that I recommend.<BR><BR>Create teams of druids and magicians. These are your crowd control snare teams. When the adds begin spawning the druids job is to target in to a group of adds and AE snare. They should then run to the other side of the pit (far right hand side) and the magician should cast Call of the Hero on them. They then rinse and repeat. Using this technique you should be able to keep most of the adds snared during the fight.<BR><BR>Have the weaponshield tank zone outside and receive the duration based Selo's from a bard. Then zone back in for the pull. This spell has a short duration but will allow them to outrun Rallos Zek on the pull.<BR><BR>Get the raid set up in positions for Rallos Zek. Have the main tank in reverse cornering position, everyone else against the left side wall. The weaponshield tank should then aggro Rallos Zek and run him to the near left corner to weaponshield him. Use standard debuffs and weaponshield aggro transfer with AE taunt when ready. Send in charmed pets and remember to reverse corner.<BR><BR>You don't want to spend too much time building aggro here. If the weaponshield aggro transferred properly then the main tank should have good aggro built up already. Still I'd give it 10 seconds or so to be safe. Once melee is called in they should push him in to the wall from MAXIMUM melee range to avoid AE Rampage. Casters need to walk the delicate balance of maximizing their DPS without overaggroing. If Rallos Zek aggros someone and leave the corner you have lost the battle. I can not stress that enough. Once he is out of the corner he will AE rampage your clerics and you will lose. The main tank must keep aggro the entire fight and you must not let the main tank die.<BR><BR>Melee should discipline early, shadowknights should harm touch. Adds begin spawning 90 seconds in to the fight and will spawn every 54 seconds after that. The first 90 seconds are a bonus period with no adds. The more damage you can do during that period of time the easier the fight will become. <BR><BR>Once the adds spawn the knights (shadowknights and paladins) become crowd control. Shadowknights can use darkness to easily gain aggro (and also snare the mobs) and paladins can use stun to do the same. They should stand outside of the casters, so that any adds that get near will aggro them first. If a mob gets near the casters or melee a knight needs to draw aggro and begin kiting them in the pit. Kite in clockwise order and DO NOT kite near the raid. You should cut across the middle of the pit, rather than bringing mobs in to aggro range of the raid. While you are kiting in this motion you will keep aggroing more mobs and your train will increase in size. It is important that you do not stop and that you strafe run if you get in to trouble. Strafe running and cutting across corners rather than doing a square route should allow you to stay ahead of the mobs.<BR><BR>Another important thing is that knights don't get in to a kiting pattern until they are needed. It isn't useful to have 10 knights running around in circles if only two have aggro. Wait until you are needed and then enter in to the circuit. <BR><BR>Other important notes on the adds. If you become overun with adds then any class that can grab aggro (preferably rangers) should grab aggro from these mobs and start kiting. One or two adds getting to the healing chain can wipe you. The wraiths can be rooted, which can keep them at bay. All of the adds can be highsunned by bards if things get really bad. The important thing to note on highsun is that it does not clear aggro. If a bard starts highsunning then they need to become a kiter after that. <BR><BR>If you have more than 72 people then those outside of the main raid can help kite. They can not heal anyone fighting Rallos Zek or damage Rallos Zek in any way. They can kite, however.<BR><BR>This is a very difficult fight. If one person draws aggro out of the corner, you can lose. If an enchanter goes LD or dies and their pet starts eating clerics, you will lose. If too many mobs spawn inside of the camp and get on casters, you will lose. And losing means having to do the entire event over again. It's frustrating but it gets easier each time.<BR><BR>Once Rallos Zek the Warlord dies everyone needs to zone as quickly as possible. AE Teleport works well here for preserving life. Succor to entrance works equally well. If all else fails you can run to the zone out in the pit or die.<BR><BR>The important thing is everyone needs to be dead or zoned so that the mobs have lost all aggro. The Planar Projection only remains in the zone for five minutes, yet the adds do not despawn for about 20 minutes. The Planar Projection spawns in the center of the pit. <BR><BR>One player should head down to the pit and aggro up all of the mobs who are near the middle of the pit and train them to the zone out. This will make it easier for players to receive their flags. You will also want to train the adds away from Rallos Zek's body so you can handle loot, but it is most important to get the adds away from the Planar Projection first.<BR><BR>Druids should be outside of the zone casting Spirit of Eagle and Invisibility on everyone in the raid. Rallos Zek's adds do not see invisibility, charmed pets that remain in the pit may, though. You can hail the Planar Projection while invisible and receive the flag. This is not the case with most planar projections, but is for this encounter. <BR><BR>Don't wait to be ressed in after this fight. Get levitation and invisibility and get your flags. Inevitably after each Rallos Zek win there are always players who took their time getting back to the zone, waited on a resurrection or crashed zoning. You can't do much about crashing during a zone but the rest can be easily eliminated by stressing these facts before the raid.<BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>Rallos Zek the Warlord drops two items per kill. None of the other mobs during this event drop any kind of loot other than runes or spectral parchments. Rallos Zek's loot is very good, but he is seldom farmed due to the difficulty of this encounter. Most guilds who have killed Rallos Zek are elemental flagged afterwards, and it is easier to farm elemental mini-bosses than to do this encounter.<BR><BR>That having been said there are two items that Rallos Zek the Warlord drops that are class defining drops. The Red Eye Mask of Rage adds up to 25% damage to nukes, as well as having nice stats. The two other mobs who drop Anger of Solusek items are Coirnav and a member of the Rathe Council. These are the two most difficult elemental encounters. The Blade of War is the definitive main tank weapon in the game. 48/32 50 AC 175 HP and a proc which generates 700 points on the hate list. The difference between a warrior with and without a BoW is noticeable.<br><br>
