    <font size="2">We realize that becoming a member of the subscription network
    <a href="http://www.flashlink.com/index.php?s=58">Flashlink</a> is going to 
    isolate us from certain readers. Since the banner advertising market 
    collapsed for gaming web sites in December of 2000 gaming sites(including 
    our own) has struggled mightily just to pay for their own server bills. 
    Despite this many readers mistake gaming web sites pleas for donations as a 
    sign of greed. This is not the case, and we will do our best to help you 
    understand that in this document.<br>
    <br>
    As many of you know the banner advertising market collapsed in December of 
    2000. Since that point database intensive web sites such as EQ Spoilers have 
    had a very difficult time covering their server and bandwidth costs. From 
    July of 2001 to January of 2002 our gaming web sites cost us an average of 
    $150 every month out of our own pockets just to cover server and bandwidth 
    fees. From January of 2002 until May of 2002 our web sites have lost an 
    average of nearly $300 a month in server and bandwidth charges. When you 
    consider the many man hours that go in to running these web sites on top of 
    the money lost. There is simply no way to expect web sites such as ours to 
    remain free. It is an impossibility. <br>
    <br>
    So we were left with the option of putting multiple pop ups on every page 
    and hoping that we could manage to cover our own server bills or going 
    subscription or partial subscription. We choose to go subscription and 
    choose Flashlink for various reasons which we will document below.<br>
    <br>
    I think it is honorable that sites such as
    <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">Allakhazam</a> have attempted to 
    go partial subscription. We thought long and hard about this route, and we 
    may still offer some more free options in the future, but for the time being 
    the only thing free is news. Why did we make this choice?<br>
    <br>
    The answer is simple. When a site is partial subscription the vast majority 
    of people will not pay. Yet they will visit every day and eat up a sites 
    bandwidth and add to the server load. This is the reason that Allakhazam's 
    runs so slowly despite shelling out huge amounts of money every month to run 
    multiple servers. Our current cost for bandwidth is $4 per gigabyte of 
    bandwidth. This bandwidth goes fast. The end result is that those who pay 
    for the service have to deal with slow server access because they are not 
    only paying for themselves, but for everyone who accesses the server. <br>
    <br>
    So once we realized that subscription was the only viable solution for us we 
    were left with the option of charging a small subscription fee which would 
    be good only for our internal sites(currently including
    <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com">EQ Spoilers</a> and
    <a href="http://www.shadowbanelegends.com">Shadowbane Legends</a> with a 
    DAoC Spoilers coming soon) or to join an existing network. Rather than 
    charge you a small fee to only access our web sites we decided to join 
    Flashlink for various reasons.<br>
    <br>
    First and foremost we feel that it is what is best for the gaming community. 
    Web sites were struggling to meet server fees before, but with UGO's recent 
    changes these sites are going to find themselves in an even worse position 
    now. As a result more and more web sites will be going subscription in the 
    coming months. News sites and other less strenuous web sites will be able to 
    hold out longer than database heavy sites such as ours, but everyone is 
    struggling. The gaming community is going to have to accept this or they 
    will be presented with an empty web site community in the near future.<br>
    <br>
    In the struggle to survive the majority of the sites that have gone 
    subscription have gone on their own. Taking the Everquest community as an 
    example EQMaps, EQ'Lizer, Allakhazam, Ilia's Bestiary, EQ Atlas and Everlore 
    all have subscription options.&nbsp; Currently EQ'Lizer, EQ Maps and EQ 
    Prices are members of Flashlink. EQ Atlas, Ilia's and Allakhazam are members 
    of a second alliance of web sites. Everlore stands alone. <br>
    <br>
    Allakhazam's fine network includes their Everquest and&nbsp; Dark Age of 
    Camelot sites for $10 every 3 months or $30 a year. Flashlink allows for as 
    little as a one month subscription for a mere $3.45, four months for $9.95 
    or a year for $24.95. Flashlink also represents a growing network of web 
    sites. Each of these represent fair options for your gaming dollar. <br>
    <br>
    In the end we choose Flashlink because it allows thousands of current 
    subscribers to instantly access our site free of charge. We also choose 
    Flashlink because they are currently the one network who is actively looking 
    to expand their web site and that will take a large variety of web sites. In 
    the coming age of subscription gaming this is beneficial to the community. 
    The more unified this community can become when it comes to subscription the 
    better it is for the end user. <br>
    <br>
    That having been said we understand that subscription isn't for everybody. 
    If you can not afford $3.45 a month for a one month subscription of $2.08 a 
    month for a year subscription, or if you simply do not want to pay to access 
    a web site then we understand and we would refer you to one of the free web 
    sites out there. At some point we may add some more free options to the web 
    site, but in the current market we have to take steps to ensure that our new 
    network launches before it sinks. <br>
    <br>
    </font> Now that we have gone over the reasons why subscriptions are a must, let's 
    go in to the features you will receive as part of our subscription service.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Alternate Advancement:</b> 
    Complete database of AAXP abilities sorted by class and level. This includes 
    110 unique skills.<br>
    <b>Atlas:</b> Zone guides and maps. Sort by connecting zones, zone 
    type(dungeon, town, plane, etc), continent or level range.<br>
    <b>Bestiary:</b> 8300 Unique beings in the bestiary. Other sites may beef 
    their bestiary numbers by counting mobs multiple times when they occur in 
    different zones. We do not. We have many mobs that you will not find 
    anywhere else on the internet. In depth information(see
    <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqbestiaryfull&eqbestiary.mob_name=%22Hoshkar%22">
    here</a>) including links to the actual spell files of effects used by the 
    mobs. Sort mobs by sociality(assisting or non-assiting), mob type(Quest NPCs, 
    Rares, Bosses, etc), level, faction or zone.<br>
    <b>Equipment:</b> 5888 unique mob drops, quest rewards and trade skill 
    created items. Other sites may attempt to beef their numbers with tons of 
    useless variants of store bought items. When it comes to mob and quest drops 
    however our site has more unique items than both EQ'Lizer or Allakhazam. But 
    that's not all. Our equipment listings display detailed information on the 
    dropping mob, spell effect, quest and zone all on one page. You'll never 
    again have to wonder what the effect on a weapon does. Filter results by 
    effect, deity, weight, item type, damage, delay, DPS, range, armor class, 
    modiers, slot, class, race, zone, flags(magic, lore, no drop, etc). Sort 
    results(order of display) by weight, DPS, speed, damage, armor class or 
    alphabetically. View these results on an enhanced listing or quick stat 
    display without flipping through pages. Our database is also intelligent 
    enough to automatically detect multi-slot items and display them for various 
    slots and intelligent ALL/ALL detection.<br>
    <b>Faction:</b> We have the fastest, most advanced and most detailed faction 
    database on the planet. Get easy to read information on faction altering 
    quests and mobs for 259 different factions in the game at the click of a 
    mouse.<br>
    <b>Quests:</b> We have the most complete quest database in existance, hands 
    down. This includes 917 unique quests. Other sites pad their quest numbers 
    by splitting quests in to a different quest for each armor piece. Not only 
    does this make the quest pages hard to navigate through but it makes you go 
    to 7 differnet pages to glance over quest rewards. If you merge those quests 
    in to a single quest you will find that we have by far the largest quest 
    database on the internet. Our staff is continually scanning the game and the 
    internet searching for quests that are not yet spoiled on other sites. The 
    result is many previously unspoiled quests being presented here on a day to 
    day basis. On a feature by feature basis we allow you to filter your quests 
    by zone, level, related zones, factions, quest items, or class. You can 
    sort(order of display) these results by level, rating, or alphabetically. 
    This allows you to display only the quests that pertain to you.<br>
    <b>Spells:</b> 2287 unique spells. This includes not only spell analysis for 
    every class in the game but also for every spell effect in the game.<br>
    <b>Trade Skills:</b> This porton of our site is rapidly expanding. Our goal 
    for launch was to have the most complete mob and quest item database on the 
    internet. That having been achieved we are now aiming to have the most 
    complete trade skill item database as well. Our trade skill items give 
    recipes embedded in to the description for ease of use. You can filter your 
    searches by deity, weight, armor class, DPS, class, race, slot, modifiers, 
    trade skill and cultural type. For example if you are searching for Dark Elf 
    Cultural Blacksmithing Items that Innoruuk shadowknights can wear then you 
    can find them quickly and easily, complete with recipes.<font size="2"><br>
    <br>
    If you are a new viewer and don't want to pay for our web site without first 
    giving it a test run then have no fear. The first 14 days of your 
    subscription are absolutely free and you may cancel at any time. If you are 
    not happy with our web site then simply cancel during the trial period.<br>
