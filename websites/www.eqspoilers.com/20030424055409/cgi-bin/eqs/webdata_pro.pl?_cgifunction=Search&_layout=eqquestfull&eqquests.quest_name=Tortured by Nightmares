<font color=#d2d200>Entrance to Crypt of Terris Thule</font><br>

<br>
<font color=#d2d200><b>Description:</b></font><br>
This is an interesting quest given by Adroha Jezith in the Plane of Tranquility. She can be found doctoring a sick Elder in a building in town. Ask her, "what coma" to initialize the quest. It appears that this places a character flag on to you once you finish the dialogue. There is a nice thread on this quest at <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5772.topic">The Safehouse</a>.<BR><BR>Adroha gives a soft sigh of woe, 'You won't be getting any response from Thelin. Ever since his injury he has been in a deep [coma] with no sign of ever recovering.'<BR><BR>Thelin tosses and turns violently on the floor, then is still.<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Adroha Jezith'<BR><BR>You say, 'what coma?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'My pity onto Thelin. His life on Norrath was a miserable one. As a young man he began to study the workings of fear inspired by Cazic-Thule. The workings had been translated for mortals by Zebuxoruk. Pouring over the texts, Thelin felt his mind being invaded by Cazic. This information was not for mortal usage and the malevolent god stripped him of all his earthly belongings and cursed him to live in [poverty and ruin].'<BR><BR>You say, 'what about poverty and ruin?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'Aye, he lived in the streets of Eastern Freeport, begging from those passing through the port. He sat quivering, propped up against a wall with one hand out as he watched the travelers pass by. None of them even gave him a second glance. Several years would pass before a female dwarf would arrive to trade some of her family's armor and weapons. She saw and took pity on Thelin. She knelt down, scratched her beard then began to rummage through her backpack. She then placed a [jeweled dagger] in his hand, smiled and returned to her former business.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what jeweled dagger?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'This was the only gift that Thelin had received since the curse. It was beautifully crafted and would likely have fetched a handsome price upon the market. He decided to keep the dagger as it was such a kind gesture. Later that eve, Thelin heard the calling of others that studied Zebuxoruk's workings. He recognized the language they called out in. He approached the men and explained he had studied the writings of Zebuxoruk. One of the shaded figures then began to mutter an incantation. Suddenly, there was a bright flash, lush vegetation and a peaceful breeze surrounded them. They had ascended here, to the [Plane of Tranquility] where they could further study the works without interference from the gods and mortals alike.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what about the Plane of Tranquility?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'Thelin enjoyed it here. He assisted the other followers by using all his mana to open a portal to the Plane of Nightmares, the demi-plane ruled by the child of The Faceless, Terris-Thule. Spent from using all his energies, he went to bed early after his victory had been achieved in this task. As he laid in bed, he looked over the dagger that had been given to him by the female dwarf. He smiled at the new peace he had found here and began to fall asleep. Drifting away into the realm of dreams, his subconscious was assulted by the horrors of a nightmare. He tossed and turned from the visions that came before him. So bad did he writhe in his subconscious torment that he turned on the dagger. He was critically injured, and let out a wrenching scream. We found him and were able to heal his wound enough to keep him alive. However, he still lies in a deep coma seemingly [tortured by nightmares].'<BR><BR>You say, 'how is he tortured by nightmares?'<BR><BR>You have received a character flag!<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith tells you, 'It is our belief that Terris-Thule is punishing him for allowing entrance into her plane. She seems to have an exceedingly strong tie to him. Since her father has already punished him, she likely found that he was easily tormented by her own powers. Sometimes he talks while tossing and turning. We have taken note of everything he has said. He has said 'I accept your offer Terris-Thule', 'I must find the pieces', and 'It never ends'. You must help him. Go through the portal that he has helped to create. Try to find his planar projection in Terris' plane. Help him wake from this torment. Please, I beg you. I cannot stand to watch him suffer any longer.'<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>Thelin Poxbourne is located near the castle in the Plane of Nightmare in a small hedge.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Thelin Poxbourne'<BR><BR>Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'Who is it? Are you.. really there? You are! Please I beg of you to help me escape from this horrid place. Terris Thule is holding me here, she delights in the nightmares she sends me. To further torture me, she has offered me a pact. She has said that if I can retrieve my [dagger], then I am free to go. She does this only because she knows that I cannot retrieve it on my own.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what dagger'<BR><BR>Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'She has taken the only thing that has brought me any joy in my life. She took it and broke it into seven pieces. She placed them deep within the labyrinth of my nightmare. I must retrieve it, will you [help] me. Please I beg of your mercy.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what kind of help'<BR><BR>Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'I do not know who you are, but I am thankful that you have stumbled upon me. I can bring you into my dreamstate, but my powers are limited so I can only handle eighteen at once. Please when you are prepared have the leader of each of your band of adventurers tell me they are ready.'<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>At this point you are going to want to gather together three full groups. The key phrase to say to initiate the quest is "I am ready". The group leader of eac group will need to say this and you will need to say it quickly after the last person has said it or you will not be teleported together. When the quest is initiated you will be teleported to a Hedge Maze. <BR><BR>The encounters start as single encounters with Nightstalkers(level 60 werewolves). They are followed by double encounters with Sinister Nighstalkers(level 57-58ish werewolves). <BR><BR>Keep moving along and you will reach a secret area that Thelin will open. Inside are two Sinister Nightstalkers and a big raven. From there the encounters keep stepping up in numbers and strength. There will be some 6 and 7 mob battles. Be sure to loot the corpses because they will drop Dagger Pieces which you will need.<BR><BR>Eventually you will reach a Construct of Nightmares. This is the "boss" of this quest. He hits for up to 800 damage but can be slowed. <BR><BR>After killing him hand in all of the pieces that dropped to Thelin. The reward for this quest is Thelin's Dagger.<BR><BR>The Construct of Nightmares also has a random loot table and will drop an item when killed.<BR><BR>After handing in the pieces Terris Thule will spawn but be untargetable. It is not yet known how to kill him but it is assumed that the dagger is bane vs. Terris Thule. <BR><BR>Hail Thelin to be teleported out and have a character flag placed on to you. This character flag allows you to enter the Crypt of Terris Thule</font><br><br>

The group leader of each group MUST be flagged in PoK in order to activate this part of the quest.  The trigger phrase "I am ready" must be spoken by each group leader one right after the other.  If there is any delay in saying the trigger phrase, Thelin will port part of your raid force to a different maze.
