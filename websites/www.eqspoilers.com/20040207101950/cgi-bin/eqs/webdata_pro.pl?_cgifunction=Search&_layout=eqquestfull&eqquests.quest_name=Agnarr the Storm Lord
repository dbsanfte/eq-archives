<font color=#d2d200><b>Description:</b></font><br>
- Agnarr is the boss of the Bastion of Thunder.<BR>- Requires a key to enter this area. This key is obtained by combining four spheres(random drop from Krigers) in to the container dropped by Tower Bosses.<BR>- Hits for up to 1400 per attack.<BR>- Point Blank AE which stuns your target, gravity fluxes, spins, does 800 points of damage, and causes 1440 damage over 1.8 minutes. This spell is unresistable.<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting</b><BR><BR>Agnarr the Storm Lord is a three day spawn. He can be tracked from the safe room near entrance. The only way to scout him is through tracking.<BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>Elemental equipped guilds can complete the Agnarr the Storm Lord with 30-35 players. Moderately equipped guils will want to bring 50+. You will need at least two solid tanks, 4 clerics, several enchanters and at least one wizard with disintegrate.<BR><BR>In order to reach this event you must have the at least one member of your raid who has completed the <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqquestfull&eqquests.quest_name=%22Symbol%20of%20Torden%22">Symbol of Torden</a> quest. <BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>The Agnarr event unfolds in three different levels. Have everyone meet you upstairs in the center of the courtyard. You can port up here in any of the four wings, near where the 6 hour wing bosses spawn. It is very important that nobody touches the Penix until the raid leader gives the command. It has to be unlocked by a player with the key. If anyone touches it before that time, the four gargoyles will come to life and kill that player. You can not port up ahead of the raid, or else the floor 1 event begins early and you will blow it.<BR><BR>Magicians should begin summoning arrows and dropping them on the ground. The second floor boss is a ranged fight. Melee types should all use bows or throwing weapons. Melees in need of ammunition can pick it up off the ground while you are gathering and buffing. This saves time later.<BR><BR>Buff up here and be sure that everyone knows what their roles are when you port up. All three levels follow a similar format and the players who are assigned these jobs should keep them for each level. <BR><BR>First and foremost you will need a main tank. The main tank will need a complete healing chain on him. You will want at least 4 clerics in this chain, six would be safer. This player will be tanking the bosses. <BR><BR>You will also need a main assist. Everyone should make /assist keys based off this character. Everyone will assist the assist tank in killing adds until they are all dead. <BR><BR>You will need to assign kiters. Rangers work well in this role. Their job is to kite adds until they are mesmerized on each level. If you don't have 3 wizards with disintegrate then you may have to clear a number of adds. If you are wizard heavy then you will have very few adds.<BR><BR>Lastly you will need the disintegrate teams. There are several portals on each level. These portals will spawn mobs at a pretty fast rate. They need to be taken down immediately. Ideally this would consist of enchanter and wizard teams. Three should be sufficient. The enchanters role is to tash a portal and the wizards to disintegrate it. Tash is important here. As soon as the enchanter is done tashing a portal he should help with mesmerizing the adds. The easiest way to assign who is on which portal is to do it before you port up. Assign a team to the left portal, to center and to right and then when you port up they can go right to the target without stepping on one another. If you only have one team then they should determine beforehand which one they will work on and then move to the next. Finally, if you have no wizards you can attack the portals, but be warned this takes a very long time. If you don't have any wizards with disintegrate, you may want to pass on this raid.<BR><BR>Once everyone has been been buffed and briefed on their roles you should have them all stand up and get near the Penix. Not too close, or it will trigger the Gargoyles, just stand close enough that you can click it when ordered. The raid leader should count down from 5 to 0. At 1 the players with keys should click on the Penix and at 0 everyone else in the raid should click it. There is a very small window from the time that the penix is clicked where anyone who clicks it will be ported up. You can't afford to have AFK players here. If they don't click within a few seconds they will be left out and they will not be able to catch up.<BR><BR><b>Level 1</b><BR><BR>The first level is fire themed and features a named boss, a few guards and three portals. The portals will spawn additional mobs throughout the fight, so they must be destroyed quickly. <BR><BR>In the Preparation section we discussed what everyone's roles should be here. To reitirate it portal teams take out portals. Kiters kite until the mobs can be mesesd. Main tank should be tanking the Evynd Firestome (the floor boss). Everyone else should assist the main assist in killing all of the adds. Once they are cleared they can assist the main tank on Evynd Firestorm.<BR><BR>Evynd Firestorm Vitals:<BR>- Hits for up to 928 per attack.<BR>- Fire based damage over time/resistance debuff. It is a curse.<BR><BR>Evynd himself is a pretty simple fight. He is on par with the Tower Bosses in the Bastion of Thunder. He drops no items, but can drop runes or spectral parchments. Once he is dead you should res and buff the fallen. <BR><BR>Everyone should move to the far side of the room to where Askr the Lost is standing. Do not speak to him until the raid is ready to move up to the next level. At that point everyone in the raid will need to hail Askr the Lost and follow his dialogue to port up to the next level. It is important that everyone in the raid is ready to say his text. Once again you should count down from 5 to 0 and on 0 the entire raid should port up to level 2.<BR><BR><b>Level 2</b><BR><BR>The second level is very similar to the first. It is meteor-themed and features Emmerick Skyfury, some adds and three additional portals. Just as the first level you need to quickly disintegrate the portals. Kill the adds and then kill the boss. The one notable difference here is that Emmerick Skyfury has a nasty AE spell. You need for everyone other than the main tank to be standing away from him. The main assist needs to drag adds away from Emmerick if they are too close. <BR><BR>Emmerick Skyfury Vitals:<BR>- Quad hits for up to 1053 per attack.<BR>- Area effect spell which does 1500 damage.<BR>- Area effect silence and mana drain.<BR><BR>Emerick has a nasty area effect spell which does up to 1500 points of AE damage. He also has an area effect silence attack. Luckily both of these attacks have relatively short range. For this reason we recommend fighting him completely from range. Get out the bows and arrows and go to work. Surround him so you keep him stationary and be careful not to push him too close to the edges of the platform. Once he gets close to the edge it will be hard to push him off of that edge with ranged attacks, so don't let him get there.<BR><BR>After Emmerick falls you should res up, buff up and go over the strategies for level 3 (see below). The most important thing to point out to your raid is that Agnarr the Storm Lord must be kited. You should assign two players to kiting duty on him. They will be kiting him for a few minutes so you may wish to use a ranger for this duty as they can take more hits than a druid.<BR><BR>When you are ready to move up to level three you must again speak to Askr the Lost. Ask him "what storm". Only the raid leader needs to do this. A portal will then open behind Askr. Stand underneath the portal and target it. The hit the 'U' (Use) key to be ported up top. As with the two previous levels you should count down from five to zero and have everyone port up at zero.<BR><BR><b>Level 3</b><BR><BR>The third and final level features Agnarr himself, some adds and five portals. The center portal on this level can not be destroyed. The adds spawn quicker here and there are more portals, so your enchanters need to be on the ball. <BR><BR>When you portal up the disintegration teams needs to do their job as usual. The kiters assigned to Agnarr need to quickly gain aggro on him and begin kiting him around. He is snareable. While they kite him you can debuff him.<BR><BR>During the fight Agnarr will spawn the four mini bosses(Jolur Sandstorm, Ekil Thundercall, Oljin Stormtide and Hibdin Cyclone). He will spawn one at 99%, one at 74%, one at 49% and one at 24%. <BR><BR>The first boss may or may not come immediately, while your fighting all of the adds and the portals. If he does not spawn immediately this gives you time to kill the adds as you have been doing on every other level. If he does spawn immediately then you have two choices. You could kite him until the adds and portals are taken care of. Or you could kill him first and then deal with the adds. The mini-bosses on this level have no AE attacks and only hit for 900ish. <BR><BR>Agnarr the Storm Lord Vitals:<BR>- Hits for up to 1400 per attack.<BR>- Point Blank AE which stuns your target, gravity fluxes, spins, does 800 points of damage, and causes 1440 damage over 1.8 minutes. This spell is unresistable.<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Eventually all of the portals, adds and the first mini-boss will be dead. It's just you and Agnarr now. But before you engage you need to get the raid in to position. Have the casters stand in the hallway, at the bottom of the steps. They should stand up against the right hand wall. They will use the all to block Agnarr's AE attack. The main tank should stand with the wall to his right hand side a bit of a ways in the wall. Not too far, as you need to be able to land complete heal, but far enough so that the AE doesn't hit the casters. Rogues can melee Agnarr from behind. The rest of the raid should be hitting Agnarr from the side, pushign him in to the wall and pinning him there. The key here is to not let him move around. If he moves too close to the casters then they are going to taste his AE, and that can be deadly. If you push him too far away from the casters then he will move out of complete healing range. Occasionally you may push Agnarr to a point semi-close to the casters and he will climb up to the top of the wall. If this happens everyone needs to back away from the wall to get him to come back down. You should then pin him back at the proper spot. <BR><BR>At 74% the second tower boss will spawn from the portal in the center of the room. When he spawns the entire raid, aside from the main tank and the healing chain needs to intercept him. The main assist should leave to the portal early so they can grab aggro as soon as he spawns. It is important that you do not bring him too close to Agnarr. Doing so may cause Agnarr or the mini-boss to get low hit point aggro on players and this could prove disastrous. Once he is dead the raid should all get back on Agnarr until the third mini-boss spawns at 49%. They should repeat this process for him.<BR><BR>The final mini-boss, Hibdin Cyclone, spawns at 24% and is unslowable, and thus requires more healing than the previous three. For this reason you should kite him until after Agnarr is dead. Send two kiters to keep him occupied and the rest of the raid should concentrate on Agnarr. After Agnarr is dead you can kill Hibdin.<BR><BR><b>Flagging</b><BR><BR>Once Hibdin is dead you must run upstairs and tell Karana that you 'will walk the path of the fallen' to receive your flag. <BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>The risk vs. reward on Agnarr is fantastic. This is a fairly easy event and the loot is among the best you will find pre-elemental. This includes a 17/20 1hander with 1 cold damage and a 140 point dd proc, a necklace with Fury of Druzzil and 120 hp/mana and vengeance 3 gloves. Agnarr drops two loots at a time.  <br><br>
