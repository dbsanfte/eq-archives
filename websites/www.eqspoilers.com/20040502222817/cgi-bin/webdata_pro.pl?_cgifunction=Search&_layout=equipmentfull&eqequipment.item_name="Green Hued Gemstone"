<b>Description</b>:<br>
<font color=#ffffbb>This is an epic quest that takes place in the Gates of Discord. Be prepared for a long haul. We will document this quest as information becomes available.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Fezbin Fizzles'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Greetings adventurer, have you come to explore this new [continent] we recently discovered?'<BR><BR>You say, 'i have come to explore the new continent'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles  focuses his attention on Erasmusx.<BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Due to some rather odd events with Calliav, we, the Wayfarers Brotherhood, were guided here to the continent we have come to call Taelosia. It is a continent which has suffered through a great magical explosion and now the native inhabitants are in dire straits. Our goal was to investigate this continent and find out more about the strange pieces of matter that we recently found in various places. All signs led us here and so we decided to build this magnificent floating city you are standing in. Unfortunately, we have found out some rather disturbing [news] recently that has all of us rather concerned.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what news'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Well, when we finished the city, we began to send out scouts to various locales all over the new continent. Right away information started to flow in. They gave us details on the layout of the land and its current inhabitants. We began to piece together this picture of the current state of things on land. Many of the reports gave details on various things like wildlife and climate as well as the local inhabitants and level of advancement. All of this seemed promising to us as we thought we might be able to talk to the natives and find out more about the strange matter that seemed to originate from this place, but then we begin to receive some very [upsetting reports].'<BR><BR>You say, 'what upsetting reports'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Apparently, the event that spread these strange pieces of matter all over Norrath brought with it a group of beings more horrifying than a shaved dwarf. These creatures seemed to be an organized army of some sort. They have apparently taken over the continent and enslaved the natives. Curious about this, we ordered our scouts to find out more about these beings.  Specifically, if they could be reasoned with and if they knew anymore about the odd chunks of rock we found recently. Shortly after we made this demand, everything [stopped].'<BR><BR>You say, 'what stopped'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'The scout reports stopped coming in. We figured that maybe they had just not found anything yet, but as time went by we began to worry. That's when Morden suggested that we send someone to find one of them and learn what was going on. Young Falcin did not know what he was getting into when he volunteered to check things out for us. Falcin left here under the light of a full moon and returned soon after barely able to breathe. He had been caught spying on the beings that currently control the continent. They had tortured him for hours trying to get information. Being the resourceful human he is, he managed to escape only to be mauled by what the natives call ukun, a humanoid creature that is twisted and lethal. Left for dead, Falcin dragged himself back to us and explained what he had [discovered] during his ordeal.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what had he discovered'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Falcin told us that all of the scouts had been captured and were either dead or were enduring extreme torture sessions. These invading beings are a vicious lot who show absolutely no mercy. Falcin's wounds were proof enough of that. Falcin explained that the scouts who were still alive are being held near where they had been discovered. Those who he could not find he assumed were dead but he still tried to get some proof before he wrote them off. Unfortunately Falcin would not live to see his desire through, he passed on shortly after revealing this information to us and now we are at a loss as to how we can help our scouts who are still living return to us and provide a proper burial for those who were lost. We cannot afford to send anyone else out there as it seems it will require a significant force in order to have any chance of accomplishing the [task] we need completed.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what task'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'With half of our numbers back home dealing with the investigation of the recently unearthed dungeons and the rest here on the ship handling what information we have and trying to decide the best plan of action, Morden figured it might be a good idea to ask some courageous individuals to assist us. Morden has authorized some form of valuable reward for those who can bring us any information regarding our missing scouts or the scouts themselves. Seeing as how you have been so interested in all I have said so far, do you think you would be interested in helping the Wayfarers Brotherhood?'<BR><BR>You say, 'i am interested in helping the wayfarers brotherhood'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>You have received the 'Breakdown in Communication' quest.  Now you must find those mentioned by Fezbin and help them the best you can. If at any point you find you have made a mistake in your scouting, please return to Fezbin and say, "I need to rescout (zone name)" and he will reset your status in that zone. If you lose your reward at any point, return to Fezbin and hail him and he should give you the appropriate reward based on your level of progress.</font><BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'Most excellent. Please take these as a token of our gratitude. It is not much to look at now, but by helping us you will find ways to make this stone more [powerful] when combining it with certain items in that sealer. Please take the time to find Taminoa Bialu, Vaifan Cogswin, and L`diava Rexxen. They are all located on this ship. Each of them is responsible for information from certain areas of the continent. Taminoa has all the information on the city area, Vaifan keeps the information on the mountain passes, and L`diava collects information on the temple areas. If you truly wish to help us, talk to some or all of them and they will help guide you to the right path. When you have finished helping them all, return to me and I shall give you the reward that has been approved by Morden.'<BR><BR>You say, 'how is it powerful'<BR><BR>Fezbin Fizzles says 'The stone I have given you is very special indeed. It is a rare stone with a power that has not yet been revealed. After studying it we have come to the conclusion that its power is based off of resonance. You will see that there are fourteen sockets in the stone. Each socket requires a gem fragment of a certain resonance. As the fragments are set in the stone it will gradually increase in power. These fragments must be placed in the stone in a certain order using a set of clockwork gemcutter's tools, the stone, and the correct shard in the device I handed to you along with the stone. As you help find our scouts, you may come across the gem fragments that will fit into the stone.  If you do, please try combining them in the special sealer. If at any time you lose the sealer or misplace the stone return to me and I will what I can do about a replacement.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>The three aforementioned NPCs will only speak to you after you have received this quest. Each will give you a subquest which involves collecting items in a specific instanced zone. We will continue to document each of these sub-quests as information becomes available.</font><BR><BR><b>Vaifan's Path</b><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Vaifan Cogswin'<BR><BR>Vaifan Cogswin says 'Well, hello traveler. You here to help with the scout problem we've been having?'<BR><BR>You say, 'yes i am here to help'<BR><BR>Vaifan Cogswin says 'Good to hear. I have been going out of my skull trying to tinker another one to find the first. Now that you are here, I can stop that and focus on compiling the information I already have. Let me tell you, being in charge of something like this is very taxing on the nerves. I remember being a young gnome and whenever I tinkered something it worked the first time. Ah, how good it felt to put the Cogswin family emblem on my wonderful creations. Nowadays it seems like everything I make has some intermittent flaw or defect. I might have to accept that I am getting old and a little slow, but I still have the wits to invent. I should stop rambling and get to the point. I am in charge of scouting the mountain areas known as [Tipt], [Vxed], and the [sewers] under the city. Which would you like to know about?'<BR><BR>You say, 'tipt'<BR><BR>Vaifan Cogswin says 'The mountainous areas of this continent hold many dangers within them. Tipt in particular is thick with members of the invading army, dangerous creatures, and the angry spirits of nihil refugees. Looking at the information I have, the clockwork scout tried to take a direct path to the other side of Tipt and had some serious problems.  Apparently, it had a run in with some cragbeasts, a pack of ghosts, numerous Muramites, and a native riddlemaster. While he made it pretty far, he took significant damage each step of the way. My last report received for this area stated that it was returning to the Vxed area to recover, but had lost multiple power cells in the process. I need you to retrieve these power cells. They are vital to rebuilding the scout and getting that report. There are five different types of cells, each one is called Vaifan's Power Cell -- named after the most ingenious gnome there is, of course. The cells are named from A to E. When you have collected all of them, place them in this power pack, activate it, and return it to me.'<BR><BR>You say, 'vxed'<BR><BR>Vaifan Cogswin says 'We have discovered that this continent holds many dangerous creatures, including the strange beings of the invading army. Many of these beasts can be found in the mountain area called Vxed. After being severely damaged in Tipt, the clockwork scout made its way back to Vxed to perform self maintenance, but I believe this is where it met its final demise. While the chance is slim, I believe you may be able to salvage enough of the parts from the creatures within Vxed to reassemble the frame. What you will need to find is a flickering finkenheimer, a tarnished sprocket, some uncoiled springs, a greased bolt, and some connection rods. When you have them all place, the sprocket, springs, bolt, and rods in the finkenheimer and bring me the result. I must warn you to be careful though. If these things could stop my clockwork, they must be pretty powerful creatures.'<BR><BR>You say, 'the sewers'<BR><BR>Vaifan Cogswin says 'According to my records here, the sewers are a pretty vile area.  Filled with some strange creatures, I hear.  So, being the genius that I am, I came up with a plan to use a prototype clockwork scout I built when we were having problems exploring the catacombs in Mistmoore. He appeared to be working fine.  I received constant detailed reports on the sewers and mountain areas until one day it stopped. For some time I tried to make contact with the clockwork, but nothing. I started working on a second one to retrieve the first when Falcin stumbled onto the boat. In his struggle to get back to us he had to make his escape through the sewers.  While going through there, he found this. This is the reporting module used by the clockwork scout. It does not look like much now, but you should have seen it when Falcin gave it to me.  I have repaired most of the damage in an attempt to access the information stored within, but there are four vital components missing. I need you to go to the four sewer areas and find a timing gear, a rusty spring, an oiled belt, and a processing gizmo.  When you have them all, place them inside the gearbox and combine them.  Once this has been done, the gearbox should give you a report. Return the report to me.'<BR><BR><b>L`diava's Path</b><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, L`diava Rexxen'<BR><BR>L`diava Rexxen says 'Yes, yes.  What is it I can do for you? I am a very busy woman and do not have a moment to waste on just anyone. Are you one of the adventurers sent here by Fezbin?'<BR><BR>You say, 'i am one of the adventurers sent here by fezbin'<BR><BR>You say, 'yes i am'<BR><BR>L`diava Rexxen says 'Very good. You are just in time. I am in need of immediate assistance in the temple areas known as [Yxtta] and the [frightful temple], Kod'Taz. While our scouts have been missing for quite some time, I recently received some information that leads me to believe they may still be alive. Which one we help first is up to you. Which area do you wish to investigate?'<BR><BR>You say, 'what is yxtta'<BR><BR>L`diava Rexxen says 'Yxtta is one of three smaller temple areas where a group of natives known as the trusik used to worship a god called Trushar. We do not know who this god is, but we believe he is a false god centered around a belief in natural destruction. Xounii Resnen was the scout assigned to this area. She was given this task because of her expertise in shapeshifting. I told her to take the shape of a trusik native and interact with them to find out more information. She managed to fit in quite well. Perhaps too well.  Gradually, reports came less frequently until they eventually stopped. While everyone feared she had suffered the same fate as the other scouts, I think she started to believe she was really a trusik and has abandoned her assignment.  What I need you to do is go there and find her.  Now, be careful, the trusik are not a friendly race of beings and they are even more irritated by the invasion of the Muramite army. When you find Xounii I fear she may attack you. If this happens, I will not fault you for defending yourself, but if it comes to this I want some form of proof as to what happened.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what is the frightful temple'<BR><BR>L`diava Rexxen says 'Kod'Taz is made up of multiple temples that were once used for worship by the trusik natives. Many of them have since been destroyed or made into strongholds for the Muramite army. Due to the sheer size of this area, we sent a scouting force there to investigate. All of them are still alive, save one, named Kitren Lanom. None of the scouts left in the area know what happened to her or her belongings. Last time they remember seeing her was when she entered the Temple of Tri-Fates in an attempt to pass the temple trial. Please go to Kod'Taz and speak to Kevren Nalavat. He should be able to help you access the three trials. You will have to enter each trial and bring me back anything you find of Kitren's from each temple. Even though the scouts there have searched many times for something, I think a fresh set of eyes may help some. Kevren is the only one who knows you are helping me. Please do not let the others know you were sent by me. I have not yet ruled out the possibility of foul play and if they are aware of your affiliation, it may place you in more danger.'<BR><BR><b>Taminoa's Path</b><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Taminoa Bialu'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'Greetings. You must be one of the adventurers that Fezbin told me about. It is a pleasure to meet such a brave individual. Where are my manners? My name is Taminoa Bialu and I compile all the information from our scouts in the [city] area of Taelosia.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What City'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'Well, it appears the native inhabitants of Taelosia lived in a grand city once. This city is made up of four different areas named in their language. They are [Qinimi], [Riwwi], [Barindu], and [Ferubi]. Based off of early information, we believe each area had a specific purpose. I am still trying to decipher the native language to figure out what the names mean, but going off of visual information I can assume that Qinimi served as their court, Riwwi is where they held games, Barindu was a lush garden, and Ferubi was a central place of worship once. That is about the extent of my information as far as the intended purpose of each area. What they are now used for I can explain in further detail. Which area would you like to hear more about?'<BR><BR>You say, 'Ferubi'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'The area called Ferubi was once a Taelosian temple. Now it is a place that reeks of pain and suffering. The invading army has desecrated the temple and the slaves within endure unimaginable torture. Based on the information our scout Smith Rondo sent to me before his disappearance, the invaders use this area to craft weaponry and conduct strange experiments. Smith's ability to sneak in and out of places quickly made him the ideal choice for this job, but like most of our other scouts he eventually got caught trying to reveal a vital piece of information. We have confirmed that he is still alive and I need you to go find him and give him this. It is a special farstone attuned to his aura so only he can use it. Please make haste in your mission, but be careful. You are entering the lion's den and if you are caught, I cringe to think what will happen.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Travel to Ferubi and find Smith Rondo</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Smith Rondo'<BR><BR>Smith Rondo says 'Greetings Satashi you have fought long and hard to make it into this secret chamber. What is it you [seek]?'<BR><BR>You say, 'Seek'<BR><BR>Smith Rondo says 'Come, come now. Don't tell me that you fought your way here for no reason? This is the domain of Vtiink Vzaan the Muramite weaponmaster and he does not take kindly to strangers entering his domain. I cannot leave for I am trapped here, but you are not, so unless you [wish to meet] with Vtiink then I would suggest you leave now.'<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to meet'<BR><BR>Smith Rondo says 'Then you wish death, no matter I cannot force your hand I can only grant your request but the only time he spends in this place is when his soldiers need their weapons repaired or replaced. He is very proud of his work and if a weapon is slightly tarnished he considers it destroyed. Now if you could bring me a broken sword blade, a jagged spear tip, a chipped hammer head and some tarnished knuckles from his elite guards, I will arrange a meeting. What happens after that is up to you, while I do not see a happy ending for you the will of fate is quite fickle.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Return to Taminoa the note from Smith Rondo</font><BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'Ah. Glad to see you return and report that you found Smith. Let me see, what does it say here . . . oh my, I can't believe this. These beings are truly insane. This is a detailed account of the experiments the Muramites have been conducting on the natives and on Smith. If what is listed here is true, we must find out more about this. It says that this is one of two reports he wrote, so we must assume he still has the other one on him. It also says here that the weapon master has access to the mountain area that leads to a secret way into the temples where they conduct these experiments. Oh, poor Smith. As soon as he figured out what was going on he documented it, hoping that he could somehow get it back to us without them finding out. Hm . . . here at the bottom he gives details about the weapon master. Seems he only enters the Ferubi area to fix the weapons that his four elite guards use. Knowing this, I am sure we can trick him into appearing. You must return to Ferubi and find his elite guards and collect a different weapon from each of them, but remember the weapon has to be damaged. Sounds like this is pretty durable stuff they use, so it may take some time to accomplish this. Either way, once it is done I would suggest giving the pieces to Smith and asking him to help.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Travel Back to Ferubi<BR><BR>Find kill and collect 4 damaged parts from the elites....<BR><BR>Upon returning the 4 parts to Smith Rondo he will give you something to get the weaponsmaster to spawn... Killing the weaponsmaster yields 54 character flags.<BR><BR>After killing the weapon master you must kill Smith Rondo.</font><BR><BR>Smith stands and shakes off the effects of the spell that knocked him unconscious. Seeing Vtiink's corpse he smiles and begins to reach into his pocket when suddenly his face becomes filled with anger letting out a maniacal laugh. 'You have destroyed him, my master Vtiink he who helped show me the way of the Mata Muram, the true joy of pain. Now I shall share that gift with you prepare to suffer the wrath of Smith Rondo.' Smith Rondo Attacks and Smith's Spectral Memory spawns<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Smith`s Spectral Memory'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>You will receive Rondo's Report at this point.</font><BR><BR>You feel a chill surround your body as a voice enters your mind. 'Thank you for releasing me from an eternity of suffering. Now you must help the others on this continent whose fate I fear is much worse than mine. You must seek out Apprentice Udranda in Barindu. She can help you gain access to the temples beyond the mountain passes.'<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Apprentice Udranda'<BR><BR>Undranda looks around sheepishly. 'Greetings. A messenger told me you would come. I believe we owe you our thanks -- though I'm not sure allowing you to face the terror in the mountains is a reward. I will have my stone worker allow you to pass through, but you must [take heed] first and be as quiet as you can.'<BR><BR>You say, 'take heed'<BR><BR>Undranda tells you, 'Good. There are many secrets I can't tell you right now for fear the Muramites might hear them, but you must do as I say and trust in me. In the mountain pass, Vxed, you must seek out Stonespiritist Ekikoa. He is my mentor and will help you in your quest to find passage to the peaks. We have created a very unique magic that we will share with you, but you must speak with him. It will all be clear to you when you find him. Tell me when you are [ready to pass] through. I cannot leave a way open for too long.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>If you say take heed again you will begin a expedition into vxed.<BR><BR>Turn in the Rondo's Report into Taminoa Bialu</font><BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'While I know it is a part of exploring new lands, it still saddens me whenever we lose a member. Smith was a good man and he will be sorely missed, but once again the perseverance of our scouts has given us some important information. I thank you for seeing this task through and want you to take this. It is a gem we believe will fit in the stone Fezbin gave to you. Try placing it in the stone, but remember if it does not work it could possibly be because you are not placing it in the right order. Now, if you are up to it, I am in need of some more assistance. There remains more of the city to investigate. When you are ready, just ask me about the area you are interested in.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>You have successfully completed a section of the Taelosian City.<BR><BR>Receive A Green Colored Gem Shard</font><BR><BR>You say, 'barindu'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'This area holds the remains of what was once a place to build stone workers. We can only guess what purpose this part of the city served and all we know now is that it is home to some of the cruelest acts of violence against the nihil. I assigned this area to Talwin, a young wood elf new to the brotherhood. He was a proven scout eager to assist. Initially things were going well, but the information he was sending was not helping much. I think this worried him and resulted in him pushing his luck a little far. Ever since I told him his reports were lacking the vital evidence we needed I have not heard from him. Before Falcin passed on, I asked him if he had found anything out about Talwin and he shook his head. I know Talwin is still alive . . . he has to be . . . and I know that there must be some clues in the area of Barindu somewhere. He was diligent about recording what he found so I would assume that if he has been captured that his writings must be lying around the area somewhere. See if you can find two of his journal entries and bring them back to me. When you return please give what you find to my assistant Opury Foop. She is trying to help me organize my reports a little better.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Travel to Barindu and collect Talwin's Journal Part 1 and Talwin's Journal Part 2. Return these Items to Taminoa Bialu</font><BR><BR>You say, 'what about qinimi'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'It appears the Muramites have made this some sort of stronghold. Destroying many of the native symbols, the invaders have converted the building that once served as the court into fortified headquarters. It is here you will find a structure called the Chamber of Souls, various pens to hold ukun, and a moat of sickly black sludge. The structures that the nihil once called home are all but destroyed now.  Very sad indeed. That's where the legion keeps the bulk of the [slaves]. I believe that the scout for this area was caught sneaking around the housing district, but I have no proof. If you were to search this area, maybe you would find some sort of sign or marker he may have left. That would be helpful.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what slaves'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'I see Fezbin saved some of the more dismal news for me. The legion has enslaved the natives of the continent. In the city area, these slaves are used mainly for menial tasks. Due to their fragile bodies, they cannot do any heavy lifting, but their knowledge of shaping stone makes them perfect for building new structures for the legion to use as well as altering current ones. They command the stone workers. I am not sure how the slaves are used in the temple areas.  That information is held by L`diava.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Upon entering Qinimi if you turn right you will find a book resting on top of some rubble. Grab it and give it to Taminoa.</font><BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'Yes. This is exactly what I needed. Excellent job. Okay, now give me one moment to decipher this . . . hm.  It seems that just before he was captured he was trying to communicate with the slaves in the area. The text is very hard to make out, but it looks like he may have been trying to get into the main headquarters. He was interacting with a particular slave named Sislono Nislan. This slave promised him a way into the headquarters only if he promised to rid the area of a tyrant, named Trixxrt. The rest of the parchment is undecipherable. I would suggest finding this slave and showing him this to see if he knows what happened.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what about riwwi'<BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'Riwwi has to be the most interesting of all of the city areas. You see, this is where the coliseum is located. Now, we are not completely aware of how it was used before this invading army took up residence in the area, but now it is used for the merciless slaughter of the nihil. Early reports from our scout, Reyna, indicate that the slaves in the area would not interact with her until she proved herself. How she was able to do this I am not sure, but I would suggest trying to find something of Reyna's while I go over my Riwwi information. Come back to me when you find something.'<BR><BR><font color=#fffbb>Reyna's Bloody Earring is a random drop in Riwwi. Give this earring to Taminoa Bialu to progress the quest.</font><BR><BR>Taminoa Bialu says 'This does not bode well for Reyna's fate. If I had to guess, I would say they took her to the coliseum. Knowing what we know about these strange beings, they would have taken her to the coliseum just so they could entertain themselves by torturing her. You must find a way into the coliseum and save Reyna. I think your best plan of action would be to locate and speak to Turlini and Namosa. They are two slaves Reyna mentioned in her reports. They may not talk to you if you have not proven yourself, but once you do that they should be pretty helpful. They may even know an easy way into the coliseum. Find these two and ask them about Reyna. Return to me when you find out more information about her.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Both of the slaves can be found in the large open area in Riwwi. Unfortunately it will require you to raise your Yunju Resistance faction. This can be done by either giving food or drink to the starving or thirsty slaves, or by killing mobs near the arena. Once your faction is raised you can speak to Namosa. All of her sub-quest is non-combative.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Namosa Bubundu'<BR><BR>Namosa Bubundu coughs pitifully and looks through you with weak eyes, 'This gazebo was once a place of contemplation, meditation, and reflection, but now it is a place of torture. These slavers shackle us here within feet of the pool of water and refuse us food or drink for days at a time, accompanied by horrible beatings. And now, I have had enough. I am through with this world and can only hope for peace in my passing. Before I pass on I wonder if you could do a [favor] for me?'<BR><BR>You say, 'what favor?'<BR><BR>Namosa Bubundu slips you a scuffed signet ring, 'Yes, yes. Here is a family heirloom that I have been keeping secret from our captors. If you deliver this ring to my kin, I can die in peace knowing it never fell into their hands. There are rumors that some of my family members have escaped the clutches of these monsters and made their way into a city that floats on water. I hope you understand, friend. Go quickly.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Pandula is found in the Abysmal Sea.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Pandula Bubundu'<BR><BR>Pandula Bubundu says 'What can I do for you? I'm waiting to hear word from the Wayfarer scouts. My niece has been captured by the Muramites and I only wish to discover if she is still alive. I can't take this, not knowing. I would much rather endure a thousand of those beast's whips than be kept in the dark. Please find her for me.'<BR><BR>Pandula Bubundu sobs uncontrollably, tears welling up in her eyes, 'So my little one is still out there. This is wonderful news. I can now die in peace. The Wayfarers have transcribed my final wishes onto this parchment. Please deliver this to Namosa.'<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Namosa Bubundu'<BR><BR>Namosa Bubundu gasps, 'What?! Oh no, this isn't good at all. She isn't supposed to die. I am! Quick, go and see Councilman Tentric in Qinimi and let him know what's happening. He has always helped our family when we were in need. If you bring this token he will know I sent you!'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb>Councilman Tentric is found in a building in Qinimi.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Councilman Tentric'<BR><BR>Councilman Tentric says 'You haven't come to demand something of me, have you? I've been subjected to enough atrocities already. Please leave this old man in peace.'<BR><BR>Councilman Tentric nods solemnly, 'Hmm . . . I see. So Pandula is contemplating leaving this world. There is no doubt that these are hard times. Our people are strong however, and nothing will truly break our spirit. Please let Pandula know that the gods have not forgotten us. Bring her this holy symbol.'<BR><BR>Pandula Bubundu looks quizzically at the symbol and rubs it in her hands. She smiles as if realizing something, 'Ah, Tentric, you are always right. I can't give up on this world or my family. I'm not sure why I was behaving so selfishly. Take this flower to my niece, she will know what it means.'<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Namosa Bubundu'<BR><BR>Namosa Bubundu says 'A drakelily? My aunt grew these in her garden. In fact, I helped her plant some of them myself. She always told me they were a sign of hope. Thank you, Silvas. I'll inform our people of your kindness.'<BR><BR>Namosa touches your shoulder and gazes at you with pleading eyes. 'I hope this isn't presumptuous of me. You've already done so much. Before you go, I need to ask you for another favor. Turlini is under heavy guard in one of the nearby towers. The Muramites think he's up to something and I'm concerned they may torture or kill him. Please have a talk with Turlini when you can.'<BR><BR><font color=#ffffbb">You will receive a character flag and an item that identifies as "Proof of kindness".</font><br>
