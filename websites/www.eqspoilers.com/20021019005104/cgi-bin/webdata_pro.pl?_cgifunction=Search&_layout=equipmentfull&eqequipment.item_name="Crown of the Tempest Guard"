<b>Description</b>:<br>
This information was obtained from a <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5416.topic">Safehouse Thread</a>. The quest begins with Lady Deira in Jaggedpine Forest.<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Lady Deira'<BR><BR>Lady Deira closes her eyes and gives a formal, polite bow to Reinholt, 'I am Lady Deira, Veteran of Thunder and one of several ambassadors to the Jaggedpine from Qeynos. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, although I fear that I am not one for words or company at the moment. I have [duties] to uphold and must give the fullest of my attentions to the fort.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what duties?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'When his majesty, Antonious IV, ordered the removal of the barricades that had separated the Jaggedpine forest from the rest of the Qeynos lands, the council of Qeynos hand-picked several ambassadors to venture to the forest and provide the proper support of both military needs and social reconstruction purposes. I was sent to aid in fortifying the military front to ward off the attacks of the gnolls and any other intruders that might climb through the gnolls' burrow. It has proven to be a very trying task as the gnolls are quite persistent in their attacks of Fort Jaggedpine and the fort's residents are rather. . . [lost] in the ways of modern warfare.''<BR><BR>You say, 'how was it lost?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'I do not mean to insult either their integrity nor their abilities, it is merely that they have been cut off from us for so long and have never had the chance to benefit from the experiences of the passing times. Granted, much unfortunate turmoil and darkness has enshrouded our world and they were sparred the suffering of Norrath for some time, but the lessons learned have been denied to them. They are capable scouts and unrivaled artisans who hold tradition in a sense of honor that is to be commended and respected, but they know little about war or defense. Their existence has been peaceful -- nearly tranquil in comparison and they struggle now. However, this does not mean that there is no hope to maintain the precious balance they have established and upheld since before the construction of the great cities of Norrath, nor does it mean that they are incapable; merely [undisciplined].''<BR><BR>You say, 'How are they undisciplined?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'Again, I do not speak out against the abilities that they do have -- they are able warders of nature and I do not underestimate the cunning of their scouts. It is when the obstacle is unknown that they find themselves without the knowledge to appropriately defend, nor are they trained to handle an onslaught of attacks that has been so generously afforded in the recent days. My duties are not only to aid in the protection of the fort and the people of the Jaggedpine, but I am also here to train their citizens in the manner of defense and offense of battle. They have been most receptive to my coming and have shown much interest in what lessons I have been able to offer thus far and in return, they have been most gracious in their hospitality and shared [secrets] of our mutual faith.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what secrets?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'The people of Fort Jaggedpine are master artisans and their faith to The Rainkeeper is pure -- having been spared the change of the modern eras. Their ancient ways are some of the very precious and priceless jewels that we strive to protect in our presence here; but shields and steel can do only so much to protect and assure that this ancient culture survives. It must be passed on from generation to generation and faithful to faithful. I, like all of my fellow ambassadors from Qeynos, am devoted in spirituality to The Rainkeeper and thus the keepers of the ancient ways have been well received to our presence and inquiries. I recently have been taught the ancient secrets of their blacksmiths -- secrets that until recently held little to [no place] in the recent culture of the Jaggedpine.''<BR><BR>You say, 'why do they hold no place?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'When the Jaggedpine forest was ordered to be sealed, only those who were directly connected with the natural world in their profession were allowed to remain in the forest's confines. This was a decision made not out of prejudice, but out of a fundamental necessity to maintain the bare minimum that was thought needed to preserve that which they sought to spare from the approaching corruption of the time. The warriors, knights, rogues, and the minority of the arcane scientists loyal to The Rainkeeper and the philosophy guarded by his faithful were warmly and hospitably accepted into the already existing guildhalls of the Qeynos city proper. However, the traditions of these minority professions dedicated to the philosophies and culture of The Rainkeeper did not die -- they merely faded for a while. But they are very much [alive once again].''<BR><BR>You say, 'how are they alive once again?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'With the reunion of the Jaggedpine forest with its sister, the Surefall Glade and reinstatement into the kingdom of Qeynos, the old ways of the minority followers have resurfaced. As I am a warrior whom has been dedicated to The Rainkeeper since I first took up the blade, I have been given the honor of being introduced and tutored in the [ways of my ancestors].''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are the ways of the ancestors?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'There are several rites that the Veterans of the Storm, the title bestowed to the warriors and knights loyal to The Rainkeeper, perform to place themselves among the ranks of The Rainkeeper's faithful. Unfortunately, this time of turmoil has kept much of these rites from being properly resurrected and performed, although they are not forgotten and the intentions to introduce them once again to the faithful remain strong still. However, there is one practice that the artisans and elders of Fort Jaggedpine have been able to relay to me. They are very traditional by nature and wished to reunite their distant brethren not only with the forest but also with the ways of their ancestors before them, so they invited me to learn the rites of the [Tempest Guard] and wield our ancient symbol.''<BR><BR>You say, 'Who is the tempest guard?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'The Tempest Guard is a title bestowed among the most devout and capable of the Storm's Veterans. I do not say this in boast or overconfidence, mind you. I walked the tremulous path and strove to earn this ancient and sacred place among my kin. Now, I am one of few to hold the title, for true warriors and knights dedicated to The Rainkeeper are rare and finding those whose hearts are truly set upon the path of storms are rarer yet. As I exist as a bearer of this rank, I am also one of the mentors that guide it. If a veteran of the storm views themselves as [worthy to bear the Tempest Guard symbol], then I shall be the one that tests the validity of their views.''<BR><BR>You say, 'I am worthy to bear the tempest guard symbol'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'Very well and it is now that we shall begin. As with all things of the Jaggedpine and the ancient ways, you must endeavor on your own accord and initiative to achieve recognition among the ranks of this society. I shall give you the guidance toward the path, but you must willingly walk it -- and you must do so in facing many great dangers. The first steps that you must take are ones of material acquisition, or on a more fine of point, you must obtain the [items] that will be constructed into your symbol, should you prove worthy of it in the end.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what items?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'You will be sent, as your first task, to retrieve two items that will be critical to the fulfillment and possible success of your trial. The Earthen Crown of the Underfoot, the first of the two items you must obtain, resides in the depths of The Hole. One named Tzitzi the Crazed holds the crown. Beware him, for although his madness is consuming, his cunning and wile are not to be underestimated. The second item that you must return to me with the crown is [Nyrein's Tome], which is rumored to exist in the depths of Kedge Keep.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What is Nyrein's tome?'<BR><BR>Lady Deira says 'When great cities were still in the dawn of their conception, Nyrein Shadowstorm was the first to bear the title of Tempest Guard. She was an able warrior who had defended her homeland of the Jaggedpine time and time again -- warding away the bestial foes of the Unkempt Wood and slaying the would-be raiders of the other nomadic tribes that sought to reave the precious forest for their own. It is said that the spirit of Karana himself blessed her -- guised in the form of a raging tempest that accompanied her through the campaign that would secure the Jaggedpine for our ancestors. It was then that she was bestowed the name of Tempest Guard and the circle of the Veterans of the Storm was set in-place. In her final campaign centuries past, she fell beneath the spell of the Kedge. What resides of her there is but a hollow shell -- the true Nyrein ascended into the Eye of Karana's Storm long ago and her physical essence is sadly but a tormented servant of the deep.'<BR><BR><font color=#eeee00>You need to obtain the Earthen Crown of the Underfoot from the Hole(Tzitzi the Crazed) and Nyrein's Tome from Kedge Keep.<BR><BR>Hand those items in to Deira and she will give you a Prayer.<BR><BR>You then must obtain the Tempest Rune from a named Madman(Anumnan Dathry) who is a rare spawn in South Ro.<BR><BR>Give the Tempest Rune and the Prayer to Lord Mrallon in Qeynos.</font><BR><BR>Lord Mrallon says ''Aaaah, yet another warrior brave enough to face their own faults and honorable enough to strive for a proof of their worth and devotion to The Rainkeeper. Your kind is too few and far too rare, but do not think that your trials are at their end. I have forged the necessary Hollowed Tempest Stone -- yes, young warrior, I am indeed one well versed in the ways of the Tempest Guard for at one time I myself held such a rank in a time before the closing of the Jaggedpine. Aaaah, but enough reminiscing for one day -- your trial is the matter at hand. Within the Hollowed Tempest Stone you must combine the Essence of the Tempest Guard, which you will find only through great peril. The Tempest Reaver, who resides in the realm of Cazic-Thule himself, holds the essence. The [tale] regarding its presence there is indeed one to be heard if you wish to fully understand your task.<BR><BR>Your faction standing with Knights of Thunder got better. <BR>Your faction standing with Bloodsabers could not possibly get any worse. <BR>Your faction standing with Priests of Life could not possibly get any better. <BR>Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos could not possibly get any better. <BR>You gain experience!! <BR><BR>You say, 'what tale' <BR><BR>Lord Mrallon says 'Nyrein Shadowstorm spent much of her life defending the Jaggedpine from within its confines. However, duty would sometimes deem that she trek beyond the forest to assure its protection. In the peek years of her life, she spent much time wandering the whole of Norrath in pursuit of one villain that had betrayed the entire order. We are not certain why or how this one, who at one time was Nyrein's most trusted of companions and second to only her within the order, fell to the temptations and corruption of The Faceless -- but we do know that Nyrein defeated him on the battlefield. He fled to the Plane of Fear and with him went the very essence of the Tempest Guard that remains caged within his corrupted, violent spirit. Find the Tempest Reaver and retrieve the Essence of the Tempest Guard, which you must then seal within the Hollowed Tempest Stone to create the Tempest Guard's Stone. Once you have this sacred stone, return it to Lady Deira.<BR><BR><font color=#eeee00>You now must kill the Tempest Reaver in the Plane of Fear. He will drop the Essence of the Tempest Reaver. Combine this in to the Hollowed Tempest Stone that you received earlier and it will create a Tempest Guard Stone.<BR><BR>Hand the Tempest Guard Stone in to Lady Deira to complete the quest.</font><BR><BR>Lady Deira gives a warm, gentle smile and a deep bow of respect to Aragir as she extends a white steel crown ornamented with a single blue gem, 'Welcome to the Veterans of the Storm, and we honor you as Tempest Guard Aragir. Bear this symbol in humility and as a sign of your eternal pledge in service and protection of all that The Rainkeeper holds dear and sacred.' <BR><BR>Your faction standing with Residents of Jaggedpine got better. <BR>Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk could not possibly get any better. <BR>Your faction standing with Protectors of Pine got better. <BR>Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos could not possibly get any better. <br>
