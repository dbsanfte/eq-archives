<font color=#d2d200><b>Description:</b></font><br>
This is the second in the line of Qeynos badge quests. It requires that you have completed the first quest(see related quests). <BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<BR><BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task.<BR><BR>You say, 'How can I advance further in rank?'<BR><BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Interested in advancing further are you? Excellent, we are ready to begin the next phase of our operation. We have gathered a great deal of information as a result of the latest series of arrests. What we require most now are [interrogators] that are able to pry the information we require out those less then willing to talk.<BR><BR>You say, 'What is an Interrogator?'<BR><BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'If you are interested in joining the ranks of our interrogators and helping Qeynos further as we bring these fiends and murderers to justice, turn in your Investigator's Badge and I will give you the briefing document you need. I already know I can trust my investigator's, so there is no need to further test you.<BR><BR>Turn in your Investigator's Badge.<BR><BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well, here is the briefing document. Please read it very carefully. I wish you luck friend, this mission could prove to be dangerous.<BR><BR>You receive a book, which instructs you to search South Karanas for an interrogator, turn in the book to him and follow his instructions. There is a bit of a trick here as the book does not end where it appears to; there is one more page telling you to first get a confession document from an investigator. This means making a run to the investigator in South Qeynos you used for the first badge.<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, an investigator'<BR><BR>an investigator raises one eyebrow and looks at you with suspicion before returning his watchful eye to the many people going about their business in the city.<BR><BR>You say, 'Please give me a confession document.'<BR><BR>an investigator says 'Here you are.<BR><BR>Then go to South Karanas. The interrogator can be found a short distance from the Hermit's hut. Give him the book. A scripted sequence follows; there are brief pauses in the interrogator's speech.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'I see you wish to become an interrogator. This is not a duty for the weak of heart you know. This job sometimes requires. . .<BR><BR>an interrogator coughs, 'a little muscle I guess you would say.'<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Nevertheless, we have an important job to do. There is a man by the name of Theodore Exanthem who is a known member of the Bloodsaber cult. He fled from Qeynos some time ago and we have been hot on his<BR>tail ever since.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'We have tracked this man down and we now know his whereabouts. However, we have bigger fish to fry today then just this low life. Theodore knows the location of two other individuals also suspected of hiding out here in the plains.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Sadly, these fiends were the two that slipped into Surefall Glade and poisoned the waters there. Though the druids were able to quickly combine their efforts and neutralize the toxins with their magicks, grievous damage was done none the less. Two of the great protectors of the hills and the glade, Holly Windstalker and Cros Treewind, became seriously ill as did one of the glade's sacred bears.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Holly and Cros, sickened as they were, removed themselves from the Hills to weather out their illness and to keep the disease from spreading further. During their absence, the Bloodsabers were easily able to traffic in the materials needed to complete their terrible work.<BR><BR>an interrogator shakes his head sadly and says, 'Tragically, Cros Treewind was attacked by one of the sacred bears which was maddened by its illness. In his weakened state Cros was unable to defend himself and was killed by this defiled grizzly, one of the very creatures he was sworn to protect.'<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'So our goal is to pry the information we need from Theodore Exanthem so that we may bring these two fugitives to justice. After getting him to comply, you are to collect a confession from Theodore and have him lead us to the two fugitives. Give me Theodore's confession and the heads of these two fugitives and you shall have your badge.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'I believe I know where we can find him. Follow me please.<BR><BR>The interrogator will walk to the Hermit's hut, triggering another scripted sequence.<BR><BR>a voice says 'Would you mind leaving already? I don't like people.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem by order of the Council of Qeynos and his lordship Antonius Bayle, I order you to come out of there immediately!<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem, you will [take us to the location] of Marcus Cachexia and Morley Murrain immediately.<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem says 'I think you've been breathing the air in the Northern Plains of Karana for too long. I will most certainly not tell you anything about their whereabouts, much less lead you right to them. You are not right in the head.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Vile beast! You are withholding information on two men guilty of terrible atrocities, not the least of which was causing the death of one of Qeynos' most respected and well known citizens, Cros Treewind! As an Interrogator I am authorized to use physical force if necessary.<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem says 'What a joke! I'm not telling you a thing. You don't look like you could scare a moss snake. I'm not afraid of you!<BR><BR>The interrogator will swipe at Theodore a bit.<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem reels back, his eyes wide with shock. Ow, he says nervously.<BR><BR>an interrogator says '[Take us to the location] of Markus Cachexia and Morley Murrain!<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem winces and says, Oh. Yeah right. Like I'm afraid of that moron or something. Theodore glances nervously over at you.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Take us to Markus Chachexia and Morley Murrain this instant or I'll turn you over to my friend here who appears to be much stronger then I am!<BR><BR>an interrogator smiles and says, 'Well, I'm getting tired. Why don't you hit him for a while. Maybe you will be more convincing then I have been.'<BR><BR>This is your cue, hit Theodore yourself. I "killed" him in one shot but he instantly respawns and the sequence continues.<BR><BR>You slash Theodore Exanthem for 39 points of damage.<BR>You have slain Theodore Exanthem!<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem says 'Sweet father of rot, alright already! Stop hitting me and tell me what you want me to do!<BR><BR>You say, 'Take us to the location'<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem says 'Fine follow me creeps.<BR><BR>Theodore leads you and the interrogator over the nearby hill to the Druid ring. There you will see two NPCs, Markus Cachexia (SK) and Morley Murrain (NEC), both estimated to be in the mid to high 20s. At this point, give Theodore the confession document and receive his signed confession.<BR><BR>Theodore Exanthem makes a big X at the bottom of the document and hands it back saying, 'A bunch of worthless thugs is all you folks are!'<BR><BR>Hold on to it for now. Engage Markus and Morely in combat. Markus will Harm Touch for 271 and create two Raised Servants (skeletons). Morely will call forth about nine Wraiths (miniature Spectre models). As a 55 Ranger, I engaged the mobs myself and won the battle, losing two bubbles of health. I concentrated on the two nameds until they were dead, then cleaned up the others. The spawned mobs did practically no damage to me.<BR><BR>Give the interrogator the heads of Markus and Morely, along with the signed confession<BR>from Theodore.<BR><BR>an interrogator says 'Excellent work, you did just fine today. You'll make a fine interrogator. Talk to Vegalys about advancing further.<BR><BR>Congradulations on your second badge.<br><br>
