<b>Description</b>:<br>
These are the new druid armor quests in Jaggedpine. This information was obtained from a <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=886.topic">EQ Traders Thread</a>.<BR><BR>Boots of the Pine:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire boots'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall endeavor to earn such a gift. I will guide and aid you where I can, as will Lerian Wyndrunner, whom you may find in Surefall Glade -- but it is you who will ultimately prove yourself worthy of this item and the sacred oath that is tied to it -- the oath of the guardian of nature. You must venture out into the world and procure several items that you will eventually return to me. The items I require are two Polished Jade Plates from the Potameid Guardians of the Hatchling River. Our rangers have reported much of our recently stolen jade ornaments to be in the possession of the Potameides -- the jade items likely came into their possession after they killed the poachers who raid our fort here on occasion. Lerian will guide you to acquire the second item if you approach and inquire to him about the Mithril Fern Boots.''<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner is in surefall glades, off to the right after leaving the bear caves via the false wall behind the druid guild.<BR><BR>You say, 'what mithril fern boots?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Cheyloh has caught the attentions of yet another druid seeking to prove themselves worthy of nature’s gifts. If she has placed her trust and faith in you with this, one of our most sacred of tests and equipment, then I shall guide and aid you in parallel to her faith, my friend. I will need you to seek out and return to me some Shadowjade Fern Seeds, two Shadowjade Fern Leaves, all of which you can forage from the Jaggedpine forest, and a Jaggedpine Panther Hide. To obtain this hide, you will seek out one known as Fitorrin Bladespur. The citizens of Qeynos have reported that he has taken a ship to Odus. As he is a criminal, Erudin may have already disposed of him, but that is unlikely for Fitorrin is well informed and education on the ways of the world for one of such a debased profession as he. It would be wise to search the forest of Toxxulia for his whereabouts.''<BR><BR>When I found Fitorrin in Tox, he was on the paineel side of the zone. He is immune to root and snare, but only has around 2k hps and green to lvl 60. You will need to hand Leiran the jaggedpine panther hide, 2 shadowjade fern leaves and 2 shadowjade seeds. When I did this, I didn't have my log on, but it results in a magic/lore/no drop hide. Leiran tells you to go to solb and get blackened mithril boots, no drop druid only that drops off of a kobold guardian. The kobold guardian spawns in the king area, he's light blue to 60 and a shadowknight. When you have the boots, combine them with the hide Lerian gave you in a large sewing kit for mithril fern boots (5ac, 10hp, 10mana), this wasn't trivial at 165 skill in tailoring.<BR>To get the polished jade plates drop off the potameid guardians. These are green at 60 for the most part, immune to root, snare and slow. The plates are a rare drop. Handing Cheyloh the mithril fern boots and the polished jade plates gives you:<BR>Boots of the Pine, 11ac, 2dex, 5sta, 5sv magic, druid only. Recommended level 35.<BR><BR>Sleeves:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire sleeves'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'If that is your wish, my friend. You will need to seek out two items and return them to me. In the depths of the Potameid caves located off of the Hatchling River, you will find the Potameid Protectors. Our ranger scouts have found many of our sacred jade ornaments scattered throughout the possession of the Potameides. Reports stating that the protectors to hold the Polished Jade Leaves, which you must acquire for the sleeves, have been delivered by our scouts. The second item that you must return to me are the Shark Tooth Sleeves. Seek out Lerian Wyndrunner in Surefall Glade and he will guide you in that task.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are shark tooth sleeves?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'You seek to prove yourself upon the ancient and sacred path of the Jaggedpine, I see. You will need to procure two specific items for me so that I might make one of the components that you will need to produce the sleeves. Yes, my, friend, you will be making the final product with your own hands and patience, as is the ultimate test of this path -- to prove that you are willing and able to earn these items on your own accord. The items I need to make the Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves are a Shark Rib from one of the great behemoths of Kedge, and a Flayed Panther Hide. The hide you will find upon one of the poachers that have taken it upon themselves to establish an outpost in our forest. The one you will find to have such hide within their possession is Yranik Blackguard.''<BR><BR>Yranik Blackguard is a rare named at the poacher camp, realy magic resistant, light blue to 60 and double hits for a max of 115 if I remember correctly. From what I've seen, he always drops the flayed panther hide.<BR><BR>Gloves:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire gloves'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'A most wise choice, friend. You must continue to uphold the sacred duties that you have pledged your existence to and thus gain nature's recognition and full acceptance to fulfill this task. The items I am in need of so that I might properly weave the gloves are Polished Jade Studs and Forest Woven Gloves. The Polished Jade Studs you will find in the Potameid Caves, where much of our sacred jade ornaments have found their way by the fates of the thieves and poachers who infest this land and frequently raid our homes. Our scouts believe the Potameid Matriarchs to hold the jade studs, and I would heed their advice to discourage any unnecessary danger to you. The Forest Woven Gloves will require further aid from a member of the Jaggedpine to obtain. Seek out my beloved, Lerian in the Surefall Glade and inquire to him about the gloves. He will know who has sent you and the full details of the task before you.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are forest woven gloves?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The gloves you seek to acquire will take much patience and perseverance on your behalf to be successful in obtaining. I can guide you as to who and what you must seek and give you the proper instructions to fulfill your part before I can give the final touch to creating the Forest Woven Gloves. The task you must fulfill before returning to me to complete the final process in the item's creation is to use your own mastery in the ways of tailoring to create the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves. There are two components for this item -- one is the Tattered Panther Hide Gloves, which you will likely find upon a renegade poacher known as Theoris Bladespur, who the scouts of the Glade have informed me currently resides in South Karana. The second item is the [Blackened Mithril Netting].''<BR><BR>You say, 'what is blackened mithril netting?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This material is new to the creation of the gloves, as the resource we had once used grows dangerously scarce. I have spoken with the craftsman of Qeynos and they have given me the knowledge of the Blackened Mithril, which can be found in the clutches of the kobold king's guard who resides in Solusek's Eye. The artisans of Qeynos say that the Blackened Mithril is light and its ability to hold an enchantment is unsurpassed by anything they have yet to find on Antonica, making it suitable for our intentions of creating this item. Once you have successfully made the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves, you will need to return them to me with the Shadowjade Moss and Shadowjade Fern Leaves, both of which you can safely procure in the Jaggedpine, if the forest will allow you take of it.''<BR><BR>The blackened mithril netting drops off a kobold advisor, also in the king area of solb. the advisor is a light blue to 60 shaman. He's either immune to changes in run speed or so resistant as to make little difference. Theoris Bladespur is roughly the same lvl/difficulty as Fitorrin, and spawns in east karana at the bandit camp by the druid ring. Combining the blackened mithril netting and tattered panther hide gloves in a large sewing kit results in Blackened mithril netted gloves, and isn't trivial at 165. Handing the blackened mithril netted gloves, 1 shadow jade fern leaf, and 1 shadowjade moss to Lerian results in Forest Woven Gloves (5ac, 10hp, 10mana).<BR><BR>Circlet:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire a circlet'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood nods softly, 'Then you shall endeavor to earn them, my friend. Nature will provide to you what it is you provide to her -- if you protect her, she shall in-turn offer shelter and provide to you. I shall aid you, as is my duty here, but you must set out on your own before my aid can be granted. There are two items you must seek; a Polished Jade Tear that resides in the clutches of Lameriae the Alluring, a powerful Potameid Temptress who seduced and killed on of the Blackguard's most cunning of thieves and hunters. It is said that she holds the tear, which was given to her by the entranced Blackguard before he drowned to death. The second item you must retrieve for me is a Shadowjade Circlet that Jhaya Wyndrunner in Surefall Glade will aid you to acquire -- all you need to do approach and ask her.'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner is on the the side of the druid's guild opposite to her brother Lerian in surefall glade.<BR><BR>You say, 'what shadowjade circlet?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'I see that Cheyloh has been keeping herself quite busy with the recent opening of our lands to Qeynos, and I am pleased to know that our brethren of the world beyond the Jaggedpine have an interest in our ways. I will aid you to create the circlet, but I must ask that you brave the wilds and turmoil of this world to retrieve two items that I will then weave into the circlet for you. The items I need are a Shadowjade Weave, which you will make with your own hands by weaving two Shadowjade Vines and two strands of Shadowjade Moss together -- both components you may find by foraging through the Jaggedpine forest. Be sure that your mastery of tailoring is up to par when attempting this feat, for the components are delicate and will be destroyed in the hands of the inexperienced. The second item I am in need of is a [Blackened Mithril Chain].''<BR>You say, 'what blackened mithril chain?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'The artisans of Qeynos have provided a wonderful counterpart to our natural, although nearly depleted resource that was once used when making this line of our sacred armor. Unfortunately, the one who last attempted to retrieve the chain was killed in Lavastorm by one of the poachers, who seek the Blackened Mithril for their own reasons -- likely to steal our recipe and sell the corrupted versions of these treasured items on the underground market of Norrath. In any case, we have heard that the chain was sold to one appropriately named Nyuae the Cruel -- a Teir'Dal enchantress. What her motives are, I am unsure of, but we do know that she has taken refuge in the Ocean of Tears. Retrieve the Blackened Mithril Chain and return it to me with the Shadowjade Weave.''<BR><BR>Nyuae the Cruel is in the ocean of tears on the dinosaur island. She's also light blue to 60, a necromancer and immune to root/snare. The shadowjade weave requires 2 shadowjade moss and 2 shadowjade fern leaves combined in a large sewing kit, not trivial at 165 skill. Handing the shadowjade weave and blackened mithril chain to Jhaya results in a shadowjade circlet (5ac, 10hp, 10mana).<BR><BR>Bracer:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire a bracer'<BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall work to obtain that which you desire, my friend. Nature's gifts are not given without justification and you must prove yourself worthy of this most sacred of our items. I will ask that you venture out into the wilds and procure the Polished Jade Blossoms and the Bracer of Braided Pine and return them to me. The Jade Blossoms are not traditional flora -- they are of the jade stones carved by our artisans and blessed by our elders. You will likely find them in the Potameid Caves, where many of our recently lost charms have turned up as of late. The Potameid Temptresses use the blossoms as charms around their necks, from what the scouts have gathered. To acquire the bracer, you must seek out Lerian Wyndrunner, who currently resides in the Surefall Glade, and seek his guidance.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what is the bracer of braided pine?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This is an item that you will need to work hard to obtain, my friend, but I shall guide you through this task -- if you can appeal to the world that you have dedicated your life to and receive her acceptance and gifts. I will need two specific items from you to create that which Cheyloh has requested of you. Those items are the Black Rawhide Bracer and the [Braids of Pine]. The rangers of the Jaggedpine Treefolk have informed me that Ryleen Bladespur, one of the poachers to have recently infested our forest, has made her way to South Karana to sell much of her stolen wears within the underground market of Norrath. Seek her out and you will find the bracer.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are braids of pine?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to make on your own by carefully weaving strands of Shadowjade Moss, Jaggedpine Needles, and Potameid Braids into one delicate strand. The forest will offer the Shadowjade Moss and Jaggedpine Needles to you if she deems you worthy of her gifts. The braids, however, you must take from the Potameid Wildlings of the Hatchling River. Be sure that your mastery in the ways of tailoring are in the forefront of your mind when you attempt this feat, for anything less will result in the destruction of these delicate materials.''<BR><BR>Ryleen Bladespur is roughly the same as the two previous Bladespurs, and can be found in South Karana, south-west of the aviak village. Potameid wildlings are light blue at 60, immune to snare/root/slow/stun, and if the braids are on their loot table then they're realy realy rare.<BR><BR>Leggings:<BR><BR>You say, 'I wish to acquire leggings'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Very well, Aldreaath. There are two components that you will need to return to me; [Polished Jade Acorns] and [Moss-Threaded Rawhide Leggings]. But procuring those items will not be easy, and I can guarantee that you will plunge yourself into danger. However, you should not fear this for we must often selflessly endanger ourselves to fulfill our ultimate goals -- the protection of the natural world. Through these endeavors, your success will be rewarded by nature¿s recognition and she shall grant to you the gifts you will need to complete this task before you.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what polished jade acorns?'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Every piece of the Armor of the Pine requires a special stone. These stones have been carved into different shapes by our artisans, and each one blessed by our elder warders of the pine. Unfortunately, the introduction of the poachers with the creation of the passageway between the forest and the den of Blackburrow has brought us to a loss for these sacred items. The Blackguard family and their henchmen have raided our fort several times, stealing our materials to be sold illegally within the underground market of Norrath. However, the poachers are very limited in their knowledge of this area and our ranger scouts have informed us that [Myraephe the Pure] killed the one who stole the specific stones we need.''<BR><BR>You say, 'who is Myraephe the pure?'<BR><BR>Cheyloh Greenwood says 'The Hatchling River -- a beautiful waterway jealously protected by the nymph spirits known as Potameides, fuels the lifeblood of this forest. These naiads are beautiful creatures, who at one time were benevolent to us until the development of great cultures and the construction of great cities destroyed much of the nymph kind. The Potameides felt the loss of their sisters and became hostile to all mortals alike, viewing our presence as a threat to their very existence. Myraephe is one of the ancient Potameides and our scouts have said that recently, she wears a necklace made of Polished Stone Acorns. Seek Myraede and retrieve the acorns as you will, my friend -- and know neither regret nor sorrow for your actions as their intentions have been influenced by the threat of the Unkempt Wood to the east. The Potameid spirit will return to protect the river its spirit is bound to, so long as the river itself does not become corrupt.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are moss threaded rawhide leggings?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Aaaahh. . . I see that you have chosen to embark on the sacred path of the Jaggedpine. No doubt my dearest Cheyloh has sent you, and if she has placed her trust in you and given you the sacred knowledge to embark on this ancient quest, then my services are at your disposal in this cause, my friend. To create the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings, you will need to obtain the [needed components] that I will work with to make the leggings.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what are the needed components?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The recipe for the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings is very specific, and the materials that I am about to describe to you must be exact for the creation of the Leggings of the Pine to be properly completed. From you, I will need a pair of Ruined Rawhide Leggings and a [Spool of Moss Thread]. The ruined leggings you will likely find in the Shrine of Brell Serilis, located beneath our forest. When the gnolls first arrived in the Jaggedpine, they raided our fort several times and although no lives have yet to be lost specifically to their talons, something of which I give praise and thanks to The Rainkeeper for daily, the gnolls have stolen our supplies from time to time.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what is a spool of moss thread?'<BR><BR>Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to use your own hands, patience, and devotion to the natural world to create. A mastery of the skill of weaving -- tailoring -- is very important when attmpting to handle such a feat. The items that you must weave to make this enchanted thread are the Shadowjade Moss and Threads of the Hatchling. The Shadowjade Moss you will find as a gift from the Jaggedpine for your services to her. If you search carefully and with selfless patience, she will grant you a perfect specimen suitable for the creation of this item. The Threads of the Hatchling you must acquire from the Potameid Bewilders in the caves located off the Hatchling River. May The Rainkeeper guide you in your quest, my friend, and I look forward to your return.''<BR><BR>Myraephe the Pure I found in the river near the poacher camp, she was light blue to 60, and immune to root/snare. The ruined rawhide leggings I looted off of a darkpaw mystic in the darkpaw cave in jaggedpine.<BR><BR>Now the tunic you have to get from Nolan Greenwood. This quest is broken at the moment because Jhaya Wyndrunner won't respond to any varriation of asking her for the recipe for the black rawhide tunic.<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Nolan Greenwood'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood gives a gentle nod to Aldreaath, 'Greetings. I am Nolan Greenwood, warder of the Jaggedpine and retainer of our [ancient ways]. The recent introduction of [outsiders] whose faith and loyalties mimic our own toward The Rainkeeper has led to the rebirth of a long lost excitement and use for my talents, thus my presence here today. Usually, I would not be so easily found for when presented with the choice, for I prefer the sanctuary of the open forest to the confining walls of my room here at Fort Jaggedpine.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what ancient ways?'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood says 'As with any culture, my friend, there are countless established ways of life, worship, law, and order. It would be impossible for me to explain all of our ancient ways in a single conversation -- and even more impossible would it be for you to understand them. You must experience and [accept them as your own] to fully understand.''<BR><BR>You say, 'I will accept them as my own'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood raises a brow and gives a gentle, warm smile to Aldreaath's declaration, 'I see, and am very pleased to know that your interest has grown and your heart is opened to know the path of The Rainkeeper. As I retain the laws and order of nature that we of the Jaggedpine have sworn ourselves to, I will be more than willing to give you what words I can to guide you toward true discovery of what it means to be of The Rainkeeper's service and pledge. The rest shall be taught through your own experience in these [trials].'<BR><BR>You say, 'what trials?'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood says 'To show your devotion to the natural world and strengthen your abilities to protect it, you must engage in a symbiotic relationship with nature. As you give your devotion and one day your life to the natural world, it will equally provide the [tools] that will aid you to execute the duties and protection you have pledged to uphold.''<BR><BR>You say, 'what tools?'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood says 'Sustenance, shelter, and the necessities that we must have to survive are all provided by the world that we must protect. The wilderness will also lend its spiritual force to you, and it is the fullest potential of that spiritual force that I can see you and many other druids have yet to truly harness. Do not think that we reave these things from nature -- for as I said, our relationship must be mutual. If you invest the time and prayer to [ask of her], she shall provide the rest to these needs most willingly -- as a mother would her beloved child.''<BR><BR>You say, 'how do I ask of her?'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood says 'These questions are not of the vocal expression, my friend. To request nature's aid, you must go in-search of that aid. In that search, you will provide unto her nothing less than a service equal to what it is you seek. My beloved daughter, Cheyloh, and [I shall guide you] through this quest.''<BR><BR>You say, 'how shall you guide me?'<BR><BR>Nolan Greenwood says 'I will give you the guidance of words and my knowledge of the details pertaining to your tasks. My experience and talents in the ways of making proper and the most efficient use of that which nature will grant you in gratitude of your service to her shall be at your disposal as necessary and appropriate. The first of your tasks will be to acquire and return to me two items -- [Silver Griffon Feathers] and a [Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic].''<BR><BR>You say, 'what is a jade studded rawhide tunic?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner gives a gentle, almost musical chuckle of delight, 'Nolan Greenwood must be quite excited to have his great talents be of interest and use once again. I will be more than willing to aid you in fulfilling my former mentor and dearest friend's task of you. Unfortunately, I am at a loss for the supplies that are necessary to aid you properly and my duties keep me safe in the Glade. I will need you to bring me two specific [items] and I will be happy to sew them into the tunic.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what items?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'The items I require for this tunic will not be easy to acquire, my friend and I do apologize for the turmoil that you will likely plunge yourself into to fulfill this task -- but as is the way of those whom defend the natural world. The two items I need of you are the [Pouch of Polished Jade Stones] and a [Black Rawhide Tunic].''<BR><BR>You say, 'what is a pouch of polished jade stones?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'Our artisans of the Jaggedpine pride themselves on the beauty and quality of their products. The jade stone has become a sort of a symbol to those of us in the Jaggedpine and it is used almost exclusively to decorate all of our powerful tools. Unfortunately, many others have found the potential of these stones and have begun to reave them from us and our craftsman have been too occupied with the recent events to make any great supply of these items. You must [find] one of the [stolen pouches].''<BR><BR>You say, 'where can I find the stolen pouches?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'With the creation of the passageway in Blackburrow to the Jaggedpine Forest, many of the poachers that are native to Qeynos soil have secretly made their way into our woodlands. They maliciously destroy our beautiful and sacred beasts solely for the purpose of monetary profit. We were not prepared to encounter such individuals and these thieves raided many of our establishments at Fort Jaggedpine. The artisans were not spared these barbarous acts and many of our precious stones were stolen. I know the name of the one who may have these stones -- [Greshvoule].''<BR><BR>You say, 'who is greshvoule?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner glares at the mention of the name, 'Greshvoule was one of many poachers to invade our forest after the construction of the subterranean passageway. He is a very cunning thief and a warrior not to be trifled with. He. . . killed one of our artisans and a dear friend of mine, Callisa, who specialized in the art of carving and polishing these jade stones. One of the rangers native to the glade graced me with his favor and found that the barbarian known as Greshvoule is hiding in Permafrost, trying to escape proper justice for his crimes against the glade. If you could find him and avenge the wrongs committed against my dear friend and the glade, I would be eternally grateful.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what is a black rawhide tunic?'<BR><BR>Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'That is an item that you must forge with your own skills, my friend. We of the Jaggedpine use the resources that nature allows us to the fullest extent and it is our law that when we embrace nature's gifts, that the one whom has gained those gifts must use their own hands and work to earn that gift -- for she has granted it to you, and you alone. I can tell you [how to make the Black Rawhide Tunic] and perhaps make this task a bit easier for one as new to our ways as yourself, my friend.''<BR><BR>Silver griffon feathers drop off The Silver Griffon in north karana, light blue to lvl 60, immune to root and snare. <br>
