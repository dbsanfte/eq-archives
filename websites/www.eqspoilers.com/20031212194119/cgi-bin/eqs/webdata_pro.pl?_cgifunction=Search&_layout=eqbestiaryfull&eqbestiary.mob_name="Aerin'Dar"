<br><b><font color=#d2d200>Description:</b></font><br>- Hits for up to 1400 per attack.<BR>- Magic Based (-150) Area effect breath does 700 points of direct damage, AE fear and adds a 3500 point DoT over 42 seconds. It has a range of 200 and a recast time fo 35 seconds.<BR>- Magic-based (-150) single target proc does up to 3000 Direct Damage and has a 45% slow.<BR>- One of the golems in his room will spawn every 10% of Aerin'Dar's hit points. The golems can be rooted and can be high sunned back to spawn.<BR>- Magic ressistance is key to resisting his AE. This means bards.<BR>- Rampages<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>Aerin`Dar can be tracked from the zone in. He is a three day spawn.<BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>Elementally equipped guilds can take Aerin`Dar with around 30 players. Moderately geared guilds should bring 50+. You will need at least one player who has the <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqquestfull&eqquests.quest_name=%22Halls%20of%20Honor%28Large%20Guild%29%22">Key to Aerin`Dar's Chamber</a>. Once you have killed Aerin`Dar you can no longer do this quest. These keys are not very common as a result.<BR><BR>Bards are crucial for this fight. You need to at the very minimum have a bard in with the clerics and main tank/rampage tank. The more bards the easier this fight becomes. <BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>Everyone needs to have their magic resistance boosted as high as possible for this encounter. You need to be sure to have a bard in the cleric and main tank/rampage tank groups for resistance purposes. In an ideal situation every group would have a bard. There are seldom enough bards to pull this off, so AE magic resistance and MR buffs are important. Raids typically gather in the room above his chamber (behind the locked door), but do not click down until they are already buffed and ready.<BR><BR>Clerics and druids who have EE or Spirit of the Wood need to save their MGBs for the fight. MGB heals are important for this encounter.<BR><BR>To get to the prep room from the zone in you need to head straight to the keep. Climb upstairs and exit the keep to the Golem and Crawler portion of the zone. Turn left and cut across to the zone wall. This involves some careful weaving through golems and patrolling crawlers. If you have invisibility and are careful you should be able to make it through no problem. Occasionally there will be a mob that sees invis though. If you die, do not train the prep area. Get near it and die along the wall, then consent someone to drag you inside. The entrance to his chamber is located along the zone wall to the right hand side once you hit the hillside.<BR><BR>The person with the key should arrive first so they can allow people inside. Once you are inside you can hold the door open by clicking the lever. Once everyone is buffed and groups are formed everyone in the raid should click the pedestal in the center of the room to be teleported down to Aerin`Dar's lair. Once you are down here you should not move around. Do not move toward Aerin`Dar.<BR><BR><b>The Fight</b><BR><BR>Aerin`Dar is a tricky fight. He hits for up to 1400 per attack, and is magic slowable. He does rampage, but infrequently. Once he is slowed his melee output is really low for a POP boss mob. He makes up for this with a 3000 point proc. This can drop a main tank quickly if it lands on him. This is the reason that you need a bard in the main tank group. The main tank needs to resist this proc. To make matters worse this proc also can slow the main tank. It can be cured with Abolish Disease, howver. Assign one shaman to chain cast Abolish Disease on the main tank for the duration of the fight.<BR><BR>The most dangerous attack of Aerin`Dar is his Glass Roar AE attack. This goes off every 36 seconds and does up to 700 points of direct damage, makes players run in fear and has a dot which does 3500 points of damage over 42 seconds. Luckily it only has a -150 modifier. If your magic resistance is maxed, this should not land on you. By placing a bard in the cleric and tank groups they should never be feared. The rest of your raid is likely to be feared from time to time, even with AE resistances going, unless you have an abundance of bards.<BR><BR>As if that wasn't enough to worry about every 10% of Aerin`Dar's hit points one of his golems will come to life and attack. These need to be crowd controlled, but they are immune to mesmerize and too high to charm. What we did was assign our enchanters to golem duty, with bards as the emergency backup. When a golem comes to life they root it in place away from the raid. If a golem manages to get by the enchanters then bards can highsun them back to their spawn position. If you are short on enchanters then you can use any other root capable class for crowd control. <BR><BR>Healing is an odd issue with Aerin`Dar. Different guilds handle this encounter in different ways. A four or more cleric complete healing chain is sufficient so long as you have bards in each of the clerics and main tanks group. If you plan on weaponshielding then you will want a bard in the weaponshielders group, as well. I personally, never bothered to weaponshield him. Some guilds elect to bypass the healing chain altogether, because of the risks of clerics being feared during the fight. The fight is short enough and he hits light enough that patch healing is sufficient for this encounter. It also helps because you can /assist heal if the main tank gets feared or dies and aggro begins to switch. The bottom line is that both solutions work, use what works best for your cast of characters.<BR><BR>Before pulling you will also want to work out an MGB healing chain. Unless you have a bard in every group then a good portion of your raid will be dying to DoTs during the encounter. MGB Spirit of the Wood and Ethereal Elixir rotations can keep the raid alive.<BR><BR>For rampage tank I always preferred to use a high hit point knight. Paladins and shadowknights can pull Aerin`Dar and if they get stunned they can Divine Aura and still get him back to camp. So long as they pull with a low damage spell they will be on the rampage list and you kill two birds with one stone. If they didn't burn divine aura during the pull they can use it during the fight if they get in trouble, and they still keep rampage. It is important for everyone to stay near melee range of Aerin`Dar and surround him to minimize push. Due to the fears and slow proc the main tank may lose aggro. The worst thing that can happen is for Aerin`Dar to begin ping ponging aggro. Another important thing is to MGB SoTW and EE before Aerin`Dar reaches camp. <BR><BR>Some guilds prefer to pull Aerin`Dar with two shaman (for Malos and Slow) and some have a paladin stun kite him until slows and debuffs are landed. All of these solutions work just fine. <BR><BR>Aerin`Dar has very few hit points. If things start to go wrong then go full damage and hope for the best. <BR><BR><b>Flagging</b><BR><BR>After Aerin`Dar dies you should begin ressing player in as quickly as possible. The Planar Projection despawns rather quickly and it takes time to kill the nine golems. So kill them after everyone is in and has hailed for the flag. If part of your raid already has the flag then they can start killing the golems while the others receive their flags. The golems do not despawn and must be killed.<BR><BR>To complete the flag everyone needs to zone in to Halls of Honor through the long winding tunnel in the Plane of Valor. This tunnel is found in a hole underneath where Aerin`Dar spawns. You open this passage by clicking on the platform. Once you are downstairs there are many more golems between you and the Halls of Honor. These can be killed but it is faster to pacify or harmony past them. Once you reach the end of the tunnel you can click in to complete the flag.<BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>Aerin`Dar drops two loots at a time. His loot ranges from pretty good (Honorary Amulet, Ring of Nobility) to poor. Once you have done him a time or two he is a very easy event, but the quality of his loot keeps him from being farmed.<br>
