This quest begins with Paldar Bladesoul in Sleeper's Tomb. He is found across from The Progenitor.<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul jolts his head in the direction of the voice. 'You. . . you're not an apparition are you? No, you can't be, that's what I am. Well, I'm glad to meet you, my name is Paldar Bladesoul. I don't suppose you've seen [Ulessa] since you've entered this tomb, have you?'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'Talk of a dragon almost as powerful as the creator herself?! A dragon that reigned supreme over all other dragons as they looked on and cowered in fear? Such beasts were unimaginably powerful and a group of three tireless adventurers would have no way to take on such a monster. We were honestly frightened by the story and we feared for anyone who tried to embark on a journey to find such a beast. But as I said, Milas paid no heed to our warnings and went off on his own anyway. We really had no idea what to think at that point, but we knew that we [had to do] something, before Milas got himself killed.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'He was our friend, though now we started to wonder if perhaps he had gotten too far into these explorative missions for his own good. Because he was our friend, we had to go after him to make sure he didn't do something he shouldn't. We followed his trail all over Norrath before finally finding out that he had made it to the [ancient tomb]. We found out where the tomb was and raced there to try and catch up to him.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'The walls shined dimly with a glacial velium bile the likes of which we had never seen before, not to mention the fact that they stood hundreds of feet high. I'm sure you felt the same way the first time you came here. The awe-inspiring architecture clouded our minds for a brief moment while we took it all in. Truly, we thought, Milas had stumbled onto something magnificent, albeit terrifying. We proceeded through the tomb carefully, avoiding the various golems and gargoyles that we encountered, all the while trying to locate any sign of Milas. We came to the door directly across from this room and my first thought was, ''What's in here?'' Without a moment's thought, we moved forth towards the [door] to open it.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'The door was gigantic and spanned the entire reach of the hall, from floor to ceiling. It took a great force to muster it open, and what we saw when we opened the door terrified us both. Beyond the door lay a humungous golem, over three times the size of the normal golems. We tried to close the door before it noticed us, but it was too late. It charged for us, the smaller golems following behind. I tried to fend off the huge golem to try and let my beloved wife escape. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't see whether or not she was able to escape, and for all I know, she could have died right then and there. As for me, I was quickly done in by the might progenitor, and have spent the last. . . eternity here [waiting for] Ulessa.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'I'm fairly certain that my beloved wife perished in this condemned tomb shortly after me, and while that makes me sad, I still have nothing but love for her and wish to find her. I've had plenty of time over the years to come up with a way to try and escape this prison I'm in so that I might be able to find her, but unfortunately the bond between my soul and this statue are far too strong to allow me to go anywhere. I've been waiting for quite some time for someone to come to aid me in my struggles, but I don't know anyone who will help.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'You will? That's fantastic, this might just work. I've concocted a way to put my spirit into a mortal body, at least long enough to search the tomb for any sign of Ulessa. I've come up with the perfect way to do this, and here's what it's going to take. I'm going to need you to bring me the lifeblood of several of the creatures in the tomb. I don't wish to upset the creatures or their spirits in this tomb, so all I'll say is that the more powerful beasts will be the ones that will have what I need. Gather the ten components for me and bring them back to me, I'll be able to use them to form the creature that I can join my spirit with.'<BR><BR>Paldar Bladesoul says 'You will?

We are not sure which items are all required at this point. <BR><BR>Our best guess is that you take six items that drop from bosses(although we don't know which six and combine them with the four class specific types for your class). For example Ethereal pieces are for rangers/rogues and Opalescent pieces are for mage types. These drop on the four Ancients. They come in silver, gold, etc and each Ancient drops one type.</font><BR><BR>Ulessa is also found in the Tomb and here's what she had to say from a <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=5643.topic&start=21&stop=28">Safehouse Thread</a>.<BR><BR>Awea says, 'Hail, Ulessa Bladesoul'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul looks up with you and sniffles. From the look of it, she has been sniffling like that for quite some time, though you're not sure how long. 'Oh, I'm sorry. I really don't mean to do this in front of you, it's just that I'm so very [unhappy].'<BR><BR>Awea says, 'why unhappy?'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'I'm unhappy because I haven't seen my husband in so long. We were so very in love, did everything together. But after the [incident], I never saw him again. It's like a pang in the back of my throat keeps causing me pain, but it's not a pain that is tangible or real, simply an emotional one. I feel so empty though without Paldar by my side.'<BR><BR>Awea says, 'what incident?'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'It all started because of a friend we once had. I say once had because he, like myself, is dead and gone. Milas was his name and he was an adventuresome little fellow, always looking to go out and do the most dangerous, most fanatically unheard of [things] to 'live' his life. His final endeavor was to come to this wretched place and find some lost sleeping dragon. Paldar and I tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen. We tried to tell him that he was just looking to get himself killed and that he should just let it go. But gnomes will be gnomes and he was a gnome. So just like a gnome, he was stubborn and wouldn't listen to a thing we had to say.'<BR><BR>Awea says, 'what things'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'He went off on his own after we pleaded with him not to go and came here, to this. . . this. . . PLACE! Ugh, it makes me so angry to think that he came here, and like the fools that we were, Paldar and I came after him to try and stop him. Did we stop to think that maybe we should just let him go? No, of course not, because that's not what friends do for their friends. Instead, we followed him and we got ourselves caught up in the [mess].'<BR><BR>Wargurdar says, 'what mess'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'What mess? I'll tell you what mess! We came here, of course terrified out of our minds. We saw the pretty sights, found out that there are huge golems and what not all over the place just waiting to grind you into velium dust, and then we came to a door. So tell me, what do you have to do when you come to a door, by default?'<BR><BR><BR>Vendrengha says, 'You checked to see if it was open'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'You open it, exactly! And that's just what we did, because we thought that perhaps Milas was behind the door. We didn't take into account that the door was twenty times larger than either of us, but we still opened it. Well, beyond that door we didn't find the gnome we had come here to find. Instead we found the creator golem, set in that room to create more golems for the ones that failed. I'm sure you can imagine [what happened] after that.'<BR><BR><BR>Vendrengha says, 'no I wont imagine, I'm going to ask you what happened then'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'We tried to close the door, hoping he wouldn't see us, but he did. He came charging after us, his feet making thunderous footsteps the entire way. My dear brave husband stood up to him and his newly built sentries to try and let me escape, and escape I did. That is, if you can really even call it an escape. I made it out of the eye of that creator beast and fumbled my through this forsaken tomb, barely missing the various [beasts] of burden along the way.'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'Golems, gargoyles, wyverns, spectres, you name it. Each time I saw one, I almost let out a scream that would have awoken the dead, if they hadn't been already I mean. I got turned around quite a few times too, going back and forth not remembering which way was up. But finally, I got to this statue behind me and looked at it. It was so still and gentle, yet it portrayed the epitome of [evil] that had slain my husband and most likely slain our friend Milas.'<BR><BR>Vendrengha says, 'what evil'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'The evil of the sleeping prismatic dragon; the evil that corrupted our little gnomish friend and brought us to our deaths. It was here that I stood, looking at this statue that I realized that it was hopeless for me to continue on. What was I trying to prove to myself anyway? That I could live on and survive? That I could find this infamous sleeper and tell him to shove off? None of that was going to be part of my story, none of it at all. Instead, while I was gawking at the marble dragon, a [shadow] engulfed me.'<BR><BR>Vendrengha says, 'what shadow'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'That's the very same thought that was going through my head at the time. Who's shadow could that be, or rather. . . what shadow could possibly be that large? When I turned, I had my answer. There, in front of me stood a lumbering golem, its bright velium skin glistening in front of me. It was at that point that I knew my life had been for naught, and that I would never see my husband again. So here I stand, an ever-lasting spirit of the tomb, [waiting] eternally to see my poor Paldar in the after life.'<BR><BR>Vendrengha says, 'what waiting'<BR><BR>Ulessa Bladesoul says 'Waiting? Who knows why I'm waiting. I guess I felt that someday, some live being like yourself could help me find my beloved. Perhaps allow us to reunite, if only for a moment. I had some kooky ideas about how to make that work, but I really didn't have a way to get the components I needed to make them work.' <BR><BR><font color=#ffff00>If anyone has any further information then please <a href="mailto:jcsmith@amazinghideaways.com">let us know</a> about it.</font><br><br>
