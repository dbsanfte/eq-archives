<br><b><font color=#d2d200>Description:</b></font><br>- Very fast respawns in his room. As a result you will likely get some difficult adds during the fight if you do not kill him quickly.<BR>- Hits for up to 2096 per attack.<BR>- Procs at Magic Based (-150) 3500 point direct damage + 3 second stun and root.<BR>- Rampage is bugged and lands only on the main tank.<BR>- Disease Slowable. Also magic slowable, but much more difficult to land.<BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>Lord Mithaniel Marr is a 3-7 day spawn. He can be tracked from the zone in, or you can invis up to his room and peek in. If he is up he will be standing at the back end of his room. He is huge and hard to miss. He may or may not be targetable.<BR><BR>If he is targetable then someone has recently cleared the mini-bosses and failed to him. You can bring the raid in and kill him without worrying about the mini-bosses if that is the case. <BR><BR>If he is untargetable then you need to kill Ralthazor, the Champion of Marr to make him targetable. Ralthazor spawns in the middle of Mithaniel Marr's room. If he is not up then you will need to wait on him to respawn. He is a three day spawn.<BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>You need a six cleric complete heal chain for a good shot at this event. If you have a 10k tank and feel lucky, then you might be able to get away with a four cleric chain. You need a solid main tank for this. A 1700 ac and 9000 hit point tank should suffice. I would want to try this with less than an 8500 hit point and 1600 ac tank. Mithaniel Marr's melee output and proc are heavy enough that you really need as good of a tank as you can get.  You will also need at least two feign death pullers. I'd recommend not trying without three. One of your pullers may die during the process, and the mobs are on fast timers. You need to have at least one backup.<BR><BR>As for actual number of players, it really depends on your players. We have killed Mithaniel Marr with 42 players and a four cleric CH chain. We also had a 10.5k hit point tank on that trip and it was a tough battle. I've seen him wipe others who have tried him with 80 time and time again, and he wiped us once with 60. If your have a solid main tank and cleric chain, you should not have much of a problem with him. If not, then it's going to be really rough.<BR><BR>This raid happens inside the Temple of Marr. At least 85% of your raid will need to be flagged for this zone in order to piggy back other players in. You obtain the flag for this zone by defeating Aerin`Dar and all three of the Halls of Honor trials.<BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>The best place to gather is behind the fountain in the first room inside of the building in the Temple of Marr. If you stay along the wall behind fountain, then it is a completely safe spot. You will need to invis to there. Piggy backs should probably meet in the graveyard in the Halls of Honor, rather than near the entrance to the Temple of Marr. If their invisibility drops near the entrance they will aggro a lot of bad guys. Even worse if someone trains a mob that sees invisibility there then you can lose all your piggies quickly. <BR><BR>Everyone in the raid needs to have their magic resistance buffed. Everyone in the raid should also be shrunk. You will need to set up a six cleric complete healing chain for a good shot at this. You will need to assign two players to off-tank here. You should never need the second off-tank if your pullers are doing a good job, but have him assigned just in case. Paladins work nicely here. You can mesmerize the yard trash on the way, but they are very resistant. Paladins can stun them until enchanters are able to mesmerize. Some guids (mine included) would just off tank all of the adds rather than mesmerizing. It really depends on your make-up. If you only have one enchanter and he keeps dying from Wrulons aggroing him then you might want to off-tank them all.<BR><BR><b>Getting There</b><BR><BR>The Temple of Marr is a very small zone. From the entrance if you enter the building and take a left at the fountain you will come to a hallway. Turn right at that hallway until you hit a corner. Then follow that corner around to the left and then the right and we typically set up at the end of that hall. <BR><BR>There are three mini-bosses in Mithaniel Marr's room, along with several Wrulons. The mini-bosses come with two wrulons at a time, but you can split them. I always preferred to pull these out to the hallway, because it gave our feign death pullers room to operate. You are going to get at least one wave of respawn, and likely two before you have all three dead. The mini-bosses themselves are moderately tough and you will want to be sure that you get them alone. They all rampage, and Ralthazor (the Froglook) roots in addition to that. Ralthazor is the toughest of the three and hits for up to 1600 per attack.<BR><BR>Upon killing Ralthazor Mithaniel Marr will become targetable. At this point you should move the raid inside of his room to the corner on the near right hand side. Leave the actual corner open for the main tank, and everyone else should stay on the right hand wall, as close to the corner as possible. <BR><BR><b>The Fight</b><BR><BR>The Mithaniel Marr fight relies is heavily dependant on the gear of your main tank, the number of your clerics, and the quality of your feign death pullers. The Wrulons in this room are on approximately 12 minute spawns, and they spawn in pairs. You should have already cleared the three mini-bosses before entering this room. The trick now becomes spacing the Wrulon spawns apart properly and then having a little luck in puling Mithaniel Marr.<BR><BR>Before we get started on any of this we need to note that the Wrulons in this room, and Mithaniel Marr himself have huge aggro radiuses. Everyone needs to stay close to the wall and near the corner. Keep the corner itself clear for the main tank to corner tank Mithaniel Marr when he is pulled. It is important that he is shrunk for this, as well. Once you are moved in you should wait on respawn. Two Wrulons spawn in aggro range of this corner (even if you are wedged in to corner). Wait for them to respawn and quickly kill them. Then wait 3-5 minutes (depending on your DPS). Then clear the other Wrulons in order from near to far. Then clear those on Mithaniel Marr's steps, but do not pull Mithaniel Marr yet. Your goal at this point is to clear the steps, and to clear the two with him as much as possible. If you somehow manage to get Mithaniel Marr solo during this period try to keep him there (get up and re-feign as needed) until the raid is ready for him.<BR><BR>While clearing those near Mithaniel Marr and while trying to separate Mithaniel Marr is is dire that your pulllers feign death in the opposite corner that the raid is set up at. I recommend setting up the raid in the near right hand corner from entrance. If that is where you set up then the monks/shadowknights should be feigning death in the far left hand corner. This is EXTREMELY important. Do not feign death in the middle of the room or Mithaniel Marr will aggro your raid. It is also important that when the tagger (second feign death puller) tags Mithaniel Marr or Wrulons from that corner that he does not pull them through the center, but also that he does not pull them too close to the entrance hallway, or you may aggro those outside. Just keep a 10 foot or so clearance from that wall.<BR><BR>You may wonder why you shouldn't have pulled Mithaniel Marr yet? Before pulling him you need to wait for respawn on the two Wrulons near the raid. After they spawn kill them and attempt to pull Mithaniel Marr. By waiting on them to respawn we know that we now have 3-5 minutes to pull Mithaniel Marr without worrying about the other Wrulons respawning on top of us. This is because we waited for 3-5 minutes before pulling the second set of Wrulons after killing those in the corner. We also then know that when we get Mithaniel Marr in to the corner, we should have plenty of time to kill him without that corner respawning on top of us. He has a good number of hit points, you don't want respawns on top of you during the fight.<BR><BR>Splitting Mithaniel Marr can be an exercise in patience. If you can't get him split in 3-5 minutes you will need to wait for everything to respawn and clear it again. I've been on raids where it took us close to an hour to split him, and I've been on others where he came on the first attempt. It relies heavily on luck, but also on the abilities of your pullers. You need to be able to react quickly when he is alone and bring him to the raid.<BR><BR>Once he gets to camp you should weaponshield tank him. That is very important. Mithaniel Marr hits for 2096 per attack and procs a 3500 point direct damage spell that also stuns and roots your target. Furthermore his rampage is bugged and instead of landing on the second person on his aggro list, it will land on the main tank. If you do the math here then you realize he can drop a defensive warrior very quickly, even a well geared one. You need him slowed and debuffed before you get your warrior on to him. Not to mention, that you need a solid aggro lock. Mithaniel Marr is slowed easily with disease based slow. You can land magic slow, but it is extremely difficult to. If you attempt to land it be sure to stand in melee range so he does not ping-pong if you get aggro. <BR><BR>It is important that you corner him as soon as possible. If the main tank get's rooted outside of the corner, things can get ugly. You need to get him cornered for two reasons. The main one is that you need the rest of the melee to be behind Mithaniel Marr. He can riposte a player for 2096 and get a 3500 point proc off. That can send many light tanks in to low hit point aggro, and you lose a melee. The other reason is that if you don't have him cornered and everyone else is hitting from behind while your main tank is rooted, Mithaniel Marr can be pushed past the main tank and he loses sight and aggro. Mithaniel Marr has a huge model and rangers can hit him with bows even when he is cornered.<BR><BR>You really need to have a six cleric complete heal chain for this at the minimum. We've done this fight with a four cleric chain and even once with a three cleric chain and a 10.5k hit point tank. On both those attempts though we had our main tank drop on multiple occassions and only Divine Intervention saved him. With a six cleric chain, bard in main tank group and a 9k hit point tank with maxed AA skills you should have no problems with this encounter. If you don't have a solid tank or a 6+ cleric healing chain then this encounter is going to cause you nightmares. If your main tank can't hold aggro you are likewise going to be in trouble. Mithaniel Marr can one round most other players rather easily.<BR><BR>If your main tank and healing chain can hold up then this is a very easy fight. There is no AE. If you timed respawns properly then it's basically just Mithaniel Marr or your main tank, who falls first. If your main tank dies you need the second tank to AE taunt quickly and everyone else needs to back off for him to get an aggro lock. Ideally this is a one tank fight, but tank switching can also work. We tried this encounter once short-handed with a four cleric healing chain and the only bard was in the main tanks group. When the main tank fell the other tanks were being eaten up by his proc, and the healing chain was too short to make up for it. We tank switched about 10 times during the fight and it managed to work. AE Taunt is important though. As soon as the main tank dies Mithaniel Marr is going to start one shotting the other meleers.<BR><BR>One last note. If your get adds during the fight you can mesmerize them, but they are very magic resistant. If this happens paladins should chain stun until the enchanters can get them mesmerized.<BR><BR><b>Flagging</b><BR><BR>The Planar Projection spawns in the middle of the room as of a few patches ago. This can cause some problems because of the speed that the Wrulons respawn in the room. You most likely are going to need to clear some Wrulons to reach him. So resurrect players quickly, clear the Wrulons and get your flags. The Planar Projection despawns in about 5 minutes.<BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>Lord Mithaniel Marr's loots are very good for the effort. If you have a force capable of killing him, then it is an easy encounter with high quality drops. This includes Flowing Thought IV, Vengeance 2 and 41% haste items, a 16/19 piercer and one of the most sought after druid scimitars in the game. The only loot which is disapointing is the Bow of Contortion. He drops two items on each kill. <br>
