This information was obtained from a <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12226.topic">Safehouse Thread</a> by Finnien of the Crusaders of Ro. It results in teh key to Aerin'Dar's lair which is the key to opening up the Halls of Honor.<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>Find Johon Popoah and hail him twice. I forgot to get the dialogue for this. Then go see Paralin, and hail him. Both are in the tents near zone in.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'You're either [brave], or your [stupid].'<BR><BR>You say, 'I am brave'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'That you are. Perhaps you'd be interested in helping our [company].'<BR><BR>You say, 'I will help your company'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'We're a part of the Battalion of Marr. We're soldiers from Che Virtuson. We were dispatched to this part of the Plane of Valor to eliminate an age old target. Unfortunately, due to some recent events our mission has been placed on hold and our [squad] has been asked to remain behind.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What squad?'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'We are apart of Ducee Tapferson. Our squad is known for our bravery. We were successful in capturing this [razorfiend] earlier today. You've shown some bravery as well my friend and that is the reason I request your [assistance].'<BR><BR>You say, 'What about that razorfiend'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'These vile beasts live in the caves west of here.'<BR><BR>You say, 'I will provide you with assistance'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'Many of us here are anxious to leave. Many wish to regroup with the rest of our company. Other wish to go back to the Halls to complete the [Trials].'<BR><BR>You say, 'What trials?'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'The Trials are overseen by the Heroes of Marr. It's these Trials that allow us to rise in rank. Only those who have passed the trials are able to enter the Temple of Marr. Now if you wish to aid us I must ask you to do a few [things].'<BR><BR>You say, 'What things?'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'You must find the Master Sergeant and tell him that you are here to aid the cause.'<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>You must now head directly to Master Sergeant Aaramis Darylyn. He is upstairs in the building past the cave to left of zone in. If you do not head directly there he will not respond to you.</font><BR><BR>You say, 'I am here to aid the cause'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln looks you over and says in a deep voice 'What could you possibly do to aid our cause. Perhaps you think you can slay [Aerin`Dar] himself?' The Master Sergeant begins to laugh uncontrollably.' I suggest you go back to whoever filled your head with this nonsense and stop wasting my time.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What is Aerin'dar'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I don't have time to explain the glass dragon to you. Leave before I get angry.'<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'I'm sorry the Master Sergeant was unable to help you. Perhaps you should [prove] yourself before you attempt to jump 'into the fire' so to speak.'<BR><BR>You say, 'How shall I prove myself'<BR><BR>Paralin Notion says 'We've been running into a lot of problems lately with the razorfiends and the planarian larvae. Many soldiers have been getting sick because of the infestations that they cause. Capture the hearts of a razorfiend, a crystalline spider and a planarian larvae and bring them back to me. Our squad had enough problems capturing this small razorfiend here. This will become your first so called 'Trial' Finnien. It should be enough to prove your worth.'<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>You need to collect a heart from a Razorfiend, a Planarian Larvae(only the ones in Plane of Valor drop these not the ones in Plane of Disease) and a Crystalline Spider.<BR><BR>Once you have collected the three hearts and turned them in...</font><BR><BR>Paralin Notion looks at you with surprise. 'Very good my friend. You've definitely proven yourself. Find the Master Sergeant. He should be able to help you this time.<BR><BR>You gain experience!!<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail, Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I heard what you did for Paralin Notion. That's quite a noble feat indeed. Perhaps we can use your help. However, you'll need to talk to the Captain first. Afterall, I can't have you walking in the [glass lair] without permission.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What glass lair'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'It's the prison that [Aerin`Dar] has been encased in for many generations.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What about Aerin'dar'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Aerin`Dar is the crystalline dragon who once roamed the Plane of Valor. During a severe rainstorm it was struck down to the very core of it's being. The mighty Aerin`Dar fell from the sky and landed in what is now known as the Glassy Wasteland. Planarian larvae began to infest it's body eventually turning it's pure heart to evil. Our [company] was dispatched to this region of Valor to eliminate the threat.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What company'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'My squad of men are a part of Che Virtuson. However, we specifically are a part of Ducee Buled. We fall under the command of Captain Ryglot. Our [mission], for the time being, is simple. But we've run into some problems lately.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What mission'<BR><BR>Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Not to fast Finnien. You'll have to speak to the Captain about that. I'm not at liberty to divulge that information at this time. That information is classified. I can tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.' Aaramis laughs. 'Go to Captain Ryglot and he'll be able to fill you in with all the details.'<BR><BR>Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I am very [busy] at the moment. Perhaps you should come back at another time Finnien.'<BR><BR>You say, 'Why are you busy'<BR><BR>Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I can't go into any great detail, but the Crystalline Globe was taken from our command structure. Its believed to have been separated into three pieces. Unfortunately, we're having a lot of trouble relocating it. Perhaps you'd like to [help].'<BR><BR>You say, 'I will help'<BR><BR>Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'That's good to hear Finnien. I wish we had more soldiers like yourself willing to help. I'm going to need you to locate the missing pieces of the globe and bring them back to me. After you've acquired the pieces perhaps you'd be able to rally enough people to lend us a hand with another [mission] objective we've been unable to fulfill do to our diminished numbers.'<BR><BR>You say, 'What mission?'<BR><BR>Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, I can't go into any details as to our main purpose is, but one of our missions was to exterminate the crystalline dragon. However, due to our company being split we are unable to go forward with this part of the operation. It has been placed on hold, pending the outcome of the [war].'<BR><BR>You say, 'What war?'<BR><BR>Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help rally some people together I may be able to release some more information to you.'<BR><BR><font color=#dddd00>One crystalline orb piece drops off of the Luminii Crawler, one drops off frogs near the bridgehouse, and one drops off of the skellies. Once the Captain recieves the three pieces of the orb, he gives you back the completed orb, which is the key to Aerin'Dar's lair.<BR><BR>Aerin'Dar hits for approximately 1400, is slowable, and has an AE on a -150 MR check, that does 3k dd, and 45% melee slow. He also has nine mobs in his room that add as you fight him, and are level 63 and mezzable by the Sleep spell.</font><br><br>
