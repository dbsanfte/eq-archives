    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Character 
    Creation:</font></p>
    </font></b><font SIZE="2">
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The character creation of the 
    magician is one of the most hotly debated topics within the class' 
    community. The choices are Human, Erudite, Dark Elf, High Elf or Gnome. I 
    will start right away by saying that all of these races will make a fine 
    magician, and it is sometimes quite a lot better to make your decision of 
    race based more on your personal preference than for statistics. Each has 
    its advantages and disadvantages. Humans are the only race that will not 
    make an excellent magician for a few simple reasons. First of all, they 
    don't have any higher than average starting statistics. For a magician, 
    Intelligence is the most important stat of them all and Humans start with 
    the least of all of the options. Secondly they are blind at night, 
    possessing no night vision whatsoever. Although this is not a huge deal, at 
    the beginning of the game you will find that this is extremely frustrating. 
    Sharing that lack of night vision is the Erudite. However the &quot;high man&quot; 
    counters this disadvantage by starting with the highest inherent 
    intelligence stat of all of the available classes. Statistically, this is 
    the best magician to go with. Another disadvantage that must be noted is 
    that the erudite starting zone is what most would define as horrible and the 
    rest would agree is not ideal. Next in line is the Dark Elf who has the 
    number two spot for intelligence and also has strong agility stats. 
    Furthermore, Dark elves have Ultravision which lets them see almost 
    perfectly in the dark. A huge disadvantage of this race is that they are 
    hated in most of the world. Gnomes have slightly less intelligence than the 
    Dark Elves, but are good. They are small creatures (which is good if you 
    play on a PvP server) and make very good magicians (my gnome mage retired at 
    level 56). Lastly, there is the high elven magician. Although their 
    Intelligence stat isn't exceptional, it is noticeably above average and the 
    royal elves also enjoy the benefits of high charisma (make more money at 
    lower levels selling stuff). They are very well liked around the world 
    except in evil towns, despite their arrogance. They have night vision and 
    have Greater Faydark as their newbie zone -- one of the best in my opinion.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">So the question becomes which of 
    these choices to pick. I would suggest either a Dark Elf, a Gnome or a High 
    Elf, although the human and Erudite can do very well. Humans and Erudites 
    share one feature that I cannot stand -- blindness! Humans have sub-par 
    stats and while Erudites blow away all other classes in terms of Intellect, 
    they start way out of the way of everything and enjoy very poor stats other 
    than intelligence and wisdom.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">One of the most important 
    features of character creation is picking a race which will fit your and 
    your character's persona and that you will enjoy. If you enjoy being a bit 
    on the evil side then Dark Elf is a great choice and is perhaps the best all 
    around choice. If you like being just and good, or love role playing 
    characters that spout off holier than thou speeches randomly for kicks then 
    a High Elf will suite you very well. If you want to be a neutral, fun, tiny 
    character (with a big nose) then a gnome would be a great choice as well</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Stats wise, no matter what race 
    you are, place all the points you can into INT and then place the rest into 
    STR. The reason we place the rest into Strength is because really, the other 
    stats aren't going to matter very much. A higher strength will help you 
    carry slightly more for the rest of the game and will help you hit a bit 
    harder when you are whacking newbie monsters with a stick / staff / club / 
    dagger / insert choice caster weapon here.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">The 
    Magician's Role:</font></p>
    </b><i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1 to 
    4:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Levels one to four are the same 
    for most classes. You will find yourself a weapon, cast to pull monsters and 
    whack / cast them down. Rinse and repeat. This will be a very quick portion 
    of your life.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4 to 
    11:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">These are some of the toughest 
    levels for a magician. They have pets and can begin their careers as 
    excellent soloers. However, their pets haven't yet come into their own yet 
    and are still relatively weak. You will still have to &quot;help&quot; them by tanking 
    a bit.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 12 to 
    50:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You have bind. Go out and explore 
    the world. During this stage you are arguably the highest damage dealer in a 
    group (non-twinked). You combine a very strong pet with your attack spells 
    being the second strongest in the game. In a pinch you can take down any 
    monster you are fighting fairly handily. You are an excellent soloer in 
    these levels and in groups act as a damage dealer and utility caster (most 
    of those summons are useless. A few are very good) .</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 51 to 
    60:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">At the higher levels the 
    magician's role changes and is not always completely clear. Wizards pull far 
    ahead of the magician at higher levels and this continues up until level 60. 
    Druids start to be able to go nuke for nuke with the magician at these 
    levels (apparently Verant decided they should be the second best nukers in 
    the game, not us) and to make this worse the power of the magician pet 
    starts going down. While before the magician pet was an extremely strong 
    creature it becomes more of a tactical aid than a reliable tank. The mage 
    epic weapon is extremely hard to get, however the spell you receive allows 
    you to create a weapon which summons the epic pet -- a very formidable 
    force. There is a huge power difference between a magician that is epic and 
    one who is not.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Magician 
    PvE Tactics:</font></p>
    </b><i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1 to 
    3:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">There is no real tactics for this 
    level other than where to fight. For High Elves and Gnomes the best place to 
    go at level 2 is the first area of Butcherblock near the greater feydark 
    zone line. There are skunks here who are level 2 and will bring you're level 
    up quickly. They also drop glands that are worth about a gold and a half. By 
    the time you reach level 4 you will have enough money to buy all of your 
    spells. Dark Elves and humans should hunt in the Commonlands, mostly the 
    eastern ones where there are lots of low level critters of all levels to 
    fry, burn and smack. Erudites should get to another place (such as the 
    Freeport or Felwithe areas) as soon as they can. Friendly wizards and druids 
    should be able to make this an easy prospect.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4 to 
    12:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You get your pet, and these 
    levels you will start to see how powerful an ally this pet will be. Make 
    hotkeys for the important pet commands as follows:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet attack <i>or</i> /pet kill 
    -- these commands will make your pet attack your target.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet follow me -- this will make 
    your pet follow you until it is aggroed by a monster. When the agro is up it 
    will return to you</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet sit down -- this will make 
    the pet stationary and it will regenerate health quicker. If it is aggroed 
    it will defend itself and when the fight is finished it will sit wherever it 
    ends up.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet back off -- this attempts to 
    back your pet off a target. This can be used when a creature is being 
    mezzed, when it is taking too much aggro, etc.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet report health -- the pet 
    will tell you its health status as a percentage</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">/pet get lost -- the pet commits 
    suicide. Very sad event. Casting reclaim energy is often preferable.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Play with your pet and you will 
    learn its strengths and weaknesses. At these levels you will find that you 
    will need to help your pet out by taking damage sometimes. </p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 12 to 
    50</font></i><font color="#D2D200">:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">These levels are very soloable 
    but you will begin to find that grouping is a lot more fun and productive. 
    You are a very strong member of the group and will probably be doing most of 
    the damage in the fight. Gradually leave home and go out and explore the 
    world. You will have a lot of fun playing in different settings with 
    different people! Find a guild! Do some quests. This will be the majority of 
    your character's leveling life! Your tactics in these levels will be to 
    balance your pet's attack with your casting skills. You will want your pet 
    to keep the monster's attention while you can nuke enough to kill it before 
    it kills your pet. In a group situation your pet represents the majority of 
    your damage output. It can be used as a crowd control mechanism and your 
    mana is best used in emergency situations. You will summon bandages and food 
    for your group and will become the best friend of rangers everywhere with 
    your summon arrows spell.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Learning to control your pet is 
    of great importance because in the later levels a stray pet in a dungeon 
    will get you and your friends killed. Many groups out and out ban pets in 
    high level situations because of this and you will have to either suck it up 
    or convince them that you will be able to control it well enough.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 50 to 
    60</font></i><font color="#D2D200">:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">These levels are similar to the 
    upper 40's and although you will see a decline in your relative power you 
    will still be a strong force. You will have a variety of useful new pet 
    features (the backstabbing water pet is very very nice) and some 
    class-defining utility spells (Call of the Hero is a good example). You will 
    live and learn in these levels. Getting your epic weapon will be a 
    challenge, but will arguably be a necessary challenge. Although you can get 
    it as early as level 46 this is as good as impossible unless you have a 
    large amount of sway with an extremely powerful guild.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Magician 
    PvP Tactics:</font></p>
    </b><i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1 to 
    3:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">PvP at this level isn't PvP. A 
    bunch of level 4 mages / wizards / etc with doubly strong spells just kill 
    you. Ignore them and get yourself to level 4.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4 to 
    7:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Send your pet in and nuke your 
    heart out. Try to be hard to find and if versus a melee move around and let 
    your pet tag them. when the melee fights your pet nuke em more.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 8 to 
    43:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You now have nukes, bolts and 
    shocks. The shocks will interrupt enemy casting and the lower level ones are 
    hard to resist when you get up in level. A basic strategy versus a caster is 
    to use a low level shock to interrupt their spell every time and let your 
    pet do most of the damage. when they are close to dead finish them off with 
    the big nukes.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Remember that with Bolts you have 
    range on your side. If you are initiating the attack, open up with a few 
    long range bolts. A nice thing to do is to face away and fire the nukes. you 
    can get a few off before the first hits and it could be enough to bring them 
    down to a dangerous HP level. Then just send your pet in to finish them off.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 44 to 
    60:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Various strategies are going to 
    apply here. By now pets take a long time to kill things (although vs. 
    casters pets can still be very effective, especially the earth pet's root 
    (if it goes through) and the 50+ water pet's backstab</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Resistances, especially magic 
    resistance are very high meaning your shocks will be less effective. Bolts 
    are still effective. Scars of Sigil is IMHO one of the best PvP spells in 
    the game. Use the aforementioned aiming away bolt trick with this fast 
    caster... cast 4-5 of them and by the time they know what's happening they 
    will be dead.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">General:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You will learn the best 
    strategies as you play and every situation is different. Mages will not be 
    the most successful in a duel situation. As a PK'er they are superb and they 
    can defend themselves in a pinch. Never neglect resistances even if your 
    opponents are low. Remember to always cast your resistance buff and always 
    try to malise your opponent down. As long as you are adaptable and learn 
    what spells work best against which opponents (you will find on the Zek's 
    that you are always fighting the same people), you will do well in PvP as a 
    magician.</p>

    Scribe and cast it for your Orb of Mastery.</p>

    </b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">In this section I will list the 
    important' spells of the level in the order that they should be bought. A 
    brief description will also be included. The first 3 or 4 spells in each 
    level category should be purchased right away.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) reclaim energy - get mana 
    back by &quot;unsummoning&quot; your pet (necissary later in the game)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Summon Food - summon a loaf 
    of break</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Summon Water - summon a 
    flask of water</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Elementalkin Earth - Your 
    first earth pet. As you go to level 7ish HP becomes very important wiht your 
    pet, and the earth pet will serve you best in that way</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Burn - your next damage 
    spell. DD for 11-13dmg</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Gate - return to your bind 
    point</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Summon Brass Choker - summon 
    a focus item to conserve components (useful as you summon a lot of pets)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Summon Bandages - makes you a 
    melee class's good friend</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Other Elementalkin's - Your 
    first water, fire and air pets</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Summon Wisp - summons a 
    lightstone. Higher priority for Erudite and Human magicians.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Sense Summoned - helpful 
    for later when fighting elementals is very efficient.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ix) Fire Flux - First AE spell. 
    Not necisary at this level.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 8: 
    (Level 8 is a very important level to get all the spells up to (x)-(xi))</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Elementaling Earth - Still 
    the best pet for the level IMHO. HP's are still paramount especially 
    considering killing yellows is still very possible (air with high agility 
    will still get hit if the monster is higher level)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Flame Bolt - your first bolt 
    spell. Does a max of 47 DMG.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Shock of Blades - your 
    first shock spell. Does about 35 DD. Also interupts casting.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Invisibility - lets you be 
    invisible. VERY IMPORTANT</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Lesser shielding - More HP, 
    More AC, More MR. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Renew Elements - Pet heal 
    for 50hp</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Staff of Tracing - give it 
    to your pet to ensure slightly higher damage output.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Shield of Fire - Damage 
    shield for 5-6 dmg. Extremely important to cast on your pet.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ix) Summon Linnon Mantle - focus 
    item to increase buff duration (saves a bit of mana)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(x) Other Pet Spells</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(xi) Eye of Zomm - scouting eye. 
    Useful for exploring unknown areas. No longer is aggroed.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(xii) Dimentional Pocket - 
    Summons a 4-slot bag. Advantage is that everything in it becomes weightless. 
    Disadvantage is that when you log or go LD everything inside it goes *poof*. 
    Use with extreme caution.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 12:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Elemental of your Choice - 
    Start playing around with them. Find one that fits your playing style. You 
    will want to start buyign all of your Elementals</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Bind Affinity - changes your 
    bind point. Essential to travelling</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Burnout - pet only buff 
    which adds haste, str and ac</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Ward Summoned - Efficient DD 
    spell vs. summoned monsters. (35-41 dmg)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Other Elemental Spells</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon Tarnished Bauble - 
    decreases agro on your DD spells by ~10%.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Other spells in the level 
    (none are particularly important)</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 16: 
    (By this level you should be buying every spell every level -- just a matter 
    of the order)</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Minor Summoning of Choice - 
    Again get your favourite but play will all of them. By now your pet should 
    represent a good portion of your damage output and you shouldn't be going 
    anywhere without one.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Shock of Flame - Newest 
    dammage spell. Good stuff at 97dmg, especially considering there were no all 
    purpose DD's last spell round.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Shielding - More HP, More 
    AC, more MR. Again, very good idea to have this on ya at all times.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Phantom Leather - increases 
    HP regen slightly, and improves AC.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) See Invisible - finally see 
    your air pet at all times!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon Heatstone - for 
    blindies this gives you infravision. You are now caught up eyesight wise. 
    Everyone else... don't bother</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Summon tiny ring - Focus 
    item to reduce casting time on some spells (non-dd)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Other spells this level. - 
    Misc. usefullness.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 20:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Lesser Summonings - Yes. All 
    of them. From now on.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Bolt of Flame - 148-152 dmg 
    isn't too shoddy!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Renew Summoning - 220hp 
    restored to your pet can help.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Shield of Flame - Damage 
    sheild for 8-9dmg and a +15SV Fire to boot! Cast on you, your pet, your best 
    friend and your worst enemy. Love for all!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Elemental Shield - Boost Cold 
    and Fire Resistance up by 20 each. You are going to be fighting tougher and 
    tougher casting mobs as you get higher up in levels and without good 
    resistances you are toast.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Expulse Summoned - 98 dmg 
    vs. Summoned monsters. Sure you can do a lot more damage with your new bolt, 
    but Expulse is a lot more efficient than Bolt of Flame. Also, Bolt of Flame 
    won’t do much good against monsters in say, Solusek’s Eye.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Summon item spells - There 
    are a few excellent ones this level. Summon waterstone is a good spell to 
    get because if fighting in a water area having an instant enduring breath is 
    a lifesaver. There is a new focus item to increase your damage output (Jade 
    Bracelet) and you get your first arrow summoning spell. Arrow summoning is 
    wicked for your ranger friends! They will appreciate the free arrows. The 
    summoning spells which are questionable are the spear and armor summonings. 
    Both of these are good only if you are going into a newbie zone. The leather 
    armor is nice to give away to some helpless newbie, but it unfortunately 
    poofs when they log. The spear is laughable but looks cool when wielded by 
    your pet.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Rain of Fire - your first 
    alright Rain spell. For those hunting multiple orcs in Highpass this spell 
    could be useful. If you have several monsters very mad at a tank unload this 
    ON THE TANK. Yes. On the tank. This will do 2 things. A) it will reduce agro 
    because you aren’t directly casting on a monster. B) you will hit all 
    monsters surrounding him. This spell has the potential to do about 600 
    damage (assuming all 3 waves hit 4 monsters for full damage).</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 
    24(From now on there are some spells which you will need to research. I will 
    not go into the details of researching here, as that is for another guide. 
    You can either do the research yourself or get a higher level mage to do it 
    for you and pay them)(Another note about level 24 is that your spells will 
    look different, having many more particle effects than before. Yay!):</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Summonings - Yes, again. All 
    of them. Fire will be tougher to get because it is research.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Shock of Spikes - This new 
    Shock spell is the next in your line of good damage spell-interrupting DD’s. 
    It will hit for approx. 172-176 and should become your staple attack spell.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Major Shielding - the next 
    in your line of self-buffing spells. This one, like its predecessors adds 
    more HP and more AC as well as better MR than the ones before it.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Everfount / Cornucopia - 
    These two spells summon 20 water and 20 food respectively. It makes your 
    life oh so much easier than casting summon spells 20 times every time you 
    enter the game. A must have for any mage.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Malise - This spell decreases 
    all resistances but disease by 20 points. It is a very useful spell, however 
    it also generates a lot of agro. Use it with care, but learn to use it 
    effectively often!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon silver choker - This 
    is another focus item to conserve expendable components. Although it once 
    again only gives a 10% chance, it works on all spells from level 49 and 
    lower.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Flame Flux - this is 
    another AE spell that magicians get. This type is called a Point Blank or 
    PBAE spell. This means that it hits all monsters close to the magician. This 
    is very dangerous when used against a group of mobs because they could 
    easily all turn on you. Best used to finish off multiple weak mobs or to 
    impress newbies by killing 12 bats at once!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Staff of Runes - This is a 
    useless weapon being 9 dmg / 36 delay. However, the nice thing about it is 
    the charge of cancel magic that comes along with it. If you think you might 
    need an emergency manaless cancel magic then you should probably have one of 
    these sitting in your inventory as a backup. Heck its not lore (as far as I 
    can remember) so summon a D-pocket and stick a few of them in there. Will be 
    weightless and full of summoned items that don’t matter much! :)</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 29:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Greater Summonings - Get em 
    all (getting the point yet?) Earth and Water are both research only so you 
    will have to pay a bit more for them.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Burnout II - an upgrade to 
    burnout. This raises the AC, Strength and Haste of your pet by significantly 
    more than the first burnout.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Inferno Shield - Next 
    damage shield. It does 13-15 damage over the time that you will be using 
    this shield. It also adds 20 to fire resistance to boot. Putting this in 
    perspective, if your tank(s) get hit 30 times in a fight (very reasonable at 
    this level) this spell will do just under 400 “bonus” damage to the monster. 
    For 80 mana this is a very efficient spell. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Dismiss Summoned - 140 to 
    162 damage versus summoned opponents. This spell becomes important because 
    it is the only DD spell you get at this spell level. This means that the lvl 
    29 to lvl 34 stretch is most efficiently done fighting summoned monsters. 
    This is an extremely effective spell if you can find a good number of 
    opponents that are vulnerable to this spell.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Phantom Chain - This is the 
    next spell in the line of Self Only AC buffing, regeneration increasing 
    spells that magicians get. This one increases the AC from between 12 and 14 
    and increases health regeneration by 2HP per tick (6 seconds)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Expedience - This spell is a 
    J-Boots buff for pets. Very helpful in making sure your pet doesn’t’ get 
    lost too far behind you.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Rain of Spikes - along with 
    earth pet’s root this spell is possibly your ticket through level 29 to 34. 
    If all three waves hit your target, you will do 273 damage to the monster. 
    (91 per wave). Very risky, but possibly necessary as you go through these 
    difficult levels.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Summon item spells - As 
    normal there are a few useful summons and a few not-so-useful summons. 
    Summon Coldstone summons an item which grants ultravision to the holder of 
    it. This is particularly useful for blind races. Leather mantle summons the 
    upgraded buff duration focus item and phantom chain allows you to summon up 
    a set of chain armour for your favourite newbie. The Chain is also helpful 
    for chain-classes during corpse recovery in a pinch. Finally, sword of 
    runes. Only real use of the sword is to give to your pet if you are fighting 
    summoned creatures.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 34:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Minor Conjurations - All of 
    them (once again!). Fire and Air need to be reasearched. Sorry :(</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Blaze - Finally a new, 
    rather powerful DD spell to bring us back up to date. It hits for a max of 
    276-295 and is fire based.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Cinder Bolt - 319 to 336 
    damage max makes us a damage force to be reckoned with. This is a nice 
    upgrade to get, although it is disappointing that it is also a fire based 
    spell.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Greater Shielding - The next 
    upgrade. You know the drill by now. More HP, more AC, more MR</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Nullify Magic - Upgrade to 
    cancel magic. Basically a stronger version with a better chance to do its 
    thing with less casts</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon staff of symbols - 
    Another terrible weapon with a semi-useful effect. This staff has 4 charges 
    of see invisible and the mana works out to be cheeper than casting see 
    invisible 4 times. Not to mention that you don’t have to go and re-memorize 
    the spell, etc. Also the weight isn’t a problem with…</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Dimentional Hole - a 6 slot 
    bag that reduces weight to zero. This is good for keeping your summoned 
    staves and such and not having to worry about their weights or them popping. 
    Also a good place to store food that you summon! :)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Summon Shiny Bauble - 
    Another very important focus item, this one is the upgrade version of the 
    agro-reducer.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ix) Summon Shard of the Core - 
    your replacement for the coldstone. Does same thing but adds poison and cold 
    resistances.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(x) Monster Summoning I - this 
    spell is next to useless. It summons a pet that is worse than the elementals 
    you summon. The only plus side is that it takes a random skin from the 
    zone’s texture memory and makes that the pet. This means that you can have a 
    pet that looks like a Sand Giant, Griffon or measily Rat. Your choice.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 39:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) Lesser Conjurations - Air and 
    Fire are research only. I don’t need to tell you that you should get all 4 
    do I?</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Barrier of Combustion - 
    damage shield for 18 to 20 dmg. 25 fire resistance. Sweet stuff. If your 
    tank gets hit 40 times in a fight (very likely at these levels) this spell 
    will do a minimum of 720 damage just as a bonus. For 100 mana that is sweet!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Expel Summoned - 261 to 273 
    max damage allows very efficient killing of summoned monsters. However, this 
    is once again the only DD spell you get this level. Making the level 39 to 
    44 stretch very difficult.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Summon Companion - Summons 
    your pet to your location. Great spell when your pet is lost. Also good if 
    you want to summon your pet at the beginning of a dungeon, tell it to stay 
    there and then summon it when you are where you want to fight.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Rain of Lava - your next rain 
    spell. Same as always, more damage. This one does 516 in 3 waves (172 dmg 
    per wave)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon Twisted ring - 
    Summons a casting time reducing spell. Same as before</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Summon Ring of Flight - 
    Summons a ring with 2 charges of Levitate</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Summon Phantom Plate - 
    Summons a set of plate armor for a corpse run or to make your favorite 
    newbie look decked out. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ix) Dagger of symbols - It 
    summons a dagger with a few resists on it. Give it to your pet…. Won’t make 
    a big difference but every 5 resistance points counts.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(x) Flame Arc - your next PBAE 
    spell. Once again it is very good for impressing newbies doing 171 to 181 
    dmg to everything surrounding you. You can now efficiently impress newbies 
    in crushbone. Congrats!</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 44:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(i) All your conjuration pets. 
    Only Fire is buyable - you’ll have to research the others.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Shock of Swords - your next 
    spell in your summon shock line of spells, and it’s a beauty. 600 direct 
    damage. It’s a huge leap in power for your character.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Arch Shielding - Next in 
    the line of HP / AC / MR buffs.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Elemental Maelstrom - A DD / 
    Dot spell for mages. Good for adding that extra little damage kick. It does 
    250 damage and then 350 more in 5 ticks (30 seconds)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Elemental Armor - Upgraded 
    fire and cold defense spell. This one gives 30 to each save.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Phantom Plate - Next in the 
    line of HP regen and AC buffs. This one does 3hp per tick healing and 
    increases AC by 17-18</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Malisement - Decreases all 
    saves but disease by 37 to 40! Huge spell. Lots of agro though.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(viii) Summon Opal bracelet - 
    increases damage output on spells level 54 and lower by 10%. So, your shock 
    of swords is suddenly doing 660 dmg instead of 600.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ix) Summon Modulating Rod - 
    Summons a rod with a health to mana charge. Helpful in a very desperate 
    pinch when a small amount of mana is needed to finish the job. These items 
    are Lore so only one can be given to each member of the party.</p>

    quest above):</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Summon Orb - Summons the orb of 
    mastery allowing a magician to summon the epic pet. Just for kicks I want to 
    see a level 46 actually get this. The pet they summoned would be red to them 
    hehe. This is quite probably THE defining magician spell and the power 
    difference between having it and not having it is rather large.</p>

    all the pets, you know the drill. This time only Earth can be bought the 
    rest must be researched.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(ii) Lava Bolt - 810damage. ‘nuff 
    said.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iii) Burnout III - more haste, 
    more strength, more AC. Your pet is now officially a killing machine.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(iv) Shield of Lava - A 25 point 
    damage shield. 25 Fire resistance. In perspective, a tank getting hit 50 
    times in a fight (again, reasonable for this level and higher) will give you 
    a bonus 1250 damage in a fight. Not bad for 120 mana!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(v) Banish Summoned - nice dmg to 
    mana ratio for a spell. This one does 585 damage for a cheep mana cost of 
    only 250ish.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vi) Summon Elemental Blanket - 
    summons a shoulder item which gives +15 to Magic, Fire and Cold. Very useful 
    for further buffing your stats. With natural resistances and magician spells 
    and summons you can boost your MR, CR and FR to about 70 with no items. 
    Pretty impressive!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">(vii) Rain of Swords - Possible 
    damage of 972 dmg per monster (up to 3 monsters) can give an impressive 
    damage output of 3207 damage (with focus item equipped) for 375 mana.</p>

    life.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Vocerate: Fire</b> - A very 
    underappreciated spell which summons the “useless” post-50 fire elemental. 
    This thing absolutely sucks for solo. It is a wizard which casts level 30ish 
    spells rapidly and hits for only about 30. On top of that it has lousy 
    hitpoints and AC. The upside is that in a group this thing can cause a lot 
    of havoc. Sit back and let it do a lot of damage, never getting the agro.

    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Vocerate: Water</b> - This is the 
    rogue elemental, and is commonly thought of as the most powerful post-50 pet

    and most importantly backstabs for wonderful amounts of damage.</p>

    pouch with 60 shurikens. Of limited use.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rage of Zomm</b> - This is an 
    interesting pet. It quads for 250dmg, bashes for 52dmg and stuns mobs. 
    Obviously this attracts a lot of agro and thus the pet dies quickly. 
    However, in PvP against an opponent who doesn’t know whats happening, this 
    pet could be extremely devastating.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sirocco</b> - Next rain spell. 
    This one can do 630 per wave. Therefore each monster can be hit for 1890

    spell, doing 5670 damage</p>

    down while their pet keeps agro.</p>
    <b>

    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shock of Steel</b> - This spell

    in groups, not good solo. Nice to have just to say you have it at any rate.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Malosini</b> - This is another

    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Manastorm</b> - This is a rain

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Seeking Flame of Seukor - </b>

    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ancient: Burnout V</b> - This is 
    an ancient spell, meaning it is ridiculously and unfairly rare. Becaues of 
    this this burnout is completely uber. AC is increased by 23, Strength by a 
    whooping 80 and there is a stackable 80% haste bonus.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ancient: Shock of the Sun</b> - 
    The strongest DD spells that magicians can get is also extremely rare. It 
    does 1125 DMG for only 334 mana.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Banisment - </b>This spell gives 
    a chance to kill any summoned monster outright. It is useful in life or 
    death situations, however this spell working has a terrible price - the 
    monster drops no corpse and leaves no loot or experience.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Greater Voceration: Water</b> - 
    This pet is widely regarded as the most powerful non-epic pet available. Its 
    combination of quick, strong attacks, high agility, good hit points and fast 
    regeneration make it formidable. Adding to that is the pet’s huge backstabs 
    for almost 200 damage. This pet is incredible. </p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mala</b> - This is an 
    unresistable malise. It takes away 35 from every resistance other than 
    disease.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Monster Summoning III</b> - same 
    deal as the others. Playing with monsters. The extra advantage of this is 
    that it is random which type of pet is underneath the monster’s skin. If you 
    don’t have say the water pet, you might get a pet that backstabs anyway.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shock of Fiery Blades</b> - 
    Damage spell for 1005 damage. This is the best non-ancient spell.</p>
    <b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Transon’s Elemental Renewal</b> - 
    This is an instant pet heal for 900 health. It is very beneficial and can be 
    the factor that keeps you in the fight.</p>

    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The Earth Pet is the meatsheild. 
    He has the most HP and the most strength of any elemental. This is a good 
    elemental to use throughout the first half of your life. Another very 
    important advantage of this pet is that it casts a root spell. Root is an 
    important spell that is not available to magicians in any other form. 
    Post-50, this pet is modeled after the warrior. It has very high HP and hits 
    quite hard.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Water Pet</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">This is the well balanced pet of 
    the lot. It has the most balanced stats. Good agility, the second best 
    hitpoints, etc. It also casts an ice damage spell which can make the slight 
    damage edge in a fight. The post-50 version of it is a true powerhouse. It 
    keeps these qualities but is also modeled after the rogue, which gives it 
    the added ability to backstab. This is a very useful skill and creates very 
    high damage output.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Fire Pet</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The fire pet is an interesting 
    situation. Pre-50 at the high levels it is arguably the best pet. It has 
    strong attacks, as well as an incredible damage shield. However, post-50 it 
    is thought to be somewhat useless. They turned it into a wizard which 
    doesn’t do much melee damage but chaincasts fire and lightning spells. Solo 
    it becomes useless and in a group it is underestimated. Pre-50 it is 
    wonderful. Post-50 experiment with it in a group - you might like what you 
    find.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Air Pet</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The Air elemental starts out weak 
    and becomes better and better the more you use it. Most people think of it 
    as the weakest pet, because it has the least hitpoints and strength. However 
    it makes that up by extremely high agility, dexterity and speed, as well as 
    a great stun spell. Post-50 this pet stays the truest to itself hitting up 
    to 5 times a round for almost 60 damage per hit, kicking, bashing and 
    stunning all the while.</p>
