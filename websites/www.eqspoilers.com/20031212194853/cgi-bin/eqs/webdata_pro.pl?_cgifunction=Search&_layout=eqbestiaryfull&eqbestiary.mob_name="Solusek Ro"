<br><b><font color=#d2d200>Description:</b></font><br>- Hits for up to 1913 per attack.<BR>- Six guards in his room are on one hour spawn timers.<BR>- Fire based AE (-400) centers around the target and does up to 1000 points of damage per wave (3 waves), as well as decreasing their ATK by 50 points for 6 seconds. It has a range of 150 and a recast of 48 seconds.<BR>- Single target fire based (-400) proc does up to 2000 damage and lowers the targets ATK by 50 points for 6 seconds.<BR>- Has an innate damage shield.<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR>- Rampages<BR><BR><b>Before We Get Started</b><BR><BR>Solusek Ro is usually the final tier 3 god that you will kill on your way to becoming fully elemental flagged. To enter his chamber you will need to have Tower of Solusek Ro access and to have killed all five Solusek Ro mini-bosses (Xuzl, Arlyxir, Jiva, Rizlona and the Protector of Dresolik), as well as Rallos Zek. You can piggy back in to his chamber. There is also a trick that allows you to piggy back more than 15% of the raid in to chamber. We will discuss that later. If you manage to kill every other tier 1-3 god except for Rallos Zek, and you are piggy backed in to Solusek Ro's chamber and receive the flag, then you will become flagged for the Plane. It is true that Rallos Zek is not required for Plane of Fire access if you kill Solusek Ro + Agnarr. Along those same lines Solusek Ro is not required for access to the Planes of Air, Earth and Water.<BR><BR>After having overcome Rallos Zek this encounter will be a bit anti-climatic. Solusek Ro can be killed by 35 skilled players. That having been said many guilds underestimate him because of this, and wind up wiping a few times before dropping him. This guide should help minimize your number of attempts.<BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>Solusek Ro is trackable from just inside of the zoneline. He is a three day spawn. <BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>Well equipped guilds have defeated Solusek Ro with as few as 30 players. I'd bring 45+ though on your first attempt. This encounter is tricky at first, and becomes much easier with time.<BR><BR>You will want to bring a 6 cleric complete healing cycle, and some AE healing. You'll also want to dedicate a few healers to the rampage tank. You will also want as much ranged DPS as you can find.<BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>Gather your forces and begin buffing at the zone in. Everyone should get as close to maximum fire resistance as possible. Both of Solusek Ro's AEs have -400 modifiers, which means you aren't likely to resist them. The proc however, can be partially resisted. So it is very important that both the main tank and rampage tank have maxed fire resistance. <BR><BR>Druids and clerics who have MGB and Spirit of the Wood or EE should save their MGBs unless told otherwise. MGB heals are important during this fight.<BR><BR>Solusek Ro is at least partially a ranged fight. Depending on your DPS you may or may not elect to have melees dodge in and out to avoid AE. During at least half of the fight though you will want to be outside of his AE range. Melee should be using bows or throwing weapons at this time. As a result I recommend that you have your magicians summon arrows and drop them on the ground at entrance. When melees zone in they can pick them up off of the ground if they need any. This will save you a lot of time later on.<BR><BR><b>Getting People in to Chamber</b><BR><BR>In order to be flagged for Solusek Ro's chamber players need the following flags: Solusek Ro Access + All 5 Tower of Solusek Ro Mini Bosses + Rallos Zek. You can piggy back 15% of the raid up to Solusek Ro's chamber, as if it were a zone. If more than 15% of your raid is not chamber flagged though, there is a trick that will allow you to bring the rest up to his chamber.<BR><BR>Before we get in to that technique let's discuss how to reach his chamber. His chamber is located in the middle path upstairs, as if you were heading up to Jiva's Tower (center tower). On the way up to the tower you will notice a round object which is surrounded by elementals. In the center of this object is a button. You click the button to port up to Solusek Ro's chamber. It is very important that noone does this before instructed by the raid leader. There are two mobs up top who will aggro you as soon as you port up. I recommend the raid leader counting down from 5 to 0, and at 0 everyone who is flagged for the chamber should portal up. It is very important that those who are not chamber flagged do not port up at this time.<BR><BR>Once you are in the chamber you should kill the two guards who will have aggroed. Off tank the second one while you kill the first. These hit relatively hard for yard trash, but aren't too difficult. <BR><BR>Once they are dead everyone needs to leave the raid. A new raid must be formed inside of the chamber, for piggy back purposes. Remember your old groups and invite them quickly. Players who are not flagged for the Tower of Solusek Ro will need to camp and come back repeatedly until they can get invited to the new raid. You may want to log in a mule and use a chat channel to let them know when to log in.<BR><BR>Once the new raid is formed and you have 28 or more players inside of it, make one of the druids a group leader and have him succor downstairs. If you run back up to the chamber quickly then the path should still be clear of mobs. This player should then invite those outside of the chamber, one at a time for piggy backing. It's important that you only do one at a time. The player that has been invited should then portal up and leave the raid. The druid should then invite the next person.<BR><BR>Those who are flagged for the Tower of Solusek Ro, but not Solusek Ro's chamber will have no problems staying in the zone once they are inside of the chamber. It only checks to see if they are chamber flagged as they port up. It never checks afterwards. Players who are not flagged for the Tower of Solusek Ro will need to camp out and come back after they disband, until all piggy backs are up top.<BR><BR>Once all players are inside of the chamber you can reinvite everyone to the raid and get down to business. At this point there will be four more guards left in Solusek Ro's chamber. You can pull these easily in sets of two without aggroing Solusek Ro. You should have no problems mowing through the four guards. The guards in his chamber are one hour spawns. If you aren't moving too slowly you should have no problem with getting in piggy backs and clearing them all and Solusek Ro before respawn. If you had problems with piggy backs, or if you have a wipe on Solusek Ro then the spawn timer may become important, though.<BR><BR><b>The Fight</b><BR><BR>When you hear guilds speak about Solusek Ro, they often say what a pushover he is. When comparing him to encounters such as Rallos Zek or Bertoxxulous, this is true. I do believe though that he is often one of the more underestimated gods as a result of this. He quads for up to 1913 per attack and rampages, but is slowable with magic (mitigated). He has an innate damage shield which is pretty heavy. Some guilds prefer to pull him with nullify magic in an attempt to counteract it. He has a single target fire based (-400) Proc which does up to 2000 damage and lowers your ATK by 50 points. His most devastating attack, however is a fire based (-400) rain spell which does 3 waves of 1000 damage, as well as lowering your ATK by 50. It has a range of 150. This means that your complete healing chain is inevitably going to be hit with this spell.<BR><BR>If you took away his AE this fight would be incredibly easy. The AE makes things difficult though. It has a range of 150, and complete heal only has a range of 100. Even with extended range 4, your clerics are going to have to stand in and take the AE. It's -400 modifier ensures that they will not resist this spell either. Patch heals can land from outside of the AE range, but Solusek Ro has a decent amount of hit points. Over the course of a fight you would likely go OOM patching, unless you have a large army of clerics.<BR><BR>There is no excuse for anyone other than clerics and the main tank/rampage tank to ever be hit with the AE. Some guilds prefer to fight this entire battle purely from range, using bows and spells. This approach works, but mana may become an issue if you don't have very high ranged DPS. What I recommend is that you melee in between AEs. Have one player (often the rampage tank) create a macro which reads something like this, "I have just been hit with the third wave of AE. You have 25 seconds to melee!" They should use this button immediately after the third wave of AE lands on them. There will then be 30 seconds between that wave landing and the spell being recast. Melee types can rush in and do melee damage during this period of time to improve your DPS. 25 seconds later he should then click a button that says something similar to, "AE is coming up. Get out of AE range NOW!" Melee types should then retreat outside of range of the AE and begin using arrows until they receive the okay to melee once again. This approach will improve your DPS quite a bit in the fight, without exposing everyone to 3k in damage per AE.<BR><BR>I also would recommend an MGB healing chain (EE and SOTW) for the fight. It is inevitable that some players are goign to miss the AE message and are going to eat some of Solusek Ro's AE. The cleric chain and two tanks will always eat the AE. MGB heals can help keep these players alive during the chaos.<BR><BR>You still have the problem of keeping the clerics alive through the AE. 3000 points of damage is enough to put a poorly equipped cleric in to low hit point aggro. It will put even the best equipped clerics rather low. There are a few ways to counteract this. If you have sufficient cleric power then you could place an additional cleric in the complete healing groups whose job would be to group heal the clerics in his group. Many guilds do not have that luxury, unfortunately. If you do not then you two paladins in the complete heal groups can work rather well. Wave of Marr is a group heal that heals the entire group of 900 points of damage. It has a 30 second recast time, unfortunately so one paladin will not be able to keep up for long. Two paladins however, are capable of healing 1800 points of damage every 30 seconds with Wave of Marr alone. If they then take turns alternating who casts immediately after the reuse timer expires they are capable of healing 2700 points of damage in 31 seconds. MGB heals will make up for the rest. When the next AE lands one paladin will be ready to Wave of Marr immediately, and the second paladin will be 12 seconds late. Before the next wave lands, however you will have 2700 points healed. <BR><BR>The one problem with group heals is generating aggro, especially early in the fight. We need for the clerics to avoid the first AE while aggro is being established. That brings us to our pulling strategy. <BR><BR>I recommend having a shadowknight pull with Nullify Magic and then immediately casting divine aura. MGB heals should be cast at this point, to avoid the aggro generated by them later. The shadowknight should then pull Solusek Ro to the weaponshield tank, who should grab aggro. The weaponshield tank should be standing out in front of all other players, to the extent that only he will take the AE. The 3000 points is going to hurt him, but it will not kill him. About 8 seconds after the first AE lands, the weaponshield tank should begin backing up towards the main tank and rampage tank. You should do a standard debuffing session and weaponshield aggro transfer, as you have do on most other mobs.<BR><BR>By having the weaponshield tank intercept aggro away from the rest of the raid you should save the tanks and cleric chain at least one, and most likely two waves of his AE. The 8-15 seconds that you save here can make a world of difference aggro wise. If you pull Solusek Ro directly in to range of the clerics and tanks then you risk clerics getting low hit point aggro and group heals generated enough aggro to wipe your cleric chain at the beginning of the fight.<BR><BR>Once aggro is locked you should follow the instructions laid out above. This is an easy fight once you get the hang of it. Don't be ashamed by wiping to this guy a couple of times though. <BR><BR><b>Flagging</b><BR><BR>After killing Solusek Ro a planar projection will spawn back by his spawn point. It is IMPORTANT that you do not fall in to the hole while hailing the planar projection. Watch your footing. After receiving the flag you can port to the Plane of Fire through Solusek Ro's chamber. This hole closes in a few minutes, however. It is important to note that you DO NOT have to enter the Plane of Fire through his chamber for the first time. Unlike Grummus or Aerin`Dar you can simply port in to fire through the front entrance.<BR><BR>It should be noted that there is a pre-flag to obtaining Plane of Fire access. This is obtained by hailing Miak the Seared Soul in the Plane of Tranquility. He is located just outside of the entrance to the Plane of Fire. <BR><BR>After receiving the flags from Miak and Solusek Ro, and assuming that you were already elemental flagged you can complete the Plane of Fire flag by first speaking to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge and [unlocking your memories]. Once your flags are in order you should head up to speak to Grand Librarian Maelin in the library, as you did for Earth, Air and Water. Once again you should tell him, "I have new information", followed by "I have new lore." <BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>Solusek Ro's loot is very good, but not quite on par with the loot of many elemental minis. Because he is a quick and easy kill, he is often farmed for loot when elemental mini bosses run low.
