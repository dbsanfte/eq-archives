<font color=#d2d200><b>Description:</b></font><br>
<b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>The Bertoxxulous event is initiated by killing the Spectre of Corruption in the Lower Crypt of Decay. This is the only mob in the Lower Crypt of Decay. You can track him from the zone in, or you can click down and look for yourself. <BR><BR>The Spectre of Corruption will respawn in three hours if the event is failed. If you suceed he will spawn in three days.<BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>Bertoxxulous is one of those events where more is better. This event is on a two hour time limit, and there is a lot to kill. If you can fill the raid up, then I recommend you do so. Skilled elemental guils could complete this raid with 40 players within the time limit, our first kill of Bertoxxulous we only had low 50s and were a pre-elemental guild. So it's possible with lower numbers, but the more DPS you can muster the easier you make things on yourself.<BR><BR>You will need as many feign death pullers as you can get. Three would be the minimum you could go with unless you plan on training all of the trash mobs on to the raid. I'd recommend 5+. You should have six clerics if at all possible, but we've done this with a three cleric complete healing cycle and a lot of patching. Enchanters are extremely important in this event. You will have a non-stop flow of trash mobs, sometimes 10+ at a time. You need at least two solid tanks and a whole lot of DPS.<BR><BR>Furthermore the entire raid will need to be keyed for the Lower Crypt of Decay. This flag/key is obtained by completing the <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqquestfull&eqquests.quest_name=%22Lower%20Crypt%20of%20Decay%20Key%22">High Priest Ring Event</a> in the Upper Crypt of Decay. This flag is actually a key, which means that you can not piggy back in to the Lower Crypt of Decay. Most guilds will do the High Priest cycle just before Bertoxxulous for those who do not have flags. The High Priest event only gives out 36 flags, however so you will likely have to do him two or three times, and he is a three day spawn. So get those keys out of the way before attempting Bertoxxulous.<BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>Have all of the raid zone in the Crypt of Decay and click on the throne behind the entrance to port in to the Lower Crypt of Decay. It is important that they do not click down if they have any aggro from up top. Bards should have songs turned off before they port down. There is an old bug where the mobs from up top get you on their hate list somehow, and then the entire top floor of puslings rushes you during the middle of the raid. If the puslings are running around up top then they are aggro on someone and you need that person to zone.<BR><BR>When you get in to the Lower area you should gather in a corner in the first room and buff up. Be sure that everyone knows that they can not venture out during this event. Only monks, shadowknights and rogues should ever leave the corner. Everyone else should push mobs in to the corner. There will be mobs wandering around the main room and you do not want to aggro any more of them than you need to. <BR><BR>You need to sort out your complete healing chain before starting the event. There are twelve kings that spawn before Bertoxxulous. These are mini-bosses. In general they hit for 1500ish and some are immune to slow. One rampges and another has a 5000 hit point lifetap proc. Practice the healing chain while fighting these, although you don't really need a full chain for these, it is good practice. <BR><BR>Place a bard in the group with the main tank and rampage tanks. This will help them resist the procs on the mini-bosses and Bertoxxulous. <BR><BR>If you have a full raid and two solid tanks then you may want to have groups 1-6 assist one tank, and groups 7-12 assist a second tank on the trash mobs. This is not necessary but it helps you clear the yard trash at a quicker rate. <BR><BR>Finally you should set up a channel for the pullers, if you do not always have one. All of the feign death capable players, rangers and rogues need to join this channel. The raid leader should also join to help coordinate. This event is a pullers nightmare. You will lose at least one puller on every king. Go over the pulling strategy (covered later in this article) before initiating the event, and have all of the pullers learn the Lower Crypt. There are four spawning pads in this area and they are obvious (a large circle in the floor). These spawners are where trash mobs and the twelve kings will spawn. One king spawns on each spawner during the various waves. There is also a spawner in the room where you are currently set up, which only spawns trash mobs and not kings. There are at least two entrances to each of this spawners. The pullers need to know how to get there from both sides and how to get back to the raid. <BR><BR><b>The Event</b><BR><BR>When everyone is buffed and ready you should pull the Spectre of Corruption to the raid. Practice pushing him in to the corner and leaving the corner open for the main tank to corner tank him on the Spectre. Once he is killed the timer starts and you have five minutes until the adds start spawning. Take note of where the Summoner is in the main room. She will spawn adds so locate the raid in one of the opposite corners from her to avoid being spawned on. If you push to the corner and stay out of the center you should be able to avoid aggroing mobs as they spawn.<BR><BR>Once the event starts each of the spawners will begin spawning trash mobs. These are all undead and are similar to the mobs found upstairs in the undead area. They spawn in the main room so expect the first couple minutes to be rough. Get used to it, because it doesn't get any easier from here on in. You just get used to it. <BR><BR>The puller should pull waves of trash in to the raid, five or more at a time. Enchanters need to mesmerize these as quickly as possible and the raid needs to kill them off. Paladins can stun these adds with a non-damaging stun on the way in to help draw aggro off of the puller and his healers. Remember you are on a two hour timer, you can not waste any time here. Other players in the pulling channel should inform the puller when the camp is almost clear of adds and he should train another wave of adds to the camp.<BR><BR>After approximately 50 trash mobs are killed the first king will spawn. After four more trash mobs are killed the second king will spawn. Four more mobs and the third king. Four more and the fourth. When the kings are up your primary goal should be to kill them. While the raid is clearing the camp the rangers should track and let the pullers know which direction the king is in. ex: North King is Up. <BR><BR>You will need two pullers for each king. One is the dragger and one is the tagger. The king will normally be stacked up with five or so mobs on the spawner. You don't want to train all of those mobs on to the raid with the king. What you do is have one puller approach from one side and the other puller approach from the opposite side of the room. The dragger will then use a spell or a ranged weapon to hit the king and all of the mobs will aggro them. They will then run down the hallway on their side as far as they can and die or feign death. I prefer dying because it's quicker. The trash mobs never lose aggro. Just die and consent a rogue. Now the trash mobs and the king will walk back to the spawning pad. The trick is that the kings do not corpse camp. They go back immediately. The trash mobs will corpse camp for a while before going back. The tagger waits until the king gets back and hits him with a spell or ranged weapon and brings him to camp solo. It's an easy tactic, works like a charm, but does take some getting used to. One thing to note is that sometimes the trash mob casters will cast spells and won't get far enough away from the pad. If you have one or two trash mobs then it should be okay still to train those on the raid. <BR><BR>It is important for the raid to know when a king is coming. Kings need healing chains and the main tank needs to be ready for it and not killing off a trash mob. <BR><BR>It is also important that the pullers talk to one another. The dragger will be dead and needing a drag. Someone else needs to be the dragger on the next king. You need to be interchangeable. <BR><BR>After the fourth king spawns you will need to kill about 30 more trash mobs to spawn the second wave. The second wave kings spawn like the first. The fifth king spawns alone. You kill four trash mobs and the sixth king spawns. Four more mobs then the seventh. Four more and then the eighth. <BR><BR>After the eighth king is killed then kings nine through twelve will spawn at the same time. From this point you don't have to kill any more trash mobs. Clear the main room when they spawn if they are getting in the way, but it's not necessary for the event. <BR><BR>Once the twelth king is killed Bertoxxulous will spawn immediately in the main room. This is the room that you are fighting in. I recommend moving your raid up one of the hallways before pulling the final king. The long ones with the steep upstairs are best. Have the main tank and rampage tank stand at the top of the steps. Have the rest of the raid wait in the side hall at the top, around the corner from the main/rampage tanks. The casters can hide in those little cubbeys to try to block Bertoxxulous' AE. I recommend practicing your positions on the final king. We'll cover Bertoxxulous a tad more later in this spoiler. For now let's focus on the special attacks of the twelve kings.<BR><BR><b>Twelve Kings</b><BR><BR>The twelve kings all have the last name Adan (ex: Darwol Adan). All hit for 1500ish, and some have some special abilities, as well. <BR><BR>The most difficult is without a doubt Qezzin. He has a 5000 hit point lifetap proc. It is extremely important to have a bard playing magic resistance in the main tanks group for this fight. It is also important that noone else steals aggro from the main tank during this fight. <BR><BR>Zandal is also tricky because he has a disease based AE which slows everyone by 50%. It can be cured by curing disease (18 counters). <BR><BR>Everyone who has completed the High Priest cycle should have no problem killing the twelve kings. They are similar to the mini-bosses in the High Priest cycle. Considering you have to complete that to reach Bertoxxulous, you shouldn't be too worried about the twelve kings. You should respect them, however. Having a wipe or a partial wipe during this event can be devastating due to the time limit.<BR><BR>Darwol<BR>- Hits for up to 1350 per attack.<BR>- Disease Based PBAE does up to 400 per tick for 3 Minutes.<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Feig<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Xhut<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Kavilis<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Raddi<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Wavadozzik<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Zandal<BR>- Disease based AE centers around the target and lowers their attack speed by 50% for 3 minutes. This can be cursed by a cure disease (18 counters).<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Akkapan<BR>- Magic Slowable<BR><BR>Bhaly<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Qezzin<BR>- Magic Based 5000 Hit Point Lifetap Proc<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Pzo<BR>- Rampages<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Meedo<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR><b>Bertoxxulous</b><BR><BR>- Hits for up to 1950 per attack.<BR>- Very large hit box, so melee from maximum melee range.<BR>- Rampages<BR>- Disease Based PBAE does up to 500 points of damage and lowers your ATK by 150. It then has a hit point and mana drain over time for 3.3 minutes. It is a disease with 72 counters. This spell is unresistable.<BR>- Disease based proc does direct damage and slows the target. Be prepared to have someoene chain cast Abolish Disease on the main tank.<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR>Bertoxxulous spawns in the main room as soon as the final king is killed. By this point you should already have everyone moved in to positions as described under The Event. You should have also had practice on the final king for this positioning. <BR><BR>Bertoxxulous is immune to slow and has a relatively heavy melee output. The main tank should have a six cleric healing chain on him, if at all possible. If you still have spare clerics then you might want to put a smaller second chain on the rampage tank. If you don't have the clerics then I'd place several patchers on him. The last thing you want is for the rampage tank to die and Bertoxxulous to start rampaging healers.<BR><BR>If you are worried about keeping your main tank up against Bertoxxulous then you might want to grab some charmed pets. You should do this prior to pulling the final king. If you are worried that your enchanters can't control their pets, then do not charm them. You don't NEED them, but they are helpful if you can keep them under control. <BR><BR>Bertoxxulous hase a disease based PBAE that does up to 500 points of damage and lowers your ATK by 150. It then has a hit point and mana drain over time for 3.3 minutes. It is a disease with 72 counters. This spell is unresistable, but if your casters hide in the cubbeys in the hall then they should be able to avoid it. Conventional wisdom would tell you that you should have someone curing the clerics of this spell, but we never did and it was never an issue.<BR><BR>Bertoxxulous also procs a slow on the main tank. This will cause major aggro problems. You should assign one shaman to chain cast Abolish Disease for the duration of the fight to nullify this attack.<BR><BR>When everyone is ready you should have the weaponshield tank pull Bertoxxulous to the top of the steps where the main tank will be standing. Bertoxxulous has a huge hit box and reach so you will need to backpedal up to the corner after aggroing him. There are going to be trash mobs in this room, but if you do not pull Bertoxxulous past them they will not aggro. That is why I recommend using the tall side passageways, on the opposite side of the Summoner. He pulls single to each of those passageways every time. One problem that you may have on these passageways is Bertoxxulous warping on to the weaponshield tank. Just position yourself in the proper spot and this should not be a problem.<BR><BR>The main tank should AE taunt just before weaponshield expires and the complete healing chain should begin. I would wait about thirty second before calling in the rest of the raid for aggro purposes. Corner Bertoxxulous in the corner at the top and plow him down. He has low hit points, this is a two minute fight. If you can keep the main tank alive, and keep aggro focused on him then you should be able to defeat Bertoxxulous. <BR><BR>If things go bad try you should try to camp a cleric. If you didn't waste time on the way up you may have time resurrect, rebuff and give it a second shot. If you were low on DPS or had some problems then you may not have that option. This is a tough event and it's not uncommon for guilds to fail three or more times before they get it right. Realistically you can only do this raid once per day, so this can be frustrating. If you have problems on this event then my advice to you is keep trying. This is the second most difficult encounter pre-elementals. If you can get by this event then you should be able to breeze by everything else up to Rallos Zek. <BR><BR><b>Flagging</b><BR><BR>After Bertoxxulous is killed the Planar Projection will spawn in the center room, where you zone down in to. Hail him for your flag. To complete the flag you must then return to the Plane of Tranquility and hail Adler Fuirstel and Elder Fuirstel. <BR><BR>Bertoxxulous is required to complete your Saryrn flag, and if done out of order players will need to unlock their memories after killing Bertoxxulous to then receive credit for Saryrn.<BR><BR><b>Loot</b><BR><BR>Bertoxxulous drops two items per kill. Each of the twelve kings has a chance to drop an item, as well. Typically you will get one or two drops from the kings as well as the two from Bertoxxulous. Bertoxxulous' drops are good, but he is seldom killed for loot, because of the length and difficulty of the event. The drops from the kings range from very poor to pretty good. The better loots from the kings include a Flowing Thought II cape, 35/25 2HPierce and a 125 hp/mana staff.<br><br>
