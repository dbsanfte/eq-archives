<br><b><font color=#d2d200>Description:</b></font><br>- Hits for up to 1197 per attack.<BR>- Disease based PBAE Curse DoT does 4000 damage over 3.3 minutes. It can be cursed with radiant cure, however.<BR>- Disease PBAE that does 200 per tick, and increases stamina loss.<BR>- Diseased based single target proc slows your tank by 60%, and does up to 300 damage per tick. It can be cured by Abolish Disease.<BR>- Rampages<BR>- Immune to Slow<BR><BR><b>Spawn and Scouting Information</b><BR><BR>Grummus spawns every three days. He can be easily tracked by a druid or ranger from the Spine outside of the castle. Gryme the Crypt Guardian must also be up or you will not be able to obtain the key inside.<BR><BR><b>What You Need</b><BR><BR>As with all encounters, the exact requirements vary by AAs and equipment. Decently geared guilds (NTOV, BOT, Ssra) can take Grummus with around 30 people, so long as they have sufficient area effect healers. Time geared guilds should be able to take down Grummus with 18 players if they have the proper makeup. Lower level or poorly geared players will likely want to bring as many people as possible. This encounter has wiped many an open-raid.<BR><BR>Area effect healing is the key to this encounter. You need to set up an MGB heal chain, as well as an MGB Spirit of the Wood chain. <BR><BR>Grummus only hits for 1100 per attack, but he is unslowable. Depending on the quality of your tank you could possibly get by on a 2 cleric CH chain. 3 Clerics should be sufficient for moderately equipped tanks. He does rampage, but a patch healer should be sufficient for rampage.<BR><BR>A Feign Death puller is pretty important for Grummus. It's easy to pull everything before Grummus without one, but because Grummus is a patroller it's easy for the puller to get jumped. You could sacrifice the puller if this happens, but it makes things a lot easier if you have an FDer.<BR><BR>A shaman with Abolish Disease is crucial for the Grummus encounter. A ranger to weaponshield is also pretty important for the initial portion of the fight. <BR><BR><b>Preparation</b><BR><BR>It is VERY IMPORTANT that all clerics and druids who can cast Spirit of the Wood or Ethereal Elixir to save their MGBs. Grummus has some heavy DoTs and these spells will make the fight much easier. <BR><BR>ALL players need to leave 4 buff slots free. Grummus has two AEs and a single target proc which will overwrite your buffs if you do not have slots. You need additional slots free for the MGB heals over time.<BR><BR>It is also important to have your paladins and shadowknights memorize harmshield or divine aura in advance. One person will need to DA pull the mobs past Aramin's room, and it is good to have back up DAs in case that player dies or goes linkdead en route.<BR><BR>Grummus and Gryme both have heavy disease based DoTs. Everyone in the raid needs to have their disease resistance buffed as high as possible. Each group should have someone in the group who can radiant cure, or Remove Curse if at all possible. It is also beneficial for each group to have someone who can cast group heal.<BR><BR><b>Getting There</b><BR><BR>To get to Grummus you will need to kill both <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqbestiaryfull&eqbestiary.mob_name=%22Gryme%2C%20the%20Crypt%20Guardian%22">Gryme the Crypt Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.eqspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=Search&_layout=eqbestiaryfull&eqbestiary.mob_name=%22Aramin%20the%20Spider%20Guardian%22">Aramin the Spider Guardian</a>. These are both en route to Grummus. All three spawn inside of the castle. This is near the large spine where lightcrawlers spawn. Once you are inside the castle it's pretty easy to find him, you can only go in one direction.  <BR><BR>Pulling the castle is easy for the most part, so long as you can handle 2-4 mobs at a time. The mobs generally all have low hit points.<BR><BR>Gryme the Crypt Guardian holds the key that is required to unlock the locked door before you reach Aramin. Gryme patrols from inside of the door, to the elbow where most guilds choose to set up for him. This is the elbow just before the locked door. The typical strategy is to pull as many of the trash mobs outside of the locked doors as you can and then wait for Gryme to path within range for him to be single pulled. He has a Point Blank Area Effect Dot which does up to 3600 damage over 1.8 minutes, as well as increasing stamina loss. This can be cured by Abolish Disease. Gryme is unslowable, but his melee output is not that heavy. When killed he drops the NO RENT key. Be sure that someone reliable loots the key (typically the raid leader).<BR><BR>Once you have the key you can move inside of the locked door. It is generally a good idea to pull to the second room just inside, at the start of the long hall. Pull all of the mobs to here until it's clear to the room just before Aramin, the Spider Guardian. Then move the party in to the room before him (the prep room).<BR><BR>Aramin is rooted in place, but there are a number of adds in the room past his. They will aggro you if you do not pull them first. Have a paladin or shadowknight cast Divine Aura or Harmshield and run in to the room past Aramin, being sure to get aggro on all of the mobs there. Train these mobs to the prep room. There's about 6-8 mobs here, so be sure that your enchanters know this is about to happen before it does. <BR><BR>After all of the trash mobs are clear you should pre-debuff and slow Aramin. It is usually smart to cast mem blur a few times after this phase, to try to wipe the debuffers off his hate list. <BR><BR>All classes who have AE damage, root or stun spells should memorize them at this point. It should be stressed that after Aramin dies about 20 baby spiders will spawn and attack the raid. It is important that when this happens everyone stays close together, so the AEs land on as many mobs as possible. Warriors should AE taunt and other tanks should pick any random spider and taunt it while the casters use AE to kill them all. It is important to go over this before the fight, because there will be no time during it.<BR><BR>Aramin himself has very little hit points. It's a quick and easy fight. He procs a DoT on the main tank, but it is nothing major. It's the spiders that hatch after the fight that are the more difficult part. Aramin's loot table can be found: <a href="http://www.daocspoilers.com/cgi-bin/eqs/webdata_pro.pl?eqequipment.item_name=&eqequipment.weapon_type=&eqequipment.class=&eqequipment.npc_name=aramin&eqequipment.dmg=&eqequipment.race=&eqequipment.quest=&eqequipment.delay=&eqequipment.zone_name=&eqequipment.effect=&eqequipment.dps=&eqequipment.modifiers=&eqequipment.deity=&eqequipment.range=&eqequipment.item_slot=&eqequipment.wt=&eqequipment.ac=&eqequipment.item_type=&eqequipment.augmentation_type=&eqequipment.trivial=&eqequipment.restrictions=&_layout=Equipment&eqequipment.level_to_use=&eqequipment.effecttype=&_cgifunction=search">HERE</a>.<BR><BR>After killing Aramin your puller should move past his room. Again this is completely linear. We typically pull the mobs to Aramin's room while loot is being handled. Expect 3-4 mobs on the first pull here. Once you clear to the large room you can move the party up and have them camp there while you pull the rest of the mobs.<BR><BR>It is very important to have an FD puller at this point. Grummus spawns downstairs from the pulling area here. He patrols three rooms down there and has a rather large aggro range. You need to clear the first two rooms while he is pathed in the third. Once you have the first two rooms downstairs clear, you need your FDer (or an Eye) to peek at where Grummus is pathed. When he paths in to the third room downstairs you need to move the entire raid in to the first room as quickly as possible, this is very important. <BR><BR><b>The Fight</b><BR><BR>Have the weaponshield tank, main tank and rampage tank stand slightly ahead of the others. Have your Feign Deather lay in the second room keeping an eye out for Grummus. When he begins to path to the first room he needs to warn the raid to be ready. As soon as he enters the first room the weaponshield tank needs to grab aggro and weaponshield. The main tank and rampage tank need to get on to his aggro list at this point as well, and do a typical weaponshield aggro transfer.<BR><BR>Once the main tank has aggro locked Grummus needs to be cornered as soon as possible. He hits relatively hard and you don't want the rest of the raid to be taking ripostes. A shaman should have been assigned prior to engaging to chain cast Abolish Disease on the main tank. Decay of the Plaguebringer makes it nearly impossible for the main tank to hold aggro, but can be cured easily with this spell. Other players should be wary to not overaggro during this fight. If you get aggro stop attacking for a few seconds.<BR><BR>The healer channel should have worked out an order for MGB Spirit of the Wood and Ethereal Elixirs prior to engagement. It is important that at least one of these is on the raid at all times to minimize the effect of the DoTs. Group healers should be casting Radiant Cure as soon as the DoTs land to try to remove them, but all groups may not have healers, and sometimes healers may be dead.<BR><BR>Once Grummus dies you should immediately resurrect anyone who needs the flag and begin asking in raid who needs a cure. It is not uncommon for players to die to the DoTs after the fight. Remember the Planar Projection despawns rather quickly, so get people in as soon as possible.<BR><BR>Also be prepared to deal with respawns. Depending on how quickly you cleared the area, and on how lucky you were on Grummus' pathing your most likely going to get respawn while doing loot. <BR><BR><b>Flagging</b> <BR><BR>To complete the flag you must first hail the Planar Projection and then jump down the hole in the room past Grummus. To hole is underneath a clickable object which will move when clicked revealing the Crypt of Decay entrance. There are some random trash mobs in this area, so be prepared to kill them.<br>
