    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><br>
    <font color="#D2D200">Character Creation:</font></p>
    </b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Character creation for the 
    enchanter, like any other class, is one of the defining moments of a 
    character’s life. It determines where they begin their existence, it 
    determines what race they are, it determines what base stats the character 
    has and lastly (and obviously) it determines what class they will be. The 
    class of the character is of course the most important. However, class tends 
    to be something that people have already decided on. If you are reading 
    this, there is a good chance that you have decided on creating an enchanter. 
    There are five racial choices for your character and each one can make it as 
    an enchanter. However, when push comes to shove, on stats there are good and 
    bad choices when it comes to making an enchanter. I will say right now that 
    these are my opinions. All of the races will make good enchanters, and at 
    high levels these differences are much less obvious to the point where many 
    feel that they disappear. I have always and still firmly believe that 
    although stats can be evened out, that initial advantage that some races 
    have never quite burns out. At this time I will say that humans, dark elves 
    and gnomes make very good enchanters. At the same time, High Elves and 
    Erudites make superb enchanters.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Human Enchanters have a very 
    distinct advantage over their other human magi counterparts. Where as 
    necromancers, magicians and wizards all have but one starting stat that is 
    important; enchanters have two - Intelligence and Charisma. For this reason, 
    Human Enchanters do very well. Although they start blind (something that 
    forever bothers me and prevents me from playing a human character) and with 
    less intelligence than the other racial choices, humans enjoy the second 
    highest natural charisma of the races available. To add to this, humans have 
    the most balanced of the other stats, giving them by far the most strength 
    and stamina. This allows them to carry more loot (important when trying to 
    make money) and gives them a few extra HP, which is marginally useful (being 
    able to take that extra hit before mez goes off is a lifesaver).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dark Elves and Gnomes are really 
    in the same boat when it comes to being an enchanter. They both share high 
    intelligence but lack when it comes to charisma. This becomes more and more 
    evident throughout their lives. Both have various advantages and 
    disadvantages, the most obvious being that dark elves are evil. However, as 
    you will soon find out that isn’t as bad as it seems for an enchanter. Very 
    quickly you will learn how to safely walk in any city. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Erudites make amazing enchanters. 
    They are plagued with two problems that are both fairly easily solved. The 
    first is the blindness factor that is shared with humans. It can 
    theoretically be solved as early as level 4 with you get illusion: half elf. 
    However, walking around as a naked half elf isn’t always fun. It is better 
    solved at level 8 when you get both illusion gnome (robes will show up on 
    gnomes) and illusion wood elf (and we all like seeing naked wood elves 
    right?! ;) The second is their starting location. That side of the world 
    sucks. I personally can’t stand the Qeynos area. I much prefer the 
    protection and love of Feydwer or the familiarity of eastern Antonica. 
    However, there are people that swear by Blackburrow for the beginning of 
    life. Either way, you have to get off Odus - it’s a train wreck, and easily 
    the worst continent in the game (yay for suckyness!) Get a teleport and a 
    bind and you should be fine - Erudites aren’t loved but they aren’t hated 
    either. They are blessed with by far the highest intellect and the third 
    highest charisma, just behind humans. Many will argue that statistically, 
    this is the best enchanter class to go with. I find it difficult to argue.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">However, my personal favorite, 
    and the favorite of a majority of enchanters is the High Elf. Many people 
    say that there are only two things that the high elves do well - Enchanting 
    and Healing. I don’t agree that they are the only things they do well, but I 
    will concede that they do these two things better than anything else. For 
    that matter, they do these things better than anyone else as well. As a high 
    elf enchanter you are given the royal treatment growing up in Felwithe, 
    night vision, a great newbie zone, a great starting location with plenty of 
    leveling options, enough intelligence to do well, and better charisma than 
    the lot of them. Many people will also argue that this is the best enchanter 
    class to go with. And once again, I find it difficult to argue with them… 
    especially considering my enchanter is this race.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Lastly, religion must be 
    discussed when it comes to the enchanter. Don’t dedicate yourself to one 
    god. Please. Just don’t do it. For some reason illusions don’t cover up 
    religion. Maybe we wear huge medallions saying, “Tunare is my Mother!” or 
    “Innurok kicks ass!” Either way, sometimes illusions just aren’t enough, so 
    chose to be Agnostic. If you don’t believe me, try being a High Elvish 
    Enchanter who worships Mithanial Marr, put up Dark Elf illusion, and try 
    walking onto Dark Elf turf. Have fun retrieving your corpse (try invis this 
    time!).</p>

    </b><i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Levels 1 to 
    4:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The role of the enchanter is the 
    same as every other class from 1 to 4. You go solo, you find small animals 
    and you hit them with whatever you got. Don’t group, and get to level 4. 
    That is your role =).</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Levels 4 to 
    16:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">This is when you should do the 
    only soloing of your life. Your pets aren’t all that bad even though you 
    can’t control them. You should learn how to use mesmerize and control a 
    crowd. Just because you CAN solo it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn how to 
    group. From level 16 on it is basically your only viable option unless you 
    are planning on getting killed a lot and leveling slowly. At level 12 you 
    get charm. You will die from this spell, but you need to learn how to use it 
    effectively or else you won’t get anywhere near your potential. You should 
    solo a bit but in groups your role is to learn how to control a crowd with 
    your tools.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Levels 16 
    to 50:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You give mana enhancers to 
    whoever needs them, you give haste buffs to your tanks, and you control the 
    crowd by any means necessary. That is your function. Learn it, live it, it 
    is your job.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Levels 50 
    to 60:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">The high levels for enchanters 
    are basically the same thing. You become an important buffer as well as 
    debuffer because without hasted party members you won’t survive. You also 
    have “emergency heals” with your rune series which can keep the tank around 
    long enough to get that complete heal he needs. Crowd control continues to 
    be immensely important and we get some wicked spells for dealing with high 
    end mobs, including a fixed duration charm and mezzes which work on monsters 
    that weren’t mezzable before.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Raids:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You have a few jobs. You have to 
    make sure everyone has Clarity II or whatever your best crack spell is at 
    the time. You have to make sure all the tanks have the best haste you can 
    give them. You have to make sure that you do everything you can to control a 
    crowd. In a boss mob situation, same thing with buffs. You should do your 
    upmost to get tashan through to lower the resistance. Then you do what you 
    can. You’ll probably die quickly anyway.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Enchanter 
    PvE Tactics:</font></p>
    </b><i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1 to 
    4:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Open with your DoT Spell, Follow 
    with strength debuff and hit it to death. (or stab.) Simple as that!</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4 to 
    16:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Play with your pet. Summon it, 
    buff it however you can. Hit a monster and let your pet go at it until your 
    pet is half life. Keep your DoT spells eating at it. When your pet is half 
    life go in and melee with it to absorb hits until you are half life. Back 
    off and finish the job. You should be able to consistently solo this way. In 
    a group a key thing is to explain to them how mesmerize works. Until they 
    understand this they will keep messing things up over and over and over 
    again. Explain to them how to /assist the main tank, all of this stuff is 
    necessary. It is one disadvantage of the Enchanter that we need to school 
    our groups at low levels on how to play with one. The advantage, of course, 
    is that after they understand exp comes a lot quicker and they see how good 
    we are.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 16 to 
    50:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You are a buffer and crowd 
    controller, never forget that. You might start getting DoT spells that do a 
    good amount of damage and you might get DD’s that can pack a bit of a punch. 
    However, you should never use any mana on attacks unless you have more than 
    75% mana, everything has been controlled and is stable and everyone has all 
    the buffs they need and want. If that is the case, feel free to pop a few 
    nukes or a DoT. However, you will find that there is always something to do 
    crowd control or buff wise. Also, don’t neglect that you are a crowd 
    controller. Don’t be forced to become a clarity and haste whore - it is easy 
    to do if you are lazy or not careful.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 50 to 
    60:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You get powerful spells and some 
    key new abilities that you need to learn to use. Your epic weapon makes 
    giving the best haste in the game easy, which is a nice break on the mana. 
    You get more and better choices for mana regeneration. In terms of crowd 
    control you have to have more focus than ever. These high level mobs are 
    extremely dangerous and one bad move from you could kill your entire group 
    or raiding party. They also become capable of extremely high damage output 
    with Dire Charm which allows them to perma charm a monster. At high levels 
    this has the potential of making the enchanter both an extremely valuable 
    utility caster, but also a high damage dealer. As always, this comes with a 
    price - if it fails, you are pretty much guaranteed to be dead.</p>

    8:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">There is no real PvP at these 
    levels. Instead it is higher levels easily ganking lower levels. Get 
    yourself to level 8 ASAP for some better options.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 8 to 
    16:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Have a pet up at all times. This 
    will make their life harder. A good strategy is to tashan and then chain 
    cast your level 8 nuke. If it keeps hitting their life will go down and if 
    you time it right they won’t be able to get off any more spells. Versus a 
    melee it is hard. Get your pet on them and cast Whirl to you Hurl and other 
    stun spells.</p>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 16 to 
    60:</font></p>
    </i>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You have the advantage of Mana 
    regeneration. One option that is very dangerous but effective - charm a 
    monster and sick em. If you can keep It charmed and on them you will be able 
    to crush them easily. Another option is to do the level 8 to 16 strategy. 
    You’ll have more mana now due to breeze / clarity / clarity II.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">At level 51 with my enchanter I 
    was able to kill 4 people simultaneously. It is very difficult but that is 
    the sort of PvP task a skilled enchanter is capable of. My basic strategy is 
    as follows: Have several mesmerize spells ready for use including the AoE 
    one. Start by casting an AoE mez on them if they are near each other. This 
    will freeze them for a bit. During this time you should cast tashan on each 
    of them. Now, start giving them mesmerize to keep them down. One after 
    another mez them and then cast your highest level tashan spell. You should 
    now have them all mezzed and debuffed. Take the weakest link (normally a 
    caster) and nuke them. Follow it immediately by another mez on them and then 
    sit down to gain mana back. Re-mez or dazzle all of them to keep everyone 
    frozen. Repeat this, always gaining your mana back. When one falls you go to 
    the next and then the next. It is extremely difficult and I sugest that you 
    start doing this by facing one opponent and then two and then three. When I 
    faced 4 it was not by choice and I was extremely lucky. Don’t waste time 
    looting them unless there is someone that is going to ninja or they are 
    bound close. If you don’t know, mez everyone, loot and then gain some mana 
    back while everyone is mezzed, for even 2-3 mezzings of everyone. This will 
    allow you to gain enough mana to take down the second person quicker. </p>

    Epic Quest:</font></p>
    </b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="2">
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">This is the enchanter's epic 
    quest. The solution for this quest is described in the quickest and most 
    straightforward fashion that we could come up with. As a result you won't 
    find much on the storyline, you will simply find out what you have to do to 
    complete the quest.<br>
    <br>
    1) Give a Shiny Metallic Robe Rilgor Plegnog in Ak'anon. The Shiny Metallic 
    Robe is dropped by the Ghoul Arch Magi in Lower Guk. <br>
    <br>
    He will give you a mechanical pen in exchange.<br>
    <br>
    2) Visit Reania Jukle in the Qeynos Aqueducts. Ask her where you can find 
    the ink of the dark and she will give you an empty vial.<br>
    <br>
    3) Buy a Quill and Paper from Qeynos.<br>
    <br>
    4) Travel to Lower Guk and charm the Ghoul Scribe. While it is charmed hand 
    him the empty vial and he will give you the Ink of the Dark.<br>
    <br>
    5) Hand the Quill and Paper to Chrislin Baker in West Karana. She will give 
    you a bandit sash for your efforts.<br>
    <br>
    More Importantly this will cause a bandit named Thracken Griften to spawn at 
    loc +800, -11500. He is level 55 so bring some friends.<br>
    <br>
    Kill him and he will drop a White Paper.<br>
    <br>
    6) Turn the White Paper, Ink of the Dark and Mechanical Pen in to Stofo Olan 
    in Erudin and he will give you a Copy of Notes.<br>
    <br>
    7) Travel to Burnign Wood and seek out a Sarnak Imitator. You may need to 
    kill some sarnaks near the fort to get him to spawn. <br>
    <br>
    Hand the Sarnak Imitator the Copy of Notes that you received from Stofo. <br>
    <br>
    He will give you Jeb's Seal.<br>
    <br>
    8) Tell the Sarnak Imitator that you need a sack and he will give you an 
    Enchanter's Bag.<br>
    <br>
    9) Gather some friends and head to East Cabilis. An NPC named Vessel Drozlin 
    spawns there. He is level 60. Kill him and he will drop a Xolian Rod.<br>
    <br>
    10) While you have your friend's together head to Neriak Third Gate and kill 
    Verina Tomb. She will drop Innoruuk's Word.<br>
    <br>
    11) Gather even more friends and head to Chardok. This time you must kill 
    Prince Selrach Di'zok. He will drop a head.<br>
    <br>
    12) Turn in the Prince's head to Joren Nobleheart in Felwithe and you will 
    receive the Chalice of Kings.<br>
    <br>
    13) Head to Ogguk. At loc +230, +400 you will find a pair of Large Muddy 
    Sandals(unless someone else has taken them already).<br>
    <br>
    14) Take these sandals to Bozlum Blossom in the same zone. She will give you 
    a Scribbled Parchment.<br>
    <br>
    15) Take the scribbled parchment to Brokk Boxtripper in one of the stone 
    huts. He will give you a Gift.<br>
    <br>
    16) Take the gift back to Bozlum Blossom and she will give you Snow 
    Blossoms.<br>
    <br>
    17) Combine the Chalice of Kings, Xolian Rod, Snow Blossoms and Innoruuk's 
    Word in to the Enchanter's Bag.<br>
    <br>
    18) Travel to Overthere and turn the combined bag in to Modani Qu'Loni. He 
    will give you a piece of the Staff of the Shissar.<br>
    <br>
    19) Tell Moldani that you need a bag so he will give you a new Enchanter's 
    Bag.<br>
    <br>
    20) Head to the Oasis of Marr. You may have to kill some Sand Giants for a 
    while to get Cazel to spawn. When he spawns kill him and he will drop a 
    spoon.<br>
    <br>
    21) Head to the Overthere. I don't have a loc for this part so be prepared 
    for a headache. You must find a key that will spawn on a mesa in the 
    canyons. Pick it up you will need it later.<br>
    <br>
    22) Head to the Crypt of Dalnir. At location -20, 50 on the third floor you 
    will find a Lost Scroll.<br>
    <br>
    23) Go to the Plane of Air. You need to get the Book of Charm and Sacrifice. 
    It is found on a table at loc +1300, +550.<br>
    <br>
    24) Combine the Scroll, Book, Key and Spoon in to your Enchanter's Bag. Hand 
    the combined bag to Clockwork VIIX in Ak'anon. <br>
    <br>
    He will give you the second piece of the staff.<br>
    <br>
    25) Head to Firiona Vie and pay a visit to Nadia Starfeast. Ask Nadia for a 
    bag and you will receive an enchanter's bag.<br>
    <br>
    Next ask Nadia for a diamond, sapphire, ruby and emerald(one at a time) and 
    she will give you one of each.<br>
    <br>
    26) You will now need to head to four differnet locations and charm then 
    hand in(while the mob is charmed) one of these gems(a different one for each 
    mob) to them. You will then receive an item with the mobs trapped essence in 
    return.<br>
    <br>
    Here is the list of mobs to turn in each gem to:<br>
    <br>
    Diamond - Spectral Librarian in Kaesora<br>
    Sapphire - Faelia Goldenwing in Skyfire.<br>
    Ruby - Wraith of Jaxion in the City of Mist.<br>
    Emerald - Impaler Tzilug in the Overthere.<br>
    <br>
    27) Combine the enchanted gems in your Enchanter's bag and return them to 
    Nadia Starfeast in Firiona Vie. You will receive the third piece of the 
    staff.<br>
    <br>
    Ask Nadia for a new sack while you are here.<br>
    <br>
    28) Gather a good collection of friends and head down to the Hole. You need 
    to visit Polzin Mrid. Hand him Jeb's Seal(that you received way back when). 
    He will give you some instructions and return the seal back to you.<br>
    <br>
    29) While your in the Hole kill Kinde's Ghost. He will drop the Essence of a 
    Ghost.<br>
    <br>
    30) Kill the Wraith of the Shissar in the Plane of Fear. He will drop the 
    Head of the Serpent.<br>
    <br>
    31) Go to the Plane of Hate and kill some Forsaken Revenants. If you are 
    lucky one will drop the Essence of a Vampire. If you are unlucky, well try 
    again soon.<br>
    <br>
    32) Head to the Field of Bone and kill the Tangrin. He can be found on the 
    island. He will drop the Sand of the Mystics. <br>
    <br>
    33) Combine the four items you have just received(both Essence's, the Head 
    of the Serpent and Sand of Mystics) in to your Enchanter's Bag and head back 
    to the Hole. <br>
    <br>
    Hand them in to Polzin Mrid and you will receive the final piece of the 
    staff.<br>
    <br>
    34) Head back to the Burning Wood and pay a visit to the Sarnak Imitator 
    again. Ask him for a sack if you do not already have one. <br>
    <br>
    Combine the four pieces of the staff in to the Enchanter's Bag and hand it 
    in.<br>
    <br>
    Congratulations on the Staff of the Serpent.</p>

    Discussion:</font></p>
    </b>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">
    <font face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Before I begin this discussion I would 
    like to note a few things. First of all, the usefulness of a spell is 
    entirely my opinion and other people might have differing opinions. Secondly 
    you should at every level try to get every spell. This is merely a synopsis 
    of what the enchanter spells do and in which order I believe it is best to 
    purchase them. If you are filthy rich, the order doesn’t matter because you 
    will get them all at once anyway! Also, if you have the opportunity to buy a 
    spell, take it, don’t worry if it is “out of order.” Every spell counts!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 1:</font></p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shallow Breath - This spell 
          comes with your enchanter and essentially does 5 damage in a short 
          time. Use it to pull your victims.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Minor Shielding - Also 
          comes with your enchanter. This one raises HP, AC and MR. Keep this 
          line of spells up at all times for the rest of your existence.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Weaken - this spell becomes 
          very useful to you, removing 15 STR from your opponent. It makes you 
          take less damage. Period.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Pendril’s Animation - your 
          first pet spell. Buy some tiny daggers and watch your first few levels 
          become a lot easier. This pet will do a ton of the work for you.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Strengthen - cast on your 
          and your pet to increase your damage output slightly.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Reclaim Energy - Cast on 
          your pet to un-summon it and get a percentage of the mana back. Useful 
          when your pet is near death and you need mana.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Minor Illusion - This is 
          very much a PvP spell. Although it roots you in place you become a 
          small object such as a coin purse, a sword or a tree. You also 
          generally become safe even in hostile areas. Why attack a tree? This 
          doesn’t always hold true, however.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Lull - I’ve always found 
          the lull series of spells to have only minor use. This is generally 
          used when you want to pull only one of two mobs. However, if the lull 
          fails you have both of them and you are in trouble. Always cast this 
          on the further of the two monsters. If not, the running monster will 
          agro the lulled monster. If that doesn’t make sense, just take my word 
          for it, or learn it the hard way hehe.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">True North - points you 
          north. I suggest sense heading or a compass instead.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Taper Enchantment - 
          decreases time remaining on a random buff / DoT, etc. Extremely 
          useless at this level. </p>
        </dir>
      </dir></dir>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 4 (Quick note about level 
      4. This is the level where you become an enchanter. Every single spell in 
      this level is important and 100% necessary):</font></p>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gate - Teleport to your 
          bind point. This quite possibly may be the most used spell in your 
          life next to invisible.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Suffocating Sphere - New 
          DoT Spell. This one does 10 dmg. Use it, live it, learn it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Juli’s Animation - Next pet 
          which is bigger and badder. You’ll be glad you have good old Juli.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Tashan - Lowers your 
          opponent’s Magic Resistance. Makes most of your spells stick / stick 
          better.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mesmerize - The bread and 
          butter of your existence. This spell (when successful) freezes a 
          monster for 24 seconds. The kicker of it is that you cannot attack it 
          either. As long as it is not taking damage it will sit there frozen 
          not able to do anything. Start practicing this spell because it is 
          your most important one. You will also have to educate your group on 
          this spell. You will start to hate your pet for breaking this all the 
          time ;)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Color Flux - Area Effect 
          Stun spell. You will get more of these. When you get 3 of them you can 
          effectively keep 4 mobs perma-stunned. This is an incredibly useful 
          enchanter series that is very underused. The only reason that you 
          shouldn’t be using this often is if you play on a PvP server. In that 
          case, I’ve been ranting about the stupidity of some PvP rules forever 
          (AE hitting group mates and pets is my biggest beef)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Invisibility - Makes you 
          invisible until you attack or cast. For now at this level you can 
          pretty much go anywhere within reason and walk right past the 
          monsters. One very important note is that it has a random duration 
          between 24 seconds and 20 minutes. And it ALWAYS starts fading when 
          you don’t want it to.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enfeeblement - decreases 
          target’s strength by 18-20 and AC by 2. Makes you hurt a lot less. 
          You’ll like it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Half Elf / Human 
          - Important if you are blind or evil. Lets you walk around in relative 
          peace. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Haze - Adds 5AC to you. 
          Could make the difference and will make you get hit lighter when you 
          do get hit.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Fear - Ok, so many of you 
          will be asking why I put this last. Fear is an incredibly useful and 
          powerful spell. In fact with a druid or ranger (9+) grouped with you, 
          you suddenly become and incredible pair. Mana. That is the problem. At 
          level 4, 40 mana is huge. Like a bubble and a half to 2 bars of mana. 
          It just isn’t worth it until level 7 or so. When you reach that level 
          it becomes a godly spell.</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 8:</font></p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Chaotic Feedback - You 
          finally get your first Direct Damage Spell. Right now your Evocation 
          will completely reek. I mean, completely, 100% reekage. You’re going 
          to have to spend some points in it and cast this spell a lot. It will 
          eventually catch up. This like all of our DD spells are “All or 
          Nothing” which means that they either hit for full damage (48 in the 
          case of this spell) or they are completely resisted. These spells also 
          have a stun component to them. The good news is that when it goes 
          through it will interrupt spell casting. The bad news is that the stun 
          component makes it easier to resist, and remember if it is it is 
          resisted all out. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Lesser Shielding - Upgrade 
          to Minor Shielding. More HP, More AC, More MR.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Root - Another bread and 
          butter spell, this one although more commonly used to keep a monster 
          in place while you nuke it (you aren’t a wizard. That is how THEY use 
          root, not you) this spell is much more useful as a crowd control 
          spell. How so? Root has a check to break every tick (6 seconds). It 
          also gets a break check every time you do damage. Furthermore it has 
          another check every time it is stunned. So, every time you nuke it you 
          give it two additional chances to break free. If you root it, leave it 
          there and keep it “out of the fight” it has less chance of breaking 
          and you have done more good.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Myrcil’s Animation - The 
          next pet. You know the drill.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">See Invisible - See all 
          those people that thought they were hiding from you.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Alliance - make people like 
          you even more! Cast this on an NPC and everyone on that faction will 
          like you a whole lot better. Use this in combination with illusions to 
          help survive in hostile waters.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Eye of Confusion - if 
          nobody is within melee range the monster will begin randomly running 
          in random directions. It is fairly entertaining to watch and allows 
          you to make a quick getaway.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Cancel Magic - Use it to 
          take away buffs. Ie. If you begin fighting in lavastorm in a few 
          levels, some things have damage shields. This takes those away making 
          you or your friend’s life easier.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Bind Sight - Step into 
          someone else’s eyes. If you are in a group, step into the puller’s 
          eyes so you can tell your group what is coming and when. If you want 
          to figure out NPC patrols, jump into an NPC’s eyes. Heck do it to a 
          random person to keep tabs on them.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusions: Gnome and Wood 
          Elf - more illusions. More fun. Yay!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sentinal - The laggiest 
          spell ever. Do this - go to your favorite bank, cast this spell and 
          run around the general area for a bit. Repeat a few times. Then just 
          run around. Continuous fog of particle effects :) It doesn’t have much 
          other use. It can be cast down a hall to give a few seconds warning of 
          a train in a dungeon. That is about the only practical use of it</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Soothe - see lull. Same 
          problems, works a bit better and on higher level mobs.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enchant: Silver and 
          Enchant: Clay - These are both only useful for trade skills. If you do 
          them or have friends that do them these spells are useful. If not, you 
          will get little use out of them.</p>

        <dir><dir>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Charm - use it, learn it, 
          live it. It is arguably your most powerful spell at this point. It is 
          also the most dangerous to your health. It could be the difference 
          between you living and dieing, between soloing yellows and dieing to 
          blues. I will be creating a separate charming guide sometime in the 
          future when I have finished all of the class guides. Some useful info: 
          /pet attack - sends your pet to attack. /pet back off - wipes your 
          pet’s hate list. /pet sit down -- sets the pet in one place. /pet 
          follow me - makes the pet follow you.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Choke - your next DoT 
          spell. This one does 80 damage in total over 30 seconds and decreases 
          STR and AGI by 7-10.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Bind Affinity - this spell 
          allows you to change your bind point to almost anywhere. Some zones 
          and areas are exceptions. You can also bind friends in certain areas 
          with this spell (as a rule you can bind them in city zones although 
          other areas to bind do exist).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Languid Pace - This spell 
          is the first slowdown spell that the enchanters get. This decreases 
          attack speed by 30%. This means that you can effectively reduce damage 
          done by the target by 30%. Very helpful spell (note that shamans get 
          better slow spells so if a shaman is in the group, you should let them 
          handle this one)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Memory Blur - This spell 
          wipes the hate list of the monster. This has two huge uses. First of 
          all, if a monster is going ape on a caster or healer in your group, or 
          even on a tank who is close to dead, cast this on the monster. IF it 
          succeeds the monster will stop being mad at everyone and the next 
          person who hits him will get his attention. This also works well in 
          Enchanter / Rogue combinations with non-aggressive mobs. Backstab, mem 
          blur. Backstab, mem blur. Works well. The other use is for 
          powerleveling characters. The enchanter gets the monster almost dead 
          and mem blurs it. If it works the hate list is gone as well as the 
          damage list. This means that the lower level can give the final blow 
          and get all of the exp.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Serpent Sight - All you 
          blind people how have infravision. Congrats.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Whirl Till You Hurl - One 
          of the most uniquely named spells in the game, the usefulness of it is 
          debatable. There are three schools: The people (like me) who swear by 
          it in the low levels and think it is a wicked spell; The people who 
          just whine that it was severely nerfed 3 years ago and refuse to try 
          it out; and the people who say it plain old sucks either way. The 
          spell roots and stuns the target for up to 12 seconds or until the 
          monster is stunned again. Combined with an animation this spell rocks 
          up until level 22 or so (IMHO).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Kilan’s Animation - The 
          next summoned pet. Should still be used often despite getting charm. 
          This is a safer and more reliable alternative, although not as 
          powerful.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Intellectual Advancement - 
          This spell decreases your fizzle rate. Very helpful.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ebbing Strength - Decrease 
          target’s strength by 25. This starts to become an excellent PvP spell. 
          In combination with the DoT spell you can now reduce strength of an 
          opponent by 35. This will not only make melee’s a lot less effective 
          but an opponent carrying a lot of loot will be bogged down by this 
          spell to the point where they start moving very slowly. Versus 
          monsters it is also very effective, and in combination with Languid 
          Pace you can now seriously diminish a monster’s damage output.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enduring Breath - Takes 
          away the need to breathe. Requires fish scales though :(</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Dark Elf, 
          Halfling, High Elf, Erudite - More enchantments to make more people 
          like you :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mist - Adds 8AC. Although 
          this isn’t as good as the Cleric AC buff it helps your tanks in a 
          pinch.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Thicken Mana - As far as I 
          know, this spell is completely useless.</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font color="#D2D200">Level 16:</font></p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enthrall - I place this 
          upgrade to mesmerize first on the list because crowd control really is 
          the enchanter’s bread and butter ability. This mez lasts a lot longer 
          - 48 seconds! You should be using this from now on and will find that 
          you use this spell into your high levels at times.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Breeze - The lesser version 
          of clarity, this mana regen spell was added with Kunark. You will be 
          hounded for this spell from now on, but it is a great ability to have!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Quickness - You are now a 
          melee character’s best friend (hmmm maybe clerics still get their love 
          more than you). This spell increases the rate at which weapons swing 
          by 30%. It is a significant improvement, although it tends to be mana 
          consuming.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Chase the Moon - Fear 
          upgrade. Useful in a fear kiting group or when you are in trouble!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shielding - The upgraded 
          shield spell. This one gives more AC, more MR and more HP :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rune I - The Enchanter 
          heal. This requires a component (Cats Eye Agate) and absorbs up to 
          50hp damage. This can be used in a pinch to keep someone alive while a 
          healer can get a spell off. This is also a good idea to keep on 
          yourself at all times. 2 Gold per cast is kinda expensive for you 
          right now but it will get to the point where it isn’t too bad anymore.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mesmerisation - Area Effect 
          24 second mesmerize. This is both powerful and dangerous. I can’t 
          stress how cool it is to stop a train, but if some get resisted you 
          have a lot of monsters mad at you all at once!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sanity Warp - Your second 
          DD/Stun spell. This one does 95dmg as a maximum. When you first get it 
          it will be slightly below that. As with all the DD’s enchanters get, 
          this one is all or nothing and is resisted more often than we would 
          like.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shalee’s Animation - 
          Another uncontrollable pet. This one has a chance to be a duel-wielder 
          so try giving it an extra weapon :) With your melee buffs you can 
          really make this animation pretty strong! (30% haste means 30% more 
          damage output)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Levitate - Half floating 
          half flying spell. This spell lifts you off the ground and makes you 
          able to run on water, lava, etc just fine. It also helps on rough 
          terrain because you won’t fall for damage. Unfortunately it isn’t a 
          flying spell so you will float downwards to about 3 feet off the 
          ground whenever you levitate off something high.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Disempower - Lower your 
          target’s strength, stamina and AC by up to 20, 15 and 9 respectively. 
          This is a GREAT PvP spell, especially in combination with your DoT and 
          weaken spells.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Invis vs. Undead - Does 
          exactly what it says. Makes you invisible to the undead. You can’t be 
          invis to dead and alive at once though :(</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Barbarian, Dwarf, 
          Tree - Good for adjusting various factions. Tree makes you neutral to 
          pretty much any animal or undead.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enchant Electrum - Useful 
          for jewelcraft. This turns a bar of Electrum into a bar of Enchanted 
          Electrum.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Tashani - Upgraded Tashan. 
          This one does a maximum of 23 MR taken away and is once again 
          unresistable and unleashs mad amounts of taunt :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Color Shift - Area Effect 6 
          second stun. Combined with color flux this is a great group tool and 
          solo tool if you are in a bind and about to die. 6 seconds is a LOT of 
          time to make a getaway.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Intellectual Superiority - 
          Decreases Fizzle rate. Always a helpful ability.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Feckless Might - Your next 
          Strength Debuffer. You are a strength debuffing machine! Again, a very 
          under-used and excellent PvP ability. This one takes away up to 30 
          strength.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sympathetic Aura - Increase 
          your Charisma (or anyone else’s for that matter) by up to 18 points. 
          Great for when you are charming, mezzing, or buying / selling. As you 
          might guess that means that you should have it up at all times :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Berserker Strength - A 
          single target Melee Buff and 50hp RUNE. The upside is that it requires 
          no component. At this point though a 50HP buffer isn’t much at all. 
          However it is still worth it if it saves your tank and it doesn’t hurt 
          to throw it on now and again if you have extra mana.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sisna’s Animation - Next 
          animation. You know the drill. This one always duel wields (sweet)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Endure Magic - Increase 
          your MR by 20 points. This is especially important on PvP servers, if 
          you are fighting casters or if you are using AE Mez spells.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Cloud - Next AC Buff. This 
          one gives an extra 11AC max. Once again, good to have when a cleric 
          isn’t available.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Benevolance - Upgrade to 
          Alliance. Nuff said.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Iksar, Troll, 
          Ogre -- More various illusions. The Troll one gives you slightly 
          higher regeneration but you become atrociously ugly.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shifting Sight - You 
          inherit your target’s eyes and gain infravision :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Crystalize Mana - Another 
          trade-skill related summon.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Beguile - Your next charm 
          spell. This one is good against monsters up to level 39.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Alacrity - 40% Hate. Very 
          nice. You are still a melee’s best (or close to best) friend, and this 
          just re-affirms your position.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rune II - The next in the 
          line of emergency damage absorbtion spells. This one can absorb up to 
          118 damage and costs a bloodstone.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Major Shielding - Next in 
          the common magi line of Shielding Spells. This one once again gives 
          more AC, more HP and more MR.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Tepid Deeds - A monster 
          that is 50% slowed does 50% less damage. Very useful for when a shaman 
          isn’t handy at the time.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Chaos Flux - 150DD is 
          getting weaker and weaker for your level, but you aren’t a nuker. 
          However, when push comes to shove and something has to die, this does 
          the job. Its all or nothing and has a stun component as usual.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Sagar’s Animation - 
          Animations are getting less and less useful, however they still useful 
          in a soloing situation.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Strip Enchantment - Takes 
          off up to 4 enchantments. Excellent for PvP and against buffed NPC’s.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Skeleton / Earth 
          Elemental - More illusions. Warning - most guards don’t like these 
          two.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Invigor - Give someone back 
          all his or her vigor. Limited use spell, but necessary in some 
          circumstances (Kedge raid anyone?)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enchant: Gold - Turns a bar 
          of gold on the mouse to an enchanter bar of gold. Used for Jewelcraft.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Clarity - Why? So Newbies 
          can bug you of course! If you don’t know why this is the number one 
          spell for this level, go back and play a warrior.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Augmentation - A super 
          melee buff combining haste, AC, Agility and stamina regen. It is also 
          long lasting.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Haunting Visage - Throw 
          this on your tanks. It increases their hate output so monsters hate 
          them more than you and your caster buddies. Its always a good thing.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Suffocate - 263dmg over a 
          min and 48 seconds as well as up to 20 strength and agility removed 
          for that time… who doesn’t like this spell?</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Listless power - remove up 
          to 35 strength and agility as well as up to 18 AC. With this and 
          Suffocate you can take strength down by up to 55 and agility down up 
          to 55. In PvP these two spells together are absolutely amazing. 55 
          strength will make most people overweight further decreasing their 
          agility and bringing them to a slow crawl.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enstill - This is an 
          upgraded root spell which will bring your target to a halt for up to 
          96 seconds. Its basically a poor man’s Enthrall, yet it works 
          surprisingly well in a trained group.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Feedback - Your only damage 
          shield (other than fire elemental) which does 11 damage. Helpful when 
          there is no mage or druid around to throw out a damage shield on the 
          tanks. This spell DOES NOT stack with illusion: fire elemental (at 
          least it didn’t a year ago when I was playing my enchanter).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ultravision - Give yourself 
          the best night vision available. Better yet, give your poor blind 
          human friend the best night vision available. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Obscure - Increase AC by up 
          to 14. Although not as effective as the clerc’s AC increasing line, 
          this is good when a cleric isn’t around or to buff the casters to save 
          the cleric a bit of mana.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Air / Water 
          Elemental - These two spells give you elemental form and bonuses. The 
          Air Elemental has a built in levitate (no more batwings!) and the 
          Water elemental has built in water breathing (no more fish scales!)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Nullify magic - remove 2 
          enchantments. Alright so you are wondering “Why this over Strip 
          enchantment which removes 4?” Here is the simple answer. Strip 
          enchantment removes UP TO 4 enchantments. This means it could be 0, 1, 
          2, 3 or 4. Nullify magic either takes no enchantments or 2 
          enchantments. This is good when you want to take off a DoT spell or a 
          snare or root but don’t want to have a chance of wiping out half of 
          your buffs either.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Uleen’s Animation - Those 
          animations are getting less and less useful. They are still good for 
          certain situations (fear kiting) but not for much else.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dyn’s Dizzying Draught - 
          This odd spell is like whirl to you hurl, but worse. It is easily the 
          more useful of the two. Not only is it very often resisted, it takes a 
          ton of mana, is easily broken and now drains mana (causing more 
          resistance checks). Just… don’t use it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Curse of the Simply Mind - 
          Debuffs INT and WIS stats. Only useful in PvP as far as I’m concerned. 
          However, there have been rumors that Wisdom affects your chance of 
          resisting mind-altering spells such as charm. In this theory casting 
          this first would increase the duration of a charm. I’ve never noticed 
          a difference, but feel I should mention this so I don’t get flamed ;)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Clarify Mana - More trade 
          skill mana summoning junk stuff. (can you tell I’m not into trade 
          skills?)</p>

          72 seconds if nobody fiddles with it :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Radiant Visage - add 30 
          charisma to yourself. Helps with the mind-control spells.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rune III - This is going to 
          be your most used run spell. It is an emergency absorber for up to 230 
          damage and costs a jasper.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Anarchy - Next in your 
          DD/Stun series of spells, this one unleashes a fair punch of up to 233 
          damage</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Greater Shielding - More 
          HP, More AC, More MR. Same deal.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Insipid Weakness - Debuff 
          your opponents for up to a brutal 51 STR. Combined with your latest 
          DoT this could cripple them by up to 71 Strength, Easily enough to 
          encumber most people.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Boltran’s Animation - At 
          this point, the animation is only good as an extra damage dealer in 
          the group. It is a lot more efficient now, because it will not attack 
          mezzed targets making it more useful at higher levels.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Fire Elemental - 
          Get yourself a fire elemental look as well as up to 16 damage in 
          Damage shield goodness.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mana Sieve - Make your 
          target lose mana. This is a great spell for PvP and When you have 
          several enchanters sieving an Ultra (Boss) Mob to make sure it can’t 
          cast anything.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gift of Magic - Increases 
          your target’s mana pool. Not a bad buff to have :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Cast Sight - See through 
          your target’s eyes with Ultravision. Yay!</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Celerity - Making your 
          Tanks his 50% faster gives them a 50% boost in damage and taunt. 
          Always a good thing.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Calming Visage - Makes your 
          target generate 10% less hate.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Immobilize - The next spell 
          in the root line, this spell is quick casting and holds a monster in 
          place for about a minute.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Insight - This nice buff 
          increases both wisdom (up to 14) and intelligence (up to 10).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Aany’s Animation - The next 
          animation, once again, good for extra damage in your group.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Invoke Fear - Your newest 
          and coolest fear spell, this one can last up to 42 seconds. Excellent 
          for group (or partner) fear kiting.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Resist Magic - Because you 
          deal with so many mind altering spells, some of which are AE, it is 
          always good to keep your magic resistance high. This spell helps with 
          that, adding an extra 40MR</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gravity Flux - Mostly used 
          as a joke spell, this is actually a very good PvP spell. If you find 
          someone with low magic resistance, forget about the mez - nuke 
          formula, start chain casting this puppy. Every time they land they 
          will take considerable damage and when they are low, just mez, get 
          some mana and nuke them down for the kill. Don’t try this on rogues, 
          monks or Vah Shir (all of which have safe-fall abilities)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shade - Increases your 
          target’s AC by up to 17. Again, helpful when cleric is low on mana or 
          not present.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Mind Wipe - There really is 
          nothing like seeing 6 monsters stop in their tracks all at once and 
          forget why they were so mad in the first place. This is a REALLY fun 
          spell for showing off in newbie dungeons and watching everyone Ohh and 
          Ahh when the train walks off scratching their heads. It is also 
          somewhat useful in the real game where you can try to get normally 
          non-aggressive mobs off your group. It is just an Area Effect Memory 
          Blur spell.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Wandering Mind - A mana 
          drain over time spell, this takes 120 mana over a period of 2 minutes 
          and gives it to you. Helpful for increasing your mana regeneration.`</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Drybone / Spirit 
          Wolf - These illusions make you a skeleton or a Wolf. They both come 
          with some bonuses (unfortunately, SoW Isn’t one)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Pacify - Reduces agro range

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Tashania - Decrease your 
          target’s MR by even more with this extension of the tashan line. This 
          one decreases it by up to 33MR</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Incapasitate - One of the 
          PvP Mother spells, this baby decreases Strength and Agility by up to 
          55 points and AC by up to 24 points. It really does incapasitate 
          people.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Weakness - Combining this 
          spell with the last one creates devastating effects. This spell 
          decreases Strength by 60 points. Lets just take a scenario here on 
          PvP. Take an average Warrior of this level. Lets say he has about 200 
          Strength. Now with these two spells alone, every pound of weight over 
          115 is going to encumber him. Add to this the 55 agility he lost 
          before and he is going to be as good as snared. Who needs Root?</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Color Skew - The next in 
          the color flux line of spells. If your enemies aren’t too magic 
          resistant, wit this and the previous two spells you can take a group 
          of enemies out of the equation indefinitely</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Discordant Mind - DD’ing 
          isn’t an enchanter’s specialty, but 528 damage in a single nuke at 
          level 44 is fairly respectable! Less than 75 damage less than the 
          mage’s best nuke at this level. Also has the all-or-nothing and stun 
          components</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Arch Shielding - upgrade to 
          the HP/AC/MR line of self-only buffs. Use it, learn it, live it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Boon of the Garu - How 
          would you like to get an extra 40 ATK, 100DEX and a 27pt lifetap proc? 
          How about werewolf form? Well then this spell is for you. Cast it on 
          your tanks and they’ll love you forever. This is one you have to keep 
          memmed due to 3 minute recast. The spell has a 6 minute duration</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shiftless Deeds - Slow the 
          target by 65%. Good for PvE and PvP</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Brilliance - Increase INT 
          by up to 14 and WIS by up to 6. This won’t stack with any other INT/WIS 
          stat buff.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Pillage Enchantment - An

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Yeogreff’s Animation - Your

          damage for a “weak enchanter pet.”</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Summon Companion - Summon 
          your pet to you. Helpful when it gets stuck or lost.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rune IV - Another rune 
          spell. Although this is a lot more powerful than rune III it also 
          costs a lot more. The required component, a peridot, costs around 
          10pp. I don’t use it a lot, but for the wealthy enchanters around, 
          you’ll be loved!</p>

          near 96 seconds.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gasping Embrace - DoT for

          frame.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Swift Like the Wind - 60%

          on all your tanks until the next upgrade to it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Blanket of Forgetfullness - 
          Known as both the high level mem blur and the ultimate train stopper, 
          this AE mem blur works fairly reliably versus higher level monsters 
          and almost always on lower level mobs (we’re talking 99%+ of the time)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Adorning Grace - Increase 
          your Charisma by 40 points. Helpful for charming and all those other 
          fun mind-bending spells.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Berserker Spirit - Get 
          40STR and Lose 20AGI. The other upside is that you get a bonus, 
          componentless 200hp Rune. This is good for twinking melee characters.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Imp - Hey, its

          making it very useful in a well oiled group in an open area.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shadow - This upgrade to 
          the AC line of buffs is worth a maximum of 20AC. While not as good as 
          the cleric’s AC buff it helps them with the mana or if they aren’t 
          there to do that job.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Kintaz’s Animation - Your 
          level 50 pet. Although the dumb thing doesn’t do what you say most of 
          the time, it does defend you when it gets whacked. With a weapon and 
          swift like the wind it actually isn’t half bad. It hits for a max of 
          52 and with quadding and such can be a real asset, especially in 
          duels. Enchanters are always amazed the first time they see their 
          crappy pet take down a giant :) Everquest Trivia: Kintaz is Zatnik 
          spelled backwards, as in Geoffrey Zatnik the spell designer for EQ.

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Collaboration - Upgrade to

          NPC quite considerably.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Theft of Thought - Steals 
          up to 400 Mana from a target. The target must have a mana bar (ie. No 
          Warrior NPC’s!). Very good PvP Spell versus other casters :)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Wake of Tranquility - 
          Harmony that can be resisted. This means that you are almost garunteed 
          to have a slew of angry mobs chasing you. I can’t think of any reason 
          that you would EVER want to use this spell. In fact it is resisted by

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Trickster’s Augmentation - 
          This is a great buff to throw on your main tank. It gives them imp 
          form, levitation, 30 Fire resistance and makes them proc a 75DD + 
          taunt effect.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rune V - This next rune 
          spell is incredibly powerful. It gives up to 700HP in buffer and costs 
          the same component as Rune IV. This is a lifesaving spell. It has a 
          big taunt factor to it though so get ready to stun the monsters when 
          they come after you.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Boon of the Clear Mind - 
          Group Clarity. Makes your life easier.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Color Slant - The next in 
          your color line of stuns, you can take out groups of monsters 
          indefinitely when you use them all properly. This one also has a mana 
          drain component.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Fascination - AE 36 Second 
          mez. I tend to dislike this spell because it normally leads to certain 
          death. However, this works fairly reliably on light blue monsters and 
          is ok if you are in a situation where you want to save a newbie friend 
          or whatever.</p>

          should be given to as many tanks as mana can afford</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Boltran’s Agacerie - This 
          is your latest Charm spell. It caps at level 53 MOBS in Norrath and 
          level 51 MOBS in the outer Planes.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Cripple - One of the holy 
          grails of PvP, this spell is deadly on its own but unspeakably good 
          when combined with other spells. Alone it debuffs STR and AGI by up to 
          75 points, DEX by up to 65 points and AC by up to 33. When combined 
          with other debuff spells this renders a melee character completely 
          helpless.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Recant magic - Upgrade to 
          Pillage Enchantment. This should be your buff-stripping spell of

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Beguiling Visage - Self

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Glamour of Kintaz - This is

          carries a powerful memory blur with it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dementia - Your latest all 
          or nothing nuke / stun spell. This one gives a punch for 675 damage.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Shield of the Magi - The 
          last spell in your personal HP / AC / MR line of spells. This final 
          version gives a maximum of 250HP, 25MR and 32AC.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Illusion: Vah Shir - It 
          baffles me why you don’t get this illusion until level 54 considering 
          you can become any other race much earlier in your career. I guess 
          that Shar Val not KOS’ing any race does help. What is more, the spell

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gift of Insight - This

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Memory Flux - This is an 
          upgraded memory blur spell that has a very low resist rate and can get 
          you down on the hate list quickly. It has had mixed reviews in 
          application, with some enchanters swearing by it and some swearing at 
          it.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Largarn’s Lamentation - 
          This is a single target 8 second stun spell. It has a lot of good 
          applications and is resisted a lot less frequently than the AE stun 
          spells. It also doesn’t have the chance to start a massive train in a 
          multi-floor dungeon.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Wind of Tashani - an AE 
          tashan spell. In my experience this spell should be renamed “suicide”.

          debuffs Intellect and Wisdom by 21 points over that time period.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Horrifying Visage -

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Overwhelming Splendor -

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Trepidation - 36 second 
          high level fear spell. This one works on higher level monsters than 
          your last fear spell and will last longer on high level monsters a 
          well. At this point in the game, keeping a monster feared for the full 
          36 seconds isn’t very realistic unless it is a low blue.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Umbra - Your last AC spell,

          no cleric there for AC buffing.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Enlightenment - Increase

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Tashanian - This is your

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Glamerous Visage - This 
          spell gives your target 18 seconds of reduced agro output (30% less). 
          It is good to cast on a wizard about to do something big, or perhaps a

          backstabbing ways.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dementing Visions - This is 
          a low-resist enchanter DD / spell interrupter. It does 675 damage.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Fetter - Your last root (aka 
          poor man’s mez) spell! This one can last up to 180 seconds if you 
          don’t bother the monster much. It can be effective with a well trained 
          group in an open area and lasts much longer than a mesmerize spell.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Rapture - This is an almost 
          unresistable mesmerize spell which lets an enchanter keep one monster 
          down pretty much indefinitely. However, because of re-cast time and 
          duration as well as the high mana cost this spell would not be able to 
          keep two or more monsters mezzed.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Asphyxiate - Your last DoT 
          Spell. This one breaks the 1000 damage barrier for a total of 1010dmg 
          over 2 minutes. It also has the effect of crippling STR and AGI by up 
          to 40 each. Combined with Cripple you can take down your opponents 
          Strength and Agility by 115 points each. The nice thing about this is 
          that for anyone carrying 100 or so lbs worth of stuff it will make 
          them either unable to move or close enough to it that it won’t make a 
          difference.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gift of Pure Thought - This 
          one is a group clarity II. Easier on the mana and quicker than buffing 
          everyone sperately</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Well you are here. You made it to 
    the height of your career. Get the ridiculously rare ancient spells and you 
    will be in an elite club of level 60’s who have every spell available to 
    them. Congratulations! Because some level 60 spells are so difficult to get 
    the order doesn’t really matter. You should get them all ASAP!</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Koadic’s Endless Intellect 
          - Kai is one of those Holy grails. It is the ultimate Everquest drug. 
          It is essentially not only clarity III but a group clarity III with 
          some extra bonuses. This baby increases mana regen by 14 per tick, 
          increases INT and WIS by 17 each and gives you an extra 250 mana in 
          your pool. People pay 50pp+ for this spell on some servers so you 
          could probably making a living being a drug dealer. All hail the 
          Luclin expansion!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dictate - This is a fixed 
          duration charm. Yes you heard that correct, fixed duration. Once under 
          the influence you have a guaranteed 48 seconds before this monster 
          comes to beat the crap out of you. Enjoy!</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ancient: Eternal Rapture - 
          this upgrade to rapture is either completely or virtually unresistable. 
          It lasts around 30 seconds. This spell only drops in the toughest of 
          Luclin zones</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Gift of Brilliance - Adds 
          150 mana to your pool and gives you an extra 2 mana per tick 
          regeneration. I’m not sure whether or not it stacks with KAI.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Ancient: Chaotic Visions - 
          A very low resistance nuke that does 775 damage. Easily your best DD 
          spell. As always it interrupts casting and is all-or-nothing.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Speed of the Brood - This
          <u>group</u> buff is incredibly powerful. It gives everyone a 66% 
          haste (second best haste spell in the game), increases agility by 40 
          points and gives some armor class. It also lasts 30 minutes compared 
          to wonderous rapidity’s 20 minutes. Don’t forget this does it to 
          EVERYONE in the group (or target group).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Visions of Grandeur - An 
          upgrade to the augment line of spells this one lasts 42 minutes and 
          gives 58% haste, 40 AGI, 25 DEX and 15ATK. Unfortunately it doesn’t 
          stack with the Shaman buff Avatar.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Wind of Tishanian - Renamed: 
    Upgraded suicide. This AE tashan does 40MR damage to each monster in the 
    radius and successfully gets every single one of them to beat the living 
    shit out of you. The only non-suicidal use for this spell would be in a 
    group PvP situation.</font></p></dir></dir></dir>

    and have some of the coolest and most unique abilities in the game. Please 
    stay tuned as I will be adding many new guides in the future. On the plate 
    within the next little while is a general charming guide, which will apply 
    to enchanters as well as necros, druids, and bards. I will also be writing 
    an Alternate Ability Experience guide which will be applicable to all 
    classes, including enchanters.</p>
