<P>
Each weekend many raids will be planned - these may be organised at that time given the number of members on.  Raids will be decided by the guild officers and leader. The raid location and desired aim can however can be discussed and requests made via the Emissaries of Dread website.  Should there be many requests for raids the Website can queue them.
</p>

<p>
It is a policy that to remain a guild member he/she must participate in all raids if that player in the guild is online at the time.  Failure to participate will result in a warning and then later removal from the guild. <BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that if a player is only online for a certain amount of time during a raid weekend or midweek raid and they cannot make the raid then they should play an alta character. The nature of EoD is that 'If you're on-line your on the raid - or you're not in the guild.'<BR>

Raid loot is handed in the following manor:</p>
<table cellspacing=10> 
        <tr><td valign="top">1.</td><td>Each guild member joins the Emissaries of Dread with 20 raid credits (RC).</td></tr>
        <tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td>Each time a guild member participates on an official raid they will receive an additional 5rc.</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td>Whenever a valued item is found on a raid the following procedure will be adhered to:
	<table cellspacing=6>
                <tr><td valign=top>i</td><td>The Item is checked (not looted) and broadcasted out to other members (Class, Race & Stats).</td></tr>

                <tr><td valign=top>ii</td><td>All members which match that Race & Class will be included in the RC check.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>iii</td><td>Each member included will have their RC checked, should there be an overall highest RC rating amongst those members they will be automatically awarded that item.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>iv</td><td>If two or more members have the same RC then that item will be subject to lotto. The lotto is made by the raid leader using /rand 1 n (where n is the number of people in the lottery). The item is assigned alphabetically in relation to the random number returned.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>v</td><td>Once an item has been won that member's RC is reduced to 20 again. That member may still participate further items on that raid.</td></tr>

                If there is no race/class witch matches the item criteria then the above rules apply to all members.

                Please note that a member may refuse to use their RC/participate in lottery for a particular item - and therefore the item will bypass them - they however retain the RC for another loot on this or another raid.</td></tr>
<BR><BR>
	</table>
        <tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td>The Guild somtimes allows non guild members to join on raids.  If this is the situation the raid credit system cannot be used - however members can gain credits for being present.</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top">5.</td><td>Raid disputes will be settled by either the Guild Leader, Officer or Raid Organiser in that order. Their decision on loot is final as long as it adheres to these policies.</td></tr>
