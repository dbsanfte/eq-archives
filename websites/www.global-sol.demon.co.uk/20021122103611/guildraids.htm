<P>
Each weekend many raids will be planned - these may be organised at that time given the number of members on.  Raids will be decided by the guild officers and leader. The raid location and desired aim can however can be discussed and requests made via the Emissaries of Dread website.  Should there be many requests for raids the Website can queue them.
</p>

<p>
It is a policy that to remain a guild member he/she must participate in all raids if that player in the guild is online at the time.  Failure to participate will result in a warning and then later removal from the guild. <BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that if a player is only online for a certain amount of time during a raid weekend or midweek raid and they cannot make the raid then they should play an alta character. The nature of EoD is that 'If you're on-line your on the raid - or you're not in the guild.'<BR>
<BR>
Raid loot is handed in the following manor:</p>
<table cellspacing=10> 
        <tr><td valign="top">1.</td><td>Each guild member joins the Emissaries of Dread with zero raid credits (RC).</td></tr>
        <tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td>Each time a guild member participates on an official raid they will receive an additional number of credits.</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td>Whenever a valued item is found on a raid the following procedure will be adhered to:
	<table cellspacing=6>
                <tr><td valign=top>i</td><td>The Item is checked (not looted) and broadcasted out to other members (Class, Race & Stats).</td></tr>

                <tr><td valign=top>ii</td><td>All members which match that Race & Class will be allowed to BID using their Raid Credits.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>iii</td><td>The raid leader will tell all bidding members the points (who has what) and who is bidding.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>iv</td><td>Members then tell the leader their bid.  They may only bid once.  The member which bids the most will win the item.  All bids are anonymos.</td></tr>
                <tr><td valign=top>v</td><td>The winning member will have their credits deducted from their score sheet after the raid.</td></tr>

<BR><BR>
	</table>
	<tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td>Raid disputes will be settled by either the Guild Leader, Officer or Raid Organiser in that order. Their decision on loot is final as long as it adheres to these policies.</td></tr>
