LOOT POLICY<br>
##############################################</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>1</b>. If a &quot;need before greed&quot; non-no
drop item is looted, this item belongs to the guild. If you upgrade your
equipment beyond the item, it is to be given to a guild officer for
redistribution to someone else who &quot;needs&quot; the item. (Note : This only
applies to items at guild events, not personally acquired items.)<br>
<br>
<b>2</b>. Item hunts are to strengthen Divine Legion by equipping its members
better.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> Only divine legion members that can use an item and will equip the 
item looted can lotto for the item. Needed class: if your asked to bring an alt 
loot rights for your main MUST be stated before you start the raid and cleared 
by an officer.</font><b><br>
</b><font color="#800000"><br>
<br>
<b>4</b>. Members at events may not roll for another member that is not present. 
You must be at the event in order to lotto the item. You may not roll for an alt 
(see rule 3 ) camped at an event. Camped Alt’s may only loot items that are 
going to rot.<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b> After everyone present has won an item or quest armor piece then you 
may roll for another item. (class only to include plate chain leather silk) 
all/all items if upgrades are rolled by ranks till everyone has one, then the 
item is cash loot 1 – 200. One armor type does not count more then another, 
winning a bracer is the same as winning leggings or a breastplate. If no one 
wants to roll for an armor or quest item those in that class can then roll 1 – 
200 for the item with out using up their primary roll and would be able to roll 
on the next item.<!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><br>
<font color="#800000"><br>
<br>
<b>6</b>. If someone is late for a DL event, they will sit out one lotto before
they can participate in the lotto.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Loot Discrepancy :<br>
</b>If for any reason that you feel that an officer is calling out loot wrong.
(I.E. All Bards roll for Bard Helm; One of the bards was late for the event and
should not be rolling) Use the /t Raid leader to correct the call before you
roll.<br>
***By rolling you accept the officers decision, and forfeit any argument or 
chance that they could be wrong about who should be rolling.<!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><b><br>
</b><font color="#800000"><b><br>
</b>
<br>
<b>8. Divine Legion Ranking:<br>
</b>Showing up on raids more often increases your status as a DL member. Along
with the title you also will have a higher percentage to acquire items on raids.<br>
<br>
The rank based rolling is used on member upgrade items only. This does not apply
to general loot that everyone gets to roll on. General loot is /ran 1 200.<br>
<br>
<b>Lord (&gt;45 raids) /ran 900 1000<br>
Noble (41-45 raids) /ran 800 1000<br>
Grand Knight (35-40 raids) /ran 700 1000<br>
Knight (30-34 raids) /ran 600 1000<br>
Apprentice Knight (25-29 raids) /ran 500 1000<br>
Guardsman (20-24 raids) /ran 400 1000<br>
Defender (16-20 raids) /ran 300 1000<br>
Sentry (11-15 raids) /ran 200 1000<br>
Apprentice (6-10 raids) /ran 100 1000<br>
Alts (0 - 5 raids) /ran 1 1000 (Secondary of a Guild Member)</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000">
<b>Probationary Recruit (0 - 5 raids) does not roll (until after 5 raids has been
reached)<br>
</b><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000">
<b>9. What Qualifies as a DL raid :<br>
</b>a. Any raid that is posted on the board by a raid officer.<br>
b. Any pickup raid with more than one group, that is lead by a raid officer.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Raid Officer responsibilities :<br>
</b>After a raid is finished the raid officer will update the message board
posts of the attendance of the raid. It the raid leaders responsibility to
ensure that this list is kept up to date.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Leaving early and showing up late to DL raids:<br>
</b>Leaving early on a raid may make you non-applicable for your ranking point.
This will be up to the Raid Leader.<br>
Showing up late for a raid may also make you non-applicable for the point. This
again is up to the Raid Leader.<br>
<br>
<b>12. Secondary:<br>
</b>Secondary and primaries may have separate ranking. If your one character has
been to 15 raids, and your other has been to 3 raids. Char one is a Sentry, and
the other is a Recruit. They do not stack raids.<br>
<br>
<b>13. Disciplinary Action:<br>
</b>Behavior that calls for Disciplinary Action includes but is not restricted 
to:<br>
*Rolling out of rank. (I.E. Someone with 10 raid points trying to sneak in a 600 
- 1000 roll).<br>
*Endangering raids, or acting out of conduct during raids<!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>.&nbsp;
</i><br>
*Rolling your rank on items that are not upgrades to your equipment. (Does not 
include 1-200 cash loots)<br>
*Tarnishing Divine Legions name and or reputation due to actions made or words 
spoken.<br>
*Excessive improper use of the guild or raid chat channels.<br>
<br>
Things that need this attention will be handled by the Guild Leader and the
Officer to ensure that the Disciplinary Action, if needing to be taken, is fair
and just. Rank could be removed (raid count); removal from the guild or other
actions could be taken. Nobody but the guild leader has the ability to enforce
any disciplinary action.<br>

LOOT POLICY FAQ<br>
##############################################<br>
<br>
</font>Q: I work a lot and don't get to play that often, but I show up to raids
when I can, how will I ever get loot when there will be someone that will be
rolling 900-1000 when I will have to roll a 200-1000?<br>
</b><br>
A: Actually you will be able to get more loot than you think. If someone is
rolling a 900-1000 that means they have been at 45+ raids. The odds are that
they have most every item under the sun. So they most likely will not be rolling
due to the fact the item will not be an upgrade to them. If the item is an
upgrade for them you will have a lesser chance of winning, but due to
participation, they in all fairness SHOULD have a better chance of winning than
you. But you still could win the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q: I live in PST time and it seems allot of raids are EST, I usually can show
up for weekday raids, but I always am late due to my work/family time schedule.
How will I ever get points to increase my ranking?<br>
</b><br>
A: You will get points just as anyone would, the giving of raid points is up to
the discursion of the raid leader. We of course know that RL comes first. If you
are late but are making effort you most likely will get points. The only reason
this is enforced is to protect ourselves from members that show up late on
purpose to avoid raid prep time and setup (Which is essential to large raids).
Prep times usually take 15 minutes to an hour. If too many people are late this
time can take up to 2 hours to get groups together and manage break-in and/or
target strategies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q: I looted a &quot;club of the ice ocean&quot; on a DL raid, I wanted to
sell it so I can buy a better breastplate for myself. Can I do this?<br>
</b>A: Absolute not. Any item acquired on a guild event has to stay in the guild
until all members in the guild have better items. When uber loot is won, if you
leave the guild, upgrade beyond, going to delete your char, going to quit the
game, selling your account, or for any reason don't need the item anymore it is
to be given to a guild officer for redistribution to someone that
&quot;needs&quot; the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q: Why is the loot policy this way? why can't we just all lotto the same no
matter how much I participate in the guild?<br>
</b><br>
A:<br>
1. The main reason we are changing them is &quot;Murphy's Law&quot;. People that
make A LOT of effort to the guild almost never win the nice items. I can think
of about 10 things off the top of my head where I said to myself.... &quot;Man,
I hope this person wins because they really need/deserve this item&quot;... And
of course when ever I think that, the person NEVER wins.<br>
<br>
2. Another reason is to ensure that the members that show up to the majority of
our raids have the nice items so they can use them in the majority of the raids
to come.<br>
<br>
3. Don't get me wrong, the members that cannot show up to the majority of raids
still have a chance of winning nice items, it will just not be as great as the
members that participate more. (so don't think you will be shut out)<br>
<br>
4. The ranking will also give a sense of achievement in the guild. To be Lord
Montage, will be a personal goal of mine. And I will be proud to show off my
title in my sig, in my inspection notes when someone right clicks me, and on the
web site when my name is listed among the other high ranking members of the best
guild on ARo server.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: I am on probation and am new to the guild. I have been at two raids. Will
I immediately be able to roll for loot when I am on my 6th raid? As will no
longer be on probation.<br>
</b><br>
A: Most likely yes. When you reach your 6th raid the guild officers take a vote
to make certain new recruites are DL material. When you hit your 5th your
probation could either be extended, you could be removed, or you will be Sentry
&lt;your name here&gt; of the Divine Legion, which will make you able to roll
100-1000 on any item that is an upgrade to your equipment. If you are not able 
to attend 6 raids within 30 days, you will be voted on based on time, during the 
week after your 30th day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q: I put in a application for Divine Legion, but if I joined I think it would
take months before I could actually win loot. Is this true?<br>
</b><br>
A: Not true, everyone has a chance to win after probation is done. Just not as
much as the old timers in the guild. But keep in mind, that the old timers are
pretty decked out, and with a need before greed policy they usually will not
roll because the item will not be an upgrade for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q: With this type of loot policy doesn't it create fair weathered raiders?
For example, if a warrior is in full indi, why would he want to go to Hate?<br>
</b><br>
A: Not necessarily. One thing to keep in mind, the majority of our members are<b>
VERY </b>pro guild. If someone needs help or is needed on a raid they are there <b>WITHOUT</b>
question. So this type of situation doesn't come up very often. But... on the
other hand it would be to anyone's best interest to attend as many raids a
possible for these reasons :<br>
<br>
1. We have a ton of fun on our raids<br>
2. If you got a raid you get a point for it, which will make increase your
ranking when you do go on a guild raid that items for you drop.<br>
3. Fighting together as a team is the biggest strong point of our guild, I have
seen us take targets with 1/3'd the amount of people that I have seen other
guilds take. And the more we fight together the better we get.<br>
4. We have a ton of fun on our raids</font></p>
