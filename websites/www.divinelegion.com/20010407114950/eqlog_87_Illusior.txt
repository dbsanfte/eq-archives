[Sat Mar 24 19:46:25 2001] Montage says, 'we are getting to the point now... where we have seen it before and know how to deal with it'
[Sat Mar 24 19:47:22 2001] Montage says, 'What I am getting at with that point is to keep in mind if you have problems that you can handle yourself to take the weight off Myself, Ill's and Ree's back.  It will only make us stronger... and the three of us less burnt out :)'
[Sat Mar 24 19:47:35 2001] Lancelet says, 'same way im sure'
[Sat Mar 24 19:48:04 2001] Montage says, 'The officer changes that I am making are going to be put together soon, but I want to let everyone know in person what the game plan is'

[Sat Mar 24 19:49:12 2001] Montage says, 'At this point we are going to elect up to 5 people as "Raid Leaders"'
[Sat Mar 24 19:49:40 2001] Montage says, 'Not everyone can be a raid leader, but this will be a key to our success as we get better'

[Sat Mar 24 19:49:56 2001] Montage says, 'One of the most important things on how we handle our guild is how our raids are run'
[Sat Mar 24 19:50:00 2001] Reeiyna tells the guild, 'arena.... but we are almost thru I think...brief meeting.'
[Sat Mar 24 19:50:09 2001] Montage says, 'As the raids that we have are what defines our guilds power'
[Sat Mar 24 19:50:45 2001] Ainadine tells the guild, 'can someone pick me up in wc?'
[Sat Mar 24 19:50:56 2001] Montage says, 'By having a set of raid leaders that we can post as having the ability to lead raids,   will insure that things do not get out of hand'
[Sat Mar 24 19:50:59 2001] Reeiyna tells the guild, 'get with booney and qalaman Ain..they can hook you up'
[Sat Mar 24 19:51:16 2001] Ainadine tells the guild, 'BOONEY hook me up'

[Sat Mar 24 19:52:36 2001] Urgetakil burps loudly.
[Sat Mar 24 19:52:39 2001] Zendel tells the guild, 'hmm'
[Sat Mar 24 19:52:44 2001] Montage says, 'these raid leaders will have other responsibilies that are based around our message board on the web site,  but I will speek with them all personally on what those responsibities will be'
[Sat Mar 24 19:52:47 2001] Zendel tells the guild, 'went wrong way'
[Sat Mar 24 19:53:26 2001] Montage says, 'I have set up a number of 5 raid leaders as a number that we will have to start with,  but that number can change as we find people that can lead raids well'
[Sat Mar 24 19:54:12 2001] Montage says, 'As far as officer changes that will be it.   the other change will be on how we suggest raids.  this is everyone's responsibility'
[Sat Mar 24 19:54:39 2001] Montage says, 'we have a section on our website called "Raid Suggestions".   It is imperative that this gets used.'
[Sat Mar 24 19:55:11 2001] Montage says, 'If you like to hit Kael or skyshrine because you like to hunt there and want a multi group guild event there.  all you have to do is post it'
[Sat Mar 24 19:55:38 2001] Montage says, 'If it doesn't happen.... that is probably because it was not posted.   By using this any person in the guild can get any raid set up that they wish'
[Sat Mar 24 19:56:19 2001] Montage says, 'There is some back end mechanics on how this will work with the raid leaders.... but with this function we will start to have raids backed up in the queue'
[Sat Mar 24 19:56:30 2001] Montage says, 'so there will always be something to do'
[Sat Mar 24 19:57:38 2001] Montage says, 'hold on... looking at my notes :)'
[Sat Mar 24 19:57:46 2001] Lancelet )
[Sat Mar 24 19:57:52 2001] Eteid snickers softly at Montage.
[Sat Mar 24 19:58:41 2001] Illusior saved.
[Sat Mar 24 19:58:47 2001] Montage says, 'Ahh that's it,   I wanted to go over quickly about how our guild objective is shifting now that we are getting larger in size'
[Sat Mar 24 19:59:40 2001] Montage says, 'I know that as I am getting higher and higher in level,  the game is becoming more loot based....   I just wanted to state some things about this'
[Sat Mar 24 20:00:25 2001] Rastella says, 'preach on brother Montage'
[Sat Mar 24 20:00:40 2001] Montage says, 'Our original objective which HAS NOT changed is to have fun playing our toons and work together so we can achieve higher status' that we could not do by ourselves'
[Sat Mar 24 20:00:55 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'im here now sorry'
[Sat Mar 24 20:01:02 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'who needs a ride'
[Sat Mar 24 20:01:27 2001] Montage says, 'but as our toon get more powerful we will be getting more based on getting "Wicked" items for high level people.   And our raids will start to have more defined objectives'
[Sat Mar 24 20:01:45 2001] Eteid agrees with Montage.
[Sat Mar 24 20:01:52 2001] Montage says, 'For example : we raid the Hole,  never going that deep.  and we have an exploration of places we have never seen'
[Sat Mar 24 20:02:17 2001] Montage says, 'Now that we have seen these places and know how to take these targets.  we will start to go in hit the target and get out. short and simple'
[Sat Mar 24 20:02:17 2001] Deishan says, '*cough* Lodizal *cough*'
[Sat Mar 24 20:02:42 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'hello?'
[Sat Mar 24 20:02:50 2001] Lancelet says, 'ewww mofia :)'
[Sat Mar 24 20:02:55 2001] Montage says, 'COM is another example'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:11 2001] Hagus tells the guild, 'Probably gonna be done with the serious part of this before you get here.'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:12 2001] Kneehorn shouts, 'NO PRISIONEEERRRRSSSSS'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:26 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'oh '
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:31 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'is it a meeting?'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:32 2001] Montage says, 'we figured out how to take reavers.... and the next time we did.  we assembled and took out our first set of reavers in about an hour and half from porting into the dreadlands'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:36 2001] Hagus tells the guild, 'Aye'
[Sat Mar 24 20:03:40 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'err'
[Sat Mar 24 20:04:12 2001] Montage says, 'Next thing is kind of hard for me to explain but I will try :)'
[Sat Mar 24 20:04:32 2001] Montage says, 'I am starting to have a problem with our group of people..........'
[Sat Mar 24 20:04:49 2001] Montage says, 'I am getting to know everyone TOO well.   it is almost that I know all of you in real life'
[Sat Mar 24 20:05:16 2001] Montage says, 'I know about peoples families and what they do at work...   and more than I personally should'
[Sat Mar 24 20:05:48 2001] Montage says, 'What I am getting at,  is that as we get closer I want to remind everyone that things start to be more personal'
[Sat Mar 24 20:06:08 2001] Montage says, 'granted we are toons here,  but there is real people behind these keyboards all playing this silly game to have fun together'
[Sat Mar 24 20:06:47 2001] Montage says, 'I see some people not in our guild say things that are just absurd.   Like they have know idea that people can get hurt or upset about things and take them personally'
[Sat Mar 24 20:07:22 2001] Montage says, 'I just want everyone to know,   that our tight group of people seem to be beyond that from any people I have played this game with.   and I applaud this'
[Sat Mar 24 20:07:30 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'im omw to the arena now'
[Sat Mar 24 20:07:39 2001] Booney tells the guild, 'regardless if the meeting is done..'

[Sat Mar 24 20:08:09 2001] Qalaman tells the guild, 'Me and ainadine are on the way also in Nk running there'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:15 2001] Montage says, 'I wanted to talk a second about everyone's second Aries.......  I personally am playing two other characters besides montage.'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:17 2001] Booney tells you, 'hey I have some pics there for you'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:24 2001] Booney tells you, 'pretty nice ones too..'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:45 2001] Booney tells you, 'put em on the website PLZ :)'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:47 2001] Montage says, 'I play Erick and Styne.     I have alot of fun getting them levels and hunting equipment for them,  and just playing something else besides the high level game'
[Sat Mar 24 20:08:52 2001] You told Booney, 'hehe np ;)'

[Sat Mar 24 20:09:04 2001] Booney tells you, 'youll like em urge was about to die'
[Sat Mar 24 20:09:12 2001] Montage says, 'I know that alot of us do this also... As I have grouped with a few of other peopls secondaries'
[Sat Mar 24 20:09:23 2001] You told Booney, 'hehe right on'
[Sat Mar 24 20:09:49 2001] Montage says, 'Playing secondaries is cool,  as I do it myself.  but when it comes to break out the big dogs for the big raids.   I log off my nubies and break out myself'
[Sat Mar 24 20:09:57 2001] Reeiyna says, 'ri'

[Sat Mar 24 20:11:35 2001] Montage says, 'I am going to say this just to state it.... but I want you to know that this guild does not have a problem with this'
[Sat Mar 24 20:11:45 2001] Montage says, 'but the problem does show up here and there'
