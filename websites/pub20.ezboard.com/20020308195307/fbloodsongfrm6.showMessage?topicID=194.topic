Some of the points might also reflect certain pet peeves of mine about such raids  <br><br>1. Pay attention! Cant be stressed enough, i've seen many deaths that could have been avoided if people listened to those who knew what they were doing. Having been on just a few planar raids, you DO NOT know what you are doing yet, so listen up.<br><br>2. Make an assist key. Assisting is good, assisting is your friend. Do not ever initiate attack in any other way than hitting your assist key. Most raids will have a designated primary and secondary assist, whose names you will use when making your assist keys. Again, do not EVER start attacking in any other way than hitting assist. This will make your enchanters happy, and will keep you from looking like a dork. If you are afraid you may hit the wrong key and start an attack early, dump your melee hotkey into bank 8 and remap your autoattack key to Q, or something similarly unlikely to be used by mistake.<br><br>3. Don't go on a raid and then leave after 2-3 hours. If you intend to go on a plane raid, make sure you have at least 6 hours after the start of the raid. Myself I always make sure I can stay for at least 10 hours in case things go bad. Leaving early creates many difficulties for the rest of the raid crew. Why? you may ask... well, to get out you need to be ported by a wizard or a druid, since you can't gate like a caster would. The porter needs to get back to the raid afterwards. So, to accomplish this someone needs to kill the porter in a duel, after which he/she has to regain enough mana for a group tp, then port you out, finally being ressed back to the corpse in &lt;insert plane here&gt;, leaving a cleric low on mana and the porter oom, thus greatly slowing the ENTIRE raid cause ONE person had not planned on staying long. This is not good, as I am sure you can see Not to mention the time it takes to remake the groups affected by people leaving. This is helped somewhat by the introduction of the Translocate spell, but many people will still demand a port to leave on grounds of not being bound where they want to go. And there might not be a wizard around with this spell, so don't count on it.<br><br>4. Don't bitch about dying a lot, or about losing exp. Even a level for that matter. Dying and exp loss happens a lot in bad places. Just accept it and get on with the raid, if you're lucky you may get some nice booty to make it up. And a rep as a guy to is not easily shaken as well, which is not bad at all. Actually, in general, just dont bitch on a raid. If you ask to join a raid, you have to, IMO, accept the way the raid is run by the leaders. If you don't like the way certain people run raids, dont go.<br><br>5. Don't ever be left alive with no clerics camped out after a train. In cases like that, being selfish is the worst thing you can do. Sacrifice yourself to give the clerics a few more seconds to get out. If you do so you may even end up with some rather cool screenshots hehe. Got a few of those myself, being left all alone in PoH with clerics camped out and a few dozen corpses lying around... and of course those 5 clerics of innoruuk beating on my sorry ass. <br><br>6. Get a map of the place you are going to. Though it is definitely possible to do without, as long as you have people to follow around to whereever you are going next, it -can- happen that you become seperated from the main group. And in a case like this, it is a good thing to know where you are, and the route to<br>where you are going. If you are lost and do not have a map, just sit tight, ask for help, give your loc to a rogue or monk, and wait for someone to come get you. DO NOT try to wander around trying to find the others, as this will most likely result in one of two things: <br>A. You die. Not so bad, as a rogue and a cleric can remedy this fairly quickly as long as you get your loc. If you do not get the loc, it will take longer. But still no big deal. Or... <br>B. You find your way back, only to realize you have 17 mobs on your tail when the enchanters are low on mana from the last pull, and clerics from healing up the tanks. This is BAD. An example of where a seperation could happen is in PoH on the wall camp, when it is time to move on. If you haven't heeded<br>point (1), you could well find yourself alone as the rest of the raid team relocates. So, in conclusion, better keep that map handy until you can find your way around the place you are going to. It pays off. <br><br>7. Don't just go to the plane where your armor drops. I know it is great to leave a raid with some pH4t L3wTz (sorry, couldn't resist), but showing some sportsmanship and helping others get a shot at whatever -they- need, will mark you as an unselfish guy. And that can often help you get in when that raid leader<br>you helped out in hate last week, is now hosting a fear raid.<br><br>8. Do not worry about only getting a few kills, or even none, on a large raid. It is often the case that 1 or 2 groups pretty much monopolizes the kills. Why is this? Because it makes sense to have a few very strong groups of the highest lvl people, who can really help out if the @#%$ hits the fan. Although I -have- seen an<br>ungrouped wizard get the kill in the face of an entire raid crew hehe (was while a few group were being rearranged after some people leaving a raid, see (3)) If, on the other hand, you are in one of the kill groups, it is possible to get some decent exp on a raid. I got 1/3 blue bubble last time I was in hate. Just don't<br>expect it and you won't be disappointed.<br><br>9. Don't go off posting @#%$ about a raid, no matter how badly it went. @#%$ happens, and hopefully everyone learned from it. How do you think it has come by that some people have the experience to pull off flawless raids? They tried, failed, and tried again until they knew how to get it right. Posting about how poorly led a<br>raid was will do nothing but prevent you from seeing a plane ever again. Sure, I have been on quite a few raids by now, but I shiver at the thought of leading one. The people who do lead them have a VERY tough job. So cut them some slack. If you have some constructive criticism, I am sure they would be all<br>ears AFTER the raid, but there is just not time for a long discussion while it is going on.<br><br>10. A few tips on cutting down on lag, which if you are not prepared can be a major hindrance: <br>Make sure you have server side msg filtering turned on. This is accomplished by typing '/serverfilter on'. This will filter spell, hit, miss, dmg shield and other such spam before it is sent to your client. Without it, the info will be sent to you taking bandwidth and creating lag. <br>Hide corpses. Done by typing '/hidecorpse all', this will prevent all corpses except your own from being displayed, thus cutting down on system lag.<br>Turn off transparent polygons. This is toggled by the '~' key, usally situated on the top left of your keyboard. This will also reduce system lag.<br>Turn down sound detail and particle effects. This is done in the options menu under General and Display respectively. Another system lag reducer.<br>Turn off as many battle spam messages as you can, to make full use of the server side filtering. Done in options under Chat Filters. Affects both system lag and internet lag, if you have server filtering turned on. Otherwise affects just system lag.<br><br>Oh yeah... almost forgot one:<br>11. Always sacrifice a gnome for good luck, before starting any raid. It may not bring luck, but at least you'll be rid of the gnome  <br><br>I hope it was something along these lines you were looking for  <br>Ulaian Moonleaf <br>54th pathfinder of Tunare <br>Leader, Avatars of Night<br> <br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showMessage?topicID=802.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylu...=802.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><div align="center"><center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="45%"background="http://faeadari.homestead.com/files/sig8pt.jpg">    <tr>        <td align="center" width="50%"><img        src="http://faeadari.homestead.com/files/sig8.jpg"        align="middle"></td>        <td align="center" width="50%"><a        href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=28361"><font        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Faeadari Greyspirit's Profile</font></a><p><a        href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=View&Profile=0&Id=43909"><font        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Eyly's Profile</font></a></p>        <p><a href="http://www.eqbloodsong.com"><font        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Officer        Bloodsong</font></a></p>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=194.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongfrm6.threadControl?topicID=194.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=194.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=194.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub20.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bloodsongbloodsong">Bloodsong<option value="bloodsongfrm24">Pictures<option value="bloodsongfrm25">The Tavern<option value="bloodsongfrm15">History<option value="bloodsongfrm23">Biographies<option value="bloodsongfrm9">New Members<option value="bloodsongfrm22">recruitment forum<option value="bloodsongfrm6">Raids<option value="bloodsongfrm21">LFG<option value="bloodsongfrm19">Quests<option value="bloodsongfrm16">Epic Quests<option value="bloodsongfrm26">Event recaps<option value="bloodsongfrm3">Trade Skills<option value="bloodsongfrm7">Misc Items (usually mob drops)<option value="bloodsongfrm4">The Auction<option value="bloodsongfrm10">Members Only<option value="bloodsongfrm12">Character updates<option value="bloodsongfrm17">Officers<option value="bloodsongfrm20">voting<option value="bloodsongfrm27">Ladie's hideout<option value="bloodsongfrm28">Luclin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/bbloodsong>Bloodsong</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongfrm6>Raids</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.eqbloodsong.com">Bloodsong</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br> <BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp"><IMG SRC="http://a1032.g.akamai.net/f/1032/81/30m/www.gamesville.lycos.com/art_gv/ribbon_small.gif" ALT="[Flag Campaign icon]" WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="86" BORDER="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"><BR></A></DIV><BR> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
