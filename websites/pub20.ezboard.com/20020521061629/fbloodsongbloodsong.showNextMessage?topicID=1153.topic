Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) Inc., a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, announced today that it will develop and publish EverQuest® Online Adventures™ for the PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system.  In addition, SOE is now an official PlayStation 2 developer, specializing in massively multiplayer online games, an entirely new genre for the console player.  EverQuest Online Adventures will be the world’s premier online only console game, bringing the player interaction and community that made the original EverQuest so popular to a whole new audience of console gamers.  The game is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2003. <br>
<br>
“We have seen phenomenal success with the original EverQuest.  The look, feel and functionality of the game provided the foundation on which we built a truly unique console-focused game,” said John Smedley, chief operating officer, Sony Online Entertainment.  “Relying on the many insights we have gained from EverQuest over the past three years, we strongly believe that EverQuest Online Adventures has what it takes to be a major success on the PlayStation 2.” <br>
<br>
EverQuest Online Adventures is a completely new game, designed to take full advantage of the PlayStation 2 system’s capabilities.  But like the original EverQuest, it will feature intricate character development, continuous player interaction and a strong sense of community, which is sure to create a phenomenon that PlayStation 2 gamers have never experienced before.  With an installed base of more than 8.8 million units in the U.S., the PlayStation 2 represents an opportunity to expand the massively multiplayer online role-playing game onto new platforms, delivering a whole new genre to the console gamer. <br>
<br>
“Quite simply, there is no other console game like this,” said Don Vercelli, vice president of sales and marketing, Sony Online Entertainment.  “The dedicated team at SOE has put in countless hours making sure that no other game would rival the level of character customization and atmospheric detail in EverQuest Online Adventures.  This is truly a new experience for the console gamer.” <br>
<br>
Using the PlayStation 2 system’s network adaptor, available in stores this August, EverQuest Online Adventures will connect seamlessly to the Internet, directing players to dedicated EverQuest Online Adventures servers.  By connecting directly to dedicated servers, SOE can help to ensure low latency gameplay and fast connection times.  Gamers simply insert the disc and the world of Norrath is just a few button pushes away.  <br>

Console players are not as used to buggy games as PC users are....<br>
Me wonders how this would end up. EQ for the PC is really buggy and needs constant updates since the world of EQ is a dynamic thingy. Then again if you develop for a console is waaaay more easyer, since the hardware in a console is always the same. Maybe it may work after all, i dont have a PS2 and i wont be buying one to play EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Hope its a good product, i only wish they could allow the console version and the PC ones to share the same world, then again im maybe asking too much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p><BR>

Mmorpgs just get changed a lot so they are bound to have some problems along the way.  My first mmorpg was Ultima Online and it was awarded the worst game of the year since it had so many bugs.  I believe it was the first mmorpg (or at least one of the very first) and I this was the main reason why it was so buggy since it was breaking into new territory.  But...  It is still the best game (in my opinion) to date.  I played it about 3-4 years and never got bored till just near the end.  So it didn't matter to me that it was buggy, it was still a ton of fun. <br>
<br>
My main worry about it being on a console is if they can make it easy to play without using a keyboard.  Seems to me it'd be too complex and would end up kinda awkward, but I don't know what they are doing with them these days.   <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~briangeerlings/IvySig2.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub20.ezboard.com/ugedoree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gedoree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shaman Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 565<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/9/02 9:43:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongbloodsong.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1162.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PS2</span><hr size=1> <br>
Console = 8.8 million users = revenue.<br>
<br>
Console = in 2 to 3 years obsolete.  Time to cut the second edition on the new PS3 = more money<br>
<br>
<br>
what's gonna happen with their online gamers?  <br>
<br>
Their tech and support centers better not be under the same catagory.  IMO I would not want to be on the same techical support system as another 8.8 million peeps.  ESP when I start paying 13.00 per account.<br>
<br>
How do you do costumer service for more than 8 million peeps?  Well off electrical companies have been doin this for years!  and still havent mastered it!  How does sony think they can handle this?  I must say if I go with out cable for a for a day because of cable lines being worked on or serviced, I EXPECT not to be charged for it , and I EXPECT 24 hour painless customer service.<br>
<br>
One of these days VI will expand untill they have nothing but enourmous buggs that still havent been worked out since the previous re-leases.  Then the problems will escalate to only buggs and down time. &lt; such as now &gt; and then to cover the mistakes they will release something NEW to keep interests.<br>
<br>
This is gonna be interesting I am not sure if I want to pay more and more money to upgrade and upgrade this game on PC.  ESP when VI/SOE can't take care of problems one at a time. <br>
<br>
Just a gamer with so much dough in his wallet.<br>

Source: Developers Corner.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it a port?<br>
<br>
No. The product started mid 2000 with the explicit goal of being designed from the ground up as a PS2 game. A port simply would not have worked. Adventures is designed to be played in the living room which is a totally different environment from the study or bedroom where PC games are played. <br>
<br>
Will I be able to visit all my favorite places?<br>
<br>
Yes and No. EQOA is set 500 years before the original EverQuest so Antonious Bayle is not yet alive. The migration to Odus has not yet been completed and there are still Elves on Tunaria (it is not yet known as Antonica). We have built the world from scratch, you can visit many places which are familiar in EQ but don't expect them to look the same or even have the same inhabitants.... <br>
<br>
How do I play without a keyboard?<br>
<br>
Very easily as it happens. Last week I got to level ten around Moradhin just doing quests from the comfort of my couch. Certainly chat is a lot easier with a keyboard but not mandatory. I  know how others will want to play but for me lying back on my couch with both feet up controller in one hand beverage in the other as my friends and I go dungeon delving is the preferred method. <br>
<br>
Does the game have the same classes, abilities and races?<br>
<br>
No. 500 years ago on Norrath races and classes were different (some didn't even exist yet!). While there will be familiarities there are many new spells and abilities that existed back in Norraths age of adventure. We will post more details on this in the upcoming months. <br>
<br>
Is the EQOA the same team that works on EQ Live?<br>
<br>
No. The Adventures team has been separate for nearly two years now working in the dark and in secret.<br>
<br>
Will I be able to transfer my own character to EQOA or see PC players from the original game?<br>
<br>
No. Your characters wouldn't have been born yet! (Unless they were Elves possibly). The games run on totally different servers. <br>
<br>
How many players does EQOA support?<br>
<br>
More than the original EQ per server. Each world should support at least 3000 people simultaneously who can go wherever they want. There are no zones or restrictions on players going anywhere its quite possible to wander by hundreds of other players as you journey across Norrath. <br>
<br>
What about Fippy?<br>
<br>
Clan Darkpaw is alive and well in the Age of Adventure <br>

Try at european main playtime to get any GM for reimburstment. Impossible! You have to play at 2 AM to get him or you have to mail them. <br>
<br>
I mailed twice. The first time i didn't get an answer the second time they only told me that it looks like a rollback and i have to accept i have lost the item. They also stated to me i have no proof that i had the item. I answered their mail and still no answer. Ok i know for the first answer they needed 1 week as well so they still have 4 days to answer this. So far the understanding of SOE for customerservice.<br>
<br>
The worser point for playing EQ on PS2 is that you have to buy EVERY improvement since i am not sure if the PS2 has a harddrive to store that large updates and changes VI is allways doing. So you get a product which is done and won't change that fast.<br>
<br>
Btw. in my opinion the good part of EQ are the relationships you build while chating with many people and i am not sure how easy you can write any text at the PS2. I had a PS1 but never thought about spending so much money for a PS2. They sell it in germany for like twice the price than in US so i just skipped it and concentrated on my PC (hehe, i don't play anything else than EQ at all at the moment)<br>
<br>
I just think lets wait and see what will going on. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98254" target="_blank">Salian<br>51 Pathfinder<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98352" target="_blank">Bune<br>40 Necromancer<br>
