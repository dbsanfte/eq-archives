Its a long one, so didnt want to tell it while playing EQ, so here she goes :<br>
<br>
Last monday, ive hit lvl 16 with Nymph, everything was perfect : I was grouped with a good friend in Erud Crossing, had a TP for free to GFAY, i had 21 GLS to make some money, i had already bought all spell lvl 16... except the best one : Breeze.  <br>
<br>
I just saw once a friend go in Kunark, and thats where the spell is sold. So, i went to BucherBlock take the shuttle to Firiona Vie, where i saw my lvl 35 ranger Wood Elf friend go.  Some people was talking to be very careful as a DE because the guard are maybe against me... But i was smiling, it was 23h50, and midnight a friend was calling me on the internet number, so i had to camp after the trade.  And most of all, im a WWF fan, and its at 00h00 at monday night... When the huge boat stoped to the dock in Firiona, I conned the guards, and they were indifferent, so i smiled, thinking i was gonna log out in 5min with all ym lvl 16 spells and go watch WWF while talking to a good good friend.  ?%&amp;%$ When i steped one foot on the dock, the 2 guards who was conning indifferent KOS me ... Boum ... all was gone, i needed to go take my corpse back, but how ?? It was at 1cm of 2 guards feet... and the most of all, why the heck did they atatcked me if they were conning indifferent ??? I had bind me in BB, so that was not as long as Erud Crossing... So, i took the shuttle again, wait again 20min in Timorous Deep, be disconnected on boat, my cpu was insane, and when i reconnected i was in BB....wtf...<br>
So, i petitionned and lucky in my bad luck, a GM almost answered me 1min after.  That was Fascina, a good one if anyone need something =).  So, i told all about it, and she helped me out... First, she summoned my corpse to a zone near the Dreadlands.  She resurected me there, and as soon as i appreared in the zone, 2 other guards jumped me... And my cpu is not a P3 900, zoning take times huh.  So, after that, she needed to kill  everything on sight, she resurected me again to my corpse, all told me to hurry to take only the most important thing... thats why im all naked except jewelry and my Dragoon Dirk and my Stein... BUT, when you are resurected, you have a &quot;spell&quot; in your up right screen called &quot; Resurection Effect &quot;, letting you at 1STR and almost all stats down by 30-40-50 pts... So, i was walking like a drunk mouse, as fast as an handicaped turtle, while the GM was pushing me and cheering me to zone hehe.  Lucky, i zoned before the guard respawn... After that, she summoned me in Oasis, where we land in a rain of SG ... that suck, i didnt die from them , but it gimme an heart attack to see 3-4 SG running near you... espicially after what happened... All was ok from there... Iwas lost in Oasis, but i found the way out.  All this for a spell that i didnt get yet.  And before she goes away, Fascina told me this : As an evil race, you need to take the Barge in Oasis. //&quot;!$/!% I didnt know that ! <br>
<br>
But now its ok, i have my breeze spell...<br>
But i logged out that night at 01h30AM, missing 75% of my WWF, and missed a call of someone imporant... <br>
That was my bad night...<br>
So, everyone cheer up, and lets party !!! =)<br>
See ya on later ! If anyone want to support me or insulte me or anything, just reply hehe<br>
Byebye !<br>
