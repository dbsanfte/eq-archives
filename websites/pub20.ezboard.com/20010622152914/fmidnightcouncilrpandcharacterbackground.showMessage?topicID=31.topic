As a Dark Elf, my childhood is supposed to be shrouded in darkness.  I suppose my parents should have been brutally murdered by a High Elf and I was to be tortured.  I'm sorry if it's boring, but my childhood was miraculously dull.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My two wonderful parents raised me in Neriak.  They're still married, are good to each other and me, and don't perform ritualistic sacrifices.  I am an only child, so I guess it makes me rather spoiled.  I was the target of all of my parents' affections.  They wanted the best for me from the very beginning.  My mother, a Necromancer, wanted me to be liked by everyone and have friends, so she didn't want me to follow in her footsteps.  My father just said I was too scrawny to be a strong Warrior like him.  So they talked it over and decided that I should study in the Tower of the Spurned.  My parents don't buy in to the ideals of much of Teir'Dal society and don't have any sort of dissension toward &quot;spurned&quot; or not.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was for this reason that I didn't really have any hatred in me.  I was fun loving and didn't have a reason to hate.  Sure, I followed Innoruuk and I went to the temple, but I wouldn't say I bought in to all that &quot;hate&quot; talk.  Not that it mattered; I was accepted in to the Academy regardless.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So I studied in the Tower of the Spurned.  My parents wanted to let me decide, for the most part, what sort of magic I would study.  I poked around a bit and thought that the ways of Enchantment were nice, if not amusing.  I began my studies at an apprentice Enchanter.  If you haven't looked in to it, you have no idea how many books there are on this.  I thought my head was going to explode!  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So now's the part where I say that I excelled at my studies and that I was the top of the class.  Well, I didn't, and I wasn't.  Actually, my instructor would sometimes root me to keep me from running off and playing with the Warriors.  You see, even though my father thought I was too scrawny, I wanted to make him happy.  So I played with the apprentice Warriors and tried to get strong.  The Warriors would always beat me, though.  I swore that one day I would best them.  When I told them that, they would usually laugh at me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even though I was &quot;spurned&quot; and even though I played with the Warriors, I never felt that I was disliked.  Everyone was pretty nice to me and I had no idea what real prejudice was.  Until, that is, I graduated from my preliminary studies.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, I was out in the world.  Sent off to practice my post-graduate work.  My parents were sad to see me go, but they knew this day would come.  My mom packed me some food and milk and they saw me off.  I trekked off in to the wilderness to work on my Enchantments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As an Enchanter, I was pretty strong in combat.  All that time with the Warriors payed off after all.  Though sometimes I would misjudge a situation.  So it came to pass one day after I had completed 8 post-graduate modules, that I was in the Western part of the Commonlands.  I was ridding the world of the terrifying Willowisp.  I had just finished a battle and was rather bruised and battered.  I needed a rest, so I walked over to the tollbooth.  The corrupt guards there provide some protection while resting.  On my walk back, I noticed a pair of High Elves that I didn't recognize.  They didn't seem to pay any mind to me, so I didn't pay any to them.  I was minding my own business when all of a sudden I couldn't move.  My feet were adhered to the ground.  I looked up just in time to see Xytel running at me with his massive two-handed sword drawn.  His companion, Faymoon, stood behind and began casting another spell.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pair was quite a lot stronger than I was and I knew that it was hopeless to fight back.  I was also very confused as to the reason behind their attack.  I wasn't prepared in any way, and all I could think to do was hide myself from them.  I began casting an invisibility enchantment, but Xytel's sword interrupted me.  I concentrated and tried again.  Again, he slashed at me with his blade, but I concentrated past it and managed to get my spell off.  They stopped their assault.  It worked!  The binds that held me in place were still there, however, and I couldn't move.  I was on the verge of death and all I could do is stand there.  The binds broke a short while later and I began a slow march toward Neriak.  It was going to take a lot of bandages to heal my wounds.  I heard Faymoon say as I walked away, &quot;She'll never make it to the light of day.&quot;  But she was wrong.  I survived, thought I still wasn't sure why they attacked.  It must have been a misunderstanding, but I lived so I dismissed it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I completed my next 8 post-graduate modules fairly quickly and without any more event.  I hadn't even had to venture very far from home.  I had spent time in the Commonlands and in the Oasis of Marr.  Though I saw a large mixture of races from all over Norrath, I never got any bad impressions from anyone, save Faymoon and Xytel.  Sure, as a Dark Elf I'm taught from the beginning that Koada and Fier'Dal are lying, murdering, evil Elves.  That's fine and good, but with my unprejudiced background, I felt everyone deserved a chance.  Besides, I figured it was just a misunderstanding with Faymoon and Xytel.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I decided to go on an adventure.  I was going to journey far from home to test my skills and also to see more of the world.  I told my parents that I was going to visit the Faydark.  They kind of looked at each other warily, but wished me luck.  I traveled the short distance to the City of Freeport and booked passage across the Ocean of Tears.  I boarded the ship when it came and we set sail!  I decided, being on an adventure and all, that I would take my time and see the world.  As the boat pulled in to the dock on Erollisi Island, I thought that I might take a look around.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stepped off the boat and was immediately face to face with a leather clad Wood Elf.  She glared at me and asked me what I was doing there.  Before I could even answer, she shouted, &quot;I, Tegea Prendyn, will protect our land and strike you down, vile follower of Innoruuk!&quot;  She began slashing at me with her drawn sword.  She was much more skilled than I was and got in several good hits.  I ran back to the boat, but she followed.  The other passengers watched as I tried to run from her, pleading with her to stop.  She was in a frenzy now and kept slashing at me.  She backed me up off of the boat and back on to the dock.  With a low slash, I was on my knees in front of her.  She leered down at me with a smug grin on her face.  I close my eyes as she brought her sword down to deliver the final blow.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I looked down at my body as my spirit floated away.  I couldn't believe what had just happened!  I wouldn't be able to see my parents again, or finish my training.  My life cut short by some weird Wood Elf with some personal vendetta.  I felt a twinge in my heart, just then.  It felt like a small, dark flame flared up in my chest for a moment, and then died down.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, I found myself standing outside the gate of Neriak.  Was I still dead, I wondered?  I looked down at myself and realized I wasn't wearing any clothes at all!  A couple people were coming, so I quickly cast an invisibility enchantment on myself and hoped they couldn't see through it.  I thought about it some more and realized that I must have been resurrected!  I was so relieved.  I didn't want anyone to know what had happened, though, so I didn't go back to town.  Instead, I decided to go reclaim my possessions from the island.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I ran, still draped only in my invisibility enchantment, to the docks in Freeport.  I stowed away on the boat with ease.  I wondered why I didn't do that in the first place.  I remained unseen as the boat left the port and sailed toward the Butcherblock Mountains on the coast of Faydwer.  As the boat neared the island of the Sisters of Erollisi, I jumped off and swam to shore.  I would like to let everyone know that the water is quite cold when nude.  I stood on shore and dried off a little.  I decided to be extra careful, so I illusioned myself to appear as a Wood Elf.  If that Tegea Prendyn saw me, she wouldn't recognize me this time.  Still being unclothed, I again faded away and headed toward the dock where my previous body layed.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I quietly crept up the shore and on to the dock.  I pulled on my corpse and dragged it back down the shore so I could gather my items freely.  There really is nothing like looking at your lifeless corpse while you pry weapons and supplies from its cold hands.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I finally had got everything in order again and washed the blood stains from my robe, I set out again.  I decided it best to travel unseen for fear of a repeat situation.  I stood on the dock waiting for the boat to make its stop, standing a few feet from my killer the whole time.  I was relieved when the boat came, and I scrambled on to the main deck and waited for it to take off.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of my adventure went well, and I returned home in no time.  I even learned a new spell in my journey.  My parents were very proud of me; I was too ashamed to tell them everything.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A while passed and I had completed 4 more modules.  I was practicing on the continent of Kunark with a Rogue who had stolen my heart.  What I would have given for him.  I protected him as best I could from the dangers in the lands.  My sweet Vaeamin, you'll always have a place in my heart.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During my stay, a Half Elf Bard by the name of Pastorious joined up with my dear Rogue and myself.  There was one problem, however.  He was currently bound to the plane of the living in the City of Freeport.  He was being careful, and didn't want to end up there should he be killed and resurrected.  He asked if I could tie him to Kunark.  I told him sure, and tried, but could not hold his body where we stood.  We thought that he might need to be closer to a temple of his god, so we would have to travel to Firiona Vie.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We set off for the outpost of Firiona Vie.  We slowly made our way through the Frontier Mountains, through the Lake of Ill Omen, and in to the forests surrounding the outpost.  I had learned my lesson from the Wood Elf on Erollisi Island, and did not travel among the &quot;light&quot; races without illusioning myself as well as keeping myself unseen.  This time, I had decided to take on the form of a High Elf.  As we got closer to the outpost, there were more and more pilgrims wandering about.  I tried to stay clear of them, even though I was invisible.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was very near the city, and stopped a moment to ready myself.  Just then, I felt a cold blade upon my back.  I turned around and saw one of the pilgrims.  He was scowling at me with such a look of hatred. I was stunned by the sudden attack and just stood there as blood crept down my back.  He frowned at me; I was obviously not fooling him with my weak enchantments.  He proceeded to slash at me without so much as a word.  I panicked and fell before him very quickly.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My spirit rose from my body.  Surely Innoruuk would not see fit to resurrect me a second time.  I closed my eyes, and that feeling was there again.  My heart felt as if the dark flames flared up again, though this time it didn't die down like it had before.  Instead it felt like the fire was consuming my heart.  My chest burned so much I cried out, and suddenly I felt the wind blowing.  I opened my eyes to find myself standing, completely naked, in the Dark Elf outpost in the Overthere.  I quickly dashed behind a statue and cast invisibility on myself.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then it occurred to me.  Innoruuk had resurrected me again!  I must have done something right.  I realized then that the burning was still in my heart.  I felt alive, I felt...angry!  I was furious!  I just snapped and I wanted nothing more than the blood of that worthless pilgrim.  I wanted to hear him scream as I slowly exacted my revenge on him.  I hated him with my whole being.  I thought back and felt hatred for Tegea Prendyn and her merciless slaughter of me before.  I remembered the unsolicited attack of Faymoon and Xytel, I hated them too.  I felt reborn, in a way.  I felt true hatred for the first time.  It was at this moment that I knew that the words of Innoruuk were true and pledged allegiance to him right then and there.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I reclaimed my possessions from the forests of Firiona Vie, along with the help of Vaeamin and Pastorious.  I told the young Bard that he would have to find someone else to bind him in this land.  I wasn't going near their &quot;light&quot; outpost again, save to destroy it.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since that time, I have felt nothing but contempt toward the Koada and Fier'Dal.  It did not start that way, but it was proven to me beyond a shadow of a doubt, that hatred is the way and I have accepted this.  I want nothing more than to sit atop the mountains of Butcherblock and watch the sun rise and spread its light over the forest of the Faydark as it burns to the ground.  When I am strong enough, I will murder their precious Tunare; the god they claim to follow; the god that they viscously murdered me in the name of; the &quot;supposed&quot; creator of the Elves.  I will be there for her demise and then everyone will see that her beliefs are the ways of fools.  Quite ironic to me that they all hold on to her, when it's clear that they follow the ways of Innoruuk.  More so than many of the Teir'Dal.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have allied myself with many others who have similar views as I have.  They may not focus their hatred at the Wood Elves and High Elves quite to my excess, but we have all seen the truth.  We follow the path that the so-called &quot;light&quot; races call &quot;evil&quot;; I guess it takes one to know one.  But we know we will persevere.  Though we are small, we are strong and we will not give up nor shall we falter.  I will do everything in my power to help contribute to the fall of the &quot;light&quot; races.  I am Presea, of the Midnight Council.  <br>
