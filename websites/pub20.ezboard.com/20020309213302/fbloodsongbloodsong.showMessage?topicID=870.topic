The Alternate Advancement System<br>
The alternative advancement system will allow anyone who has purchased and installed Shadows of Luclin to further customize their high level (51+) characters. Customized features may include things such as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your class or archetype (fighter, magic user, priest), and general skills available to everyone. These skills may include anything from an enhanced metabolism, to improvements in skills already available to your class. You may also find some unique skills not yet available to anyone. Some enhancements may add a title to your character based on what choices you have made in enhancing your character; these titles will be visible to other players.<br>
<br>
In order to attain these skills, you will be able to toggle your experience into the alternative advancement pool. When you do this, your experience will be allocated to this pool in lieu of your “leveling” experience bar. Once a certain amount of experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you will receive training points that may be allocated to acquiring your enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain, although some enhancements may have pre-requisites that will need to be obtained before you are able to acquire it.<br>
<br>
Players will have the option of toggling between the normal experience pool to gain levels, or back to the alternative enhancement pool to gain enhancements whenever they wish (although this may require you to zone after you have toggled your switch). Switching between the two pools will not cause you to lose experience in the other. Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from the “Leveling” experience pool, it will not impact your alternative advancement pool. <br>
<br>
The alternative advancement system will allow for a variety of enhancements to choose from for each class. Those who chose to enhance their character with this system may find a higher level of individuality in their character.<br>
