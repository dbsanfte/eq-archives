consuming all that the eye could ingest accented only by brilliant neon mystical symbols of pinks, reds and blues.<br>
<br>
The caved city of Neriak lay hidden deep within the Nektulos Forest kept an eerie quiet all its own.<br>
<br>
Yet on the eve of the Dark Elfin holiday of D`Chtal (the rights of the dead) this silence was pierced by the agonizing scream of a young woman giving birth followed by a tiny helpless voice that yelped and quivered in concert.<br>
<br>
Twas this eve that I first open my red eyes and voiced my existence to Norrath from my father’s house and out of the protection of my mother’s womb. Tears of pain and evil joy rolled down my mother’s cheeks as the priests of Innoruuk lifted me up above their heads by the flames in the “Spires of Innoruuk” and asked the Prince to bless the tiny, naked child.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk filled my heart with hatred so delicious and my soul with powerful magic to be honed and shaped that I may carry out his will. He whispered down to the priests my name – Lexxii (meaning “elixxiia” elixir of pleasure) then ordained that I should become a Cleric in his service and protect his legions of Warriors, Necromancers, Shaman, Wizards, Magicians and Enchanters. But above these his pride, his Shadow Knights.<br>
<br>
A tool of pleasure, nurse, companion, lover, hater. A protector and provider of physical needs in servitude. I would be trained as a “Succubi” (Geisha) and then I was taken from my mother who wept and begged the priests for one last look, to lay in her arms a final time as a newborn but they ignored her disappearing with me into the shadows.<br>
<br>
Training as Succubi was at times harsh but it was the only life I knew or know. The priests and the Succubi mistresses said I was their best student and most talented in many ways. My passion for the Succubi arts was growing as much as my magic. I was gleefully consumed into my part ordained by Innoruuk and his quest to spread hatred in the land.<br>
<br>
Being shuttled from temple to temple was a part of my daily routine.<br>
<br>
The woman I used to see starring at me as I walked with the priests down the streets of Neriak as a girl had about her a longing aura. Once She gave me her voice when I passed so close to her she could almost touch me. “Lexxii…” she barked softly as she reached for my arm. For a moment I paused, turned and looked deeply in her own red eyes. I felt the connection with her in my soul but the priests hurried me along once more just as the woman began a soft smile.<br>
<br>
From that day, I would always look for her and when those occasions would present themselves, a smile was always shared but nothing ever said. I knew this was my mother.<br>
<br>
The day came when I would be christened into service outside training and the temples. I was presented to the lead Shadow Knight trainer to entertain him for an evening. It was a test, a right of passage and if I failed it could have cost me my head. Needless to say I am alive so I must have done very well.<br>
<br>
Time is a strange thing. It gives growth to the physical, heals the physical and the spirit too most times but it can take as much as it gives. There did come a time just before womanhood that I nay saw the woman again on the streets. Later I would learn that she died. Her death was not from a virus nor was it by blade or sickness but it was from the poison of time and a broken heart. She wanted so to hold her daughter and talk to her just once. The waiting and longing killed her.<br>
<br>
I would also learn that her name was Tarshi, Succubi Entourage Mistress, Cleric of the house of D`Triixx who had become pregnant with me and expelled from her duties. After my birth she was sent to the streets in shame and shunned. All I could gather was that she was the vessel of a royal and my birth was kept secret as this royal wanted a male heir, his name I know not and has been kept from me. I now knew my mother’s surname. This I claim as my own. D`Triixx, of its history is yet another tale.<br>
While living in the Villa Az`Kerns as part of the ladies of Armael, I met two sisters named Saskia (a Necromancer) and Serenaty (a Cleric, both of our father Innoruuk) as I was performing my duties as Cleric for our father’s legions in training in the Nektulos Forest. We joined forces as I too continued my own training in the healing and killing arts.<br>
<br>
Twas there too that I first met Krystall Ecllypse, a beautiful Shadow Knight and veteran of many battles in her 22nd season of Veil. The sight of this Shadow Knight was stunning in well-used bronze armor head to toe with a manner about her that was stately. I baptized her with the blessings of our father and gave her strength with magic. I asked her if I could follow her in battle to tend to her wounds in the service of Innoruuk but nay she said because I needed more training though she was grateful for the offer. She gave me a pair of banded sleeves and leggings with many scars and promised me the weapon of a giant beast to the west. The weapon is named a Glowing Wooden Crook. Legend has it she said, that this weapon possesses magic. We became close friends.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile a slow grumble began to spread across Norrath as evil voices conspired with each other to form a council and distribute an organized restlessness from the shadowed depths. This council was led by an Ogre named Reog and his lieutenant (a Troll named Obeah) who selected me to be the third of his Triad surrounded by his council of seven.<br>
<br>
I embarked upon a special task given to me by Obeah. He gave me a list of named foes requesting I use my Succubi and Cleric talents to assassinate them. Here is the scroll upon which I now measure myself and my progress.<br>
<br>

<br>
After one of these successes, I happened upon Krystall in Nektulos again when a Druid Wood Elf had the gaul to enter our forest and tempt Innoruuk. The Stone Guards came to kill him but I saw an opportunity to capture his soul into my father’s service by healing him during the battle. All did not go as planned though for as I was healing him, guards came at me from behind and tried to strike me down. Krystall struck the guard and called for me to flee for my life. I gated to the gates of that foul Human city called Freeport then healed myself.<br>
<br>
This is how I came to serve Krystall and the House of Ecllypse for I owe her my very life. Her constant companion and healer.<br>
<br>
The killing continues in my father’s name, Innoruuk.<br>
