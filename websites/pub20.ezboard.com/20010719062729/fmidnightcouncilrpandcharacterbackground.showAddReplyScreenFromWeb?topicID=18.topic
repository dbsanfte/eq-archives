           THY MISTRESS OF THEE DEAD &amp; HATE<br>
<br>
<br>
Thy night was cool with a brisk wind as a lonely female Dark elf roomed about in Nektulos Forest, when all of a sudden four large framed human men jump out from behind a large rock and started to  beat the little one from Nerek unmercifully, until she lay there bleeding an almost unconscious. As the men piliaged  her backpack a small dark figure  creeped out of the darkness an started to cast a spell or two causing the men to run away  in great fear. He then nelt beside the hurt lady as she wispered ever so gently  a prayer to thy god Innoruuk saying take thy life if thy must but give thy life to my unborn child. She then looked upon the face of the Old Master Necromancer who had  saved her an said please save my child an put me to rest for my child shall be born this night.Thy Master replied  with Thy will shall be done M'lady. She then started to screem in pain thy time had come for the birth of a new force in Innoruuk's powerful will, a beautiful female child was born. As they lady was taken her last breaths of air she said please kind sir take ever so care of my little one she has know one now, thy Master repied It shall be my will M'lady, she then closed here eyes an took her last breath  of life an started her journey of rest. Thy Master picked up thee ever so little one and beamed a smile then said little one you shall remember this unjust deed that was done this ever dark night am shall have your revenge on there souls for you shall become my apprentice in thy years to come. Thy Master started to cast a spell as he started to disappear into the darkness of night he rang out with thy word Vladrylia is what I shall call thee. Many a year passed as the young female grew from a child into a young adult. She had not seen much of the world  as see had stayed home an took care of the masters hut  deep in the forest an studied the books he had gave her to look at. When one eve he sat in front of a fire an told her the story of how she had been born an then told her that she was to be a apprentice of the Black Art Of Necromancey it was to be her destiny to learn an destroy those of the light  or those who follow the path of good. She nodded as she understood and he then handed her a little dark grey stained robe, a small dagger, a spell book, amd two scrolles with spells scribed on them .He then told her to goto her room an study  that was written and to scribe those two spells into thy book  an  not to return till she had. the next morn she returned from her room an awoke the master with a giggle an a smile he new she had done what he asked . the master sat up an said good my child of darkness  you shall come across many of these spell an will need to preform the same task I new you would not fail as he opened is eyes wider he saw that she was wearing the robe an had the dagger on her side he then said  great little one  you are now to study before we eat  thy food that Innoruuk has providus today. Then I shall leave you to study more as I have business in Nerek to attend to today. She then went back to her room an started to study more of the books  the master had given her before  but for some reason she now understood  what these books had to say. After they ate the master said well I am off I shall return to thee at sundown this eve. as he stood at the door of the hut  Vladrylia said Master  why can I not go with thee  the master replied for thou time will come to go an for now you shall study for the world is a cruel an unjust place for your eyes of yet little one an he headed out the door.Vladrylia didnt understand  but she did what her master told her  an she went to clean  after she finished she went to her room to study more.  The night began to creep up into the sky an yet her master was not yet home  Vladrylia became to worrie  about this  due to her master never said he would be back an not show at the time he said. Several hours after darkness fell Her master came running into the hut an yell Vladrylia  come her Now she came forth from her room he placed a note in her hand then said grab you tools an hurry be quick I say. She new not what was about to take place  would be the last she saw of her master an the home she had come to love so dearly. Vladrylia scored  to her room an grabeed her backpack an started to fill it with the tools the master had told her.She the emerged from her room  the master yelled make sure you do not loose thy note it is of great importance to you  you shall need to give this not to the Guild leader in Nerek for he shall show you the way of our Dark Art .Vladrylia didnt understand what was the hurry an why her master seemed to be getting rid of her.  she then said how will I find thi nerek you speak of an why are you doing this to me master? He replied child I would love to teach you all of the art but see late this night Ill shall die an you shall to if you leave not this place for  men of light come to slay me an I will not have them take yee life with out a fight  but yours is to fragle to fight  for you know not the ways of thy art. You will need to take some food an milk with you for your journey this shall take you no more than have a day to the north of hear there is a path that will lead you there. Please child question me no more an go for my time draws near. In the distance you could her the heavey foot steps of serveal men  ever so closer they came . Vladrylia ran from the hut deep into the forest that surounded the hut an turned as she  heard one of the men say we shall burn it to the ground. she turned to look back  an shaw the hut ablaze with her master out front trying to fend him shelf  from death but alast he couldnt an fell to the ground. Vladrylia saw this mass unjustice an emited a horad screem an feel to her knees crying  for she was alone once again in her life an new not what to do except what the master had said  she lay on the ground cowarding under a bush where she feel fast asleep. At day break  she awoke an ran to where the hut had been all thatwas left of her home was now smoldering ruble an ash  she search for a trace of her master but non was to be found. As she sat there praying to her god Innoruuk to give her stregth to find justice for the unjust that had happend to her master, a thunderest voice she heard said goto Nerek my child there you shall find heaven rest and frinds that shall teach you the Black Arts with no Harm to thee you shall become a Great an Powerful Necromancer  an set straight these an many unjustices in your an others life  now go child of darkness  an be fast. Vladrylia then stood an ran ran like she never had before  she found the road that her master spoke but  there was a fork in it she thought which way do I go  an a arua of power drew her to the north fork she past many a mountain an hill. Vladrylia finaly came to a cave in the side of a moutain in wich had two guards standing there  she look up an relized by the symbol on the top that she had reached Nerek. Vladrylia entered the cave  where she saw a many of stangers  some the likeness of her some very different from here she then preceded to the third gate the entrance to the Dark Elven  worshoping quater  wher she saw a building  that had the same  symbol that had been on the parchment that the master gave her  she entered the building. She had finaly arrived  to her new home Vladrylia then opened the note an read the text which said to give this note to the guild master an he would instuct her on her path to darkness . Vladrylia then went inside an gave the note to her guild master an practiced the art of pearcing with her dagger. The Guild master then told her to go hunt moss snakes then after  those hunt decaying skelitons and after those hunt fire beatles an to study her spells. She was to hunt until she had enough to afford  the rest of her spells  for the first circle of darkness then return   an buy these spells an learn them. After hunting for what seemed many a year she attained enough to buy he spell circle. Vladrylia then went back to the Guild master an he said my child of darkness you have done well you shall become most a powerful in your time but for now you should study an hunt  for you have many a spell circle to buy an learn in order to do Innoruuk's will. Vladrylia noded an left for the forest once again this time she had a pet skeliton in which to help her. While in the forest  she came upon a Troll his name was Ramlak she talked with him to learn of him he was a Shadow Knight  in the service of Innoruuk to  they talked about would tavels he had been on for he was more powerful than her in his fifteenth season. While they talked she found out a few better places to hunt which she was greatful for his service an thanked him an piad him 2 gold for his services of guiding her. Vladrylia  has had many a brush with death an fears it not  for she dreams of the day wher she can be free of this world an join her Master , her Mother an her god Innoruuk after cleansing the wourld of all light dwellers an  those that follow the path of good. She also states that she will reclaim the continent of Antonica an all that souround it for Innoruuk an the Dark Elven race as it should be an is writen in history, but this is not the end but a new beginning.......  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/bmidnightcouncil>Midnight Council</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground>RP & Character Background</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/midnightcouncil/">Midnight Council Home Page</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
