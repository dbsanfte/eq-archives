<br>
I need the following things from anyone who wants to participate.<br>
<br>
1. Which of your characters is your favorite and give us his/her/its full name/class/race/alignment.<br>
<br>
2. How does your character act towards others? Of the same race? Of the same class? Towards total strangers?<br>
<br>
3. Does your character have any prejudices? (It's EQ so being racist against dorfs is ok)<br>
<br>
4. Favorite weapon/type of fighting for your character.<br>
<br>
5. Any quirks?<br>
<br>
6. Leader? Soldier? Rebel? What?<br>
<br>
7. Straightlaced or corrupt?<br>
<br>
8. Is your character connected with anyone at the moment?<br>
<br>
9. What're your characters behaviors?<br>
<br>
Just to get it started here are Ryu's...<br>
<br>
1. Ryu Bloodsword, Dark Paladin - Human - Mithaniel Marr<br>
<br>
2. Ryu views everyone as below him. He's arrogant and pig headed with a twisted sense of justice and a very scary sense of humor. He doesn't trust anyone not even close friends. He tolerates elves, despises humans, hates trolls and ogres, sees little people as idiots and as for Iksar and Vah Shir he didn't bother forming an opinion just starts killing them.<br>
<br>
3. Ryu specially hates gnomes and Iksars.<br>
<br>
4. Ryu specializes in swords of any type. He loves the longswords and Claidhmore and attacks viciously using both hands or a sword and a shield.<br>
<br>
5. Ryu has a thing for red heads...<br>
<br>
6. Ryu is a true and true Soldier. He doesn't like giving commands nor does he like giving them out. He is only trully alive in the battlefield.<br>
<br>
7. Corrupt to the core but with a sort of messed up sense of responsibility.<br>
<br>
8. In a way. Ryu's attitude towards women is love em and leave em.<br>
<br>
9. Ryu's irrational, irresposible, egotistical, mean tempered, selfish, arrogant, self centered, maniacal, and an all around bad guy. Deep inside he is a hard man with a cruelty that can only be measured by the pints of blood spilled by his sword. In his chest beats the heart of true darkness... except for a small light that hangs stubbornly reaching out for the light. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub20.ezboard.com/ubalearic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balearic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dead Paladin</span><br>  Posts: 793<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/9/02 10:24:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongbloodsong.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=985.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Songers read or I'll start killing rats...</span><hr size=1> Is G. Gordon Liddy hungry again? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1. Which of your characters is your favorite and give us his/her/its full name/class/race/alignment<br>
<br>
Balearic Pureheart, Paladin/corpse/airhead, Tunare<br>
<br>
2. How does your character act towards others? Of the same race? Of the same class? Towards total strangers?<br>
<br>
Bale treats others fairly well, as a rule.  He doesn't prejudge others unless the other person has been rude or obnoxious (beggars, known liars, etc.).  He's been known to hunt with trolls, ogres, and inkies because not every &quot;evil&quot; person is truly consumed with darkness, not even Ryu.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Of course, our boy is also pretty naive about some things, and he inadvertently hurts people and is hurt himself as a result.  <br>
<br>
3. Does your character have any prejudices? (It's EQ so being racist against dorfs is ok)<br>
<br>
Bale isn't an enemy of anyone as long as they do their job.  He jokes about dorfs and ganomes, who really need to start taking growth hormone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
4. Favorite weapon/type of fighting for your character.<br>
<br>
1 hander and a shield (currently Trueheart Shield and either a Defiance or a DWHWS) or 2-handed sword (currently Strength of Grodan, but I can't wait for that FD! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  I also use a Carved Dragonbon Lance sometimes because it's fast and hits fairly hard.  I also cast a lot of spells (stun/root/anti-undead DD), a carryover from my days playing a wizard.  The only forms of combat I haven't gotten to 200 are hand to hand and 2 hand blunt.  <br>
<br>
5. Any quirks?<br>
<br>
A weakness for elven women of any variety.  (No, I'm not naming names! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  Also, as mentioned, a tendency to go oom in the middle of a fight from casting too much.<br>
<br>
6. More of a Leader? Soldier? Rebel? What?<br>
<br>
More of a soldier than a true leader.  (Gotta improve that trait before the next raid.)  More of an idea man, coming up with odd ways to attack a problem (e.g., a big, multi-guild raid on PoA to get multiple FA's, if it comes off).  A leader in the sense that he takes care of his own, and will do anything to work out a problem, but fight an enemy to the death by any means necessary.<br>
<br>
7.  Straightlaced or corrupt?<br>
<br>
Generally honest, though he sometimes wanders off the path of true light because of ambition or a desire to help others.  Genuinely has no idea what anything in EQ is worth, so he seldom sells anything to ensure nobody's taken for a ride.  (DEFINITELY needs GG's help in this area! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
8. Is your character connected with anyone at the moment?<br>
<br>
Bale has several very good female friends.  That's all I'll say. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
9. What're your characters behaviors?<br>
<br>
Bale's irrational and irresponsible at times.  He can be self-centered (gotta get that epic!) and he sometimes whines when things aren't exactly right.  He'll go out of his way to help people in need, though he has very little money.  He loves a good fight, but seeks different ways to attack than a headlong charge.  Bale tries his best to live according to the Golden Rule.  In all this, he draws the ire of his brother-in-arms Ryusan.  Bale is exasperated by Ryu's bad behavior and wishes he'd turn back to the light before it's too late.<br>

Nyrogen Soulsmasher Male Wizard High Elf Tunare -- The Mother Of All<br>
2. Generally Speaking Nyrogen thinks that High Elves are the best race in the world, but thinks well of Wood Elves, and Half Elves as well. Generally speaking, he dislikes Humans and  Erudites, the most. He Loathes Dark Elves, Trolls, and Iksar's. He Doesn't like Ogre's, but he will do business with them. On alll other races, he is indifferent.<br>
3. He has just a couple prejudices, all Evil Races are 110% Evil, and he has no sympathy for them. And Gnome's tinker with too many things that they should not.<br>
4. Magical Battles, no Meele. Just Spells.<br>
5. Is very impatient with just about everyone.<br>
6. Soloist. Stays alone doing his research, and searches for magics that will bring him more power then the other Wizards of Norrath.<br>
7. Not Either really. In the Middle.<br>
8. Nope Notta, zilch -10.<br>
9. Power is everything. Those who are not enlightened should not be alive.<br>
<br>
FYI-- I do Roleplay Occasionally. It is just kinda hard to Roleplay when you are grouped with classes/races you don't like and you may need. IE Dark Elf Cleric. I Roleplay around twice a month maybe. <p><p><div align="center"><embed width="300" height="332" src="http://users.skynet.be/bk287788/Sigs/Nyrogen.swf"></div>

Jendaani Snowhisper, Barbarian Shaman of 46 seasons, The Tribunal.<br>
<br>
2.  Jendaani treats everyone just about equally, or so she believes.  She is a bit wary of strangers, but will usually give the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
3.  No racial prejudices, although she hates it when gnomes lick her knees.<br>
<br>
4.  Favorite weapons are Dark Ember and Jade Prod.  Usually solos or plays in small groups of people she knows and trusts.  Jen has been burned too many times playing with strangers.  Although at her current age, she is more caster than melee fighter, Jendaani loves to sic her wolf on a mob and then bash away.<br>
<br>
5.  Jendaani hates dungeons or indoor areas.  She also is afraid of heights, and does not like to climb the ramp to Highhold, or run in the mountains.<br>
<br>
6. Follower.  <br>
<br>
7. Straight and narrow with a teensy little curve here and there!<br>
<br>
8.  Jendaani is not strictly connected with anyone, but has a soft spot for a certain Shaman friend.  Of course, when she was a wild young thing on the Tundra, she had a crush on Bandl..unrequited love never quite left her.<br>
<br>
9.  Jendaani is more a solitary person.  She has a sense of duty to her fellow Norrathians and her Brothers and Sisters in Bloodsong.  She's been known to give away 10-charge SoW potions if someone asks and can't afford.  One of her favorite things is to join her RP brother Muros from The Shadow Order and give out gifts to the young Barbarians in Everfrost on EQ Christmas day.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps your project, M'lord.<br>

<br>
 1.  Yilanu Lathander, 53 Hie Vicar of Bloodsong, Loving wife of semi-retired Nandiyen Lathander, my childhood sweetheart, ( in EQ).  She is ally in Thurgadin and is or almost is in SS&lt;(memory fading--too many long nights on  EQ).<br>
<br>
 2.  Yilanu is friendly towards all.  Believes in fairness and kindness, respect and honor. She has many friends and is known to carry on 4 to 7 conversations at once.  She has one pet peeve:  she hates being shafted or treated unfairly by selfish loot/exp mongers.  <br>
<br>
  3.  She has a preference for Males!  Known by some to be flirtatious, barbarian and human males especially. She also is extremely fond of iksars and gnomes.<br>
<br>
 4.  Yilanu currently uses either a dawnfire when vs undead or when being a non battle cleric.  She has maxed her weapon skill.  And a gorganga spiked club when battling. ( All of her equip is in bad need of upgrading)<br>
<br>
 5.  Yilanu is extremely clumsy.  Has been known to fall backwards over building edges at the most inopportune times, like. .  during a raid.  She also incurs damage at the least little bit of elevation change and can be heard screaming as she travels throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
 6.  Yilanu is extremely team oriented.  Her desire is for the health, welfare and benefit of the team.  And while she is cooperative, she can also be outspoken if she feels the situation warrants it.<br>
<br>
 7.  Yilanu is straight laced as far as factions go.  Extramarrietal affairs are not up for discussion.<br>
<br>
 8.  Yilanu is married in game to a semi-retired fellow cleric, Nandiyen Lathander.<br>
<br>
 9.  Yilanu is compassionate and passionate, spunky and friendly.  Generally good natured but can be irritated.  Gets along well with others.  ( sounds like an add for a stray at the dog pound)<br>

Which of your characters is your favorite and give us his/her/its full name/class/race/alignment.<br>
<br>
Right now I am enjoying my shaman the most - Mistydawnn, Shaman, Barbarian, Tribunal<br>
<br>
However, LOL, my mains are usually -<br>
Mistymoon Light, Warrior, Wood Elf, Tunare<br>
Mistylight O'Gannon, Monk, Human, ?<br>
<br>
2. How does your character act towards others? Of the same race? Of the same class? Towards total strangers?<br>
<br>
I usually treat everyone friendly and consider all friends at least till they do something stupid or piss me off - then watch out.<br>
<br>
3. Does your character have any prejudices? (It's EQ so being racist against dorfs is ok)<br>
<br>
I am aquiring a very strong dislike for people that can't play their classes well or have no clue about how to play the game.<br>
<br>
4. Favorite weapon/type of fighting for your character.<br>
<br>
well I really have never given much thought nor preference toward weapons so I guess for this one my answer would be N/A<br>
<br>
5. Any quirks?<br>
<br>
Kinda funny I remember people who piss me off once and tend to not give much attention to them again. -- I know I know this is really bad, especially for me.<br>
<br>
6. Leader? Soldier? Rebel? What?<br>
<br>
I try to be a leader and a follower as well.<br>
<br>
7. Straightlaced or corrupt?<br>
<br>
I wish I could say corrupt for the laugh of it but all that know me know Im not lol<br>
<br>
8. Is your character connected with anyone at the moment?<br>
<br>
MIstydawnn - No<br>
MIstylight - Grabnick<br>
<br>
9. What're your characters behaviors?<br>
<br>
I like to play to have fun and meet new people and maintain old friendships with all my friends.  I would say that no matter who I am playing I will always maintain contact and friendships with these people.  I try to be curteous to all and try to think to myself - what would I like to have done - Example as of late - May I have a sow when about 15 people ask at a time- so I do it and then med my mana back up-hehe<br>

Which of your characters is your favorite and give us his/her/its full name/class/race/alignment.<br>
<br>
Eer hard to tell but i will talk about Bacan now... High Elf Magician follower of Tunare.<br>
<br>
2. How does your character act towards others? Of the same race? Of the same class? Towards total strangers?<br>
<br>
Bacan is a follower of the magic arts and only tolerates the grunts characters, and only find himself at home with other caster types (Nukers, or healers). But he find himself amused sometimes by some of the lowly tanks efforts.<br>
<br>
3. Does your character have any prejudices? (It's EQ so being racist against dorfs is ok)<br>
<br>
Races doesnt matter to Bacan only high Intelligence or Wisdom is of care to him... Mainly: if your dumb you suck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Religion is not a matter of concern to him either, but he wont deviate from the path of mother Tunare even if his friends does.<br>
<br>
4. Favorite weapon/type of fighting for your character.<br>
<br>
Soloer to the bone, what Bacan only needs is a strong pet, and some vicious nukes. But from time to time he enjoys hunting with a small group of friends.<br>
<br>
5. Any quirks?<br>
<br>
Bacan hates Quadkiters, and sees quad kiting as a non honorable way of fighting the evil.<br>
<br>
6. Leader? Soldier? Rebel? What?<br>
<br>
Bacan doesnt likes big crowds, prefering the small groups where leadership is not really needed.<br>
In time of needs he doesnt neglects the role of leader if the task is worthy.<br>
<br>
7. Straightlaced or corrupt?<br>
<br>
Utmost straightforward he regards corruption as the work of lower minds.<br>
<br>
8. Is your character connected with anyone at the moment?<br>
<br>
After having his heart broken by a brunete wizard, no serious love interest has crossed Bacan's path, other than Austriana the Lanys uber babe.<br>
<br>
9. What're your characters behaviors?<br>
<br>
Bacan is curteous and welcome any ppl in his relations, until proved wrong.<br>
He always back away from conflics with ppl, fearful to cause more damage than good. He always think that his wrongdoers will find the wisdom to right their wrongs, given some time.<br>
He is utmostly loyal of his small group of friends, stoping at nothing to lend help in their needs, but is in turn very shy to ask for help for the acomplition of his desires. <p><BR><BR><BR>
