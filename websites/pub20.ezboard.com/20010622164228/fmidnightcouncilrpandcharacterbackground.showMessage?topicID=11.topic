<br>
The good races of dorfs and tree huggers were spreading their paganistic influences throughout Faydwer. What started as a band of orc protestors expanded into a cult who's idealogy of goodness permeated the lands.<br>
<br>
Their self-proclaimed righteousness had struck a chord in Ak'anon. King Akanon sought to halt the practice of the dark arts. Royal decree was set forth to have the mechanics build a new model of Clockworks to help cleanse the city.<br>
<br>
Eonis Mournunder and other followers of Bertoxxulous were banished to the deep recesses of Ak'anon. There their hatred biled and festered amongst their ranks. Many rose among them who sought to restore the dark order. A few were caught and persecuted. Some escaped to spread the word of the impeding lightness to Antonica. There was one who was born to deliver change.<br>
<br>
Yakub, nicknamed &quot;the big head scientist&quot; by his peers and teachers, restored the hope of their evil past. In his younger days he pilfered books from the Ak'anon library and digested everything he could. He reprogrammed Clockworks and turned some into Rogue Clockworks. But his greatest mark was left with his attempts at DNA splicing. Eonis and the heads of the Bertoxxulous' guilds were abhorred at Yakub's creations. They had already banished one of their followers to the caves of Steamfont. For all his brillance, they didn't want to see Yakub follow in Meldrath the Malignant's footsteps.<br>
<br>
Yakub had to work in secrecy. He wanted to have a race of obedient warriors who would crush the elves and dwarves. Forbidden from Ak'anon's zoo he had to find other avenues. There was a myth that a troll named Bubblegupp lived in Steamfont mountains. Yakub desperate to continue, spent many days &amp; nights in the mountains hoping to capture it.<br>
<br>
One day Bertoxxulous grined evilly down on his devout worshipper. Yakub was running from some kobolds when ran he across a hidden cave. A foul stench struck him as he entered. He ventured in further and discovered the corpses of drakes and kobold runts. This was a nest of some sorts. He grabbed some bone chips from the pile of corpses and summoned a demon to animate them and take form. There he sat with his pet until the cave's occupant returned.<br>
<br>
When the troll entered, Yakub's first plan was to capture it alive. But the troll proved too formidable for Yakub and his pet. The troll and pet fought fiercly, but the troll destroyed the pet. As fate would have it, the outcome of the battle left the troll severely hurt. Yakub sucked the last essence of life from the troll before he could meet his pet's fate. The troll laid there lifeless as Yakub's mind scrambled. In the short time it took for the troll to be killed he didn't notice that it was a female. He grabbed a severed femur from a kobold corpse and sharpened it against the granite wall. There was something he could salvage from all of this.<br>
<br>
Yakub had created a troll warrior to do his bidding. He hid it in the mountain cave until he could prove to his masters' how it could benefit their cause. Yakub taught his servant about hate and the evil ways. The troll was taught the art of killing and the ways of leadership. He sought to make this troll better than a warrior. It would possess the powers of necromancy. Due to the intelligence of the troll it was limited in power to a pure necromancer. But his strength and size would compensate for its lack of intelligence. Yakub called his creation Obeah.<br>
<br>
The masters had found out about Yakub's experiments and sought to destroy his abomination. Yakub couldn't allow this to happen. He packed up a few scrolls, armor, weapons, and other provisions and took Obeah to the Butcherblock Mountains. He knew they couldn't survive there forever and he had to get Obeah to Grobb where he could hide amongst other trolls until Yakub was ready. They stowed away on a boat headed to Freeport and then ran to Innothule swamp from there. Once they reached the swamp, Yakub instructed Obeah on how to reach Grobb. Yakub told Obeah to continue their struggle and to bring forth darkness.<br>
<br>
As Yakub turned and headed back to the desert he felt he had pleased the dark forces. A loud shriek had pierced his ears and sent a shiver to anything that was in hearing distance...<br>
