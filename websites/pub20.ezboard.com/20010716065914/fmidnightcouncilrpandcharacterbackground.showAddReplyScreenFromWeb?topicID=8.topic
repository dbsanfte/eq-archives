Throughout his young life he watched his older brothers battle. Tinkerdo was considered a good magician, both in talent and in his nature. Their parents are proud of Tinkerdo and want Tinkerbe to follow in his footsteps. Tinkerde is considered an outcast of the family. He chose to follow the dark arts. Without family support he struggles to rise in the ranks of necro-magic while Tinkerdo gains power quickly.<br>
<br>
Tinkerbe spent a lot of time thinking bout his brothers. Why would Tinkerde choose to be evil when it causes such hardship for both him and the family? While wondering around in Steamfont Mountains Tinkerbe happened upon Watchman Halv. Tink, as his family calls him, was happy to have someone protect him while adventuring in the dangerous area. Halv is a friendly sort, and happily comes to the rescue whenever Tink gets into trouble with the spiderlings and skeletons of the area. They quickly develop a friendship as Tink works to raise his skill.<br>
<br>
One morning Tink went out into Steamfont Mountains to visit his good friend Watchman Halv. To his horror the guard was dead, lying on the path where he was slain by a wood elf druid and a high elf cleric. Tink was horrified that two members of good races, neighbors to the gnomes, would do such a thing.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry about it,” the druid said with a laugh. “He will come back.” To Tink’s surprise Watchman Halv dropped from the sky, landing in his usual spot after being resurrected by the gods.<br>
<br>
“Halv is back,” the cleric told the druid. The two immediately begin to kill the guard.<br>
<br>
“What curse is this?” Tink asked as he watched Halv being killed over and over. “How can the gods of good permit such a thing. How can members of the so-called good races kill our guards over and over for practice and money? How can our neighbors do this to gnomes?” Tink ran through Steamfont and Ak’anon shouting for help. None of the other gnomes wanted to get involved.<br>
<br>
“That is just the way things are,” one gnome cleric told Tink. “The gods punish us for being neutral. They slaughter our guards so that our young are at the mercy of the monsters of the area. There is nothing you can do.” Tink was not ready to accept this. He continued to run through the city until he found his brother Tinkerde studying with the other necromancer in the depths of the Ak’anon tunnels.<br>
<br>
“Yes, we know,” Tinkerde told his younger brother. “You will not find help from our week and frightened brothers. Even the dark brotherhood of the gnome necromancers do not have the power to stop the slaying of our guards.”<br>
<br>
“You have to do something,” Tinkerbe cried. “Anything. Make them stop. Make them pay.” <br>
<br>
“We cannot make them stop,” his brother again told the crying young wizard. “But we plan to make them pay. Are you willing to do something to make the followers of good pay for what they do to Watchman Half and the other gnome guards?”<br>
<br>
“Yes. Anything.”<br>
<br>
Then travel west, past the city of the dwarves and catch a boat to Freeport. Once there travel to East Commonlands.  In the mountains to the north you will find a narrow passage. That will lead you to Neriak, city of the dark elves. Seek out the Midnight Council. Tell them you want to join the fight against the hypocrites that poison our land. They will instruct you on the art of revenge. Be warned brother, once you feel the warmth of your enemies blood on your hands you will never be the same.”<br>
<br>
Tinkerbe set out on a long journey, eventually finding the Midnight Council. He expected a group of vicious dark elves who enjoyed nothing better than killing. What he found was a jolly band of dark elves, ogres, trolls, humans, and even erudites. They all had stories of persecution at the hands of so called good members of society.<br>
<br>
“You have to prove yourself to us before you can join our ranks,” Tinkerbe was told by the council as they lead him on a journey.<br>
<br>
“What do I have to do?” he asked as the group stopped on a beach near a fishing camp.<br>
<br>
“See that cross-dressing barbarian standing next to the water? Just go say hello and he will instruct you on what to do next.”<br>
<br>
“Sure,” Tink said as he walked toward the barbarian.<br>
<br>
“A stinking little gnome,” the barbarian shouted before Tinkerbe could say hello. “You smell of evil.” The barbarian started beating on the little gnome wizard. Tinkerbe reacted by rooting the large idiot and blasting him repeatedly from a distance. The council cheered when Tinkerbe killed his oppressor.<br>
<br>
“You are now one of us,” they said as Tink was accepted into the council. While the others were celebrating Tinkerbe had another thought on his mind.<br>
<br>
“I have slain an enemy, but I have not yet felt the warmth of my enemies blood on my hands.” <p><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Reog</FONT></B> the educated ogre of <A HREF="http://www.midnight_council.homestead.com"><IMG SRC = "http://www.midnight_council.homestead.com/files/mcsmall.gif" WIDTH=195 HEIGHT=32  BORDER=0></A></P>
