<br>
RUNNY EYE<br>
<br>
Friday night we were supposedly raiding Runnyeye. <br>
<br>
I think the group was about an hour latel forming, but final roster was this, Ston 29 Chanter, Gubbins (me) 26 Druid, Orok 25 warrior, Ninyenea 19 warrior, and a 22 mage who's name is escaping me at the moment (sorry). Natton, 24 druid, tried coming too but was held up waiting for dawn to safely cross Kith, and he only got there in time for corpse runs.<br>
<br>
This wasn't the turnout we were expecting obviously. A 10 level spread made for an odd group as well. When finally together we marched down to the Warlord room, accidentally pulled 2 rooms at once, and got wasted.<br>
<br>
Ninyenea's corpse was lost in this initial battle and the rest of the night was spent looking for it.<br>
<br>
Kudos to Aradesh/Orok and Celi for putting in a determined a determined effort to find this corpse, but it was not recovered that evening.<br>
<br>
Aradesh died looking for this corpse, Ninyenea and the mage died twice, Ston died once, and my Bard that I brought over to sense corpse got wasted as well.<br>
<br>
So in summary we started late, suffered muliple deaths, no loot, and only had one encounter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But hey, at least we are trying to organize raids. That's a big improvement from before, and its probably a good sign that we did get a not bad turn out on such short notice. We just have to look at this and figure out how to improve our system of organizing raids.<br>
<br>
Question - How did Ninyenea finally get her corpse?<br>
Was it in a wall?<br>
<br>
Mistymoor (Friday)<br>
<br>
I saw a few of us were part of a UPN raid in Mistymoor on Friday. I'm not sure what happended but I heard it was a disaster as well. Mistymoor - hmm, my guess is trains.<br>
<br>
DALNIR (Sunday)<br>
<br>
This one got off to a late start as well. Dalnir is hard to find. It took a long time for everyone to show up, then when everyone was finally there, we all started going link dead. By the time we were rdy to go we were 3 1/2 hours behind schedule.<br>
<br>
I have to say though that we did finally put together a ringer of a group.<br>
<br>
Roster was this: Ganlaan 42 shaman, Ozomalt 41 warrior, Rundris 47 warrior, Fahfur 40 cleric, Pingyow 45 monk, Eldoron 41 ranger.<br>
<br>
(more people did show up initially but didnt make it through the LD scene)<br>
<br>
We were really tough on this place. When we got down deep to the third level we teamed up with a group of Magic's Gambit. We traded Fahfur to them because they lacked a healer. (never say Bloodsong isn't generous - giving away the cleric???) With two full groups together we owned the place. The mobs lived only for a few seconds at most. The only lame thing was the lack of interesting loot. Afer owning the Overseer's room and getting bored of no loot, we decided to go on one last crawl. This just led to more of the same - nothing, and we decided to leave. <br>
<br>
We had obviously gotten a little too cocky, and we pulled the whole Overseers room and a couple more. Out of 11 players I think 3 escaped and 7 died. The 3 of us that got out escorted Fahfur down to the corpses so he could rez everyone. Thus, a little drama was added to an otherwise calm night.<br>
<br>
Aside from being stupid at the end, and the uncontrollable factor that none of Ping's monk stuff dropped, I think this raid went ok. I had fun checking out this rather unique dungeon.<br>
<br>
The problems with the raid I think were this 1. Most everyone was late, and 2. When everyone did get there, it took a long time to organize ourselves into groups. <br>
<br>
I think ideally the person orgnizing the raid should make a list of everyone that is coming, and determine groups ahead of time. No offence to Ping intended at all - thanks man for getting us all out there, I enjoyed the sites. Again, I think this guild is just starting to get organized, and I think some discussion about how we get more organized would be a good thing.<br>
<br>
One thing that would help a lot I think is that whoever called the raid has to show up and take charge of everyone. If there is no leader, things go very slow.<br>
<br>
I think there is a lot of exciting stuff going on in Bloodsong these days. I had a great Bloodsong filled weekend. Its finally getting really interesting for me. I just hope we can work on our raid organization techniques.<br>
<br>
I hope everything goes well for Najeena.<br>
It looks like that raid is being organized very professionally.<br>

Don't worry about the rocky start guys.  It happens to us all.  The first 3 times UPN tried to raid Mistymoore were utter disasters.  It took us a while to get the hang of it.  As for starting late.  I know I have led about 3 dozen raids.  I still can't claim I have led one that started on time.  It is very exciting as you progress to bigger and better things.  You just gotta be ready for some failures.  Sometimes bad things happen.  Heck about 3 weeks ago I led a Fear raid that had a tough break.  I lost 2 weeks of hard earned exp and my raid was about 6 hours late.<br>
<br>
  Still you can't let things like that get you down.  Everquest is all about trial and error.  Raids in my opinion are the funest thing to do in the game.  There is nothing more satisfieing than standing over the body of some boss mob your raid just killed and calling out the loot your friends will soon have an opertunity to win.<br>
