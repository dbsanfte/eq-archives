For as long as I can remember I was always &quot;special&quot;.  As a young lad I can remember as I was running through the forest or   just walking down the street in Erudin I would see stuff out of the corner of my eye but when I looked it was gone.  Shadows would seem to shift, shapes that I thought I saw would just disappear into the shadows.  When I told my parents about this they were concerned and started keeping a closer eye on me.<br>
<br>
I have always been an oucast of sorts.  I never played warrior with the other kids, or tried to learn the petty magic tricks that the other kids would run around showing off.  I was content keeping to myself, to my own thoughs.  I was an observer, I watched everything, the way people acted, the way people talked.  I learned a lot about the way politics worked vs how they wanted you to think they worked.  I saw things happen that would not even be spoken of in the most hushed of wispers.  Murders done by the head Paladins and the senior Clerics of the city that were done in the name of good.  I began to dispise these things, not only to dispise but to hate them from the very core of my being.<br>
<br>
I remember the first time that Cazic spoke to me, well not directly but he sent his Emmisary to me and through him...it...he spoke to me.  I was playing on the rocks one day when Detholven, my childhood tormenter, came up to me and pushed me off the rocks and into the water.  As I pulled myself out of the water I remember there were about 6 boys there all a little older than me.  They were all laughing and pointing at me.  Anger and rage welled up inside of me and I snapped.  I don't know where it came from or how I knew how to do this but I reached out and put my hand on Detholven's chest and pulled his very life from his body.  I remember the shock and horror on the faces of the other boys as his body crumpled to the groud...dead.  They recovered quick and ran screaming in terror.  I was shocked and disgusted with myself when I realized what I had done.  I was no better than the ones I hated.<br>
<br>
I ran and I kept running till I could no longer run.  I colapsed in a heap in the middle of the forest and wept in agony.  I could hear the guards from the city looking for me as I hid beneath a bush.  It was then that Cazic sent his Emmisary to me.  I lay there broken and sobbing when out of the shadows steped a form...if you can call it that.  Surprisingly I felt a sense of calm come over me as I gazed upon him.  I don't think it really spoke, more of just put thoughts in my head and I knew what it was saying.  I was chosen to be a servent of Cazic, a servent for life.  He told me where to find the city of Paineel and that I would be safe there and they would teach me how to use the powers that I had been given.  He then stepped back into the shadows and was gone.<br>
<br>
I went to the city as I had been directed and located my masters.  They tought me many things things that would make most people violently sick.  How to steal life force, how to make things fear me, how to control death and darkness its self.  I was disgusted with myself but over time I grew to like it.  Nay not like it, love it.  I vowed that I would have revenge on the very people that I had seen take innocent lives for no better reason than because they threatened their power.  I would have revenge on the children that tought me to hate growing up.  After my masters had tought me all that they could they told me I must now leave Paineel. That I must seek out the Midnight Council and that they would teach me the things I needed to know.  That I would find people like myself, who hate society, who were outcasts, and that together we would get what we sought.  Revenge. <p><A HREF="MAILTO:thespek@hotmail.com"><B>Syzian</A></B><BR>
