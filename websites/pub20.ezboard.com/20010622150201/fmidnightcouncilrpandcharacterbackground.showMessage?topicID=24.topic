I began murming the incadations for the spell, the spell that would transform my soul to my grand lich,paled majiks flowed down onto my fingertips.<br>
Droplets of the necromantic majiks dripped down off my hands and disapeared into thin air before they reched the ground, the ground of my lybrinth of iced caves. My hands, now envoluped in majiks i raised them to my shoulders hight, watching the powers flow like a stream to the ground. Then i brought them down with thunderous spead. Moved my entire arms in cricler fashion watching how the very fabric of time ripped where the lost souls cried out with great pain for help, openings from planes began to apear infromt of me. in one image i saw several floating rocks bound together by chains in another i saw the fears from others roaming around mercyless in a burning forest. But one that stood out of them all was the one where Hatred seemed to slice throu the grim gates of a darkend land... the plane of hate. The planes began to fade into my right hand along with all my memery's and thoughts form into a globe brighter than any star or flame.theres no going back now i thought to myslef. i heard a slight noise over all the majiks, i ignored it foolishly i may have the most grand intellgence norrath hath ever seen but sadly i was none to wise. With the burning globe of my existance at my fingertips i began to walk towards the lich. With out any warning i heard the words &quot;Demon Of darkness prepare thee death!&quot; as a barbarian wielding a long sword and in a full set of plate armor charged against my lich and attemted beheaded it. with all this happining i quickly charged the for my lich so i could be in control of it, a little to quickly for i tripped and went hand first into the damned barbarians neck. dazed and confused i peered out  of a small light that seemed to slice through a metal surrounding my head to see my body my erudite body lying dead with a collapsed forehead and a burned off hand. I then tried to move, and to my most cheerful surprise it worked but the next surprise was not to cheerful for as i stood up not knowing my name or many of my thought but only the last few minutes, i looked ahead to see to my horror a globe of burning majiks filled with all my other memory's the ones rejected by... by... the BARBARIAN!! the experiment was a horrible failur and almost instanly as i relized this a hand of the most strongest flesh came smashing down on my head forcing my to fall on my hands and knee's. i then saw a sword lying next to the lich's feet i reached for it and brought it up allong with myself and plunged it deep within the lich's stomach slicing a through the ribs into the heart of the lich and out through the side. For a few moments i thought it was over until  was hit in the face with the strengh of a gaint and flung thirty feet down the iced caves. My eyes now bloodshot and sweat and blood driped down my face, i torn the helmet off and began running down i heard the lich running with lighting speed as i  stumbled down the cave,   after about 30 minutes of just sprinting down the cold caverns i relized the lich's footsteps were no longer head. Had i outran it? or had it returned to the room? My lungs burned like a inferno and my  legs where of liqued and my mouth dry'er than a sand. I then collapsed gasping for air as my throught parched and dry burned along with every other body part. The next thing i knew was it being freezing cold i had no idea how long i was unconsus nor did i care. The cold had nearly iced over the barbarians rough skin as i stood up hoping for no more surprise then no surprises. Nothing but many caves leading out of the cavern i had ran to. Trying to come to my senses i choose one of the caves, i do not remember wich for my brian felt like liquid and was to hard to think or remember anything. I stumbles in and out of caves for days weeks possibly months. With no food supplie or water i was starving and dying of thirst struggling to survive  the snow and ices. One lucky day i was crawling on the ground barley alive i saw a opeing in the snow where a single beam of light slice throu the snow. Relizing this must be sunlight my dashed for where i saw the beam and madly began digging  through it. an Opening! i saw the the sun slowly dipping back into the horizion. I stood up and raised my arms and Shouted with my exitment &quot;IM FREE!&quot; then collapsed once again. When i awoke i slightly opend my eyes seeing that the ground below me blood red snow... my blood and the ground was moving, something was dragging me but what? I peered over to see my puller and saw a jaw of razor sharp teeth pulling me by my shoulder. &quot;Hey!&quot; I heard someone shout, &quot; Get away from him&quot; there where several footsteps coming toward me then i heard the bear moan drop me and run off. &quot;Come here good mate&quot; said the unknown savior bandaging my wounds, then hepled my up. &quot;Why! what happend to you Baldaviar!  everyone thought you had been slain by the orcs. if ya dont remember its me mclain&quot; i think thats what he said his name was. &quot;Listin you better head down to qeynos for some poitions to get yeself fixed up right, we barbarians dont have the stuff  the people int qeynos do&quot;  he pointed in the direction of yet another cave but this one had a few gnolls in it.&quot; Go up that away  throug those caves and stick to the left wall once you get into the caves dont make any turns until you get out into the open there should be another cave across from there go through that then head south till u get to qeynoys alright, o you look hungry heres some food and water&quot; i gave no replie just gupled all the water and ate the food in one it and  followed the directions to qeynos. I walked up into the cave sneaking past the gnolls. It was dark and damp in it and i continues to travel through the cave checking my scabberd incase any gnolls tryed to attack me. I  then saw the light of day as i struggled down the caves it seemed to blind me but it brought some joy to me. I worked my way across black burrow avoiding the dog like gnolls. I then saw the cave entrance and straggled through it into the hills of what i think where qeynos. Moving my way down a path several guards every now and then looked and my poor self judgmentaly, After about and 20 minutes of walking i came apon the gates of qeynos movning through pianed by my horrible experiment i instead of trying to heal myslef i went strait to a bar. Drinking seems to make all a blur but i remember a snappy mouth little dwarf  with an' irontoe making rude comments me being drunk as i was drew my swor and slayed the fool. Several guards instantly caming running to me relizing my mistake i made a mad dash to the docks. to my luck the boat was just departing as i ran up the docks i made a leap of almost pure luck and landded on the boat the Seaking, the chasing guards did not get the luck. The boat ride was hard and painful and more painful once i sobered up. Somehow i dont know how i made iit to erudin and as Sabrina came next to the boat i steped on it hoping  word of my murders hadnt reached erudin before I. As the boat approached the grand marble city of erudin i steped off and heard several quitly hushed voices and then a shout &quot;Kill Him! kill the damned barbarian!&quot; shouted a guard that was pointing at me. four guards ran up and in an instant  a blade sliced through my stomack then neck causing my to stand strait moment before my death, everything seemed too go into slow motion as i brought my hand into vision i saw the burning globe and plunged my hand into the back of a young erudite who i learned name was Erud Pressman. In an instant all the pain was gone and i saw a bloodyd body of a barbarian blood oozing from the wounds. One of the erudites shouted the barbarian was not dead yet and one of us is him. the guards begin asking other guards personal quistions to see if one wasnt themslef a guard aproached me and asked what sorcery did i practice Without respounding i spinted down the erudin on the teleport through the halls onto the teleport above the water pass the palace pass the forge of erud pas the liabry into ran to the teleport to toxxilu ran through the hallway pass the guards and fled to the grand city of paineel i did all that by instict not knowing where i was, and all the time every guard was chasing my in hopes to slay me.<br>
<br>
Now i have returned to my necromantic ways and to pursue my past but one quistion ponders my mind... what was my orgianal name for it hadnt been tranfered through the burning globe..... if anyone hepls they shall be rewarded until then i am known as Hatebringer<br>
