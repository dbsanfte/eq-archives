I am not here to tell my story, but a tale I heard at a bar in Neriak.<br>
<br>
I was heading to Freeport from the Temple of SolRo, when a gigantic storm came over and forced me to take cover. The only place I could go was Neriak. I donned my mask, pulled my hood as far over my head as possible, and made sure to hide my light flesh.<br>
<br>
I made my way to the nearest bar. I flipped a coin to the bartender and sat down looking out into the water. She brought me my drink, and mentioned the sign above the bar.  It read, &quot;tElL da teLL, and git sum alle.&quot;  She mentioned something of the ogre washing dishes behind the bar. I said, &quot;Figures.&quot; The bartender walked off.<br>
<br>
The door opened and the entire crowd in the bar turned around.  Two men walked in.  The first one, covered from head to toe in black, pulled back his hood revealing his piercing eyes, and a smile. He placed his scythe by the door, and took from his left hand a little cone, from which a shield of pure white energy came. The man placed the cone in its holder, and it's brilliance faded. I sensed an amazing power from him, but I was not afraid.<br>
<br>
The second man was dressed in a suit of what seemed to be pure gold. It glowed like the sun. He removed his horned helmet and placed it on the handle of his overturned mace. He then leaned his shield against his helmet.  He looked around and cracked his knuckles. <br>
<br>
The robed man walked over to the bar and sat next to me. He said &quot;Hey, Bubbo, nice banner.&quot; The ogre giggled to himself and blushed. <br>
<br>
The man looked around again and his eyes met mine.  He drew close to me, and I was instantly paralized in fear. I couldn't move, talk, or even breath. He wispered to me as if i was hearing his thoughts, &quot;You have guts coming in here. I know what you are. You have my respect.&quot; He casually turned to the bartender and called for his usual.  <br>
<br>
The second took the seat beside the first. He too looked at me and took a double take. He ordered a drink, and stood up and came around to me.  He said some stupid pick up line, which I ignored. He sat down with a sigh. He saw the marks and bruises on my arm. With a snap of his fingers they were gone. I uttered a small &quot;thanks.&quot; <br>
<br>
The man in black stood up, walked to the center of the room and said, &quot;In light of Bubbo's effort, I'll have my take as some ale.&quot;  He paused for a second gathering his thoughts and begain:<br>
<br>
My name is Ndiavar, and this is my brother Rebrn. Our father's name was Daemon. **********  He was a handsome Dark Enchanter who liked his women. He bragged about his conquests he even said that he has slept with every race in Norrath, a claim that frankly, i dont' doubt.  I know rumors of his offspring with woodelves, and even iksar. The going rumor is of two iksar children one named after deceit the other after truth. But i digress.  <br>
<br>
My mother was a shadownight drawn in by his charm.  He promised support, love, and security. None of which he gave. I lived a solitery life. The children at school made fun of me for I was a weak bastard.  My mother was disappointed in my lack of strength, but she still loved me and showed the the true ways of hate. She always said i have a gift, and that some day i would find it out.<br>
<br>
That day came when i was mocked and beaten in school.  I fled school, ran out past the guards and into the woods.  I sat on a log, layed down and cried a single tear when i felt a sharp pain in my leg.  I looked down to see a snake with it's fangs deep into my calf. I felt the poison creap into my body.  I stood up and hate welled up in me. I began to breath hard. I closed my eyes and I saw Lord Innoruuk laughing at my pitiful existance. My breath returned.  I stared at the snake and my hate decended on it as a darkness. I locked eyes with it and screamed. I saw its mind well up with fear, and it begain to flee. The darkness didn't allow it's escape. I took a step towards it, and realized the pain in my leg as i fell to the ground. In dispair i grabbed the snakes tail. As i took a deep breath to wail, its body shrivled up and turned to dust. I was healed. I stood up unscathed save the holes in my pants.  <br>
<br>
It was at this point when i realized my power. That day I walked the woods practicing my newly learned skills. I learned to control them. I discoverd a small blade which i hid in my sleeve.  I begain using it aswell as my skills to kill. I grew stronger and stronger that day. <br>
<br>
On my way back home i saw a pitiful human being mauled by a wolf. I cackled to my self.  I slit the dog's throat, and sucked the puppy dry.  The human looked up at me in fear, and slowly dragged his bloody mass backwards.  Without thinking, I closed my eyes, raised my hands, and pushed.  I slumped to my knees as i saw his wounds disappear.  Gashes came in my flesh. I took his pain as mine. He stood up and ran, stumbled over a rock and continued off in the darkness.  I finished my way home devouring creatures to cure the wounds received.<br>
<br>
I walked in the house, my mother looked at me, and knew. Come with me she said, and i followed. She took me, without a word, to a man who had names for my skills. He welcomed me with open arms, and taught me further how to control these powers. The man even showed me how to raise a minion to do my bidding.  I am the result of that training, and many years of experience.<br>
<br>
My brother's tale is one even he wants to forget, for he was born a twin. They both shared the name, Rebrn. She progressed abit faster than he did. She begain training their mothers profession, healing. I helped her with money, and armor, and other items she needed. He watched her grow in power and strength, but had no interest in it. He had visions of fighting tooth and nail with the enemy.<br>
<br>
One day he returned home to a broken door, and a looted house.  He stumbled upon the corpse of his mother. Her body was mangled and bloody, raveged by some unknown villan.  He made his way to the back of the house where he found his sister dieing.  Rebrn held her in his arms and watched her die. Her last words were, &quot;the lights will pay for what they have done today. Make us proud in your conquests, and always bring glory to Lord Innoru. . .. &quot;<br>
<br>
He swore that day to never be helpless in death again. He took his sister's armor as a reminder and to this day carries a piece of it with him.<br>
:<br>
<br>
The crowd remained speechless for a moment, until Bubbo ran out from behind the bar yelling, &quot;tal tal, al al, tal tal, al al.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ndiavar patted the ogre on the head and laughed. &quot;Drinks are on me tonight!&quot; he yelled, and everyone cheered.<br>
<br>
He returned to his seat by me and said to me, &quot;The storm is over, you best be going.&quot; I nodded, and started to leave. &quot;I will see you again, I am sure of it,&quot; he said. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
I started to sing my little song, and beat on my drum.  The entire bar turned to me in astonishment. I removed my mask, and laughed as they drew their weapons. &quot;Appia,&quot; I said as I disappeared in my song and sped off.  I heard the brother's deep laughter as i zoomed out of the cave they call Neriak.<br>
