I made a few character changes to give context within MC and present it to you now.<br>
<br>
Part I<br>
<br>
 Longinius was a reflective sort of fellow. So he didn't spend a lot of time cursing the misfortune that led to his current assignment. He did, however, remind himself that if he survived this mission it would be the last time he would let the priest Belmonte suggest a place to relax and entertain himself<br>
after an evenings studies. But then again, how was Belmonte to know Seloxia Punox had a daughter studying the arts of Enchantment in the Tower of the Spurned? Let alone that she might be funding her tuition working nights in the Maiden’s Fancy. Next time, if there was one, he thought, He would just head to the barracks for the normal night's game of Tonk with some of the warriors from the 4th, where the only arguments about Kings and Queens were when more than one of the same suit showed up in play.<br>
<br>
Master Tolexx had been quite clear on the matter: “ It is being seen as an insult to one of the Great Houses of Neriak. The honor of the House of Innoruk's Knights was at stake.” he said. Of course, no one had asked the young Punox girl what she was doing in The Fancy, exercising her Guise spells in the manner she had been. “Amends must be made. You must understand that, Longinius.” his Master had said emphatically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Longinius was not unloved in the House of Shadows,  and would be missed to be sure.&quot;; Master Tolexx  said, coming to the end of pronouncement. Because of that he was not being sent in several small boxes to the House of Warriors outright. Longinius was a servant of the Queen, no matter how low, and the Punox family, as warriors, served the King; it was decided the matter of punishment was to be left up to the Priests of Innoruuk. They were considered impartial judges in matters between houses, regardless of the harshness of the lessons those punishments usually tried to convey.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring me the head of Master Whoopal.&quot; The High Priest  said. &quot;Through your sacrifice the name of your House shall be spared.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                                                                      Part II<br>
<br>
 Longinius laughed quietly to himself, his breath forming a cloud before him in the early morning air. “ The head of Master Whoopal indeed, and me barely out of my apprenticeship. So much for dreaming.” the doomed youth thought to himself. Longinius wore little in the way of armor, but he carried his father’s greatsword. A long, slim wicked looking blade that was said to have been a gift to his father from the outpost commander in Overthere, his father’s last post of service. His father had saved the commanders life during a massive attack by Sarnaks. It was said to be one of the finest pieces of steel in Neriak and was named Snicker-snack by the ancient runes that ran its length. The sword had been sent home after his father disappeared on a raid into a place called Dalnir. Placing the pack he had brought with him from the winery and his father’s sword into the bowl formed by a small raft he had made from reeds and his oilskin cloak, he slipped into the cold water of the nameless river that ran through Nektulos Forest.<br>
<br>
Longinius crossed the river as quitly as possible, deposited the pack where it would be easily spotted by the little heathen bastards when they came down to the river to fetch the water they used to make whateverr that horrid brew was they drank in the morning. Longinius slipped back in the water and let the current carry him downstream a ways to a spot he considered far enough from the camp to make his final preparations.<br>
<br>
&quot;Focus!&quot; Longinius said to himself, working a whetstone down the long edge of the ancient greatsword.  If he was going to get through this, he thought, it would take complete concentration. “Hate is our mantra.” the Master of Shadow Knights had told him. “Bring up a fine rage and the way to your enemy's destruction would be clear.”  Destroying the enemy was all well and good, but Longinius reflected that he was much more suited to defilement. But, then again, that was the kind of thinking that had gotten him into trouble in the first place.<br>
<br>
As he put the final coat of lime polish on his sword, Longinius went over the mission parameters for the hundredth time. The mission was quite simple. Kill Master Whoopal and return his head to the High Priest of Innoruuk. Longinius normally disdained the rather barbaric notion of trophies but he was left with little choice in the matter. His best hope was that the halflings were all besotted on the Kalish he had left at the river’s edge. If so he might be able to lure a few towards the river with his pet where they might fall in and drown or better still, end up as piranha food. At least with the other halflings gone he might have a chance to die with Whoopal’s blood on his blade.<br>
<br>
At that moment in his musings, Fortune decided to play a hand<br>
<br>
                                                                      Part III<br>
<br>
 Whoopal was furious. He cursed to himself as he made his way back to camp after chasing off what had first seemed to be an attack by a demon wolf. Where the Leatherfoot Deputy had gotten to was anybody's guess. But he would have words for him once his wandering carcass hauled itself into the temple by the river they called home. Whoopal brushed dead wasps from his work coat. “Damn stinging swarm.” he  thought. Whoopal had never even thought how much it might hurt when he cast it on the Inkies. He just loved the way it made the blue devils dance when they ran. Once he got back to camp and had a moments piece for meditation; and maybe a bit of lunch, he would take care of the swellings that  were quickly making his life miserable.<br>
 <br>
“A Druid of all things!” Whoopal went on to himself. “You might expect incursions of the Blue Devils or maybe even a few Orcs from the Commons, but a  Gods forsaken Human druid had made a run at my camp!”  The Boys just stood there in a drunken stupor all soused up from Brell knew what, and so Whoopal  had been required to carry the fight to the Wolf spirited menace from Freeport's suburbs.<br>
<br>
Whoopal continued bemoaning his fate to being exiled here to this backlot of acreage. “Constantly beset by rain and cold. Not to mention the mud.”  he continued in his muttering. “Can't even call it a proper allotment. By the Gods of hearth and Home I miss my fire in warm, cozy little Rivervale.” The fact that he might miss lunch altogether was making him cranky. So much so that he did not pay attention to the actually serious nature of his wounds. Nor did he hear the sound of Death approaching.<br>
<br>
Longinius couldn’t believe his eyes. There before him was his target. Bleeding from a dozen or more wounds in his body and totally oblivious of his surroundings. Summoning up the entirety of his inner fire, channeling on the frustration of being set an impossible task, he focused his entire rage at the waddling form before him, stepped from his hiding place and released it all in one searing bolt, engulfing the horrid little creature in eldritch flames.<br>
<br>
As he was bathed in the fires of Innoruk, the last thought in Master Whoopal's mind was that this was the warmest he had been since leaving  Rivervale.  <br>
<br>
Longinius whistled a little tune to himself as he carried out the last little grisly portion of his task. As he finished cleaning his blade on the Halfling's  coat he came to the conclusion that this might not be such a bad day after all.  <br>
