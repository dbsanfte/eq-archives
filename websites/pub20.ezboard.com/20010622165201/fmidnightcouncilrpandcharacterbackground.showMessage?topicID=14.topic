My father and two brothers decided to advance my training in this area they called the eastern region of the Commonlands.  My eyes started to hurt from trying to adjust to the light.  It was very different from our dark forest.  My father told me to be careful, because the guards would not help me if I were to get in trouble.  He said they merely tolerate dark elves.  He sent me off to find something to kill.  <br>
<br>
As I walked away, I took a look back to see my father with his arms crossed and my brothers practicing their spell casting.  They were much smarter than I.  One could quickly advance the time it takes to recover from battle, and the other could make bones walk.  I was very impressed with their skills and hoped that one day I could use my own skills to be worth something in battle to them.  <br>
<br>
I strolled over a hill with a heavy, rusted over, two handed sword and a backpack filled with various things.  Father said they would increase my strength.  At the base of the hill I saw a strange sight.  Four humans sat around a fire, eating and drinking, and being very loud.  I had never seen a human before, but the description my family gave of them fit perfectly.  It wasn't long before they realized I was watching them.  All of them stood up and started stumbling in my direction.  Some of them unleashed weapons, and that's when I ran back to my father.  The humans followed me all the way back.  <br>
    My father told me, &quot;If we should fail to win this battle, return to our forest, and the eternal darkness will protect you.  Now go hide, quickly!&quot;  I ran as fast as I could to a distant tree.  Little did I know that was the last thing my father would ever say to me.  I could still see shadows of the humans and my family.  I could only watch as the vicious battle began.  I had hoped that the state in which the humans were in would sway the advantage to our side.  I was brutally wrong.  The humans were advanced and skilled warriors and it seemed their drink gave them an edge.  In pure horror, I witnessed what was left of my family be slain in cold blood.  <br>
<br>
The humans left in a boisterous manner, never bothering to take anything from the recently dead.  I creeped up to the bodies.  There lying in a blanket of death, were my two brothers and my father.  The anger swelled within me.  I stabbed my old sword in the ground.  I opened my father's hand and took his sword into my own.  As I tightly gripped the handle, shadows began to flicker around the blade.  The metal no longer glissoned in the noon-day sun, but instead shadowed everything around it.  The sword absorbed my pain.  This containment caused the metal to turn black.  I sheathed the weapon and placed it on my back.  I also gathered some supplies and took &quot;The Word of Innoruuk&quot; from my father's back pocket.  I stood and whispered a short goodbye.  Not fully knowing my final destination, I started to run to where I felt most at home.  Nektulos.  Thoughts of my mother darted through my head.  Could she still be alive somewhere?  The notion of being strong had left.  I ran swift with the wind in my hair, as crimson tears of hatred screamed down my face.  <br>

I have become much stronger and the path has become clearer.  I now stand amongst others that know my pain.  We call ourselves, Midnight Council.  I can still remember how honored I felt when given the priviledge to join this elite band of fighters.  A fine cleric by the name of Lexxii made this all possible.  <br>
<br>
Returning to Neriak after a long, hard day of killing, I stumbled upon a young cleric.  She was dressed in very little tattered leather and such.  A beaten up, old staff was gripped in her hands.  I immediately took a liking to her name.  I struck up a conversation with her and found she was most genuine and innocent.  She was an almost exact duplicate of how fun loving I used to be in my youth.  I decided to give her some pieces of armor that I had no more use for.  Her eyes opened wide, stared directly into mine.  As she held the scarred armor, I could see the appreciation on her face.  I decided to take off my helm and formerly introduce myself.  She instantly commented on my beauty.  No one had done that for a long, long time.  Eventually our conversation came to an end.  Before I left the cleric in the battle field I made her a promise.  I vowed to bring her the great Glowing Wooden Crook.  A rare weapon such as this would greatly help her advance her training.  She offered to help me slay the keeper of the staff, but I declined.  I had come to take a great liking to Lexxii, and I do not think I would stay sane if her life should be taken by the horrors of this world.  <br>
<br>
Some weeks had passed and once again I found myself in the home forest of Nektulos.  With my sword sheathed at my side, and a large crook on my back, I saught out Lexxii.  I found her sitting on a log conversing with her fellow dark elves.  I immediately noticed she had become much stronger than before.  She was draped in full banded armor and there was a certain gleam in her eye.  She quickly recognized me and embraced me in a hug.  Her hands struck the crook on my back.  A smile crossed my face.  She took a few step backs with her eyes wide and her mouth open as I handed her the Glowing Wooden Crook.  I told her about the battle with the beast, and pointed the punctured holes in my armor.  Just then, blue sparks shot out from Lexxii's fingertips and flashes of light surrounded me.  Immediately I felt healed.  Her powers had increased greatly.  I am fortunate to have such a wonderful friend.  Her generosity did not cease there however.  She asked if I would join the ranks of her guild.  I had noticed the tag on her armor, but thought nothing of it.  I accepted her invitation and became a proud member of their alliance.  Once again I left Lexxii to her training and I set off for more information about the death of my family and the disappearance of my mother.  Much time has gone by since that day.  I have become much stronger and the path has become clearer.  I now stand amongst others that know my pain.  We call ourselves, Midnight Council.  <br>
