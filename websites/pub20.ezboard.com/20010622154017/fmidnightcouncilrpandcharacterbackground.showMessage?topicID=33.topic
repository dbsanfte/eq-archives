The toils of the Council, although the path set forth by Innoruuk, could be tiresome, and for those brief Days of rest he was granted he was content.<br>
<br>
 It was here in his abode where several weeks hence he had recieved word from those spies he had sent into the Faydwer, and other Realms abroad, had reported to him the Breaking of the Circle, after the Vigil had failed in its attempted Seige of Castle Mistmoore...<br>
<br>
 Now he delighted on the memorance of that day, those fools he had watched run in circles attempting to find the slightest hint of the Council, and the toy Leafenryn, he who the High Cleric had in a sence Created, march on a sad crusaide against his power!<br>
<br>
 As he relaxed at his large Desk, made from the wood of Slay'n Treeants, he was greatly anoyed at the sudden tapping on his chamber door...<br>
<br>
 &quot;What!?&quot; he barked, not even trying to hide his anger.<br>
<br>
 &quot;A Message M'Lord,&quot; came the muffled reply through the thick door &quot;I am told it is of great urgancy!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Slowely rising from his seat, he marched to the Door, and thrust it opened with a crash. There standing befor him was a small, slightly shaking, messanger (a Tier'Dal, but a weak one). The young Dark Elf held his hand aloft, in his white knucles he held a peice of Paper...that had been staned in blood.<br>
<br>
 Belmonte Smiled, and took the note from the fool...and slammed the door in his face.<br>
<br>
 &quot;What could this be?&quot; he asked the room &quot;It is decorated apropriately....&quot;<br>
<br>
 As he opened it, the smirk on his face faded and then turned to a scowl of hate....the letter had been a missive from one of his agents who worked secretly in Castle Mistmoore, and watched Kelethin and Felwithe....It was written in two Parts though, and each part was scribed in a different hand, as though there were two authors. The Note Read:<br>
<br>
 My Lord;<br>
  As we knew, the Circle of the Mute prophet has been shattered, and of this I write you in haste. The prophet, none other than the &quot;Sister&quot; of Leafenryn, Valadorn, has disapeared...<br>
  ..we belive she has been taken out of our reach, not by mortal hands, but a Wizard of Mistmoore tells she has been taken &quot;home by the Mother's Hands...&quot; these are Ill tidings indeed!<br>
<br>
 (there the first Part Ended, and the second writing began)<br>
<br>
 Belmonte;<br>
  I found this writ on the corpse of the messanger who attempted to reach you, now I conclude his work.<br>
  In the 2 Days that I have had this letter I have checked on the Kaethorn fool.....Dread news have I found...<br>
<br>
 He has recieved news from his sister, and His....his Father....a New path has been lay'n before those chosen from the Circle that was broken...and it is one of Vengance. Be Warned my Lord...Innoruuk Bless us.<br>
<br>
(and there the letter Ends)<br>
<br>
 His day of rest ruined, Belmonte garbed himself in his official Robs and Armour, strapped on his mace, and left his abode...he sent out the call through his messangers that the council must assemble.....<br>
<br>
 &quot;Well Belmonte, Slayer of my Past.....look ahead, for I am your future! As we move through the Wilderlands in search of your Followers, they will feel the priking of Thorns, beneath many Leaves.....Be Warned, for the Vengance of Tunare is upon you, and all your Ilk!&quot; <p><i><b>Leafenryn Kaethorn</i><br> Warden of the Circle</b><br> <i>"They shall fight with Claw and Horn, we shall Fight with Ivy and Thorn..."</i></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground.showMessage?topicID=31.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground.emailToFriend?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground.threadControl?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub20.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="midnightcouncilgeneral">General<option value="midnightcouncilabouttheguild">About Midnight Council<option value="midnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground">RP & Character Background<option value="midnightcounciloutofcharacter">Out Of Character<option value="midnightcounciltipsandtricks">Tips & Tricks<option value="midnightcounciltradeandsell">Trade & Sell<option value="midnightcouncilfrm8">Events & Raids<option value="midnightcouncilguildmemberarea">Guild Member Area<option value="midnightcouncilfrm9">Council Bench<option value="midnightcouncilfrm7">Inner Circle</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/bmidnightcouncil>Midnight Council</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub20.ezboard.com/fmidnightcouncilrpandcharacterbackground>RP & Character Background</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/midnightcouncil/">Midnight Council Home Page</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
