Well there are some things that you will need to know. First off, we're a close-knit guild and we'll only be looking to add in people that fit in with all of our current membership. You will be expected to get along with and work well with everyone. If you come thinking &quot;I want to join because of my friend ____ even though I dislike ____.&quot; this probably isn’t the guild for you. By all means, join us on day-to-day events. However, unless you can work with EVERYONE, please seriously consider looking elsewhere for a guild.<br>
<br>
REQUIRED LEVEL:<br>
As much as we'd like to admit anyone that would fit with our members, we do focus heavily on grouping within the guild. Therefore we do require an absolute minimum of 46th level, capable of going to the planes with us. We prefer 51st level or above, as most of the areas we frequent are gear towards players in their 50s.<br>
<br>
EXPANSIONS:<br>
We spend the vast majority of our time in Kunark and the recently release Vellious. So much so that if you see us in the old world, we're probably getting ready for a plane raid. Also, it's hard to get to the 51st or higher level without them. This isn't a hard and fast requirement, but it's something you should very much keep in mind. No sense joining a guild and not being able to ever group with any of them. Also it’s going to be much harder to get to know us.<br>
<br>
CLASSES:<br>
There is no requirement that says you must be of a specific class to join, we will allow recruits of any class. Of course at any point in a guilds life the need for some classes outweighs the need for others and those classes will have an easier time in joining.<br>
<br>
ZINE KEYS:<br>
Currently, everyone in the guild has a key to Sebilis, and you probably should too. If you're serious about joining and are grouping with us regularly, expect us to drag you out to Trakanon's Teeth and get one of these. If you do not get one and are accepted into Knights Reknown, rest assured you will be dragged there very shortly upon joining, in fact I wouldn’t be surprised if you were inducted as you’re turning in the components. Along similar lines Cobalt Scar teeth, and Howling Stones keys are a definite plus. We're looking to finish getting all the current members their keys as we plan to start hitting Howling Stones soon.<br>
<br>
TIMELINE:<br>
Don't expect to be able to join right away, it may take some time to get to know everyone, and for everyone to get to know you. We'd rather take our time making sure that new members will be a good fit than have to remove people at a later date. After being invited, we have a 30 day trial period for a new recruit. This allows both the recruit and the guild to part ways on good terms if the need arises.<br>
<br>
THE PROCESS OF JOINING:<br>
Get to know our members, invite us to join you on raids, sign up for our raids. Join us on exp camps and try to get to know as many of the members as possible. Once you’ve met some of our membership, post on this board your intention to join. We will make an effort to include you in guild groups, and to make sure that all our members get the chance to meet you. We’re still in the process of deciding exactly how new members will be welcomed, currently when we feel that a recruit is ready to join, it’s discussed in guildchat. And the current membership has the right to speak up in favor or against new members. This will probably be formalized into a voting procedure at some point, and this document updated to reflect that.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask any of the officers. Currently they are Bryndar, Zinin, Linluilya and Tallador. If you have trouble contacting people in game, feel free to use the contact(s) below.<br>
