            happened to Gad......... You saw all the rocks at Allen's Falls, right. Well Gadzilla
            slipped while trying to climb up the rocks and fell to the bottom. The fall removed a few
            pieces of meat from his elbow, scraped up his knee, and required a little sight seeing
            trip to&nbsp; the local hospital........&quot;<br>

            NOT write travel brochures for a living. In fact, I didn't even know he knew how to write.
            This was goddamn poetic. I read this and, I laughed, I cried, I had all of the emotions.
            Just kidding. But it's a whole lot like what he said up here, honest.&quot;<br>

            the throne/thong discussions going on, I just got to thinking....Why is it no one ever
            wants to see Ugglie in a thong? I mean, he is sooooo...what's the word....DREAMY....yeah,
            that's it. He is as hunky as hunky can be! He is the Ricky Martin (the straight, non make
            up wearing version) of the EQ world. He's cuter than all of the Back Street Boys put
            together!&nbsp; Maybe if the women of the guild got together, and gave me a little present
            or something, I'd do a little fashion show, private dancing, etc etc etc...for them.
            Woooooooot! What woman could resist?&quot;<br>
