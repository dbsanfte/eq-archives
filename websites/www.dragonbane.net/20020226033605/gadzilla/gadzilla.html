            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is a small story
            from my life that was affected by another Dragon's Bane member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A member, that went above and beyond the call of
            friendship and our code of conduct. A person, that to them the kindness that they showed
            me was part of a normal friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
            member is Tumult, aka Jason Petruno.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the past month we have
            become friends and have learnt a lot about each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
            &nbsp; </span>He also has a girlfriend who is equally kind and generous named Shelby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These two people took me into their home for a
            long weekend, without even meeting me first. Where I come from, this isn&#146;t something
            that is done normally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone where I live
            is normally extremely reserved and would never allow a stranger into their house without
            knowing them first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only did Jason take
            me in for the weekend but, he proceeded to help me get a job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The job market as well all know isn&#146;t the
            greatest, so in order for me to shine above the rest, he allowed me to see some of the
            stuff he does before I applied for the job.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He
            introduced me to his boss and helped me rewrite my resume to reflect more of my better
            qualities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His girlfriend was willing to help
            as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She is a good listener and made me
            feel comfortable while I was at their house. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In our clan code of
            conduct, we don&#146;t have a specific section about face-to-face meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we did, Jason, aka Tumult has surpassed
            anything that we could have thought of to write as a guideline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This little story is to honor him and his actions.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> I have found that our
            clan has been attracting some extremely nice people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
            &nbsp; </span>I hope this trend continues and that when we all find that special
            friendship and that we won&#146;t squander it or allow it to dissipate with age.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Special note:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank you Jason and Shelby for your kindness and
            hospitality. You have given me hope and courage that I didn&#146;t have before I visited
            you. The kindness from your hearts is infectious and will be remembered for a very long
            time.</font></p>
