    For those interested in joining Dragon's Bane, <br>
    below are our recruitment guidelines every recruit <u>must meet</u>:</strong></font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Before submitting your
    application</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You need a sponsor. A
        sponsor is a <u>member</u> of Dragon's Bane that will agree to be your sponsor, who will
        vouch for you personally.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You must have read the
        &quot;About Us&quot; section of our website and our Charter. It also helps to have read as
        much of the website as possible.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You need to group with more
        Dragon's Bane members then just your sponsor. Meet as many members as possible.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Filling in your
    application</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You must complete the
        application form in its <u>entirety</u>. The form will be sent back to you for completion
        if you leave it incomplete.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Note that any false or
        misleading information on this application form can lead to termination of membership at
        the discretion of Dragon's Bane.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>After submitting your
    application</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You will be notifed by email
        that your application has been received and is &quot;in process.&quot;</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Your application must
        receive unanimous &quot;yes&quot; votes from the team membership and final approval is by
        the Guild Leader and/or Team Leader.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You need to demonstrate
        &quot;effort&quot; on your part that you are trying to fit in and be a part of things. If
        you offer to help Dragon's Bane members you don't know, that goes a long way in member's
        minds.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You need to show up. Period.
        DB needs to see your face around. If you can only be online whenthe majority won't see
        you, and that you will rarely if ever have the chance to group with other Dragon's Bane
        members, there is not much point in&nbsp; joining since you don't meet the above
        recruitment criteria.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Cmitchel</strong>,
        as Guild and Group Leader has got to know who you are, and better, if you have talked to
        him, sent him a /tell and been at an event. He's the Guild Leader. The Guild Leader has
        final approval on all applications. Approval won't be there if the guild leader has never
        met you or talked to you. In cases of teams where the Guild Leader is represented by a
        Team Leader, the same goes with the Team Leader.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We're not asking recruits to
        turn their lives upside down for Dragon's Bane. If a recruit has a busy real life schedule
        and can't juggle the demands of our guild at the present time, then they should not be
        recruited because there are <u>some</u> time demands for recruits.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Casual gamers are fine but
        even casual gamers must meet our recruitment demands of being online at least three
        days/nights per week, grouped with DB members for the first few months.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is up to recruits and new
        members (in probationary status), that if they can't be online for a few days to let the
        Guild Leader or Team Leader know they won't be online and why. Otherwise they are MIA.
        It's just common courtesy.</font></p>
