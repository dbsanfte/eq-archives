            Should a player wish to join Dragon's Bane Guild, they must be &quot;sponsored&quot; by a
            present Dragon's Bane guild member. That is, the member will recommend the applicant to
            the guild, and is responsible for the applicant during a one month probationary period.
            All new members are on probation for a period of one month, during which time all members
            will be evaluating the new member. During this time the new member will also be evaluating
            Dragon's Bane to ensure they want to commit to the Guild. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Note we do not accept membership
            applications from players under level 10.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Dragon's Bane applicant must provide
            the following information to the Dragon's Bane sponsor (incomplete applications will
            automatically be returned):</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Dragon's Bane sponsor will forward the
            information to the Guild Leader who, in turn, will forward to all Dragon's Bane members
            for their opinions and a vote. There must be at minimum received 10 positive votes and no
            negative votes within a one week time period. Should there not be enough votes received,
            the applicant will be advised to get to know more members of Dragon's Bane and to resubmit
            their application at a later date.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As well, an applicant must attend at least

            applicant will receive their guild tags, a Welcome to Dragon's Bane email and the start of
            their probationary period with the guild. New members on their one month probationary
            status cannot sponsor members until their probationary period is over.</font></p>

            by at least one member of Dragon's Bane.</font></p>
