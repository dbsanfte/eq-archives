                Robert Duffy's latest plan update... <br>
                <br>
                &quot;We will be releasing a point release beta early next week. This one has taken some
                time but it addresses quite a few things. Graeme has been very busy with the network stuff
                and net traffic is now being compressed at about 4:1, this should make a huge difference
                for modem players. There should be a substantial FPS boost for most people and there are a
                bunch of fixes/tweaks in place. This release will also contain an auto update system so
                you can check for new updates at any time. If you get the beta, the final will be offered
                via the auto update. This addresses all of the cheats and hacks we know about as well.
                That is an ongoing battle. This point release will utilize a different protocol as a
                result of the new network compression. <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, I will finally get the UI stuff release for mod teams. This will allow
                mod teams to distribute Team Arena style menus/scripts for Quake 3 only mods without
                violating the EULA. <br>
                <br>
                There are some really nice looking mods going on right now, Urban Terror, Q3F, WFA,
                Annihilation, Navy Seals are all looking really good. Quake The Movie is also looking
                really really good, the guys at Tritin were kind enough to send us the first 13 or so
                minutes and it is amazing stuff. Overall the source changes mod teams will need to
                integrate are quite small. <br>
                <br>
                Work progresses well on Q3A/TA, Wolf and DOOM.&quot; </font></td>

                of products ranging from 99 USD to 399 USD. nVidia&#146;s new lineup starts in the value

                the 64MB GeForce2 Pro at 199 USD are geared toward the mainstream and performance
                segments. The lineup is completed with the 64MB DDR GeForce3 for as little as 399 USD, 20

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">TA Team Members;<br>
                <br>
                I have been working with Apathy (TA Ladder Admin on the OGL), to work out a rule set for
                the TA-CTF ladder. Generally, the TA Ladder will adhere to the same rules as the regular
                CTF ladder, with a few new exceptions:<br>
                <br>
                - The pre-map warmup time default is being increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds. So the
                map won't start without the players who take longer to enter the server. The TA server
                already has this setting.<br>
                <br>
                - Although not finalized, because of the size of the TA maps, the minimum number of
                players on a team for a match is to be increased from 4 players to 6 players. This means
                that if the opposing team comes to the match with less than 6 players, then we still have
                the right to play with all 6 of our players. If this rule is finalized, then we will only
                agree to play matches with 6 players. If we were to agree to an 8 player match, and only 6
                of their players were to show up, then we would have to downsize to 6 players (not fair to
                clans that have practiced for an 8 player team, and then find themselves not prepared for
                a 6 player match; and not fair to the extra two players that altered personal plans<br>
                to attend the match, just to find out that they are not playing). This is also simpler for
                strategy coordination. When finalized, our strategy will be altered accordingly and
                disseminated throughout the team.<br>
                <br>
                - The map list for matches is not yet decided, however, it is expected that all the
                standard TA maps, plus the four TA_mappack maps will be included in this list.<br>
                <br>
                - Last, and definitely not least, Apathy as agreed to map the persistent runes droppable,
                as a default setting for matches. This means that you can drop a rune that you did not
                want, or should have not picked up. This is similar to LMCTF rune characteristcs, except,
                when you drop the rune, then it will go back to it's own respwn spot. The TA server<br>
                config has just been updated to allowing dropping. Players should put the following
                command in either their q3config.cfg file, or their autoexec.cfg file: bind KEY &quot;drop
                persistent&quot;<br>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is official.....as of tonight, the
                CTF Team will be transcending to Team Arena CTF. The vote was unanamous of all members in
                attendence. It is expected the the OGL will create ladders for TA shortly. TA has been
                ordered for the server. When the university where the server sits, is back in session in
                two weeks, TA/CTF will be installed, along with<br>
                the 1.27 upgrade, and Q3Comp v. 2.02 (which supports 1.27). At that time, the CTF Team
                will be removed from the OGL's Open CTF Ladder. All CTF Team members should prepare
                themselves for the transition by obtaining TA if you wish to continue to play on the team.
                The CTF Team meetings and practices will continue at the same time and place until the
                server is switched over.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>More
                News</strong>| by Sandman<br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Good News! The transition date from CTF
                to TA/CTF is being moved up. I just found out that I will have access to the server
                sometime late next week, and the software is expected to arrive early in the same week.
                Therefore, next Monday's CTF meeting will likely be the last regular CTF frag session.
                TA/CTF is expected to be running on the server for the following practice, with v.1.27.<br>
                <br>
                In other server news......I have scrapped attempting to use BC on the server. It seems
                that the port that BC uses is not open, and since I will not be able to get university to
                open the port, and the port cannot be changed in BC, it simply will not run. Team Sound
                has been installed on the server instead, and will be the communication program in use by<br>
                the TA/CTF Team. The IP address for Team Sound is the same as for the CTF Server....
                128.153.23.177 password is &quot;tsenter&quot;. Anyone that does not have Team Sound yet
                can dl it from www.teamsound.com.</font></p>
