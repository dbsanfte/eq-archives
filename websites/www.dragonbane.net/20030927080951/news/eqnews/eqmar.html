                  (Story) </strong></u><br>
                  <em>Sunday, March 26 7:26:32 PST -- epic</em><br>
                  <br>
                  Last night I attended the greatest EQ event I had ever seen in my life! <br>
                  <br>
                  The Quellious (server) Springtide Festival was the most organized, most fun, most
                  rewarding event I have ever been to. <br>
                  <br>
                  I decided to attend this event after posting a bit of news about it on Notcrazy so I
                  created a new monk (Ashrum) Just for the event. I traveled to the East Commons tunnel at
                  around 3:00 EST. Members of the Legendary Heros, Dragons's Bane, Peace Conclave, and the
                  Bootleggers were all handing out free drinks and other great items such as oracle robes,
                  fine steel weapons (I received 2), and black iron crowns (I got one!). The tall high elf
                  man that handed me my crown was none other than the leader of Dragon's Bane Cmitchel. He
                  introduced me to Oriz, the leader of Legendary Heros who I found out later was going to
                  renew his vows that night. The guild leaders proceeded to show me around and I was amazed.
                  There was corpse hunting (which I took part in but couldn't win because of my human eyes),
                  trivia in which a lot of people won great hard to get items, a lottery, a slave auction,
                  give-aways, a bazaar, and free binds, sows, buffs, and especially drinks (my alcohol
                  tolerance went up 25 points =) <br>
                  <br>
                  Oh and of course the beauty contest! As soon as I heard about this I promptly entered
                  hoping that all the females would be swoon my my great bare-chested monk physique. Boy was
                  I right! I came in second behind a gnome named Lorazon. <br>
                  <br>
                  Oriz offered to give me a ride to the Karanas which was where he would exchange his vows.
                  We teleported there and I met a great ranger by the name of Tamas. Tamas guided my frail
                  level 4 body through all the wolves, lions, and aviaks to reach our destination: the aviak
                  village in South Karana. <br>
                  <br>
                  Ah the wedding! Great time had by all. As many as 40+ high level characters came from all
                  across Norrath to see this great ceremony. Oriz and Kirastar exchanged vows and everyone
                  cheered. I wished Oriz good luck and said goodbye to all my new friends. This was truly my
                  finest day playing everquest! <br>
                  <br>
                  I would like to thanks Tamas, Oriz, and Cmitchel for guiding me around the event and
                  showing me a great time. Hopefully I will get some pictures up of the event but if I don't
                  you can always go to the Quellious Quarters for a different write-up at: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://www.davalkyries.com/quellious/" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(255,255,255)">http://www.davalkyries.com/quellious/

                  <br>
                  I hope this was worth the lack of news yesterday and I hope Quellious has many more events
                  like this! <br>

                <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">&quot;Well, we did it. We killed Cazic Thule.
                To the best of my knowledge, we were the first to even attempt him since the patch where
                he got beefed up. <br>
                <br>
                With 41 people, including members of DB, LH, PC, SoS, Vis Maior, and Emerald Templars we
                took CT down easily. There were perhaps a few other guilds represented that have slipped
                my mind. <br>
                <br>
                Anyhow, Cazic cried out for his little minions to help him, but none were to be found, for
                we cleared the entire zone. Cleared it with just minutes to go before the zone started
                respawning, as a matter of fact.<br>
                <br>
                During the course of our raid DB won most of the loots (for once). Karre has a list of
                what all dropped, and I'd assume a list of who got what, also, if you're interested.<br>
                <br>
                It's our intent to (ahem) farm the zone for a few days, without the interference of CT and
                his death touches, nor that pesky Dracoliche.So our guild's rangers and paladins will soon
                be seen sporting more of their spiffy plane armor! We felled Dracoliche yesterday in Day
                2.<br>
                <br>
                So at last in EQ, our guildname has been lived up to. We not only led an expedition that
                slew a dragon, we also slew a god.<br>
                <br>
                I would say this is a major milestone on the road of acceptance as a powerhouse in the
                world. :)&quot; - <strong><em>Tamas<br>

                &quot;A definite thanks go out to Kilrtom and Karre for their hard work last night in
                organizing the Plane of Fear Raid which is continuing Friday and Saturday.<br>
                <br>
                With so many of us being &quot;new&quot; to planes raids/and or fear plane, it was great
                that they knew the locs, obstacles, &quot;ins and outs&quot; that we had to overcome.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">There were members from our friends present also,
                Peace Conclave and Legendary Heroes as well as members from other guilds that came to lend
                their support.<br>
                <br>
                For those of you that weren't there, what happened yesterday was we logged on as soon as
                the server came up and a few of us (about 7 or 8) decided to go through the portal
                (located in the back of the Spec cave) so we could camp in the plane and start from there
                with everyone else. We thought that the plane would be clear, but it wasn't lol! We got
                swarmed as soon as we zoned in, and several died :( We didn't do any body recovery at this
                point because it was too hard with our few numbers. <br>
                <br>
                At 6:00 we met on chat, so we could be told what to do, what groups we were in, etc. <br>
                <br>
                Then we went in en masse on the server and into the plane. At this time, due to the server
                being down again, there were no mobs and we could make it to the &quot;safe spot&quot;
                before being attacked. <br>
                <br>
                We had approximately 30 people at the height of the raid all organized into groups, pull
                group, 1st group, second group, etc. We killed a lot of &quot;weird&quot; looking things
                and during the night a lot of shaman, monk and rogue armour was dropped (a lot of it no
                drop), a druid belt, cleric belt, valorium breasplate, TV legs and a ranger axe. (I know
                more was dropped I just forget what it was.) Fatalities were at a minimum until one point
                when we downsized in numbers and got several mobs at once. At that point, most died and we
                did that a few times in a row. After that though, again it went pretty smoothly. <br>
                <br>
                The looting rules were decided in advance of the raid, so there were no arguments about
                loot, etc. <br>
                <br>
                All it all, it was very well organized and went extremely well. The raid ended at 6:30 am
                est.<br>
                <br>
                The raid is continuing tonight again at 6pm est. So any of you that couldn't make it last
                night, I hope you can tonight or later in the weekend. Even if you can't make it at the
                specified time, give a tell to Kilrtom or Karre when you do log on and I'm sure they'll
                work out how to add you to the groups.&quot; - Pantera</font></p>

                &quot;Well, the EQ Gathering II which was held in St. Louis on Sat. March 4, in now over.
                It was a complete success and was thoroughly enjoyed by all attending.<br>
                <br>
                I arrived, registered and went to find a seat to watch the other EQ addicts arrive. Three
                people arrived in the full costume of their chars, including one fellow in an FBR. The
                four people showed up with sticks to which they had attached clear plastic sheets and
                painted their names in either blue or red. These sticks were then stuck in the back of
                their shirts giving the appearance of our chars names on the screen. <br>
                <br>
                Kevin Scott opened the Gathering at 9:30 AM and told us to mingle and get to know one
                another. After looking around at name tags and feeling that I was the only representative
                of Quellious, I headed up to check out the artwork of the designer of the EQ Gathering
                t-shirts, posters, and mousepads. A few minutes later I was hailed by Kumaddara with
                &quot;Quellious!&quot; We stood and talked for a few minutes and then along came, Fenick,
                Sanguril, Swifter, Darion, Gudor, Woneid, Altrax, and Feadorn from Quell. We found a
                table, camped it and began talking about everything EQ and Quell related. <br>
                <br>
                During this time, the famous Brad McQuaid arrived along with Bill Trost (Lead Game
                Designer), Mike Hutchins (Asst. Producer), Jeff Butler (Customer Service Mgr.), Geoff
                Zatkin (Game Designer) and Matt Yaney (Game Designer). Needless to say they were swamped
                as soon as they walked in and were introduced. Everlore was also there with their
                computers and broadcasting live on their site pictures of the EQ Gathering attendees.
                There were also a number of GM's attending (and no, Ozzmar, Mandybeth, and Cosil were not
                there).<br>
                <br>
                After lunch was served, a Real Life Quest was started in which we grouped by server. At
                this point I had the chance to meet Ariann. We had 2 Quellious groups since we were
                limited to 8 people in a group and there were 14 of us from Quell. We were handed bags and
                a list of about 90 items from EQ (Soil of Underfoot, Fairie Princess Dust, etc.) to find
                in about an hour and a half. We set off on our scavenger hunt. The imagination of some of
                the groups was unbelievable. One group actually went down to the Mississippi River and
                brought back a real fish tail for the quest! Yuck! <br>
                <br>
                During the time our bags were being checked, Brad and the gang were demonstrating the
                expansion, Ruins of Karnac. We did find out the following on the expansion:<br>
                <br>
                1. The levels max out at 60.<br>
                2. The new continent will apparently be huge with 25 zones, the smallest of which is the
                size of WK. There are 4 city/newbie zones for levels 1-25 and the other 21 zones are
                designed for levels 25+. One of these areas is guarded by 3 wyverns that are level 53.<br>
                3. There will be one teleport pad each for wizs and druids and they will be located in the
                same zone.<br>
                <br>
                After the the bags were checked and graded we again assembled but by class this time for a
                Trivia Contest. We were given 15 minutes to answer 3 pages of simple questions such as
                &quot;Name all the zones on Norrath&quot;, &quot;List all the <br>
                Level 1 spells for all casting classes&quot;, and &quot;Name all the Gods of
                Norrath&quot;. Doh! Needless to say, no one completed them all.<br>
                <br>
                While these were checked, dinner was served and the Quell group spent more time talking
                and getting to know one another. After dinner, the prizes were awarded to the Real Life
                Quest team winners and the Trivia Contest winners. <br>
                The prizes were, of course, a copy of the expansion for each group member! Before you
                drive all of us from Quell crazy, NO none of us won a copy and the copies are being mailed
                to the winners! Copies were also awarded to the 3 players who attended in full costume and
                those imaginative people with the names above their heads. Verant then handed out posters
                and pics of the RofK to all of the attendees to finish off the evening.<br>
                <br>
                The Quell group said farewell to each other and promised to stay in touch on game (which
                some of us already have done) and we headed off all fired up and ready to get back on EQ. <br>
                <br>
                EQ Gathering III is being planned now and if you have an interest in attending check
                www.everlore.com. They are supposed to setting up an area for your vote on the next site
                for the convention.&quot;<br>

                What a blast this was to have Dragon's Bane members and Legendary Heroes members running
                across 2 zones trying to capture the flag. A few casualties were had (of course), but also
                many memorable one on one combats! Our downfall was we didn't have a ranger or druid for
                SOW! Legendary Heroes capped most, but we did get one cap in (thanks Amun!). Vorpax and
                cmitchel will be working on refining the rules a bit, and we will definitely be having
                another EQ&nbsp; Capture the Flag event soon.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">Click </font><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/flegendaryheroestavernsgeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=130.topic" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">here</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"> to see

                Well we did it! We cleared out Kedge Keep entirely today including the feared Phinigel
                Autropos. Unfortunately he dropped enchanter specific items that were no drop (and we had
                no enchanters with us!). But great team work by Legendary Heroes, Bootleggers, Peace
                Conclave and Dragon's Bane. We ruled Kedge Keep today!</font></p>

                Last night's Fire Giant raid proved a lot easier then anticipated! Again, a great turn out
                of members from Dragon's Bane, Legendary Heroes, Peace Conclave and Bootleggers. A few
                deaths, but nothing like we thought it would be. After clearing out all the Fire Giants we
                were left feeling satisfied and victorious. A couple of really nice items were obtained
                and randomed, but the best part of all was the camaraderie between the guilds! Screenshots
