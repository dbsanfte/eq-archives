                <br>
                This message is a reminder about our Fear raid in February. I am leading the raid and will
                be laying down the ground rules within the next week or so. There is a sign-up sheet
                posted on our message boards. <br>

                If you intend to go, then you MUST sign up for the raid on the message board. I need to do
                a lot of work to organize the raid, so please do your part and let me know if you intend
                to go.<br>
                <br>
                Remember:<br>
                46+ for the raid<br>
                Everyone who is 46+ is WELCOME (Please come!)<br>
                Although we want the nice loot, friendship comes first<br>
                Raid is from February 22-24<br>

                and I are glad to introduce to you all ( as my 2nd family) our new addition to my family.
                Connor James, my son was born! Those of you that where on that early morning ( bout 2:30
                am hehe) when I got home to shout to the EQ world of our proud moment, know all went very
                well and both are fine. I just brought my wife and new baby home and will probably have a
                lil less time to play for a while ( unless I get up late at night to feed him and can play
                1 handed) 1handed feading skill goes up to 102 hehe. My wife will be sending all a web
                page to see some pictures soon. Well my turn to feed :) be well all and thank you all for
                the kind words. </font></p>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">Hi All, the CoM raid was a lot of fun
                and a general success. Thanks to all of those who could make it and we missed those of you
                who couldn't. Special thanks went to Hits and Alancia, rogue/ench, without them it
                would've been tough to<br>
                get the show on the road.<br>
                <br>
                Phat lewt discovered: Ornate Rune Shield, went to Evoc, gratz Evoc! (he happened to be the
                only death on the raid so its good he got the shield :) Throneblade of Yakesha and some
                other warrior wep I can't remember went to<br>
                Brut and Gurunt, nice going guys. Sil was able to get a majority of her Shaman epic drops,
                particular three<br>
                books of one of the tougher mobs. Now you've opened a can of worms Sil, good luck with the
                rest of your quest :)<br>
                <br>
                However, we didn't recover any Jade Reavers for the rng/drd epic, so I will be putting
                together another go at it this coming Sunday, 4pm PST. (Making it a bit earlier for you
                east-coasters). We will need 3 full groups, 4 preferably if we want to go all the way to
                the top Black Reaver room. Bring your batwings as its a long fall down.<br>
                <br>
                Hits was able to take care of locked doors for us, and turned out to be a primo scout.
                I'll see if he can do it again Sunday. We do need a Feign Death Puller though, I'm not
                sure which is better, monk or SK. Preferably<br>
                higher level than not (54+). Can you get 15 or so levels in the next 6 days Shenzi? :p<br>
                <br>
                I don't know of any SK/monks in DB who fit the bill atm, so if someone has a friend who
                might be interested, please send them an invite.<br>
                <br>
                We will be meeting at same spot in EJ, 300, neg2000, right at the zone line to CoM. I'll
                be on at 3pm to supply tports as needed.<br>
                <br>
                Send me a holler via email or game chat if you know you can make, the earlier I can
                solidify who's going, the smoother it will run.<br>
                <br>
                Also, in a few weeks time I will be organizing a raid on Kedge, the opportunity you all
                have been waiting for to max your swimming skill :) I will supply anyone who goes with a
                free fishbone earring. Er, scratch that, I'll pack a lot of scales, hehe. Raid will be
                multi-purpose, send me an email if you have a distinct goal in Kedge.<br>

                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">I've had to change the raid day and time to
                next Monday, 15th, 5pm PST due to when Hits could make it.<br>
                <br>
                We need a lockpicker, and Hits was a great scout yesterday, so it really hinges around him
                for now. I hope that day works out for everyone.<br>
                <br>
                And I chose 5pm as a middle ground for west/east coast, late enough for those working on
                the west coast to do it hopefully, early enough for those on the east.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for the many responses to coming Sunday, sorry bout the change, hope you can be
                there :)<br>
