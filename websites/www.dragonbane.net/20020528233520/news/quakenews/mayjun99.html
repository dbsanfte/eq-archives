              the flag and was waiting for ours to be returned.&nbsp; I was having some bad ping

              DB/WODB LAN PARTY</strong></font></font><br>
              </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">Hey all, about a couple weeks ago, a
              couple members started talking about having a LAN party. Well I want to know, how many
              people would be serious about going to one, for DB/WODB and anyone they wanted to invite.
              I think we should make a list of everyone who's interested, and see what develops from
              there.<br>
              <br>
              From what I remember, I think it would be more likely to happen in the Toronto area, as
              there are quite a few members from Ontario. Also a time period of August was given. I
              think likely to happen close to the weekend.<br>
              <br>
              Personally, I'm really interested and would like to see this happen, I just need to know
              what date exactly and where, so i can book a couple days off work.<br>
              <br>
              I hope to here a lot of responses, and would like to remind everyone, &quot;SERIOUS&quot;
              responses only. It's all nice and everything to say that you would like to go, but after
              everything is planned out, 3/4 of the people can't go.<br>
              <br>
              Anyway, let's see what happens. If interested, please <a href="mailto:jkolly@ilos.net">email
              me</a>. - <strong>[DB]Omenborn</strong></font></p>
