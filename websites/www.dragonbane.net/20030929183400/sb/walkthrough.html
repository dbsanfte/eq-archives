            </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            This walkthrough is based on the En-Tranz beta world, and is by that right subject to
            drastic change. However, some advice contained herein may still be of use.<br>
            <br>
            Basic Tips:<br>
            <br>
            NOTE ON TRAINING: BEWARE! When training, there is a limit on how far you can raise a skill
            before its price grows insanely large. For example, you train one point in Blah which cost
            600, again for 650, again for 700, and if your not paying attention, again for 13,550. So
            do not just &#147;click click click&#148; when training, click, watch the price, click
            again, watch, etc.<br>
            <br>
            Using the map:<br>
            Latitude (LT) East to West<br>
            Longitude (LG) North to South<br>
            <br>
            LG Grows<br>
            ^<br>
            |<br>
            |<br>
            |<br>
            |<br>
            |--------------&gt; LT grows<br>
            <br>
            Death Shroud (DS): When you die, you re-spawn with the death shroud that does not allow
            you to cast or be cast upon. (Only after a certain level)<br>
            <br>
            R1,R2,R3, etc are a way of telling a player/creatures rank. 1-9, Rank 0 (R0) 10-20, Rank 1
            (R2), etc, etc. Some also refer to this as the &#147;tier&#148;.<br>
            <br>
            For the purpose of this essay, L2, L3, etc. will represent Low Rank 2, 3, etc. H3, H4, H5,
            etc. will represent High 3, 4, 5. The ranks cover a wide range of levels, at L1 a, a H1
            mob will more often than not kill you.<br>
            <br>
            Creature Con: By Selecting a creature (mob) you will see it named, the color of the text
            will give you an idea of how challenging it is.<br>
            </font><strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000">Red</font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">: Much higher, very difficult-impossible.<br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00"><strong>Yellow:</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Same level-slightly higher level<br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF"><strong>Blue:</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Somewhat lower than you.<br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Light blue:</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Very easy and a quite a bit lower in level<br>
            <strong>White</strong>: Very easy, worth just 1 experience<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><u>Walkthrough<br>
            </u></strong>Now, I remind you this is based on the En-Tranz Beta, and all information
            could be drastically changed.<br>
            <br>
            When entering the world, I recommend starting in the Hamlet of Wainthorpe.<br>
            <br>
            When you spawn in the hamlet, you will immediately want to head Northeast and kill, kill,
            kill.<br>
            At level 1: Field Spiders, Night Spiders, Dire Ant Drones, Grass Serpents (anything around
            15 exp).<br>
            <br>
            When you hit level two, you can go back to Wainthorpe and train, or head further Northeast
            atop a hill where a small pack of Lizard men are waiting to be KILLED.<br>
            Lvl 2: Lizardmen Hunters, Small Tiger serpent (Anything around 60exp)<br>
            <br>
            At level 3, train again or head Northeast once more and KILL!<br>
            Level 3: Lizardman Trackers, Rotting Skeleton, Black/blood spiderling, Rat (Anything
            around 130 exp)<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, around the City of Silverlance Keep which is due directly East of
            Wainthorpe, are large packs or &#147;herds&#148; of mobs conveniently grouped by their
            level. Walk around the castle, find a mob your level, and kill all the mobs in that
            vicinity. Make a level, and then move on to the next pack. You can make level 4 this way
            with ease.<br>
            <br>
            At level 4, you will want to train for certain.<br>
            <br>
            From Wainthorpe, head directly east. Atop a large plateau, you will find a large Grobold
            Camp. At the level of 4, move with caution. Ideally, you will want to find or create a
            group immediately. Where one is not available, head to surrounding, smaller camps or
            return to Silverlance and level more on smaller mobs.<br>
            <br>
            The Grobold camp can be located at:<br>
            LT: 34419 LG: 18519 ALT: 79<br>
            <br>
            From this Grobold camp, and with the right group, levels will come extremely fast. In the
            lower levels, stick to the outlining Grobolds, the Warriors and Axe fighters.<br>
            <br>
            You shouldn&#146;t worry about training if you&#146;re in a good group, or at least until
            level 10.<br>
            <br>
            At level 10, you will want to select your profession. To do this, you will need to find
            your Professions Training structure.<br>
            <br>
            -Forest Sanctuary-<br>
            Druid &#150; Scout &#150; Ranger<br>
            LT: 36190 LG: 17528 ALT: 91<br>
            <br>
            -Amazon Temple-<br>
            Fury &#150; Huntress &#150;<br>
            LT: 36962 LG: 16795 ALT: 96<br>
            <br>
            -Cathedral of the All-Father-<br>
            Priest &#150; Prelate &#150; (Crusader?)<br>
            LT: 36230 LG: 19291 ALT: 95<br>
            <br>
            Once trained, you will want to return to the Grobold camp. From here, you can still rise
            to 13-15, depending on how much time you&#146;re willing to invest here. In a full group,
            the money is pretty decent as the mobs die as fast as they spawn, creating a swift income.<br>
            <br>
            At level 13-15, you will want to head to the Bandit Camps.<br>
            <br>
            Bandit Camps:<br>
            LT: 37979 LG: 15720 ALT: 44<br>
            <br>
            The camps are designed with several &#147;islands&#148; in a series of river ways. Most of
            them are connected by bridges, although they awkwardly placed and in lag, can take longer
            than just swimming.<br>
            <br>
            From here, there is a wide variety of Bandit spawn that will take you as high as 18 or 20.
            Beware, as there are special named Bandit Knights that have an incredible amount of
            HP&#146;s.<br>
            <br>
            In some cases, Mage/archer classes may even be able to kill bandits that stray to close to
            the edge of the Islands from across the river. When a bandit has to cross under the river,
            he is slowed, allowing for several spells/arrows to be shot. Lucky for you Arrows and
            fireballs are not slowed down by several meters of water. =]<br>
            <br>
            When you have reached the desired level from the Bandit Camps, between 18-20, you will
            want to head to the nearest Teleporter or Rune Gate. There are 6 located around Noob Isle,
            and they are marked by a triangle with a circle at each corner. From these Portals, you
            will want to transport to the island to the Southwest of the &#147;main&#148; Noobland.<br>
            <br>
            On a side note: There is a hunting ground, a swamp, in the middle of Noob Isle. Howver, I
            HIGHLY recommend avoiding this swamp. The ratmen within are mostly archers, and extremely
            deadly. Combined with the difficult swamp terrain, this area simply isn&#146;t worth the
            risk.<br>
            <br>
            Back to the Island to the SouthWest. On this Isle, there are several cool mobs. From the
            Deathless Sentinel&#146;s to the Bear King, you can rise as high as 25-30 here, depending
            on how much time your willing to invest. At level 18-20, this isle can be a challenge,
            however with a group you will find ideal spawns.<br>
            <br>
            Southwest Isle of Noobland<br>
            Deathless Sentinel Camp<br>
            LT: 14437 LG: 13632<br>
            <br>
            The last option for levels 18+ is making the trip to the mainland. To do this, go to any
            of the 3 castles on Noob Isle. Near the Tree of Life (ToL) there will be a Runemaster,
            speak to them and ask to change alligence to antoher guild. You can Swear to any of the 3
            Safeholds off Noob Isle, which are Khar Th&#146;Sekt, King&#146;s Cross, and Vorringuard.
            While the creatures in the vicinity are mostly much higher than 20, you may be able to
            find groups that will offset your level. However, I recommend staying on noob isle until
            20, at least. After level 35, however, you are forced to leave.</font></td>
