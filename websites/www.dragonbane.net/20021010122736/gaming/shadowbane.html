            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Although the genre is
            relatively new, it's arguable that massively multiplayer<br>
            RPGs are already getting a little stale. After all, how many more times can you go to some
            dungeon and look for orcs before it gets boring, or search for the rare &quot;Get-A-Life
            Sword&quot; that only certain warriors can wield? <br>
            <br>
            On a recent trip to Ubi Soft in Montreal, Canada, I got to check out what could be one of
            the most innovative MMORPGs to date, one that takes all the cool stuff you liked about
            EverQuest and Asheron's Call and combines them into a slick package that adds real-time
            strategy into the mix. Developed by Wolfpack Studios and published by Ubi Soft, the game
            in question is<br>
            Shadowbane. <br>
            <br>
            <u>A New Mix </u><br>
            What looks to set Shadowbane apart from the competition is that it combines role-playing
            with strategic elements. Not only are you leveling up your character and learning new
            spells and abilities, every decision you make will affect the history, politics, and
            landscape of the game. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Shadowbane is a little of both types of games,&quot; explains Sean Dahlberg,
            spokesperson for Wolfpack Studios. &quot;We've taken elements from both genres and mixed
            them together to make something a little different. Players have the option to build and
            siege cities, use tactical information and own territory like in any RTS, but players can
            still quest, adventure, collect treasure, and act as a diplomat with any RPG. Basically,
            we've expanded the concept of what a<br>
            MMORPG is. <br>
            <br>
            Rather than focus solely on the story arc of a single character, we've extended the
            experience by creating a backdrop of political intrigue. The best part is that each
            individual player chooses what aspect of the game he or she wants to involve him or
            herself in. If someone doesn't want to help build a city, they don't have to. If they
            don't wish to join in on epic quests, they don't have to. There are many options and roles
            for players to participate in and the choice is up to the player &#133; as it should
            be.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            As one would expect from a game of this scale, the backstory is quite involving. The story
            of Shadowbane covers over five-thousand-years of recorded history, filled with legends,
            epics, and tragedies. &quot;Shadowbane's deep history is one of the things that sets the
            game apart from other MMO games,&quot; continues Dahlberg. &quot;The depth and sheer
            amount of backstory serves as the backbone for Shadowbane's strong role-playing elements.
            Wolfpack's head writer, Sam &quot;Meridian&quot; Johnson, created some 5,000 years of
            recorded history and sculpted an in-depth society for all the different races and factions
            within the game. The Shadowbane story will unravel throughout the next five years, and
            players' actions in the game will directly affect how the story unfolds.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            The Shadowbane world was once whole. During the War of Tears, fought mostly between the
            elves and humans, the High King of the Humans, Cambruin, was betrayed and slain by his own
            weapon, a sword named &quot;Shadowbane.&quot; This event ignited &quot;The Turning,&quot;
            in which the doors of Heaven and Hell closed fast, ended the Age of Kings, and began the
            Age of Strife. Players are brought into this world of strife and chaos, roughly a century
            after &quot;The Turning.&quot; The world is still torn asunder and most fragments are rife
            with chaos.<br>
            <br>
            Players begin their Shadowbane experience in the newbie city, a kill-free zone where they
            are able to build up their character, meet other players, and acclimate themselves. Once
            players leave the newbie city and enter the Shadowbane world, the options are endless.
            Whether the path is to quest alone, build a city, join a guild, rule an empire, or siege
            enemy kingdoms,<br>
            players have the ability to become anyone and do anything they desire.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Shade <br>
            </u>It's also important to mention that Shadowbane is a PvP game, allowing players to kill
            other players, which may be a welcome feature to many gamers (including myself).
            &quot;Shadowbane is like an RTS on hardcore steroids,&quot; explains Michael Steele,
            director of operations. &quot;It's more visceral than games like Age of Empires. This is
            brutal gang warfare. While you're playing<br>
            Shadowbane it feels like rival sports teams rather than friendly, social circles like in
            other games. <br>
            <br>
            Everything you do in the world has a consequence. Players have to work together as a
            cohesive unit in order to dominate in this game. It's really quite interesting to see how
            the players on the beta program have sort of banded together in their separate groups and
            how they work through problems and such. I can't imagine how many different types of
            guilds are going to spring up<br>
            when the game is launched.&quot; </font></p>
