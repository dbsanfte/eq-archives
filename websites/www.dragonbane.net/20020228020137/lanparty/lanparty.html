            <br>
            The kegs are reserved, the food is in the house, the mugs are made, the server is in the
            house, the driving directions have been emailed (if you don't have them....then let me
            know and I will send them again)....... We are ready for a party! <br>
            <br>
            We have had scorching temperatures in the mid 90's for the last three weeks, and no
            rain...... so lawns are turning brown, but it looks like the weather will cool off a
            little for the weekend. There might be some isolated thuderstorms on Friday, while people
            are traveling. On both Saturday and Sunday, the forecast is 75-80 in the day and 55 at
            night..... so bring clothes that will make you comfortable in these temperature. A link to
            weather.com's webpage for this area is below: <br>
            http://weather.com - Local Weather - Potsdam, NY (13676) <br>
            <br>
            Anyone with a digital camera will be asked to upload their pics (or transfer them) to one
            computer at the party. Then we will be burning CD's of all the pics before the end of the
            party, for anyone that wants them. So make sure to bring a CDR or two. <br>
            <br>
            As long as everyone brings the computers that they said that they would bring..... then we
            will have 10 computers on the Lan. The TA server is now in my house and hooked up to an
            8-port, 100mps switch....... and my computer is getting a good stable 15ms ping to it. We
            could still use a couple more switches or hubs (besides the one that I have)...... if
            someone can make sure to bring them. We have some surge protection here...... but a few
            more will be needed......and maybe an extra 25' extension cord, if someone has one. I have
            plenty of margarita mix..... so anyone that loves frozen margaritas and would like me to
            fire up the margarita machine......please bring some Tequilla (it's hard to get here in
            any kind of quantity). <br>
            <br>
            For those attending, please let me know when you think you might be arriving (early
            morning, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, early evening, late<br>
            evening, etc)..... so we know when to expect you. <br>

            I have been working on original Dragon's Bane merchandise, made especially for the Lan
            Party.<br>
            <br>
            XFighter has been kind enough to make Dragon's Bane T-Shirts up and bring them to the Lan
            Party for people that order them with him. They will be a good weight, white T-shirt with
            the original DB dragon on the back, and a Dragon's Bane 2001 Lan Party wording on the
            front pocket area. He has connections and can get them made for a cut rate of $10 each.
            The catch is ....... he needs payment in advance. Apparantly he also accepts Visa and
            Mastercard. Contact X soon about making your order.<br>
            <br>
            Bane and I have been designing a personalized Dragon's Bane Lan party beer mug. They will
            be laser etched with the the DB dragon (that made took from the website and converted to
            b/w), and each persons player name on the mug. The exact wording placement around the
            etched dragon<br>
            is still to be finalized, but they will be very neat. What better way to drink your
            beverages at the Lan Party but from your own personalized Dragon's Bane mug. The cost to
            make these mugs will be about $12 each. I don't need payment in advance, instead you can
            just pay for the mug<br>
            when you arrive. You can order those through me. Let me know.</font></p>

            We have two nearby motels at $45/night (based on two double beds)....... The Chalet Motel
            (315)265-8400, and the Nomad Motel (315)265-6700. Two motels at $55/night (based on two

            (315)265-0709. <br>

            Smallings Motel South is newly renovated, and Smallings Motel has a pool. Both are decent
            places for the money. All motels are within 5 minutes of my place. <br>

            Motel and the Nomad Motel both still have rooms available, but they aren't the nicest
            motels. They would do if you just wanted a cheap room, nearby to crash. Other alternatives
            are two motels that are located in Canton, NY (about 15 minutes from my house): The Best
            Western Inn still has rooms available (315-386-8522) but is nearly filled. The Best
            Western has nice rooms, heated pool, continental breakfast, golf course, etc and prices
            for double occupancy is $80 per night, and $90<br>
            for four people. The Comfort Suites Inn also has rooms available (315-386-1161) and is
            filling fast. It is a new motel with very nice rooms, heated pool, continental breakfast,
            and prices range from $90 for double occupancy, to $105 for five people (two doubble beds
            and a fold out couch). </font></p>

            We have two nearby motels at $45/night (based on two double beds)....... The Chalet Motel
            (315)265-8400, and the Nomad Motel (315)265-6700. Two motels at $55/night (based on two

            I would suggest the Smallings motels. Smallings Motel South is newly renovated, and

            Overnight accommodations will have to be decided soon, if people expect to get motel rooms
            in town. I can provide accommodations for up to 5 people at my house, as long as some
            don't mind sharing a double bed or crashing on a couch. Bane can accommodate one on his
            couch and has floor space for one or two if you have sleeping bags. JanaBear is bringing a
            tent that will accommodate a couple of people besides herself, if they have sleeping bags
            as well. These accommodations will be reserved first to people that could not afford to
            pitch in $45 with others for a motel room for the three-day weekend. So, if forking out
            that money for a room would be impossible for you, and could possibly make you not be able
            to attend the party, then let be know....... and we will try and accommodate you first. If
            you don't respond, then I will assume that you will be pitching in with others for a motel
            room.</font></p>

            The Lan Party is being held in the St.Lawrence River Valley, located in foothills of the
            Adirondack Mountains of NY. Anyone driving up from the NY City way up I-87 will be
            reminded of this has they spend about three hours of their trip driving into the
            Adirondack Mountains on one side, straight through the middle of them, and out the
            opposite side to get to party. At the same time, if we should desire to take an afternoon
            break on one day, from our three-day, all day, all night gaming regimen....... then we
            could take a short road trip to one of two nature splenders of the region. There are two
            fantastic places to see that are each about 1 1/2 hours from where Bane and I live. We can
            surely make it to at least one of them, of your choice, during your stay. <br>
            One is Whiteface Mountain in Lake Placid. Lake Placid was the home of the 1980 Winter
            Olympics, and is a really neat place. Whiteface is just outside of Lake Placid, and is the
            second highest peak in NY, It was the location of all the ski events of the Olympics.
            Whiteface offers gondola rides to one of the lower summits for $10/person. A less
            expensive, and possibly more breathtaking alternative is the toll road which is $4/person
            for access, and you drive part way up the mountain, and then take an elevator up the
            inside of the mountain to the summit of the highest peak. You can check out the website at
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a href="http://www.Whiteface.com" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">Whiteface.com</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> The other trip is to Boldt Castle in the Thousand Islands Region of the
            St. Lawrence River, just off shore from Alexandria Bay. Boldt Castle is an impressive,
            huge, 7 story castle on a small island, and has an impressive history to it. Admission to
            the castle is $3.75. There is a 2hr 15min boat tour around the islands and stops at Boldt
            Castle Island for $12.50. A less expensive alternative is a shuttle boat to the<br>
            castle's island for $6.75. You can check out the website at Alexandria Bay We can do one
            trip...... or attempt both....... or do none. So let me know what you think about these
            short road trips........ and which one you would like to see (if we only do one). Bane and
            I have seen them, so they don't matter to us. Domocracy with rule, and nobody will be left
            behind. It'll be a Dragons Bane group thing, if we decide to take in the sights. So if you
            are attending the party, then cast your votes. </font></p>

              mentioned, 'we have many splendors available to us here in the St. Lawrence Valley located
              in Northern New York' or something like that. :-P One of my favorite things to do up here
              in the summer is a local attraction that is available only to those who know of its
              location - Allens Falls. I don't know who Allen was, so don't ask. Anyway, it's a local
              favorite with college students and some of us &quot;Townies&quot; who like to enjoy it in
              the summer. It's a waterfall on a large granite outcropping with a deep swimming hole at
              the foot of it. It's easily accessible (10 minutes away) and is a nice quiet place to
              relax and cool off after fragging (or before). During the summer I usually have the place
              to myself for the most part and I take advantage of it every chance I get. Just thought
              I'd throw it out there along with the other major attractions Sand has mentioned. I've
              attached some pics for everyone to see - I'm not a photographer, so be kind. :-)&quot;<br>

            go....... don't worry about it. Some will be be staying in motel rooms, and maybe a couple
            at Bane's place. My water heater recovers pretty quick, and I have two bathrooms. If we
            need to take a load off, then we can do a shuttle to Bane's place, less than a mile
            away............. he lives in an apartment building that has a boiler for hot water, which
            may be difficult to drain. We have things figured out. Just get yourself here....... :-) <br>
            <br>
            <u><strong>Equipment update: </strong></u><br>
            I will have an 8-port 10/100 switch for the party now........ just to start things off. We
            will proabably only need a couple more for the rest of the computers, or a second server.
            I also have CAT-5 cable that will be wired up for extra 100mps patch cords. Still bring
            your own....... but I won't need any extras. I will also have extra RJ-45 ends and Bane's
            crimpers here, if we need to convert some 10mps cables to the 100mps configuration. We
            will have enough surge protection/power strips for about 10 computers........... so a few
            more would be nice. I will be running the power strips from a few different circuits in
            the house, to avoid brown-outs and other overload problems. Therefore, a couple of long,
            heavy duty extension cords would be beneficial. My computer will still have a cable
            connection, if someone should need it for driver or email purposes. </font></p>

            Here's the skinny on the Lan Party.......... <br>
            <br>
            - Dates. <br>
            Yes, the dates will be Fri, Sat, Sun......... Aug 10, 11, 12. Anyone is welcome anytime
            after noon on Friday. If the rest aren't here, then you can help me and Bane set up the
            puters and test the beer (tough job right?) Depart on Monday...... unless you want to head
            out Sunday evening. <br>
            <br>
            - Accomodations at our places. <br>
            Bane has room for one on his couch, and more if you don't mind his floor. I have two spare
            double beds and a couch........ so accomodations will depend on if people mind sharing a
            bed (I know there will be some interesting comments coming on this one...... hehe). I have
            a lawn perfect for tents, if you like to camp out and want to be extra close to the keg.
            Sleeping arrangements at our places will be provided first to those who could not afford a
            room, and would not be able to come to the party if you had to pitch in for a room.
            Otherwise, first come first served. <br>
            <br>
            -Hotel Accomodations. <br>
            We have two nearby motels at $45/night (based on two double beds)....... The Chalet Motel
            (315)265-8400, and the Nomad Motel (315)265-6700. Two motels at $55/night (based on two
            double beds)........ Smallings Motel (315)265-4640, and Smallings Motel South
            (315)265-0709. <br>
            And one nice one located near the bars in downtown Potsdam at $90/night (based on two
            double beds), The Clarkson Inn (315)265-3050. <br>
            <br>
            I would suggest the Smallings motels. Smallings Motel South is newly renovated, and
            Smallings Motel has a pool. Both are decent places for the money. <br>
            <br>
            -Air Travel. <br>
            The closest airport to us is at Massena, NY. It's not really an airport...... more like an
            air strip. But US Air has the turbo-prop US Air Express that flies into and out of
            Massena. Massena is aobut 20 minutes from us, and we can arrange pick up and drop off. The
            closest major airport to us at at Ottawa, Ontario. It's about 1.5 hours from us. The next
            closest major airport to us (which is the closest that is in the US) is in Syracuse, NY,
            which is about 2.5 hours from us. Burlington, VT is about 3 hours, and Albany, NY is about
            4 hours......... and they would not provide any service that you can't get into Syracuse
            or Ottawa........ so those areas are not feasible. <br>
            <br>
            -Equipment. <br>
            We will have our computers here, and the server. We have some powerstrips and some CAT-5
            RJ-45 cables, but we will need more. He have no hubs or swtiches....... So the system will
            be down until the first person arrives that has a hub. Bring your systems if you
            can....... with powerstrips, cables, speakers,<br>
            headsets, and whatever else. The more the marrier. <br>
            <br>
            I hope this answers some questions. <br>

            OK..... let me put this out there....... Bane and I are considering having a DB LAN Party,
            if there is enough interest. The party would be in early August, and at my house in
            Potsdam, New York (which is in the extreme northern part of the state, near the Canadian
            border). I would bring the TA server home from the university and set it up for the event.
            It might be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday party. It might be something interesting.......
            like running all of the Id multiplayer games at some point during the party (Quake3,
            Quake2-lmctf, Quake1, and Doom) for all the old-timers. We would need some more computers
            though. A keg of Labatts Blue run through a cold plate would compliment the abundance of
            food. Motel rooms in town run from $45 to $85 per<br>
            night, but I can put some people up at my place, and Bane might be able to as well. Here
            are some driving distances that I got from mapquest.com for people in the clan that live
            in or near some of these places.</font></p>

            RJ-45 cables, (3) surge protector power strips that'll run two computer systems each, and
            enough circuits to plug them all into....... :-)&quot;<br>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We definitely will be
            doing more than just TA. It will be more like an Id party. I will be burning some extra
            installation disks of Quake2 (with lmctf), Quake1, Doom 1 &amp; 2, for those that don't
            still have them. Anything that we want to play...... we will play. (except for Quake
            drinking games with Target and Cyber).&quot;<br>
