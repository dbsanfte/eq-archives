        </em>DALLAS (AP) - The Bouldin family drove 14 hours nonstop from their home in Phoenix to
        see old friends they'd never met before. Cary and Jeremiah Johnson, newlyweds from Austin,
        came to revel in the shared passion that brought them together in the first place.<br>
        <br>
        Thirteen-year-old video game fanatic Andrea Stephens of Tampa, Fla., had a more simple
        reason for attending QuakeCon 2003: &quot;It's pretty exciting.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Since 1996, QuakeCon has been the video game industry's Woodstock, a 21st century blend of
        tough games, fast computers and mostly white, teenage boys in black T-shirts.<br>
        <br>
        But changes are afoot at the event, which grew out of fans' love of the &quot;Quake&quot;
        line of games: visceral, violent titles in which players gather online to blow each other
        up as fast as possible.<br>
        <br>
        Girls, older people - even entire families - are joining in the fun.<br>
        <br>
        Stephens dangled a pink cell phone in her hands as she recalled her first time playing
        Quake. She's now a member of several gaming clans and has even competed in a professional
        game tournament this year.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It's pretty exciting,&quot; she said of winning. &quot;It gets tense. After games,
        I'm all shaky.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Quake's inventors, id Software, Inc., said the conference began as a free thank you for
        the hardcore fans who continually flocked to their headquarters in nearby Mesquite.<br>
        <br>
        This year it was moved from a hotel and convention center in Mesquite to a much larger
        facility in downtown Dallas - it was the only way to accommodate the more than 2,000 fans,
        id game designer Tim Willits said.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It's bigger than Quake. It's bigger than one game, bigger than one company,&quot;
        Willits said. &quot;The core of the event is younger people, college students. But there
        are families, too. This is their yearly vacation.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The event is split into three areas. A conference room houses a dozen or so computer
        hardware and software makers touting their latest wares to throngs of eager gamers. A
        smaller room hosts game tournaments where players can win computers and other prizes.<br>
        <br>
        Next door is the real draw: the fabled B.Y.O.C. (bring your own computer) area.<br>
        <br>
        Pulsating with a cacophony of techno music and laser blasts, the cavernous, dimly lit
        space strings thousands of computers together with more than eight miles of networking
        cable.<br>
        <br>
        For four days, gamers huddle in groups and alone in front of their glowing screens, facing
        off against each other in countless three-dimensional battlefields.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It's overwhelming,&quot; said Doug Bouldin, a 38-year-old environmental consultant
        who arrived at QuakeCon with his wife, Candace, and their two daughters, stroller-bound
        Piper and 12-year-old Tonya.<br>
        <br>
        The couple wore matching gray T-shirts and baseball caps with &quot;NAD&quot; inscribed in
        red, white and blue. Their North American Destroyers clan has some 50 players across the
        nation, and they were eager to meet fellow NAD members they'd only talked to while playing
        Quake.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;This is a huge conference, but Quake is worldwide. It's an opportunity for everyone
        to come together and meet and play,&quot; Doug Bouldin said.<br>
        <br>
        Jeremiah and Cary Johnson hadn't met in person when they first began fragging each other
        with rocket launchers.<br>
        <br>
        That was nearly three years ago. After a chance meeting in person, they realized they had
        more than just games in common. Friendship soon gave way to romance, and they married in
        January.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I didn't go at this looking for romance, but it happened. Now it's kind of a
        tradition that we game together,&quot; said Jeremiah, 24. &quot;We still do regular couple
        things, and we own Rollerblades, but gaming does take up a lot of our time as a
        hobby.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The Johnsons recently bought a house in Austin, including a room for computers, which they
        called their &quot;babies.&quot; &quot;We planned it so we have a room for the
        computers,&quot; Jeremiah said.<br>
        <br>
        Both agreed that the face of gaming has changed in recent years. &quot;The community has
        kind of grown up, there's more of a variety of people,&quot; Jeremiah said.<br>
        <br>
        Vendors range from powerhouse game publishers like Activision, Inc. to one-man retail
        operations like Tommy Lucas. The 28-year-old part-time ski instructor from Colorado
        Springs, Colo. said he spends his summers catering to gamers with geeky $15 T-shirts,
        miscellaneous cables and computer tools.<br>
        <br>
        He recently unveiled a line of clothing for &quot;girlz&quot; - including spaghetti-strap
        shirts and thongs that read &quot;Error 403 Forbidden,&quot; a reference to inaccessible
        Web sites.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I think the guys like those more,&quot; Lucas said.<br>
        <br>
        Many companies said the event provides invaluable feedback on new products.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;They give us direct access to the people who are buying our products,&quot; said
        Carrie Cowan of graphics card maker nVidia. &quot;These guys are not shy about saying what
        they think.&quot;<br>
