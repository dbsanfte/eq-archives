            outline of <br>
            what to expect for new members of Dragon's Bane.</strong></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cmitchel founded and
            created the Dragon's Bane Dark Age of Camelot Team. It is part of the Dragon's Bane online
            gaming group at http://www.dragonbane.net. He has had extensive experience in running
            online gaming clans, tournaments, etc.<br>
            <br>
            As a member of DB, you would have access to other DB online gaming teams, and upcoming new
            DB teams.<br>
            <br>
            Please ensure you have read the <strong>Dragon's Bane Charter</strong> at
            http://www.dragonbane.net/dbogg/oggcharter.html and <strong>About us</strong> at
            http://www.dragonbane.net/dbogg/oggabout.html<br>
            <br>
            Also, if you do not &quot; really know&quot; other members in the Guild, take the time to
            do a tell and say &quot;hello&quot; to the other members when online. Get to know and
            group up with each other. We've got the best group of players in Dragon's Bane (my humble
            opinion) and we're losing out by not taking the opportunity to get to know each other.<br>
            <br>
            Make sure you check the dragonbane site regularly.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>Guild Email Lists</strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            As well, you will receive a lot of email in future, so regularly check your email. We have
            also established a DB General Email List. This list is used for general Team updates,
            newsletters, upcoming new game information, anything that is not specific to daoc or
            shadowbane. (dbane@yahoogroups.com) Should you wish to join the other DB mail lists, go to
            http://www.dragonbane.net/dbogg/oggmain.html<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Please note regarding the email lists -<br>
            </strong>-Keep size of email reasonable, no huge attachments, link to them instead. We
            have a lot of people using free email services that don't take kindly to these.<br>
            -Sign your email with your character name(s) so people know who you are.<br>
            -Under no circumstances add player email addresses to any non-db mail list, without their
            approval.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>Guild Member Responsibility</strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            It is the members' responsibility to keep up-to-date on what is happening within the
            guild. This includes reading your email on a daily basis and checking the DB website on a
            regular basis. All guild policies are posted on the site as well as emailed to the members
            in advance of any change. Should a member disagree with a change in policy or a new
            policy, it is the member's responsibility to contact the guild leader in advance of the
            changes being implemented and not to argue after the fact.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>New Member Responsibility</strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            All new members must be active on the Team for at least the <u><strong>first 2 months</strong></u>.
            Active means you must be online at least <u><strong>3 times a week.</strong></u> Should
            you not be able to be online at least 3 times per week for the first 2 months, you must
            let cmitchel know. Otherwise, your membership in Dragon's Bane shall be forfeited.<br>
            <br>
            As well, Hammerthought keeps track of all alternate characters of members. Please keep
            Hammerthought informed, when you create a new alternate character.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>Probationary Period</strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            All new members are on a probationary period for one month. During this time, you have to
            mix well with other members of Dragon's Bane. This is something that cannot be determined
            through a yes or no question or filling out an application, so we ask that you hang out in
            guild chat and take part in our raids and events so that we can get to know you better.
            Please understand that this is pretty much the most important criteria for joining
            Dragon's Bane. This takes time and we ask anyone who is truly interested in joining
            Dragon's Bane to exercise patience. You can ask our members... it's worth the wait to join
            our team!<br>
            <br>
            </font><u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Sponsoring a New Member</strong></font></u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Any member of Dragon's Bane can sponsor a new member. However, new members cannot sponsor
            recruits until they have been a member of Dragon's Bane for minimum of one month.<br>
            <br>
            The following are Dragon's Bane's goals with regard to the guild: we want to keep Dragon's
            Bane a close group. We want all members to know each other well. We want to be a
            membership that mutually supports each other.<br>
            <br>
            To sponsor a new member, the follow steps must be taken:<br>
            <br>
            1. Each new applicant must have 1 sponsor. When a sponsor is sponsoring a new applicant,
            the sponsor will have ensured that:<br>
            <br>
            - they have grouped several times with this new person and knows this person extremely
            well.<br>
            - the new applicant has been to the DB website and is familiar with DB goals and aims and
            general guild workings.<br>
            - by sponsoring a new member, you are vouching for that recruit.<br>
            <br>
            2. All members can vote for new applicants from their first day on as a Dragon's Bane
            member.<br>
            <br>
            3. The applicant must fill out the application form and send it to cmitchel before they
            are tagged as a recruit.<br>
            <br>
            4. After I send out the application for opinions/votes, I must only positive response
            emails within a week and no negative vote in order for that person to be accepted.
            However, all applications are subject to GM approval. Please note that an &quot;I don't
            like that person&quot; is not acceptable alone; a reasonable reason must also be included
            to turn down an application.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>Disputes</strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Should you have a problem with a fellow member or a dispute, you are to inform me by email
            to formally complain. I will mediate and deal with the situation. Disputes and arguments
            shall not be held over the guild chat channel or alliance channel, but referred to the
            Team Leader for action.</font></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Bots</u><br>
            Dragon's Bane maintains several bots and vaults to help our members. They are:<br>
            <br>
            a) Vault Bots. These bots contain extra jewellry, weapons and armour a member may be able
            to use and a member can access them as needed. Please do not give out the login or
            password to anyone else, as this bot was created solely to help Dragon's Bane members.
            Please contact Hammerthought/Arclight in game who will give you the login and password
            information for this bot.<br>
            b) Crafter Bots. This bot is maintained by Hammerthought/Arclight and is intended to help
            members with their trades. Should you be trying to get your tradeskills up but need a
            donation to help, please contact Hammerthought/Arclight in game who is in charge of this
            bot.<br>
            c) Housing Bot. With housing, there is a need to have a bot to house rental monies, and
            we're always looking to members for donations to this bot. Jockoo/Uncut and Barab/Iace are
            in charge of housing, so should you wish to make a donation, please give it to either of
            them.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Alternate Characters</u><br>
            All alternate characters must be in Dragon's Bane as well as your main.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Trades and Power Levelling</u><br>
            Dragon's Bane has master crafters for every trade possible and all members are strongly
            encouraged to buy off DB crafters to help support their trade.<br>
            <br>
            Regarding power levelling, Dragon's Bane does not have a specific policy on it; however
            begging for power levelling will not be tolerated. Some members offer to power level other
            members which is fine, so long as it is voluntary.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Guild Chat Channel</u><br>
            Being a member of Dragon's Bane gives access to all members to our guild chat channel.
            This channel is to be respected by all. Swearing, name calling, spamming, talking badly
            about other members, harrassment, begging for items/power levelling will not be tolerated.
            You also have access to our Alliance channel, as we are in the As One alliance. The same
            rules apply to this channel.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Guild Houses</u><br>
            We have 3 Dragon's Bane guild houses. The facilities are open to Dragon's Bane members
            only. Here's some basic info on them -<br>
            <br>
            House 1<br>
            #1 Rossmore<br>
            &quot;Transportation House&quot;<br>
            Porter to Domann<br>
            Porter to DL<br>
            Porter to DC<br>
            Bind Tree<br>
            Healer (which you get a 25% discount off of if you use it)<br>
            Guild Vault (free items for the membership if they can use it. Please store items you no
            longer need in here for other members that may be able to use them also.)<br>
            <br>
            House 2<br>
            #2 Rossmore<br>
            &quot;Weaponcrafting/Tailor/Fletch/Armour&quot; House<br>
            Grandmaster Merchant<br>
            Apprentice Merchant<br>
            Personal Vault Keeper (you can access your own personal vault here)<br>
            Seige merchant<br>
            <br>
            House 3<br>
            #10 Rossmore<br>
            &quot;Alchemy/Spellcrafting&quot; House<br>
            Transmuting Merchant<br>
            Bane Merchant<br>
            Incantation Merchant<br>
            Personal Vault Keeper (you can access your own personal vault here)<br>
            <br>
            ----------------------------------------------------<br>
            You can get to our houses easily by taking the Erie horse from the housing entrance (just
            north of TNN). If you get lost, you can just use the command /houseface guild Dragon's
            Bane. The easiest way to get to the Guild house would be to just buy a Guild portal
            necklace at DL or a Guild portal scroll at Dom and you will port right to the house.<br>
            <br>
            If you bind at our house, to release to our house when you die is /release house<br>
            <br>
            <u>Guild Events</u><br>
            Guild event nights are held every Wednesday night at 9 pm est. Information will be sent
            via the email list and posted in the MOTD. All levels are invited to these Wednesday night
            events.<br>
            <br>
            We also have level 50 RvR nights every Tuesday and Thursday, 9 pm EST - meet in DL. We use
            Roger Wilco for voice communication (you don't need a special headset for it; you can use
            just your own pc speakers if you want). Download it free at <a href="http://download.com.com/3000-2121-10024393.html">http://download.com.com/3000-2121-10024393.html</a></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Guild Officers</u><br>
            All members can tag recruits, claim keeps, upgrade/downgrade keeps, have alliance chat
            priviledges. Some members have volunteered for the additional responsibility of promoting
            members' alts; however the intent is that all Dragon Bane members are officers and equal.<br>
