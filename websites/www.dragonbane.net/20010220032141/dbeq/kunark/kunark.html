                +6 wis, +3 sta), Lake of Ill omen<br>
                <br>
                In the sarnak outpost there is a sort of throne room, filled with angry sarnaks, and upon
                the throne is the target, &quot;Chancellor of Di'Zok&quot; (probably with a shaman pet) If
                he has the spear, he'll be weilding it. This is the only known drop off of him. Recomended
                party is 3 of 40+, though lower or less may be feasible with some luck.<br>
                <br>
                How to do it: One of the hallways brancing off of the passage leading to the throne room
                leads quite a ways down to an empty room with no other exits that may or may not have a
                roamer at the entranceway (will get loc). Invis everyone to the room (none of the sarnaks
                can see invisible) and clear the one roamer. Your puller should be the person with the
                longest range damage. The sarnaks are extremely aggro at close range, but won't assist any
                pull over 45. The puller should pull either the chancellor or his pet, either will bring
                them running down the hallway. One of the casters of the group should stand at the corner
                in the pull path to dispell the puller if he's rooted. Once you have the chancellor in the
                room, whack at him until he's about 20%, then everyone that has a stun spell/ability of
                any kind should let it reload so they can use it, because once he's at 10% health, he will
                attempt to gate. Most stuns will work fairly well on him, especially low level cleric and
                druid ones. The chancellor is a fairly decent melee'er, but a pretty crappy caster, except
                for his root and gate.<br>

                <br>
                In the Goblin Mines, a wandering goblin named &quot;Lord Gorelick&quot; (also with shaman
                pet) will go around buffing and sowing various goblins. If he has the staff, he'll be
                weilding it. This is the only known drop off of him. Recomended party is 3-4 of 40+. Lower
                or less gets fairly dangerous because of wanderers and confined space.<br>
                <br>
                How to do it: This guy is fairly difficult, as he wanders, and has a habit of being in the
                worst place when your party's invis wears off. The best way I've found is to buff up
                everyone outside the mines, then see invis and invis everyone. Then pile into the mines en
                mass and find the Lord. Then find a fairly empty room or passageway, and pull him to it.
                He will commonly be around other goblins, but they won't assist pulls from a 40.<br>
                If you a decent taunter, a decent healer, and a decent caster, it should be easy. He will
                not try to gate, but he will try to run, so make sure he's snared or rooted. He's actually
                not that tough a mob, but because of the numerous roamers (most of which he'll have
                buffed) it can get sticky.<br>

                <br>
                In Warslik Wood, there is a house occupied by three forest giants (all of maybe mid-high
                20's) inhabiting a house (will get loc on it). Since they are so easy to kill (root and
                dot or blast for a caster, and just pull and kill for a melee'er) you'll get the drops you
                want in alot less time. Also, if you have track, keep an eye on it, because just north (?)
                of this house is the spawn for the goblin that drops the Iksar Scale Gloves (great
                mid-level chain gloves). He is more difficult than the giants, but always drops the gloves
                as far as I've seen.</font></td>
