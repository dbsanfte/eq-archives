                Stormheart once again. I would like to extend my gratitude to all<br>
                those who replied and apologize for not returning any of my own. My mother is doing well,
                and the worst is over. She will be going through an adjustment period to try to get back
                to a normal semblance of life. <br>
                She'll need to heal for about a month then followup with radiation therapy. It was quite
                harrowing to<br>
                deal with the illness and administer with paperwork at the same time. Slowly but surely
                life is getting back to a level of comfort. <br>
                <br>
                Thank you all for your support. My prayers go to all those who are still going through
                this trial. <br>
                This is hard on the family as much as the patient. I send you my hope, wishes, and
                compassion of one who is still coping. My smile and gratitude goes to all those who
                replied. It helps to know that when you<br>
                sail a stormy sea there are other ships out there to support you. I salute those who have
                gone through<br>
                this before and bow my head in reverence to those who still do. Please feel free to E-mail
                me also if you<br>
                wish to chat or need to talk. (One note of caution I get kinda wordy)<br>

                ranger on the MMORP Dark Age of Camelot. To those who play, know me as Stormheart. I come

                <br>
                As of February 8th, 2002 my mother was diagnosed ith colon cancer. The extent of the
                problem is<br>
                looking very serious. On Tuesday, she will undergo surgery to have the cancer removed.
                During the<br>
                analysis of the surgery of that day, they hope to discover if it has spread to the liver.
                At which point<br>
                the results could prove fatal. I shall not dwell on the details nor relate any aspects of
                technical aspects of modern medicine.&nbsp; Rather I wish to expulse a subjective view of
                my meandering thoughts. In other words I just need to let loose. So here it
                goes,....Fantasy and reality are surfaces of the same mirror. A German philosopher once
                said &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot; So what we perceive or think we perceive is what
                we make of it. On one side are the truths and facts that are taught and learned through
                life. On the opposite are the dreams, desires, and hopes that life reflects on us.
                Mirrors, like life are fragile things. To those who know me best, know that I am a happy
                soul (with a wry sense of humor). <br>
                <br>
                Blame is a bookmark, not a story to go over and over with. We move on. People are so
                caught up in so many bookmarks that they can detail their lives by it. I for one do not
                choose to live as such. I find people are so caught up in the moment that they forget all
                things have a beginning, middle, and end (Be it games, distances, people, and life in
                general). Why is life not fair? Because, nobody said it was. Why is the sky blue or grass
                green for that matter (that was rhetorical). Someone said, &quot;If life tosses you<br>
                lemons, you make lemonade.&quot; My god, I hate that quote! Life never tosses anything.
                Life is on grand scale that, we as humans develop religions to try to explain away
                everything. Do I as a person have a right to attach the whys and wherefores to such and
                such a thing thats happens to me? Do I say envrioment or where I was born or who I was
                born from make my life any richer than what I can make for myself? And I quote from a
                Columbia speech article &quot;The race is long and time is short, in the end there's only
                yourself.&quot; <br>
                <br>
                But I digress, where were we? Ah, yes, lemonade. A wonderful euphemisism isn't it? How
                often is that<br>
                misleading? Self delusion is never a remedy to the exact nature of any problem that life
                would swing your<br>
                way. It's one thing to be positive but to ignore the true horror and tradegy of Life's
                calamities is like <br>
                living in a bubble. We all deal with problems differently and there is no one correct way
                in doing<br>
                anything when it deals with the human psyche. But to ignore anything is doing more damage
                than seeing<br>
                things for what they truly are. Okay, done venting,..thanks. <br>
                <br>
                So, I face this challenge. I am supported by a wonderful family and I will count on my
                friends. How<br>
                well will I be, after this is all said and done, will remain to be seen. My mother lives a
                ways away from where I am. So I will be taking a small sabbatical from the game a bit.If I
                don't or haven't replied to any E-mails, I apologize.<br>
                <br>
                So, I leave you with these parting words. Ignore alliance chat, believe in one another,
                and have fun. <br>
                This game is worth no more than the enjoyment that you get out of it. So don't put into it
                anything more<br>
                then what you know wouldn't be fun.<br>
                <br>

                You can play 3 ways..Team Match (Death match) Allies vs Axis - kill as many of them in a
                team total to win. Team Objective - Allies vs Axis - Finish the objectives given at the
                start of the map.<br>
                or either of the top 2 in a round based setting.. 15 min (whatever is decided upon) to
                either get the most kills.. or finish the objectives.. Then once you do either.. you
                switch sides... (good to play both sides!)<br>

                become a reality. In the new state of the game, Mark Jacobs laid out Mythic's new 6 week
                plan. (for those of you that are skeptical the last plan was about 3 weeks ago and was a
                plan for the month, which has already been completed, 1 week early).<br>
                http://www.camelotherald.com/more/202.php<br>
                <br>
                I'll pick out the good stuff ;)<br>
                <br>
                Housing <br>
                This is arguably the biggest item in the list. Implementing a full housing system that
                goes beyond what is available in any of today&#146;s games is our number one goal. As
                such, it is not an easy nor trivial thing. The full implementation will take several
                months. However, in order to make sure that we get it right we are breaking it up into two
                distinct stages, the first of which we will implement in this update. Contained in this
                update will be the following. <br>
                <br>
                5) There will be at least three types of buildings that can be purchased by the player
                and/or guilds. <br>
                <br>
                6) Each realm will have at least 50 home sites set up for guild and higher level housing.
                These sites will be pre-selected by the world developers to not only fit in with the
                landscape but also in not a way to clutter the environment and inhibit gameplay. <br>
                <br>
                7) The homes will contain a variety of features including vaults, guild banners, emblems,
                tradeskill tools. <br>
                <br>
                Please keep in mind that this is only the first stage of the housing system. The second
                stage will include new areas that will be designed for the majority of player housing
                (vacation homes, crafter towns, consignment stops, etc.). While we could wait and put them
                both in together, by separating the two we will be able to focus on the core system over
                the next six weeks but also then be able to better gauge the impact on the game from a
                player&#146;s standpoint as well as the real demand for housing.<br>
                <br>
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                <br>
                Also some other good information of what to look forward to. Anyways nobody knows exact
                price but I'm guessing a guild house will cost a TON. This means to try to start saving
                your money :). We will be needing as much money from everybody as possible, the end result
                will be awesome. I can't wait to have a guild house it will be awesome!<br>
                <br>
                Anyways we don't want you become extremely frugal....just be conservative. I'm a victim of
                handing out money (most know the story of me giving 10g to a guy for a rez hehe), always
                give a lot of money to newbies who ask for it....but I'm going to stop the handouts. Once
                again save the money you don't need. But don't ruin the fun of the game :) I don't want to
                hear about people wearing all gray armor because they are saving money for the house.<br>

                I missed the last LAN party by a few dollars and a weekend full of busy work... <br>
                <br>
                This is a very initial invitation to my apartment sometime in May for a LAN party. I have
                space for about 10 people MAX to party around and live comfortably for the weekend... of
                course with other DB members living so near-by.....<br>
                <br>
                Please let me know if you're interested, and there is a weekend that you CAN or CAN'T make
                it (make sure I know the difference :-) ). I will keep a tally of when the best times are,
                and shift the date back and forth a few days / weeks to meet the most number of people.<br>
                <br>
                Like the last LAN party, ANYONE is invited, and you shouldn't need to stay in a hotel
                there should be a few rooms in the nearby area to stay in for free). Plan for about $30-40
                for the weekend, and we can have some really good food.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks,<br>

                coming this AUG... I am going to rent a hall right smack in the middle between BANDO (my
                brother,,,if you don't know by now) an myself (about 25 miles between us) I have checked
                out motels in my area... (One right around the corner) and I also have other clans
                thinking about coming.... We have a beach house in the HAMPTONS (30 miles from me) so we
                could hang and drink like LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS... and hobnob with celebrities
                (I never saw any but my mom constantly has stories)... Then we can head over to NYC and
                sight see (what is left) and party till 8 am in some cool trendy club...<br>

                Raids for DB DAOC Team| </strong>by Hytstuph<br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think all of this discussion and time
                will smooth things out. In-game communication is less than optimal, cuz it's hard to type
                and play at the same time; and usually results in me running into mobs (sorry Bej).<br>
                <br>
                To summarize what I think I've heard:<br>
                <br>
                1 - pre-designate raid leader / rotate through guild / CMs call<br>
                2 - announce leader as others join raid (or publish with raid invite)<br>
                3 - listen to leader while on raid, discuss tactics post-raid<br>
                4 - Patience is a virtue (auto-follow and reading material help)<br>
                5 - You will die, get over it, it's just a game, try again<br>
                6 - Print realm maps and spend some time in the frontiers<br>
                7 - Following the tactics of a level 45 Druid will probably get you killed until you're a
                level 45 druid.<br>
                8 - We need to fix the Alb doors so they're not hanging open - ok I tossed that one in.<br>
                <br>
                I've lost my patience a few times in raids and gotten snippy. If any of you detect me
                being a mullet feel free to tell me to shut up. (e.g. /send Hytstuph back-off you
                over-anxious moron you're scaring the bards)</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Seige Weapon Information for DAOC | </strong>by cmitchel<br>

                changing daily, but it reports to Id and Gamespy master servers...... so it can always be
                found, no matter what the IP address. I hope to correct this situation in the near future.
                This server is running on it's own<br>
                NIC and IP, and the TDM server running off the other. The server can be used for any
