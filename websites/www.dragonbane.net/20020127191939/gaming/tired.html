            Action game with a dash of real-time strategy building tossed in. Claim a patch of land

            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Mankind- Available Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            3D real-time stratefy game that combines space battles, political affairs, trading, quest
            and power. You control a fleet of ships, colonize planets and build an empire. Other
            players will try to steal you empire, grab your planets and destroy your fleet. You can
            download a demo that limits the number of units you can control or you can pay $49 for a
            yearly subscription. <br>

            Is an on-line game that combines the real-time strategy genre with the space sim genre. Up
            to 32 players battle it out in a game that combines harvesting, research, and space

            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Star Peace - Available Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Massively multi-player game of economic building. It's a lot like SimCity but instead of
            controlling a city, you are playing alongside other players. There are over 300 different
            structurews to research and so on. <br>

            It is a bit of a hybrid online game. It won't support more than 64 in a game and can also
            be played offline in solo mode. It will ship with an editor that Bioware is promising will
            be full-featured and easy to use, so we may see a lot of mod activity spring up around
            this game. Supposedly, you can creat games where a live Dungeon Master will control the
            action, or where the AI will handle those tasks. You will be able to create a character
            that will advance in levels and Bioware has plans for secure servers that will allow
            players to &quot;check-out&quot; their characters for play and then check them back in,
            with the idea being that this will prevent hacking. <br>

            </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Should be the first science-fiction roleplaying on the market. IT has a four year story
            arc already planned that covers the conflict between the rebels and the Omni-Tek
            corporation. Players will also be able to build their own quests and will have randomly
            spawned dungeons that will be generated in-game for groups of players looking to receive a
            mission. <br>
            <br>

            In Beta Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Is a Korean game that is extremely popular there. It's a fantasy game of orcs and elves
            that resembles &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and features battles for control over towns and
            castles, a magic system with over 50 spells, gambling events, dogs (yes, you can have a
            pet) and a rather elaborate item creation system that has you following formulas to create
            items like bracers. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>RedMoon - In Beta Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Another Korean game. It's set in an anime-styled science-fiction world. IT offers players
            both pre- and post-cataclysmic settings. There are nine types that players base their
            characters on. Players will battle spies and cyborgs, cast spells, and so on with no limit
            on the levels the players can attain. The players will be able to e-mail items to one
            another in the game and JoyCity promises constantly updated quests. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Dark Age of Camelot - In
            Beta Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            This is an Arthurian game with three factions: Vikings, Celts, and Brits. Each faction
            will have its own adventure areas in which player versus player conflict within the
            faction isn't allowed. The ultimate goal that players will build for will be to adventure
            in the rival faction's areas and engage in player vs player combat against enemy players. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>The Sims Online - 2001 </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            You can expect to play a version of &quot;The Sims&quot; in a massively-multiplayer world
            with the focus being on social interaction. Character advancement may be similar to the
            original game - get a job, improve your dwelling, etc. It looks like players may compete
            by getting other players to visit their homes or businesses they set up. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Shadowbane - In Limited Beta
            Now </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Fantasy-themed &quot;Shadowbanes's&quot; big strength will be its complex player versus
            player conflict. In fact, they are building the game around this controversial feature. As
            to the style of play, it wil be level-based and Wolfpack has said that they want the
            gameplay style to be similar to &quot;Diablo&quot;, though the game uses a 3-D engine.
            There will be guilds that can control territories, the ability to form alliances, and so
            on. Player races include elves, humans, aelfborn, dwarves, half-giants, shades, and
            irekei. There are four basic character classes: fighter, healer, mage and the rogue, but
            they can specialize in one 18 advanced character classes, such as druid, crusader,
            assassin and more. <br>

            Race for ponk slips. Pull into the burger joint and show off your ride. This is a
            &quot;persistent-state hot rodding community&quot; for car lovers. You'll be able to buy,
            sell and customize hotrods, including classics, stocks, muscle cars and customs. You can
            even sell custom paint jobs to other players. There will be racing too allowing players to
            race on back streets or in a sanctioned racing circuit. AND you can listen to songs on
            your car &quot;radio&quot;! <br>

            It's a persistent sci-fi universe that's basically &quot;Privateer&quot; or
            &quot;Elite&quot; in a massively multiplayer universe. Players engage in ship combat,
            trading, smuggling, research, and more. You will use money to upgrade your shie and hire
            new pilots to command a fleet. <br>

            This will be the first massively multi-player first-person shooter It's set in the 27th
            century and the Earth is in trouble so we have colonized other planets including Neocron.
            The city is patrolled by powerful non-player characters (police and robots) but the
            surrounding outlying areas will be where the first-person shooter action will take place. <br>

            it's a faction-based shooter with money and implants taking the place of gaining levels.
            Any player will be4 able to kill another player. <br>

            2001-2002 </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            This will be the first virtual battlefield. Something that wargame fans have dreamed of
            for some time. You can be an individual soldier in the trenches or in comand of a tank or
            you can also battle in the air or on the sea. Players who have advanced in rank can even
            take command and issue orders to other players. They have eliminated the Nazi insignia. <br>

            Another Sci-fi fame in the works. There aren't any humans in this world but there are a
            few humanoids. It allows players to build not just homes but entire cities. As such, you
            can expect a detailed economic system as well to <br>
            go along with the adventuring. You will be able to form an army of NPC's and wage war. The
            developers have promised that players will be able to have an impace on the game world and
            change it. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>BigWorld - 2002 </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            It's a former penal colony and will include dynamicallygenerated missions, player vs
            player conflicts, factions, and more. It utilizes a third-person view and will start
            players off knowing nothing of their past. They will discover it as they play the game.
            There are three playable races: Human, a cio-mechanical Cybrid, or a tribal alien Beziel. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Sovereign - 2001-2002 </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            This is a massively mutli-player real-time strategy game that promises to have much more
            depth than the typical games in its genre with diplomacy, spying, alliances, trade routes,
            and many other features that almost make it sound like a turn-based
            &quot;Civilization&quot;-style game. The game will begin and end with a winner. The
            persisitent element is the player's character, the &quot;ruler&quot;, and will be used in
            each new game, accumulating experience and <br>
            goodies. <br>

            A Sony Online game that is headed up by ex-&quot;Ultima Online&quot; developers that will
            have it's emphasis on skills instead of levels. They aren't saying much about the game
            other than you will not be able to play Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader but may see them
            ingame. <br>

            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Everquest 2 - Unknown </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            All that is known about this game at this time is that it will use a much more powerful

            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><u><strong>Project Entropia - Unknown </strong></u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Another sci-fi game with a couple of differences. It will be free to play but to buy items

            Another sci-fi setting instead of fantasy that is set one million light years away from

            radiation. You will be able to travel from planet to planet via spaceship and death is
            permanent unless you've cloned yourself. There will be planetside and space battles,

            You can be a wide variety of characters in this game and will have governments. There will
            be trade routes, trade skills, faction system, and the combat will focus on player versus
            player. There will be built-in penalties for killing within your own factions. <br>
