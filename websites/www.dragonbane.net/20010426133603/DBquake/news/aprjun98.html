            <blockquote>
              <p><em><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Clan Wars, DB - Info., <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Nogame/">http://members.tripod.com/~Nogame/</a></font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;SCORES: CS=240 DB=129</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">MATCH 1: Match 1 was played on the Edge,
              at DB's server. It was evidently clear from the start of things how the match was going to
              go. CS started off strong, behind No-Game's quick fragging. Saddam Hussien and Dackman
              took over in the end to really give CS the win. Cmitchel of DB was a constant threat
              because he was just sneaky as hell! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">MATCH 2: Match 2 was played on Tokay's
              Towers. It started rather close with Cmitchel of DB giving CS a great game! However,
              Cmitchel was the only powerhouse for his team and eventually lost the top spot on the
              scores. CS played with consistancy and all players had a close frag count in the end.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">ORGANIZATION: The organization for both
              matches was perfect! Match 1 started after 5 minutes, and match 2 was instantly played.
              With 20 minute time limits, the war took 45 minutes total! Organization was the best CS
              has ever seen!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">TECH PROBLEMS: Technical problems were
              non-existant! Other than a 450 ping for No-Game (which isn't unusual), the matches had no
              lag, and no problems.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">SPORTSMANSHIP: Great sportsmanship was
              displayed by DB. The only words which were exchanged during the course of both matches
              were praises of good effort. After the end of the match, &quot;GG&quot; was exchanged by
              all parties.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">COMMENTS: CS has never played a more
              organized clanwar, and I don't think it ever will. DB is the best all around clan on the
              net (in my opinion). They play the game well, and are enormously good sports! Also, the
              organization was unparralled by any other. Without a doubt, Dragon's Bane is the clan to
              play!&quot;</font></p>

            match today with the guys from Dragon's Bane. Organization and bold play bought us a win.
            Lag reared its ugly head, but the Wusses beared down and took the best two out of three
            match in two games. No singleplayer stood out more than any other, as everyone functioned
            as a team. Constant rushes on the enemy base, and an air-tight defense that allowed no
            captures combined for an impressive win. A tip of the hat goes to the DB players that also
            stuck it out despite the server chop.&quot;</font></p>
