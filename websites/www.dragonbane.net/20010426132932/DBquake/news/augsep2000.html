                Fixes pure server so they're pure again, with a bunch of other nice changes. You can
                change your head model independantly of your body model. ie Have uriel's head on bones
                body. DB should find somekind'of dragon head model and make everyone use it as they're
                head so we can tell who DB is at a glance. Quick!! Challenge a team before they crack pure

                that the freeze tag team should pick a day that doesn't conflict with the CTF Team.
                However, in an effort to accomodate both Cyber's and Pufftgd's schedules, we will change
                the reserved match days to Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. This should also accomodate the
                freeze taggers. If there is any problems foreseen by Haks, the team scheduler, or any

                Sportmanship issue......do we really need to talk about this??? Dragons Bane's
                sportsmanship applies not only applies when we are playing matches, but also in chat
                rooms, and emails of correspondance. If you find it absolutely neccessary to use rude
                language or profanity to express your feelings, then save it for post-game meetings or
                emails where only DB ears are present. Dragons Bane has a very good history of good
                sportmanship, which places our clan among other well respected clans. That's one reason
                why Dragons Bane is desirous of being played. It's one thing to play Q3.......it's another
                to be professional, polite, and thank the other team for a game well played..... whether
                you won or lost.<br>

                mode, and I have a borrowed card that doesn't support OpenGL......so you can be assured
                that I will still be online, at meetings, and will be coordinating things as usual. I will<br>
                just be unable to play Q3 until I either get the card sent in and fixed, borrow a suitable
                replacement, or purchase a new video card. At any rate, I'm expecting to be out of
                commission for atleast a few weeks. The defense should still be strong with Cyber, Bane

                I am glad and anxious to bring the team this info......I had a meeting tonight with
                individuals from Clarkson University, which is primarily an engineering school in Potsdam,
                NY where I live (and my Alma Mater). I was enthusiastically assured that our new CTF
                server will be given a home on campus, and connected to their new T3 line! As soon as it
                is built and set up, they will hook it in to the T3 immediately. This brings me to the
                second bit of news, I have the case, fans, heatsinks, dual processor board, two Celeron
                466's, 256mb memory, hard drive, floppy, cdrom, keyboard, mouse, and monitor, and a linux
                o/s. I am lacking a video card, sound card, 100mps NIC, and a ATX power supply. People on<br>
                the team said that they had these components to send me, but I haven't received any of
                them yet. These four parts are now holding up the project, and I have ran out of money to
                purchase them myself. If you have any of these parts and you are willing to donate these
                for use in the server, please send them to me. Without scrounging these last few<br>
                parts, I will have to wait a couple of months until I have the money to buy them, which
                will of course delay the entire project at least that long.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Freezetag Tournament</strong><br>
                The current status on tourney is: schedule is being formed right now. We are hoping to
                begin next weekend (Sep 9th), probably with an exhibition round, just to get everyone into
                the swing of things. So the actual start date will be the following weekend (pending no
                glitches--Sep 16th). Also, the war server will be available for clans to practice on, it
                will be possible to reserve time on it. -<em> [DB]Xfighter</em><br>

                All Active CTF Members - King has decided that he doesn't want to perform the task of
                scheduling matches and servers alone. It is a very time consuming, yet important task for
                the CTF Team. He did say that he would assist when he can,<br>
                since he is familiar with server administration and he knows a lot of clans. I am unable
                to perform all the other tasks of leading the team and do the scheduling too. Therefore, I
                am asking for an active member to step forward and assist King in scheduling OGL matches
                and scrims, and booking servers (until ours is built). Anyone that can assume this<br>
                role in behalf of the clan, would be greatly appreciated. - <em>[DB]Sandman<br>

                As previously established..... matches or scrims will be held on the following nights:
                Tuesday, Thursday, and/or Saturday, at 8pm EST or 9pm EST (or anywhere in between).
                According to everybody's schedules that were sent to me, these nights and times are
                convenient for the major of the team. And by rotating the nights of a match as much as
                possible, it will enable a person that may not be available on Tuesday to participate in a
                game on Saturday, for example. So...... everybody can plan on matches to fall only on
                those three days of the week. If or when we feel that we are working together like a
                well-oiled machine, then we may opt to occasionally schedule a scrim or Monday, instead of
                a practice.<br>
