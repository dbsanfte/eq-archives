        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's been a frustrating
        time for QQ with all this moving, but now we're back. Thanks to Pantera for all her
        efforts, and thanks to you readers for bearing through all the shuffling.<br>
        <br>
        I find myself not knowing what to say in this edition (but don't let that fool you into
        thinking this will be short, I'll babble on about something or other).<br>
        <br>
        There's a lot I want to talk about but the words aren't coming. (Tamas stares at a
        blinking cursor for 15 minutes)<br>
        <br>
        When I first began to write this column, my intent was to make people think about the
        ripple effects of their actions, good and bad, and how those actions impact others. It was
        never my intent to make enemies or step on toes. Alas, I cast my own stone into the water,
        never considering the consequences of the ripples I created.<br>
        <br>
        I have made enemies, and I have stepped on toes. The price has been steep; I have been
        called whiner, liar, and hypocrite, just to name a few. No, I'm not trying to reopen old
        conflicts or issues. In fact, looking back on some of my earlier columns and posts, I find
        myself guilty of idealism and<br>
        naivete in some of them. After venturing further into the realms of EQ (both territorial
        and socio-political) I have in some cases changed attitudes, becoming similar to attitudes
        that I had previously called into question. Does this make me a hypocrite? No. It makes me
        a lot of things, but mostly it makes me feel...well, nevermind how it makes me feel.
        Mostly, I just want to say I'm not the jerk a lot of people think I am. It's tempting to
        wish I'd thought of writing what I have anonymously, but it's far too late to worry about
        it now. <br>
        <br>
        What I'm driving at is that without more reader feedback on issues that concern THEM, new
        editions of this column will be sparse, because Tamas has pretty much ground all his axes,
        and isn't really planning on going to look for new ones to grind. It's just not worth it
        anymore. I'm going to go back to having fun.<br>
