            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I am afraid. I am angry.
            I am in shock.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I see the same in every
            other face.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This ever present lump in
            my throat and slow unpredictable tear ups are the norm now.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My parents both moved to
            the east coast a couple years ago. My son just left for boarding school on the east coast
            a week ago. It was his first plane ride alone. I was already missing him but now I am not
            with him to look in his eyes and hold him safe. There are some who will never again be
            able to hold their lost and missing. They are in my every thought, waking and sleeping.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is not as quiet in
            Chicago as it was Tuesday or Wednesday. Being so close to O&#146;Hare airport I never
            really noticed how much air traffic there was until it was gone. It is Thursday, planes
            are flying and it looks like rain here. Finally appropriate in a simple sad way. The
            beautiful relentless sunshine of the last two days has been a mockery of sorts to the
            common sorrow in the area.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The worldwide outcry has
            been comforting. To know that not everyone hates gives hope. To see the tireless labors
            and efforts of strangers and loved ones alike gives hope. I don&#146;t think the human
            spirit has been broken but I believe its&#146; heart has. As Americans we felt safe. No
            outside source has ever hit our mainland like this. That ideal is gone. Sort of like
            emerging from a happy unrealizing childs&#146; world into the naked and brutal vulgarities
            of adulthood. Now we, on our own soil, truly realize how much another person and their
            following can hate someone elses way of life. This was not an act of war. War is striking
            out at soldiers, military bases, and weapons. This was an attempt to start genocide. The
            willful killing of a whole race or nation. Do you honestly think this is the end? Not a
            chance.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Against my beliefs that
            taking another persons life is wrong the person responsible for this horror has to be
            stopped. The only way this can happen is for this person to cease to live. I never thought
            I would ever wish for someone else&#146;s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>death
            but I do. Not for vengeance (that would be a slow torturous death, tempting but no, I
            haven&#146;t changed that much I guess) but for the elementary desire to continue our
            life, liberty and happiness. This person, if left to live, will continue his assault on
            humanity.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The persons responsible
            are really only a percent of my emotions. A small part (which is growing steadily) is the
            fear of my fellow Americans. Last night (Wednesday) and tonight (Thursday) there have been
            &#147;Patriotic Rallies&#148; held in a suburb of Chicago (Bridgeview). These rallies
            start out peacefully enough but last nights&#146; gathering got out of hand when the
            tempers flared and the desire to march to a Mosque and an Arab part of town overtook the
            crowd. Police from many neighboring communities are there right now to keep the peace.
            Please, please, please use common sense and use caution before turning on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>fellow Americans for deeds done by someone who is
            simply a very bad crazy man. There have been tons of them of every race, creed, and
            religion throughout history. You don&#146;t have to fit a special mold to be a monster. I
            could name names but we know them all. Do not assume that because someone has a certain
            religion, ancestors, or last name that they are not an American first. No matter what, I
            have to believe that most people are human with goodness inside.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Before my eyes
            unwillingly blink shut, deep in my heart, I try not to think of the families who are glued
            to their radios or TVs who live in that far away land and know as little about me as I
            know about them. I know they love their kids. They have to.</font></p>
