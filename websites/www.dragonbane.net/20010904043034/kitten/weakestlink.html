            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gentle reader. I tried I
            really tried to watch more than one episode of this. I just couldn't. I wouldn't ask my
            husband to drive back by a hundred car pile up either, rubberneck all the way past it the
            first time hell yeah .. maybe even stop and render aid if I am feeling nice but go back
            nunn-uhn. Same is true for that piece of tripe. Millionaire and I had a<br>
            pretty decent love affair for the first 3 months or so. Then it started (because of a
            contract I am led to believe is standard and more than a bit screwed up) to interfere with
            other shows (charmed) carried by CTV in my area. Had millionaire stayed an hour long once
            a week GREAT but it became a PHENOM (to everyone but me) and was on five nights a week and
            petered out to me. I am predicting a flop there can not possibly be enough gawkers out
            there to make this fly. The only thing that might save it is ....<br>
            <br>
            S.A.G. S (screen actors guild strike) Unless I missed something this is still looming over
            north America like the sword of Damocles (look it up if you don't know). Seems like if the
            fat cats in Hollywood , La la land and New York al want mo money mo money mo money. The
            studios are being greedy and not wanting to give more to their talent and the overpaid
            talent want more. Yes yes I know cry me a freaking river the &quot;starving actors&quot;
            that are really serving you dinner and parking your car won't see a big improvement, and
            folks like Jim Carrey (yay ex Canadian) Drew Barrymore, Callista Flockhart, Shanon
            Doherty, and Regis Philbin have no excuse for needing anymore money. Good GAWD FOLKS y'all
            make more in a month than most teachers do in a year, get over yerselves. This is going to
            lead to more ......<br>
            <br>
            Reality TV/game shows. Hope you liked big brother and survivor 'cause more of them is in
            the cards (the S.A.G. union cards) Well maybe not survivor it's definition is in the air.
            Stacey Stillman from survivor 1 is suing Mark burnett and cbs for arranging for her vote
            off palau tiga. Seems the shows producer ALLEGEDLY spoke to at least two of her tribe
            mates and arranged for them to not vote of rudy because it would be bad if all the old
            people went first. One of them (dirk) is admitting the conversation and vote swaying<br>
            took place. If survivor is &quot;reality drama&quot; then it is scripted and should be
            using S.A.G. actors exclusively in which case rig it however you want. If it is ruled to
            be a &quot;game show&quot; (hey it has contestants vying for a prize I can see how calling
            it a game show is a huge leap*sarc*) then CBS is in deeeeeeeeeep doo doo and they ain't
            got a shovel or a paddle. See way way back there was this game show that provided some
            contestants the answers because people winning big was good for ratings which means they
            got mo<br>
            money from advertisers. Well they got caught (probably pissed off a stonecutter yes they
            do rule the world from their secret meetings) They got investigated and the feds made a
            law against fixing things and calling it a game show. So if it isn't a game show they have
            to use guilded actors which will be on strike, if it is a game show then the are up a
            creek for &quot;fixing it&quot; not a good day to be they &quot;eye in the sky&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            Wow and to think I sat down here an hour go thinking &quot;I know I'll harp on that poor
            excuse for a game show called the weakest link&quot;<br>
