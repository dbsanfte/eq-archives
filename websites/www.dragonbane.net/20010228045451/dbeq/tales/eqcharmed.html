              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><em>Submitted September 16, 1999. This
              story is an actual adventure.<br>
              </em><br>
              </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Charmed Charmer's Luck!<br>
              </strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">My Name is Joven Wolfheart, I
              am druid Nature lover of Tunare. Rumored to be quite a Charmer and ladies man amongst
              other members of the guild (truth of the matter is I'm just nice). I write you a story of
              my luck in the field. I am only 24th level and I have been charmed 3 times in my career
              and not happy road to have to take I might add. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">My first time was when I was group with a
              lovely necromancer name Vina She and I were hunting the sisters about 17th level when we
              for the first time discovered the ruins behind the nybrights camp. we saw what we thought
              to be a rare spawn Emperor Drake with a monarch. She conned blue to us not even dangerous
              at that so we decided to slaughter the poor creature. upon hitting it I got a lesson in
              humility. I was charmed and used as a pawn against the lovely Vina. After her death I was
              forced to guard the emperor with my life for 5 whole minutes then my control was regained
              and nothing else came of it.. I never again hit the emperor since then.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Then at 23rd level Iw as closing in to 24
              while hunting in mistmoore with a good group when someone shouted &quot;Train <br>
              from the graveyard.&quot; Without a second thought I ran like hell to get out Mistmoore
              and just as I prepared to zone, I found my self back in Mistmoore, this time charmed by
              the negotiator! And, this time I wasn't just charmed, I was <strong>beguiled</strong> for
              20 minutes!! I was forced to <strong>buff</strong> everything thing I saw from negotiators
              to king and princess to vampire and ghoul.&nbsp; I was taken into the heart of the
              graveyard and buffed anything that spawned &quot;skin like stone, shield of barbs, see
              invisible, Spirit of wolf&quot; - all,&nbsp; I laid it on them, at which time barely aware
              of where I was I reigned my self and was slapped down dead where I stood in about 0.5
              seconds!</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">After I respawned, I went invisible hoping
              that &quot;see invisible&quot; had worn off which it had thank the gods! I dragged my poor
              corpse back to zone and looted it and prayed that nothing like that would happen again. (
              I was forced to kill so many people in that zone I felt my good name corrupted beyond
              repentance. I killed my group and people at whim under the control of that heartless bitch
              whom is called the negotiator) . </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Later, I am level 24 and I have been
              charmed yet again!! This time it's by Evil Eye in East Karana and it too was blue. It made
              me kill and buff but it wore off quicker, but not quick enough for I was forced to kill my
              partner Darcness!</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">The moral of my story is if you see a druid
              named Joven accompanying a heartless creature, kill him quick and end his suffering for
              you will do him a favor in the long run. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Cancel magic is also a good thing to have
              &lt;hint hint&gt; thank you and peace be with all of you.<br>
              <br>
