              <strong>Forward<br>
              </strong>I do not write this story lightly. There have been events in my life that I will
              never get over, no matter how old I live to be. Neither do I write this story to glorify
              myself. I feel that I have lead an interesting life, with my own fare share of joyful and
              tragic moments woven into it. I write this story because I want to share with you, my
              friends, how I came to be the person you know today. Before I begin there are two things
              that I would like to clarify: Elven time is not measured in the same way that human time
              is. We of the Elven blood live much longer lives than humans do because we age more
              slowly, so our way of measuring time must be different. As five years pass for a human,
              only one year passes for a High Elf. So even though I am 125 years old by human standards,
              by my own people's reckoning I am only 25 years old. The second thing is how I am able to
              reapeat some of the conversations in this story. One way is by asking my father, who has
              an excelent memory and can relate many of his past conversations to me. The second way is
              through magic. With the aid of an Enchanter friend of mine I am able to send my spirit
              back in time to mearly observe past events. And now, my story.....<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Chapter 1: They Meet <br>
              </strong>Where does my story begin? I suppose it should begin at the begining, at my
              birth. No. I will go back farther than that, I will begin at the time when my father met
              my mother. My father's name is Tarker Blazetoss, he was born and raised in Felwithe. My
              mother's name was Shilandria Firebright, and she was born in Felwithe but raised in a
              small settlement in Lesser Faydark. My father and mother met each other while going to
              school at the Felwithe Academy of the Arcane. My father was studying to become a Wizard,
              while my <br>
              mother aspired to become an Enchanter. My father was 26 at the time, and had been studing
              at the Academy sinse he was 18 years old. He was a handsome High Elf with short white hair
              and a charming smile, or so my mother told me. My mother was was only 19 when she came to
              the Academy, sent there by her family when they had rasied enough money to pay for her
              tuition. According to my father, she was the most beautiful High Elf maiden he has ever
              laid his eyes on. She had long golden hair, a rare thing among High Elves, perfect
              alabaster skin, and a twinkle in her eyes that made his knees grow weak. He was smitten
              with from the first moment he saw her, as were many of the other younger students training
              at the various guilds in Felwithe. My father, having never been in love before, had no
              idea what to do. He was not <br>
              athletic, so he could not impress her on the practice field. His magic could not be used
              heal the sick, or strengthen the weak, so he could not impress her in that way either.
              Whenever he tried to talk to her, he grew flustered and began to talk about extremely
              technical magical theory, while she looked on with a strage smile on her lips. Finally,
              after a year of her being at the Acadamy and flirting with severel differnet High Elf
              youths, and yet never going out with any of them, he finnaly got up the courage to ask her
              <br>
              out. Much to his astonished surprise, she said yes. <br>
              <br>
              ----------<br>
              &quot;On one condition,&quot; she added.<br>
              &quot;Anything,&quot; he replied.<br>
              &quot;You have to promise me that you will not talk about anything technical while we are
              on our date,&quot; she said with an impish little grin.<br>
              &quot;You have my word,&quot; he promised.<br>
              ----------<br>
              <br>
              And so they went on their first date, and it was magic from the start. Not Wizard magic,
              or Enchanter magic, but magic of a different kind. A year after that they were married. I
              am told that it was a lovely ceremony, with <br>
              my mother looking raidiant in a shining white Gossimer Robe, and my father looking very
              elegant in his Flowing Black Robe. And so Shilandria Firebright became Shilandria
              Blazetoss on the Felwithe bridge 27 years ago.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Chapter 2: The Birth<br>
              </strong>I am told that in the three years following their marriage my father thought that
              there was no way his life could possibly get any better. He was rising rapidly in all of
              his classes, becoming the most promising Wizard in all of the Academy. Although he had to
              study very hard to stay on top of his classes, he still was able to find time to be with
              my mother. While she was adept at the Enchanters art, she was nowhere near as skilled as
              my father was in his Wizardry. My father, although not an Enchanter by art, had become
              fairly skilled at the Enchaters art, as he had with the Magicans art as well. He was able
              to help my mother study and learn the more general aspects of the Enchanters art, when he
              was not busy with his own classes that is. Two years and three months after my parents
              were married, we are talking about High Elf time here, my mother withdrew from the
              Academy. She had come to the conclusion that she would never be a master at her art, and
              she was pregnant. My father was hard pressed durring the nine months that followed. Not
              only <br>
              did he have to contine with his studies, but he also needed to find some kind of work and
              spend time with my mother. He finally found a job delivering mail for the Antonican League
              of Bards, which he was able to do far better than any normal person due to his ablility to
              teleport himself all around the known world. This is not to say that my mother did not
              help, for she was a very strong person and would not sit idly by at let her husband do all
              the work. She found a job in Kelethin enchanting items for all the local guilds. Shortly
              before I was due to be born, they were able to afford a house. Located in the living
              quarters of Felwithe it was not a huge house, but it was a place that they could call
              home. At last the day that I was to be born arrived, and with it arrived a taxing problem
              for my father to face. You see, that day was also the day of final exams for my father. He
              had a difficult choice to make: Take the final exams and possibly miss my birth, or skip
              the exams and fail his courses but see me be born. He was in his quarters in the Wizard
              guild wrestling with his dilemma, with the exams only a few hours away, when there was
              suddenly a knock on his door. When he <br>
              opened the door he found the leader of the Wizard Guild, Quintalain Boltar, standing
              there.<br>
              <br>
              ----------<br>
              &quot;Come in revered guild leader,&quot; my father said.<br>
              &quot;Thank you Tarker,&quot; said Quintalain, &quot;I will only take a moment of your
              time. It has come to my attention that your wife is due to give birth today, is this
              correct?&quot;<br>
              &quot;Yes sir,&quot; my father replied, &quot;that is correct.&quot;<br>
              &quot;I know that today is the day of final exams and that you of all people do not want
              to miss them,&quot; said Quintalain. &quot;Have you talked to your instructors asking them
              for an extension on taking your final exams?&quot;<br>
              &quot;Oh I have sir,&quot; said my father, &quot;but to my dismay they all said that they
              were deeply sorry, but they could not give me an extension.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Cannot and will not are two different things Tarker,&quot; said Quintalain. &quot;I
              believe that if you ask them again, you will find that they have changed their
              answer.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Thank you sir,&quot; my father exclaimed, &quot;but why would you do such a thing
              for me?&quot;<br>
              &quot;I have had my eye on you for quite some time Tarker,&quot; Quintalain said.
              &quot;You are more adept by far than all of your classmates, and I believe that you are
              even more skilled than some of your teachers. You are a fast learner, have an excelent
              mind, and you have not let your power go to your head. For the past 13 years you have
              worked harder than any student at the Academy, and I feel that such hard work deservers a
              reward. Now go home to your wife and enjoy the miracle of birth. And remember, hard work
              does not always go <br>
              unrewarded in this world.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Thank you sir, thank you so much!&quot; my father cried as he jumped out of his seat
              and began to shake Quintaliain's hand with incredible vigor. &quot;I will not forget what
              you have done for me! You will not regret this!&quot;<br>
              As my father ran out of the room Quintalain turned to an invisible bystander who had
              oberved the whole scene &quot;Do you think he has any idea what is in store for him or his
              son?&quot; Quintalain asked.<br>
              &quot;No,&quot; said a quiet, rich, woman's voice, &quot;but he is strong and he will
              endure, as will his son&quot;<br>
              Quintalain sighed. &quot;I hope you are right Mother Tunare, but you are placing an awful
              lot on the sholders of one, and I only hope that he can bear the weight.&quot;<br>
              ----------<br>
              <br>
              My father, oblivious to this conversation, ran as fast as he could back to his home and
              his wife. And on that day, with my father being 31 years of age and my mother being 24, I,
              Evoc Blazetoss, was born.</font></p>
