                Memramcook, N.B. Canada. I inflict myself on my husband of almost four years so far and
                for the rest of my life. Funny story - we moved in together after knowing each other for
                only four weeks. Lived together for a year, then planned the whole wedding in under two
                days (from no preparations to married in under 48 hours). I wanna be impulsive, reckless,
                lose myself in your kiss ...</font></p>

                meal&quot; First it has to have candle light roses and wine (red) Caesar salad extra
                croutons and bacon bits, the biggest damn steak you can find , somewhere between rare and
                medium rare depending on your definition (when I say rare I mean let it look at the oven
                shiver in terror then bring it on out ) I like it cooked slightly more than that ... brown
                on each side for about 2 mins is great. Dessert either chocolate fondue with strawberries
                and whipped cream in front of a fire place , or there are these killer cookies a
                restaurant near me has .. they have white chocolate some kind of nut (macadamia maybe) and
                is sooooo yummy. You can imagine why I am the size I am (check out members photos, I will
                never beat Talangirl in a swimsuit contest 8))<o:p></o:p></font> </p>

                Ummm well you asked so here it is something to shock and amaze.... on a broad scale it is
                uniformed people speaking about things they (demonstrably by their speaking) know nothing
                about.. honed to a finer degree people who sit communism as being bad or outdated because
                1&quot;America isn't&quot; or 2&quot;look at USSR and china they are communist and
                evil.&quot; America is not the be all and end all there are other ways of governing that
                are as good, America isn't a democracy it is a republic (look it up) China and Russia WERE
                NEVER COMMUNIST despite what they say and we believe, they may have tried to start down
                the path but umm Marx (the inventor of Communism) said a temporary dictatorship of the
                bourgeoisie (middle and upper class) by the pro-literati (working class) the dictatorships
                kinda weren't temporary and well power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
                Communism means no one owns anything but all own everything. I will never be convinced
                that anyone NEEDS to make more than 100,000 a year, or that CEO's rockstars, sports people
                need to make millions while teachers are lucky to clear 50,000. /rant off<o:p></o:p></font></p>
