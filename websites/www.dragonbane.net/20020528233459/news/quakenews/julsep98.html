              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">I just like to take the time

              I'll start off by saying that these guys have to be the biggest bunch of sexually
              repressed idiots in the history of the human race. First we agreed to a 4 on 4 match on
              C's server. Well one ACME guy shows up and leaves, reconnects leaves, etc. His ping was
              about the same as mine was so he didn't timeout. Then </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Taz[ACME]</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> gets on the
              server and obviously this idiot has seen one too many episodes of </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Judge Judy</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">, yelling at us to get on their server &quot;NOW&quot; or we forfeit in
              two minutes. So as his little stop watch is ticking down, </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">me</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> and </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">C</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> begin to think...hmmm. Well they challenged us, they picked the map, and
              now they want to pick the server. I'm not really familiar with the OGL rules, I know
              reading 5 pages of rules about a computer game league gets some people off, but I guess
              I'm just weird. So we join the server and there are about 7 or 8 Acme guys arguing with </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Hitman</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> about things they had already agreed to days before hand. Well with </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Hitman</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> being the nice guy he is, he gives in and we are gonna play right? Wrong.
              We sit there for a good 10 -15 minutes while these guys decide who's going to play for
              them. They have no clue how many players the match was set for, but can remember the
              agreement on the server, please. We wait patiently, and guess what they end up with 3 guys
              with pings of 100 or less and one guy with a 250-300 I believe. Now </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">C</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> and </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Hitman's</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> pings are up into the high 300's and they are on
              cable. I've got about 290-340 and some really bad fps and </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">MacDixon</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> had
              the same fps problem. So finally we start and well as expected they killed us. Now losing
              I can handle, but these guys felt the need to rub it in even though they had every
              advantage and were breaking the rules. It was 24 caps to none I think. Now I don't know
              what the problem was with these guys. Maybe they didn't get lucky at the prom, or get
              picked on in school, or are pissed off cause mommy and daddy forgot to tuck them in the
              night before. It was a total disregard for sportsmanship, you don't kick someone when they
              are down, its a basic rule of humanity. I play this game for one reason, that's fun. I
              have fun when I win or lose, but these guys have a hard on to win so bad that they
              completely ruin the appeal of the game. <br>
              <br>
              Now to some of them, I apologize for this, there was one guy (forgotten his name) that
              stepped out when </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">C</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080"> disconnected, a few times. And they didn't talk
              any shit although they really didn't have to, sometimes actions speak louder than words.
              And when these guys play a good clan I hope they get the same thing, and I promise you
              they won't show the class that we did by not complaining. <br>
              <br>
              Now I'm a fairly laid back guy, and don't take games all that seriously, however this
              match touched a nerve. I went out had a smoke and was over it, but thought I'd throw in my
              2 cents on the match. Guess you have to deal with idiots in life, but you don't have to
              like it :0<br>

                &quot;Well, we played one round with Clan Dragon's Bane last night in LMCTF. Those guys
                are pretty damn good. Even though we had a ping advantage, they still managed to beat us.
                Goes to show why we play mostly Lithium DM! I'm chalking it up as a scrimmage since they
                had to go, but we will be matching up again soon. More practice sure couldn't hurt on our

                a good one but you guys never showed up. It was a clan ring server for clan matches. So
                when you guys want to play *For real* this time let me know. We will NOT use yours or our

                gotta be kidding me!!!!!!I haven't heard such a ridiculous commentary or a more offbase
                evaluation of a situation in my life. To start things off we agreed on a server and yes we
                did have some high pings. We then agreed to try another server &quot;77's&quot;
                server,well it was awful I spent the whole time locked up, so after much deliberation and
                'server searching' none was to be found. An hour later after the match was supposed to be
                started one of 77's members gave us a call and said that they found a server, well 2 of
                our members had already left but cmitch organized a patchwork team to compete anyway....go
                figure but they forgot to include the port number I tried 6 different ports and then gave
                up, Ill be damned if we didn't try to play that match. By the way all this running around
                occurred at about 12:15 am cst....After reading such an asinine statement from those
                clowns I personally will not participate in a match with the clan...not that they were
                rude or anything because they weren't, its just that I think we deserve just a little more
                respect then they want to give us. DB was at the allotted server with all members on time,
                clan 77 was not. They then proceeded to try and give us a hard time, that's crap. Well
                enough of that, like I said I don't mean any disrespect to that clan its just that I think
                we deserve a little more respect than they decided to offer. &quot;play for real&quot;

              based, with each position controlling a certain area and therefore a certain weapon. The
              positives of the strategy, in theory and in gameplay, is that the enemy's weapon choice
              will be greatly limited. Also, traffic throughout the level would be severely hindered by
              constant attacks. However, there were many flaws that I did not foresee. One, I counted on
              perfect attendance of all the team members. That was not good, one of them couldn't show,
              he had more important things to do. I tried to patch the place, but the positions were
              spread too thin. Second, although each position can help 1 or more, a lot of times people
              would be outnumbered because of team damage... often a person risks killing or hurting his
              own teammate. I think that this strategy would be great if thoroughly practiced and
              explained, but it would require usually more than 4<br>
              people, depending on the level though.</font><br>

              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">Azz's team strategy was to
              have 3 people run about and frag while 2 people guarded certain weapons. One person was to
              watch the rocket launcher on the upper ledge while one of the roaming fraggers kinda
              watched their back, and the second person was suppose to guard the grenade launcher. That
              plan was not going to work with only three people, so I just told my teammates, DarkenRahl
              and Teric to have fun. At the last minute Theman44 was also added to our team, but did not
              know our strategy, or lack thereof. Our biggest downfall was the lack of all teammates
              having the proper skin on so that we would not accidentally shoot our own teammates. All
              in all, it worked out pretty good. Great job guys!<br>

              <br>
              I have decided to try something new for Clan practices. I sent out the following email to
              all clan members:</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;For the month of
                August, DB is going to implement a new type of practice. During this month, I have divided
                DB up into 4 teams which will be identified by model. The Team Leaders will be Azzkikr,
                BigSned, Theman44 and Jedi666. Azzkikr's Team will be the Wolf Model, Big Sned's Team will
                be the Female Model, Theman's Team will be the Cyborg Model, and Jedi666's Team will be
                the Male Model.<br>
                <br>
                It is the responsibility of each Team Leader to get in touch with the members of your
                team. Each team is to come up with a &quot;DM match&quot; strategy by next Monday's
                practice. Then the strats will be put to the test. After the one hour test, where the
                teams will compete against each other, the clan will meet on icq for a 15 minute meeting,
                where each team will tell what strat they used, did it work? and why/why not? If a team
                member cannot show up for Monday, then it will be the responsibility of the team to
                compensate for that by adjusting their strat. Each team is to use teamtalk (messagemode2)
                as part of their strat.<br>
                <br>
                Please note that on Monday practice, friendly fire will be on, and weapon stay off. The
                level for Monday's competition and test of your team strategy will be Q2DM1.<br>
                <br>
                This is to be taken as a <u>serious clan exercise</u>; there is a plan to this
                method.&quot;</font></p>

              said we would play 4 vs 3, but they said they didnt want to hear excuses that we got beat
              because we were outnumbered :) So on we went to another game on The Edge...this time
              46-41, close....Cyber was happy 44 wasnt there cause friendly fire was on (hehe) and well,

              able to stop our flag for getting out about 4 times, the others, well turned into caps.
              Total of 8 caps for CT on their server, and 0 for DB. :) So now to DB's server, hmm, still
              nobody else from DB. Oh well, cmitchel and I played again, But this time, cmitchel had
              defence and I had offence. Well I think we shocked CT, I got resist and started a capping
              spree, 10 caps in a row to CT's none. Then 3 of em rushed cmitchel on D, got our flag and
              capped. I got cornered, and lost my resist, causing another quick cap for CT. Total caps
              on DB's server DB 10, CT2. Damn guess what? A tie, so total points is the tiebreaker, and
              well with 4 vs 2, CT gets the win. Anyways, CT played a good game, It was great fun,
              although I'd love to know German, I'm sure some of those things typed after I walked into
              their base and whiped out their D time and again were quite colourful :) They were good
              sports all around! Hope to meet them on the battlefield once again, next time with even
              teams!<br>
