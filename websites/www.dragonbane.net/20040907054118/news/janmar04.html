                    will not be back for a few months. I'll be online a little before then to say my goodbyes.
                    But I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone just incase I don't catch you online before
                    then. Thanks for everything DB. I have met lots of great people and have had a great time.

                    <br>
                    Scottish and Japanese researchers last year isolated an &quot;immortality gene&quot; in
                    mice that allowed stem cells to grow indefinitely in the laboratory. They dubbed it Nanog,
                    from the Celtic mythical land called Tir nan Og, where everyone stays young. The discovery
                    hastened the race to find a similar human gene and prompted serious scientists to publicly
                    discuss for the first time what they've been quietly pursuing for years.</font></p>

                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now that I have acquired Rrand I have a
                    house (#3208) and a CM available to make filling WC orders viable. I've PCed my way up to
                    1030 and can make most weapons. If you email me a weapons order via this email account I
                    will make the weapon and place it on my CM with the price set at cost. My house is about a
                    5 minute run (with speed) to the SW along the river from the guild houses.<br>
                    <br>
                    For guildmates, I'm simply charging the average cost with no accounting for my time. So
                    it's just the material cost multiplied by the average number of retries to make a
                    particular level item. I may not have enough cash to attempt an MP high-level weapon (50
                    retries), so one of the higher level WCers might be a better choice.<br>
                    <br>
                    The odds of making a particular quality weapon are as follows:<br>
                    <br>
                    94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 = 98/6 or 16.33% or 6.12 retries<br>
                    100% = 2% or 50 retries<br>
                    <br>
                    For example, I think the most expensive weapon's base cost is 247Gp and would cost 1.5Pp
                    for 99% and 12.35Pp for 100%. The rational here is that while guildmate #1's weapon might
                    come out 99% on the second try, guildmate #2's weapon may take 8 tries for 99%. The
                    statistical average is 6.12 retries so that's what I'm using.<br>
                    <br>
                    I'll take an order for any number of any level weapons. I'll email you back when it's
                    done. I'll leave it on the CM that night unless you want to pick it up in-game. There are
                    aready a few 99% weapons on the CM at #3208 from my PCing if anyone is in the market. My

                    cancelled my account, but I have almost a month left to complete my leaving. I will

                    I need all the cash that I can get. The main thing is that I am so very happy with this

                    all of you. If I do Ebay Bear, I will make certain to deguild him. If any DB are
                    interested, the account is a 50BM (RL3.5)with 5 artifacts activated (spear of kings, axe
                    of malice, belt of the sun, winged helm and hapy feather cloak). He has a house in
                    Torrylin with vaults, merchants and a CM on the porch. The account also has a 42 void
                    eldy, 35 mana chanter, 28 NS, 20 Valewalker (869 or so in Alchemy), 20 Druid (551 or so in
                    SCing) and some other Misc level 24-20 toons. Bear has ML4 completed except for the MLxp.
                    He has none of 5, but most of 6, 7 and 8 done. If you want to make an offer let me know. I
                    have no idea what to ask. My best to everyone! If no one is interested, I will Ebay him in
                    about 3 or 4 days. Take care!<br>

                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">&quot;Hi all. I downloaded the open
                    beta client last night and played for a few hours. I wanted to share my first impressions
                    of Knight Online.<br>
                    <br>
                    First, a little about my background. My first MMORPG was (of course) EQ. I have played AO,
                    DAoC, Neocron, and FFXI. I have beta'ed many games, including SWG, AC1, AC2, Earth and
                    Beyond, The Sims Online, Rubies of Eventide, Planetside, and Horizons. I would say (in
                    games) my personality type is mainly of an adventurer / achiever. Okay, enough about me.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Graphics (World): Very good job! The graphics look great, and I was able to run them on
                    my main PC (AMD 2500+, 768 MB RAM, ATI Radeon 9700 PRO AIW) with no choppiness. I think
                    they rate right up there with some of the best looking MMORPGs on the market today.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Graphics (Character Models): I would have to say these are good, but some of the
                    animations could use some work. I particulary disliked the sitting / standing animation.
                    Other than that, good job on these as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Music: I really like the music. The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes the
                    music seems a bit too dramatic for the task. I found it strange for dramatic, epic music
                    to be piping through my speakers as I killed worms <br>
                    <br>
                    3. MOBs: I like that, at least in the newbie areas, these are plentiful. I found the
                    fights to be fast-paced and enjoyable. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Loot: Great job on this so far! I like that you can get usable items and coin off of
                    MOBs at a very low level. Too many games today go the &quot;no loot&quot; route in my
                    opinion. Even if the loot ends-up not being great, just having it is a big plus in my
                    book.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Lag: I had a few spots of lag, but, overall, this was fine. I was able to play
                    virtually lag-free for most of the time.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Population: Please please keep a relatively few number of servers when impressed that
                    you have scaled the # of MOBs (in the newbie areas at least) to accomodate the # of
                    players!<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Control: Great idea on this! I love being able to control my toon by either the
                    standard WSAD (or arrow keys) or point-and-click. I usually prefer the WSAD method, but I
                    found your point-and-click interface to be very intuitive!<br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, I am very impressed with this game. I actually look forward to playing it when I
                    get home. That has not happened, at least at this level, with a MMORPG (esp. one in beta)
                    in a while. Good job! I will also be recommending that my guild try this game. So
                    hopefully that will bring more load testers in!&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                    <br>
                    Anyway, in my opinion, its worth a look. I am playing as Xannder on the &quot;1&quot;

                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hello everyone (from bedpost so you all
                    know who I am from the beginning),<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm sure that most of you have noticed that I haven't been on at all the past week. I just
                    have lost total interest in a game that can change the way a character you have put a
                    year+ effort into and then it doesn't work the same anymore. This is not just due to
                    Wardens being nerfed just in general. Also the direction that they are taking frontiers,
                    some of it is good, however, alot of it I look at and can't imagine how they think that's
                    a good idea. Just can't see being interested in this game anymore. <br>
                    <br>
                    I have really enjoyed my time being in Dragon's Bane DACO team and everyone that I met
                    here. I actually never did uncancel my main account from before when I had said I was
                    going to cancel so I think I only have about 2 weeks left before my account is closed. I
                    may sign on once just to say bye to everyone, however, if I miss seeing you I hope
                    everyone has fun with the game. <br>
                    <br>
                    I doubt that I'll be trying any of the new MMORPG's coming out for the same reason as this
                    one has really turned me off. I don't see how mythic thinks it's a good idea to nerf a
                    class to the point that people don't even play them anymore. Then later they may make a
                    change to make that class good again but who knows for how long. I keep hearing grumblings
                    about how Thane's are going to be good when Frontiers comes out, I'm sure they will change
                    that though if that is truly the case. From reading up on the other MMORPG's out there
                    this seems to be the way they go as well when something needs fixed, they just nerf the
                    class rather then fix the actual problem. There are so many things that they could have
                    done with classes rather then nerf them horribly. <br>
                    <br>
                    The focus shield nerf really is irritating to, the problem was that a group of 8 cabalists
                    could kill the dragon, so what do they do, they nerf focus shield for all realms rather
                    then just making the dragon immune to Focus shield damage. How much longer will the infil
                    be over powered? Then when they do nerf the infil, NS's will be winning against infil's to
                    often so the NS's will get nerfed...<br>
                    <br>
                    Sorry about my huge rant here, however, until I see game come out that I think will not
                    get this type of negativity towards the customer base I wont be playing any of the
                    MMORPG's that come out. <br>
                    <br>
                    Hope you all have fun and good luck,<br>
                    <br>
                    I'll be on e-mail still just to hear about things and hear what frontiers is really like.</font></p>

                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hi all, for anyone out there interested
                    in taking a look at Lineage 2, Japan Open Beta is running now, and Gelrog and I have been
                    messing around with it for fun. Anyone can get an account, and the Beta is very playable,
                    even with a lot of the quest/merchant speak in Japanese. So far I think the graphics are
                    outstanding, and the content is average. Supposedly much like DAOC the fun begins at the
                    higher levels with siege warfare. Haven't gotten there yet but interested in seeing how it
                    works out. I don't think I would leave DAOC for this game but it is a fun alternative to
                    get on for a few hours to play around. Anyway purpose of this email is to give you a guide
                    to get a Japan Open Beta account if you are interested. Here is how:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Go to the following link and click the Bright Red Box on the left side of the
                    screen(Says in Japanese &quot;Sign up for Open Beta&quot; I guess) <a href="http://www.lineage2.jp/">http://www.lineage2.jp/</a><br>
                    <br>
                    2. (Page 1) Click the left side bullet and then click the button (This is the license
                    agreement)<br>
                    <br>
                    3. (Page 2) Enter your email address in the next box. Need to use a real one since it will
                    then send you a registration code. Click the button once you have entered it.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. (Page 3) Go to your email box (in another window) and cut and paste the Alpha-Numeric
                    code they emailed you (it will be the one in english letters) into the box. Push the
                    button.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. (Page 4) Fill out the next page according to this graphic. <a href="http://www.un1337.org/l2-j.jpg">http://www.un1337.org/l2-j.jpg</a><br>
                    <br>
                    6. (Page 5) Next page is a confirmation of your information. Click the left hand button to
                    confirm. <br>
                    <br>
                    7. You are now signed up. Download the Client here : <a href="http://download.bbx.lineage2.jp/L2_040211_J2.exe">http://download.bbx.lineage2.jp/L2_040211_J2.exe</a>
                    Highly recommend using Internet Download Manager (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_download/0,fid,22363,fileidx,1,00.asp">http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_download/0,fid,22363,fileidx,1,00.asp</a>)
                    It very nicely breaks the file down and doesnt lose it if you crash. File is a hefty
                    1.18GB so it will take a while.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Run the client and enter your account/password info. Go to the options page (all of
                    this is in Japanese now so you will have to guess a bit) and select English. Now all of
                    the important content will be displayed in English.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Gelrog and I are on server 3. Names so far are Valkwynne, Gemmalin, and Valkwyn. Great
                    resource for help on quests, items, etc is www.l2orphus.com <br>
                    <br>
                    Hope to see ya in there :) If you get stuck feel free to send me an email and maybe I can
                    walk you through it with teamspeak.</font></td>

                    game that has characters that age and die, at which point you get to keep physical wealth
                    and reputation, but have to level a new toon. This may solve the power-gamer versus casual
                    gamer dilema most MMORPGs face. Also, guilds level, so your groups abilities grow through
                    the ages despite members passing on. It's skill based not level based (like SWG) so non
                    fighting professions don't fight to level. It's in final Beta, but is scheduled for
                    release on March 1st. The race abilities seem more distinct (ala Shadowbane). All
                    non-starter zone land will be controlled by NPC tribes when the game goes live (with very
                    sophisticated AI) and once conquered you have to keep them either subjugated or appeased.<br>
                    <br>
                    I think the game is PnC, and I'm not sure how the PvP is implemented, so it could go the
                    way of Shadowgank... er, Shadowbane.<br>

                    <br>
                    These vaults are intended to be used for guild donations, particularly salvagable items.
                    Also for ToA scrolls you wish to share. If I see 99% and 100% dropped items, I do look at
                    the bonuses before deciding whether to salvage or place on Consignment Merchant.<br>
                    <br>
                    Any guild member can put things in these vaults, but only me (Hammerthought), Cmitchel and
                    Panterra can remove items. So, if you see a scroll you need, contact one of us. </font><p><a name="DB Biosfear: Announcement!|by Sinsredemption"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>DB Biosfear: Announcement!</strong>|by Sinsredemption</font></a><br>

                    <br>
                    On the 15th of this month, there is going to be a Castle siege. If you visit the Biosfear
                    website you can read more about it. It is, simply, a war between guilds within an area,
                    and we all fight for a crystal of some sort. The point system is based on guild kills,
                    non-guild kills and amount of time a guild controls a crystal. This is a big event in the
                    game and i am hoping we can make DB look good. This may be difficult for our guild has
                    only just started in Biosfear. <br>
                    <br>
                    As for recruiting, I wish to request that those whom Dark and I recruit not be officially
                    recruited to DB, rather just in game untill the game actually hits off. <br>
                    <br>
                    If any others in DB get into this game plz let Dark or I know and we will take good care

                    Hopefully the most prime location for a meeting hall in all of Istaria. It will take alot
                    of carpentry and fitting work to get built and we don't have anyone in the guild now

                    16 ML9 hibs took ALL lvl 10 keeps AND relic keep from 40+ albs defending.<br>

                    <br>
                    2-3 power draining spheres at doors and along walls to keep thier rezzers and casters
                    inside w/out power 2-3 power regen fields around thier group....Given that.. an Animist
                    has INFINITE power....therefore a shroom army you could never even imagine :P<br>
                    <br>
                    On that note, we're going to be pressing on with the MLs.<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm pretty much done leading ML3s and lower. Aglon's taking those up. I'll be doing ML4
                    some more, then moving onto some ML5s. Nearly all of ML5 is group oriented except the last
                    step 5.10 <br>

                    reading the WoW boards. Its called BiosFear. It is a MMORPG that is currently is open
                    beta. It may be neat to play around with, since its free. Its interface is sort of like
                    Shadowbanes, which right away means I don't like it (not a fan of point-and-click
                    movement), but somebody may find it a fun diversion. Anyway, here is the link:<br>

                    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hey all, Darksouled here with a little word
                    about the new beta. I have been playing the game for 2 days now and the first night I
                    played it I deleted it from my hd..... but<br>
                    somthing told me to try it again. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And well I did... and I am finding myself
                    quite addicted to it! It is a new game and seems to be trying to get itself out there a
                    little fast but there are many things about it. First of all I have no idea what the cap
                    for lvl is but its far beyond 50. Somewhere around 200 there are quite a few things about
                    the game that I like and others that I don't. <br>
                    <br>
                    I really enjoy it now and I think that some of you should give it a try for a few days. If
                    this game turns out to be big, Ithink that it would be good for more that one or two
                    members of Dragon's Bane to get in there early and get a good foothold on the lvls, cash,
                    and quests. I am already a lvl 20 with one toon and lvl 12 with another.<br>
                    <br>
                    Just email me&nbsp; if you are interested and I'll do all I can to play around the same
                    time as you and give you all the help that I can with cash, power levelling and such.<br>

                    everyone walked away with a great gift - whether it was scrolls, artifacts, mp
                    armour/weapons, promise of crafting service, etc. A great time was held by all.
