        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The other night I
        overheard a shout/ooc argument between some low level players and a very high level player
        regarding the arena in Freeport. It would seem that this high level player was killing
        anyone who entered the arena. Now I know the arena is a PVP area, and players are warned,
        and PVP is what arenas are for. However, some people wish to use the arenas to test out
        new spells, or just pass some time smacking each other around for laughs.<br>
        <br>
        The arena is not a hunting license for sadistic level 50s to hang around and slaughter
        every level 5 that strays into it. Okay sure, it's PVP and you can attack them. But once
        they say &quot;hey, cut it out&quot; and you continue to slaughter them, you've pretty
        much crossed the line into Jerk City. Just<br>
        because you CAN do something doesn't mean you MUST. Quite simply, this is called sentience
        and freewill. It's what seperates humanity from the animals.<br>
        <br>
        In the past I've been told of high level characters who have not only killed people in the
        arena, they KEEP killing them before they can recover their corpses. That's just sick and
        wrong. As with anything else, you can attack a person in the arena; it's your prerogative,
        and a risk they take by<br>
        entering. But once that person has asked you to stop (even if they do so in an angry
        manner) and you do not, that, in my book, constitutes harassment.<br>
        <br>
        To those people who entertain themselves in this grossly immature fashion, I say to you,
        grow up.<br>
