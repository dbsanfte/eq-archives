            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Dragon's Bane was officially formed on
            April 19th, 1998. It is a virtual community of gamers, known as the Dragon's Bane Online
            Gaming Group. Members of Dragon's Bane find &quot;like minded&quot; gamers within our
            community.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>What do we Offer?</strong></font><font
            face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Our unifying theme is that we offer the &quot;lone gamer&quot; a community to belong to.
            While in-game clans and guilds generally exist around six months or so, Dragon's Bane has
            existed since 1998 and plans to be around for a long time in future.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Typically, our members will play a number
            of online games and often we move as a group into the latest online world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We concentrate on those personal
            relationships as well as the games themselves. We have several members that do not
            actively play games. With the use of ICQ, Email, MIRC, and Message Boards we provide
            several ways to continue personal relationships outside the gaming atmosphere. When a game
            does come along that is good we generally get a good amount of participation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>So what games do we play?</strong></font><font
            face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            We have organized leagues at this time in Quake 3, Dark Age of Camelot and Neverwinter
            Nights, however, some members meet up together to play other online games as well. In
            past, we have had Starcraft, Baulder's Gate, Quake 2, Everquest and Forsaken Leagues.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>What do we offer the Gamer?</strong><br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A) Stability. We are old and stable
            offering a secure world for a player to add value to and not have to worry that if they
            invest time it will vaporise when the guild/clan folds in a month.<br>
            <br>
            B) Support: many members with good communications mechanisms (we use IRC, ICQ, email)
            means you can always find answers to questions, people to play games with and help with
            problems.<br>
            <br>
            C) Events: We do a lot of events. <br>
            <br>
            D) Security/Maturity: We offer a secure gaming environment away from the anti-social
            gamers that plague some areas/worlds. We attract a high quality of player, mostly adults,
            with a similar gaming outlook<br>
            <br>
            E) Friendship: We aren&#146;t about numbers or a specific game but about being a community
            so we offer friendship above and beyond the game. This has even led to some real life
            relationships and friendships. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Should I Join Dragon's Bane?</strong></font><font
            face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Due to the nature of our type of group, membership is not the casual adventure that an
            in-game guild is. There is a higher level of commitment involved in joining an OGG and
            even the joining procedures themselves are neither immediate nor simple form-filling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We represents a section of the gaming
            community that wants to achieve the most out of its gaming, however, those who would join
            just to be part of a &quot;bigger&quot; group, or who think then can gain some immediate
            gaming advantage from this, are not suited to Dragon's Bane.<br>
