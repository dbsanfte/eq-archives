            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After dealing with the
            holidays and another birthday I haven&#146;t felt much like writing. It was a sad year and
            I am relieved it is past We updated our severely ancient computer (which was a
            tech-challenged drama unto itself) and I guess I just got sick of messing with the damn
            thing. All our games work now but I needed a break from this tiny smoke filled study.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I dislike being ignorant
            on a subject and will usually try to learn as much as I can so not be AS ignorant.
            Unfortunately computers go beyond my tiny intellect. I took classes, barely passed, and
            cried in frustration most of the time. I do not have a head for computers. Let me put it
            this way, attaching a picture to an email successfully is a big accomplishment for me. Sad
            isn&#146;t it?<o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Anyway after a month and
            a half of online absence I have torn up my kitchen and have plans on the works for both
            bathrooms. The people who lived here before me and mine were an older couple. Apparently
            they were as wallpaper challenged as I am computer challenged <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>because the kitchen walls have been bubbling up
            for the last 5 years (not to mention being the absolute ugliest design). This past month I
            lost all control and stripped it off with a vengeance. Now as I stare at the mess
            I&#146;ve made I want to make it great which means dark rich warm colors (migraine
            friendly colors in other words).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ceiling
            is stucco, which is a moronic choice for a kitchen with a ceiling fan. Stucco is a
            cleaning nightmare. Standing on a chair trying to vacuum the ceiling with obnoxious
            siamese cats scrambling underfoot is an experience I would like to leave in the past. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I know the desire to game
            will come back when I am halfway through the kitchen overhaul. That&#146;s usually how it
            happens when you take a break from something you enjoy. Maybe it was the shock from being
            able to play all the games the old machine was too puny to handle. I was able to play
            Quake for the first time and it was only 10 minutes before I was squealing and screeching
            from frag overload. It was a huge leap from EQ&#133;.lol. I was finally able to log into
            DAoC as well but I just didn&#146;t feel like being a newbie right<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>at the moment. Larry called my attention to the
            changed models in EQ which I thought for the most part looked sort of silly except for my
            cleric. I might play her for a bit to see what else has changed in EQ. Not right way of
            course. I have a kitchen to conquer.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
