                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hey All, as you know, I have been
                hoarding money in anticipation of Spellcrafting. I have heard about a few other DB players
                that are also interested in Spellcrafting and Alchemy as well as those that don't have
                money to progress in their chosen craftskill. I have good news. I have reached the 10
                platinum goal that I had set.<br>
                <br>
                I now offer Firesing's metalworking skill to help other SP/Alchemy and other
                higher-craftskill DB members to take advantage of Firesing's ability. I therefore offer to
                pay DB members a nearly full value price for Darkness Falls Deamon Seals. The prices are
                Diamond 16 gold; Sapphire 3.6 gold and Emerald 1.3 gold.<br>
                <br>
                Please note that this is intended for DB members only and for the building of guild
                crafting only. It is expected that you will offer your crafting services for the good of
                the guild. If you have seals that you wish to sell, but not for crafting money, my prices
                are Diamond 10 gold, Sapphire 2 gold and Emerald 80 silver. Firesing can generally be
                found in Innis, but he is willing to pick up a quantity of seals, if necessary. Due to the
                flood of seals I may receive, I may have to limit the number that I purchase.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks all!</font><p><a name="Latest Level 50 Members in DAOC| by Panterra"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Latest Level 50 Members in DAOC| </strong>by

                BG as thats only where i been for the last few days :)<br>
                <br>
                First off lemme stat a Nature druid at 24 is VERY formidable. You get a HUGE pet that when
                fully buffed can be problems for a stealther. If a stealther is in range I usually sic pet
                and DOT then just walk away. the DOT can bring a stealther down to almost dead and the pet
                takes care of the rest. I even had a pet Tree that killed a stealther that wasnt dotted.
                My dot killed ylw con caster fairly quickly. The AOE root is a blessing in disquise.
                Several times i turned the tide using that darn root then DOTTING the casters and healers.
                I usually take Nature to 20 then dump the rest into Regrowth to get the insta heal. I set
                a personal record by getting 206 rp without a single death on my side. When u consider
                each kill is normally 1 rp, thats quite an achievement.<br>
                <br>
                Well, there I was. Some blasted infil jumps me. My pet naturally gets pissed while I start
                sprinting. Stealther breaks off to fight pet.....Heal poison, heal, DOT THE MOFO. Soon as
                I did, I get shot by some stupid scout. SO i tell pet to attack the scout meanwhile im
                starting to hurt but the pet stuns the scout. MUHAHAHA. Quick heal followed by Dot. Dead.
                SO i'm heading back to MB to rejoin my forces when TWO SB nail me. Pet gets one I start
                melee with 2nd. My health falling pretty quick. No fears though. <br>
                INSTA HEAL!!!! I beat one SB into a bloody pulp and sprint like mad. Meanwhile the
                stealther too decides to run. Mistake. Dot. Dead. I reheal myself.<br>
                <br>
                SO im sitting there and i swear to you from 50 ft away (game ft) i see a stealthed SB. get
                er pet. She runs to no avail (blue con). Dot. Dead. I run over to Alb side with the force.
                Get bored after 5 minutes and as im swimming the water, off to my left I see my stealthed
                friend again (stix). Pet. Dot. Dead. I go up to CK and med and AFK. 10 minutes later i
                come&nbsp; back and looking at MB i see me buddy stix again. Pet. Dot. Dead. Persistant
                gal isnt she? So im wandering around looking for something to kill. SB jumps me about 3
                minutes later but missed. Pet gets pissed again. I target and take a wild guess who it is.
                Yep, my buddy Stix. DOT. Dead. SO i run back to APK to see whats goin on there. Nothing
                much. OK <br>
                head back to CK. On my way i see noone other than STIX! Pet. DOT. DEAD. About 3 minutes
                later some CSR sends me a tell. &quot;We watching you&quot;. I stopped and was like huh?
                He said a stealther reported that u know where she is all the time. I sent back.
                &quot;Watch all u want but its not my damn <br>
                fault her stealth sucks&quot; Guess he musta checked her specs cause thats the last I
                heard from him. I mean this gal's stealth musta been like 1 or something cause u could see
                her from a LONG ways out. Kinda ticked me off. Anyways i became a celebrity there in
                Sharonn. People were begging to group <br>
                with me, and stealthers wouldnt touch me without some kind of backup. Guess I musta REALLY
                pissed of Stix cause she was back tonight with ELEVEN other Shadowblades. Take a wild
                guess who they ALL gunned for first. Quite a sight seeing 12 stinking shadowblades all hit
                you within 4-5 seconds :P<br>
                <br>
                Anywas Sharonn maxed out at BG. Ill be farming gold with Locutus/Locterra (get her SOME
                exp) AND leveling my NS (wife is thrilled at PLing my NS but guess who is more happy about
                it :P)<br>
                <br>
                Take care all and see u out there!<br>

                EMain with a couple of groups of Hibbies. We had just waxed a group of Albs by the APK and
                were heading back to the MG. We swung up through the treeline looking to bait any Infs so
                we were a good 100 feet behind our group. As we approached the wall I saw a <br>
                yellow Alb caster at the base of the wall in the SW corner. I ran toward him and he bowed.
                So stopped and targetted him with Ao, ready to root if he ran. Instead he walked toward me
                and bowed. Then he sat down, apparently OOP. He stood up and pointed at Ao, so I sat Ao
                down. He bowed at me, I bowed at him. Then I hit sprint and charged him. He started to
                cast, but got never got it off. I hit him with Fireblade, my Flurry insta, and he
                commenced to runnin'. Immediately two stealthers appeared and attacked me. I stood Ao up
                and started healing Hyts. I flipped on triple wield and finished of the Caster for 500+
                RPs, then I smacked the saracen and took a big chunk of Albion hide. The 3rd saracen ran
                for Ao, who got off his last heal (OOP) before she got to him. I killed the Saracen and
                ran for the first one. I got Ao's insta off before she killed him so I had full health. I
                smacked her once as my triple ran out, and flipped to my parry/evade combo quick bar. I
                parried her second attack and fired my three move parry combo, which took her to half
                life. We traded blows and she was down to a small slice of health when a group of hibbies
                came rolling over her. I woulda had her. All in all 1000 RPs, 3 dead Albs, and only 1 dead
                bot. Not bad for a random encounter at the wall.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a name="Natune| by Soreale/Strawbery"><strong>Natune| </strong>by

                Just some stories for Punish, Info for Cindy and couple pics :P<br>
                Next a couple stories:<br>
                Well there I was. Standing all alone at the Alb Wall with my ever faithful PanterraBot (or
                Locterra as she has come to be known lately). Suddenly WHACK! I get hit my an Infil. Hmmm
                ylw con. DEBUFF! SMACK! WOAH he lost a lot of health! Guess he thought so too as he
                decided to try to run. Hit <br>
                em again and he almost dead. But then another one jumps me. Ylw Con. Great! These guys are
                like roaches. Ahh hell I'm still 75% health. lLet's lock and load. DEBUFF! WHACK. Woah!
                Dude, ur dyin! SWING! THUD! Hmm that was quick :) Now where did that first one get to?
                Hehe anyways as I <br>
                get near the top of the lvls, I'm finding out Champs are pretty fun :) So later that
                evening, I see a Blue Con Sac BS a caster. I Blast her for about 150 as I run towards her.
                I reach her and draw out my trusty sword. But then I'm dumbfounded that it immediately
                goes right back into its place....hmmm wtf? There she is dead, yet I never saw myself hit
                her. Ok lets scroll up.......up..........HOLY CROW! 356 dam w/ 300 crit. WOW one shot kill
                :)<br>
                <br>
                Ok enough story time. The 2 pics accompanying this letter are of 2 different variaties. In
                one labled nakedbearhunt, I got bored doin so lvling with the &quot;homies&quot; so I
                decided to add some &quot;risk&quot; element :)<br>
                <br>
                In the second one, Alliance CLEARLY acknowledges my UBERNESS. O wait, Josi is the
                conceited one not I. Ok Alliance thanx me in that pictures for &quot;saving&quot; crunchy.
                Hell all I did was buy the wood and transport it there. Wasn't that damn hard espceially
                with a merchant right there in Crunchy. Did hurt the pocket book a lil though :P Anywas I
                don't take credit for saving crunchy. Elmo was working the doors, I was hauling wood and
                pissing off Infils on the walls (blast, debuff, snare...they hate that), and we had <br>
                a few good peeps out there distracting them. Its a team effort, not a single individual.<br>
                <br>
                Any how see ya in the game :)<br>
