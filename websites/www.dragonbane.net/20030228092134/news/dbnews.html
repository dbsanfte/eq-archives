                so no daoc tonight. Woke to get a shower and then rack out...<br>
                <br>
                Before that i did however move all toons to fin 1 and did some brief testing of my spells
                at fins with new spell crafted items (thank you Hammerthought!!!)<br>
                <br>
                My AOE DD hits on the fins for about 300 (Up from 130-150)per fin. When i joined, the grp
                said Wow and noticed that the fins were mowed down at an alarming rate. Plus with all my
                spec in arb (48+10) and focus (50) i almost use no mana per set of fins. This toon is
                really geared towards sheer damage now. I got half a bub in 48 in about 10 minutes.<br>
                <br>
                Should be fun, i'll look for a grp tomorrow and see if we cant do something with Indi and
                some others.<br>
                <br>
                Oh, btw, we pulled Fins Shroom style today for the first time, possibly in fin history :)<br>
                <br>
                2 high lv ani's spam out DD turrets, warden bubbles and a ment or bard confuses the fins
                till the bounce around and die from the turrets... was very funny to witness the chaos.
                But somehow it worked with minimal death to the participants.<br>
                <br>
                Btw, shroom style is Not a way to plevel, as the fins randomly hit people, so all
                participants need to be able to take 1-2 hits and live :)<br>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Due to popular demand, I have recreated
                the Charity Bot. The purpose of this Bot is to hold salvagable mob drops and donated
                monies which can be used by the guild crafters to skill up.<br>
                <br>
                I would like to see all mob drops collected during Wednesday guild outings, that are not
                claimed 'to be used' by participants, go to the Crafter Bot. But that could be determined
                by the participants on each outing.<br>
                <br>
                I will limit the amount withdrawn from the Crafter Bot to 20% of the money per person for
                3 withdrawals a day. This maximum could reduce the money by 50% per day, at most.<br>
                <br>
                I suggest that the crafter bot could be used for salvage purchase money as well.
                Specifically, if you visit the Fin tree and purchase 6 Firebrands for 75 gold each (or
                simply get them from auto-split), please feel free to sell those Firebrands to the Crafter
                Bot for 75-80 gold each. The net profit to the crafters will still be 70-75 gold each.
                Same goes for DF seals, Diamond 8g, Sapphire 2g and Emerald 50s.<br>
                <br>
                The Crafter Bot is named Dbcrafter and he is parked at the vault in AF. Please don't
                hesitate to ask me to log him for you.<br>
                <br>
                If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to ask me in-game or in email.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a name="Alchemy 1000| by Jockoo"><strong>Alchemy

                could not have done it without generous tips while crafting and super donations from
                people like Cmitchel, Arm, Demidron, Hammer, and Azthoth. Hijo's donation of <br>
                340g allowed me to get my last point to 999 before going totally broke :)<br>
                <br>
                What does 1000 Alchemy mean to us? Qord can now make** :<br>
                <br>
                All lvl 47 DD and DOT proccs<br>
                All lvl 40 and 43 armor reactive DDs<br>
                ALL potions<br>
                ALL poisons (including magical poisons)<br>
                All dyes <br>
                Most charges<br>
                All re-charges at a significant discount to NPC prices<br>
                <br>
                **For all Dragon's Bane members at cost<br>
                <br>
                I will make any of the &quot;instant&quot; health, endurance or power potions at cost if
                you provide me with the appropriate mob drop (Same goes for the magical poisons). The
                instants cannot be fired in-comabt like <br>
                the name implies, but best I can tell, they fire just like any potion (just drop to peace
                mode for a second) and provide full return of health, power, or endurance. They are 5g in
                materials + appropriate mob drop to make.<br>
                <br>
                For those of you that have not used any of the available potions, see me in-game and I
                will provide you with a sample to try. They can be extremely powerful in solo PvE or PvP.
                Also, if you have a toon, lvl <br>
                20 or higher, that is using a PC-made weapon without a procc applied to it, you REALLY
                should see me.<br>
                <br>
                I know many people are looking for the Holy Grail of Alchemy, the Armor Reactive Health
                Buffer imbue. This imbue is a 100hp reactive procc that absorbs 50% of damage taken until
                100hps of absorbed <br>
                damage has been met. Anyone that has used fast weapons against someone that has health
                buffer reactives on their armor, knows that they can be very deadly. Imagine trying to
                kill a Warden in melee <br>
                with these reactives on their armor!!! <br>
                <br>
                In order for Qord to make Heath Buffer reactives, he needs to get to about 1070 skill. I
                estimate that it will take about 15 plat to get there from 1000.<br>
                <br>
                Anyone who knows me, knows that I do not take donations very easily. I like to pay my own
                way. But, Alchemy has forced me throw that notion out the window. I WILL skill Qord to
                make the Health Buffers <br>
                with or without further donations. I have invested over 90% of my own cash into crafting
                from the last couple of months of farming. I have cleared my vaults and drained my alts
                and will continue to do so <br>
                until Qord gets where he needs to be. However, I can only make so much cash solo.<br>
                <br>
                If anyone can wait, and they wish to &quot;pre-pay&quot; for the Heath Buffer reactives in
                an effort to fund Qord's skilling, or just want to make a donation, it would be greatly
                appreciated (and I will try not to <br>
                put up a fight:)). For those that have already donated a plat (or more) I consider it a
                pre-payment on whatever you are looking to have imbued in the future.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks again for your support, Dragon's Bane!</font></p>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have received a few contacts from
                guildies asking about the cost of Spellcrafting an item. From the way the questions are
                being asked, it sounds like everyone is concerned that it will take hundreds of gold to
                Spellcraft each piece of armour or weapon or shield.<br>
                <br>
                Here are the facts:<br>
                <br>
                For a lvl 51 99% item, the maximum Supply cost one can incur is 60 gold**. However, you
                could spend as little as 3.3 gold and use up all 28 imbue points.<br>
                <br>
                For a lvl 51 MP item, the maximum is 66 gold. Again, it could be as little as 3.6 gold.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 40 99%, max is 40 gold, min is 1.3 gold.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 40 MP, max is 52 gold, min is 2.3 gold.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 30 99%, max is 20 gold, min is 70 silver.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 30 MP, max is 30 gold, min is 1 gold.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 20 99%, max is 9 gold, min is 40 silver.<br>
                <br>
                A lvl 20 MP, max is 13.5 gold, min is 52 silver.<br>
                <br>
                So, you see. Spellcrafting is really quite cheap when looked at from a cost benefit
                standpoint. It appears that about 350 gold will completely Spellcraft an entire set of
                armour and weapons for a lvl 50 character.<br>
                The cost of the armour and weapon are MUCH more than Spellcrafting.<br>
                <br>
                **NOTE: The prices given are for Supply cost only. They do not include Spellcrafter
                margin, high-con failure and losses, time constraints, quality specifications for
