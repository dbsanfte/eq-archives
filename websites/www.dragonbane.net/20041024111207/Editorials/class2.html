    Survey Results</strong></font></p>

    Well, ok, I was wrong. This drivel I spew is read by not three people, but eight! I guess
    it's always nice to discover that you're more than twice as popular as you thought,
    though.<br>
    <br>
    I wish to thank those that responded to my survey, but I regret to inform you that the
    data collected was insufficient to provide the direct comparisons that I wanted.<br>
    <br>
    However, it was enough to allow me to continue on my topic with a bit more information in
    my own mind. The information given to me shows that GENERALLY all classes of spellcasters
    can solo the example mobs at a much lower level<br>
    than melee classes. And, in some instances, the melee classes are completely unable to
    solo them. I had intended to draw up a chart and point out how unfair it was that some
    classes are so much more powerful than others.<br>
    <br>
    But...<br>
    <br>
    Somewhere between starting my last column and this one, I have lost the fire for this
    topic, and I apologize. People get too wrapped up in making levels sometimes. I'm not
    immune to that myself, plenty of times I've found myself thinking &quot;rangers
    suck.&quot; Don't let it get you down. Get out there and play! Hang out with your friends.
    Laugh. Have fun. Tell jokes. Bonk someone on the head!<br>
    <br>
    Every time I've gotten truly discouraged and thought that all the odds were stacked
    against my class, my friends have picked me up, dusted me off, and gotten me going again.
    They might not have known they were doing that, but they did.<br>
    <br>
    True class equality isn't found in comparing stats and who can kill what at what level.
    Equality is to be found in finding a group of friends that you work well with and have fun
    with. Let your strengths offset their weaknesses. Let their strengths offset your
    weaknesses. Cheer for their triumphs, comfort their tragedies, and enjoy.<br>
    <br>
    For those who are concerned about being the biggest, baddest, fastest leveller with the
    neatest items... Well, go out and enjoy yourself too. But I might advise you to slow down,
    stop and chat a while with someone. Bonk someone on the head! As the saying goes, it's
    lonely at the top.<br>
    <br>
    Me, I don't mind being in the middle, as long as I have some friends around me.<br>
