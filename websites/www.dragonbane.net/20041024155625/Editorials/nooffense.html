        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        This actually began as a post on the message board, but then I realized I had pretty much
        spoken my peace on a subject I felt strongly about. Therefore I'm going to jazz it up a
        bit and make it this week's column. It's not usually my intent to double-dip in this
        fashion, but maybe I just felt lazy today.... So let's get to it.<br>
        <br>
        Recently there's been much ado about Soulfires and other such lofty quest items and this
        incredible eagerness to help people obtain them. It's all so amazingly sweet that I expect
        to see June Cleaver passing out milk and cookies afterwards. (What we often get instead is
        Murial Mayere passing out cookies and booze, not that anyone's complaining!)<br>
        <br>
        But I wish to examine some motives. Is this massive rally of support truly out of desire
        to help people achieve the difficult quests of their class? (And don't go off talking
        about eagerness to help a friend, because we've all seen the posts talking about &quot;wow
        I couldn't believe so many strangers showed up to help me!&quot;) A desire to share in a
        greater glory perhaps? Or<br>
        is it simply because there's no profit to be made from doing otherwise because Soulfire is
        no drop?<br>
        <br>
        There's an odd disparity in EQ about what's no drop and what isn't. There seems to be no
        logical pattern to it, either. Some things that you would think should be no drop aren't,
        and others that ought not to be, are. A prime example would be the shameless hawking of
        Crushbone/Deathfist belts. The experience and faction gain for those quests can be
        extremely<br>
        beneficial at the low levels. Yet to all intents and purposes, experience and faction can
        be purchased. Hey, it's the ultimate twink: buy a few levels AND a good rep with NPCs by
        dropping 20 or 30 pp to buy a few belts. Just go to East Commonlands or Greater Faydark
        with all chat channels turned on and you'll see what I mean. The traffic for orc belts and
        shoulderpads is amazing. Personally, I also find it disgusting.<br>
        <br>
        And now, more about this odd trend of helping others achieve their class-specific item
        quests...but only when no money can be made from it, it seems.<br>
        <br>
        I know many rogues who can't get their class-specific Ravenscale armor because it's not
        quested for, it's dropped. Recently a rogue of my acquaintance camped the Avatar of Fear
        for almost 8 hours with an ad hoc group he assembled from people within the zone. His
        reward for organizing this attack? Nothing but pain. He watched 3 Ravenscale BPs go into
        the hands of non rogues who's eyes lit up at the prospect of the many platinums they could
        gain by selling this item. And who also had the lack of courtesy to openly talk about it,
        in front of this Ravenscale BP-less rogue. To add insult to injury, he was killed leaving
        Cazic, and what did he see when he zoned naked out of the Arena? Why, a twink rogue half
        his level in full Ravenscale, of course. This poor fellow was almost ready to delete his
        character in sheer disgust!<br>
        <br>
        Many tasty warrior items that you would think would fetch a lot of money are, in fact,
        there for the taking by any warrior willing to wait around for them. Go to the king room
        in Solusek B, you'll see what I mean. So how come warriors can get such amazing weapons as
        Painbringer(Trainbringer)just by being in the zone and going to loot it? Well, it's
        because that particular weapon is worthless to a non warrior because not only can't they
        use it, they can't SELL it, either. So why do rogues get the shaft in such an blatant
        display of thoughtlessness on the part of the game designers? Perhaps Ravenscale armor
        should be no drop, too...<br>
        <br>
        Witness also the Electrum Bladed Wakizashi needed by rangers for the Call of Flame quest.
        The Call of Flame could be considered similar to a ranger's equivalent of Soulfire as the
        crowning item/ability of their profession, short of gear from the Planes. Yet are rangers
        besieged by offers of the precious fangs required to obtain the sword? Not only no, but
        hell no.<br>
        Nope, the fangs are camped almost 24/7 by people seeking to SELL them. &quot;Hey, I won't
        help you get them, but I'll gladly trade you a set for that SSoY.&quot; (Granted, not
        EVERYONE who camps for fangs is out to sell them, but far more classes than can use the
        weapon the fangs give eagerly snarf them up) The EBW is no drop, but the fangs aren't.
        Weird, is it not? Why one and not the other? Personally, I'm thinking it should be the
        FANGS that are no drop and not the sword. Because by God if a person's going to have pay
        an arm and a leg for something they need, it should be a functional item, not lore<br>
        items needed to initiate the CAMP to GET the item!<br>
        <br>
        No, instead, these fangs, and Ravenscale items, are hawked for obscene prices and trades.
        Why? They're CERTAINLY no rarer or more difficult to obtain than a Soulfire. But they're
        commodities, and they bring out the greed in people.<br>
        <br>
        I'm sure there are countless other similar examples of quests large and small pertaining
        to all classes, but I can't address them all here.<br>
        <br>
        So next time everyone cheers and huzzahs for a paladin obtaining Soulfire, take a moment
        to think how you'd react if that sword could be bought and sold on the open market. Would
        you be so willing to help, or would you be overwhelmed by the thought of all the
        money/trades you could make with it if you had one?<br>
        <br>
        I suppose that being a ranger, my opinion could be considered biased. Well, think what you
        wish. There are countless examples in my history of me bypassing items I could have taken,
        and sold or traded, but instead saw to it that the person in the group that could best
        make use of the item got it, friend and stranger alike. (In fact, I also once gave up
        something very desirable to myself just to get that aforementioned rogue an item of
        Ravenscale armor) My conscience is clear. My bank account pretty much is, too. I can't
        help but draw a parallel between the two. <br>
