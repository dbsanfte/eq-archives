                    in coming. I have avoided it as i see people move on, or leave daoc then return after a
                    bit. I didnt want to actually email a farewell because i felt i really hadnt
                    &quot;left&quot; the game yet. But after many months of just stopping in to say hi to
                    friends, and checking the merchant on my house, I feel it is time to say farewell to DAOC
                    for Soreale. Heck i dont even know the people putting in applications now! <br>
                    <br>
                    I have tried so hard to not admit that RL has taken over my life, but.............. it
                    has. 17 years ago, i had 4 babies in 5 years, and changed double diapers (2 kids in
                    diapers at once) for 6 years........ ughh!! Well, Now in 1 month, those 4 babies will all
                    be teenagers. For the next 6 years i am going to have 1 or 2 teens at a time getting a
                    job, getting a license, graduating from high school, then leaving the nest (POUT, CRY) As
                    if this isnt going to be hard enough, I just finished potty training my little Joshua. So,
                    i cant call him a baby any longer. I want to hold onto as many memories as i can as he is
                    growing as he may be my last. They are truly taking 30 hours a day 7 days a week right now
                    of mommy time. So, cant do ML or artifacts or Realm ranks :) hehe<br>
                    <br>
                    It was an awesome 2 and half years i must say!! Thanks to all my great online gaming
                    buddies!! So many of you made it so much fun to play. I play for the companionship more
                    than the game itself so you are what kept me having fun!! CM and Panterra, thanks so much
                    for recruiting Oreale and I so long ago into your family! It was so much fun for us! And
                    for our kids as they grew into playing as well. Your friendship and companionship were
                    great. To my many hunting partners/farming partners/whining partners.....(hehe) Gelrog
                    (and all his alts :)), Valkarian, Barab, Jockoo, Arm (and all his alts:)), Dyrn rabits!,
                    Phlow, Rhymes(my favorite fellow homeschool mom :)) Wipndry, Padrig, and Odysseus, I have
                    missed you all and will miss you greatly until we game again!!<br>
                    <br>
                    I am going to try and make the fun even planned for tonight :) I will probably be late,
                    but am going to try like heck!!! Hopefully i can see most of you then :)<br>
                    <br>

                    Crafting (Level 800 Quest) Information for you!</strong>|by Skaull</a><br>
                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hello this is Skaull and I suck at
                    playing a NS. hehe. Now that that is out of the way I wnated to share my lvl 800 Alchy
                    quest with you all. Hopefully this will save other peeps time if they decide to do this
                    quest. Remember that I have only done the Alchy one. SO if Mythic has the WCing screwed up
                    blame me anyways. :)<br>
                    <br>
                    First off I talked to my trainer. He gave me an item to make. First important thing. The
                    NPCs ALWAYS want lvl 96 or better. Now the materials I needed were not all in TNN. Too
                    high of a lvl for newb capital. So one needs to plan ahead. I needed Carbide metal and had
                    to go to housing twice. Time sink. If you looking to get lvling tools and you want more
                    than one I suggest making batches of items. The quest appears to repeat. I have <br>
                    done it twice now and same stuff.<br>
                    <br>
                    So I made the item and gave to trainer. Then I had to make another item and give to girl
                    in MM. She had me make 2 more items and run them to 2 NPC that were in Ardee. Then it was
                    back to MM to talk to girl and then back to my trainer. I receive a lvling item with 19
                    charges and 8% add to crafting lvling chance. It took roughly 2 hours to do this once.<br>
                    <br>
                    NOW this is the reason for this email. TO SAVE YOU ALL TIME hopefully. You want to do this
                    quest and thinking you might need more than one item from it planning is key. Make items
                    in batches. Then repeat the quest after you get your crafting item. The second time took
                    roughly 15 minutes on NS speed. Also all 4 quests are given at once by trainer. So you
                    have to be aware of the thread you chose. Me I pick one and when going to the accept box I
                    back off to stop it. then I get spam telling me which quest I <br>
                    declined. Tells me the lvl on this. Then I just started it again if the lvl is the one I
                    wanted.<br>
                    <br>
                    I hope this helps peeps out with the lvling grind. Me I think it is well worth doing the
                    Alchy one at least. Each batch of 11 tries now cost me 343g at lvl 987. And that is with
                    using metal I salvaged. No real cost there for me. Thanks for your time and Happy
                    Crafting. :)<br>

                    kept count of as many fights as he could during the duels. As most of you know DBane put
                    it to Heart of Albion pretty hard. At one point we counted 14 consecutive DBane wins. I am
                    sure that we missed several fights, but thought the tallies would be fun to share with
                    you. Here are the results that we were able to capture (Note I only individually listed
                    those with a winning or even tally):<br>
