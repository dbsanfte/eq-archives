                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is for those of you who have just
                gotten the game, or are new to multiplayer. I have no experience in single player, I just
                jumped straight into Multi :)<br>
                <br>
                1. Avoid the &quot;action&quot; games at all costs. (Servers are divided into categories.)
                To get the full experience of NWN, join a role-playing server designed for low levels.
                (Would have a level range of 1-5 for example.)<br>
                Bad things about action games: DMs have no idea what they are doing. DMs give out too many
                rewards, which ends up twinking your character. All of the stupid people play on these
                types of servers, so you will people running around at level 1 with glowing swords, or
                people by the name of Tough Biyatch2859.<br>
                2. Learn about the class of your character before you create it.<br>
                3. we are all daocers so we know the rest :)<br>
                <br>
                I am fairly experienced in multi so hopefully I have somewhat of a clue of what I'm
                talking about. If anyone wants to ask me any questions about NWN, email me, <strong>Strokke</strong>
                at </font><a href="mailto:Strokke@cox.net" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">Strokke@cox.net</font></a><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">****************<br>
                <em>&quot;I'm having problems with lag when I play NWN - any ideas?&quot;<br>
                </em></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hehe depends on your system. I run
                a Tbird 1.2G @ 1.4, 512 ram, Geforce 4, Soundblaster 512, and a speedy HD.<br>
                <br>
                At 1000x700 (not exact resolution but I can never remember the EXACT numbers :P) I
                don&#146;t experience any lag at first. But after playing awhile, I notice it starts to
                get a little quirky. My personal belief is there might be a memory leak somewhere and I
                think we just need to be a little patient as Bioware<br>
                tracks it down.<br>
                <br>
                I had the same problem with Morrowind and it has better graphics. It used to get really
                laggy (IF I could even keep it running!). But they said there was a memory leak somewhere
                and when the patch came out I was able to hit 1200x1000 and now I don&#146;t experience
                any probs. <br>
                <br>
                NWN doesn't&#146;t have the detail that that Morrowind has yet I tried 1200x100 and things
                did get laggy. So in my opinion, there has to be a memory leak in the game somewhere,<br>
                <br>
                Some things to try:<br>
                <br>
                There is a option in the configuration to force 16 bit color mode. I don&#146;t mean the
                16,32,64 meg texture packs, but 16 bit COLOR. Its under advanced when u start the game and
                choose Play, toolset, dm client, etc. Goto config, then advanced. 32 bit color does make a
                system work really hard.<br>
                <br>
                Turn off all background programs.<br>
                <br>
                Change your virtual memory from a dynamically changing one to a permanent size. <br>
                <br>
                Change your &#147;Role of the computer&#148; into a &#147;Network server&#148; instead of
                a &#147;Personal computer&#148;. This will increase the Cache reserve.<br>
                <br>
                And finally the most important yet often neglected thing u can do is KEEP YOUR DRIVERS
                CURRENT!!!. Video card, sound card, Via drivers (IF u have a Via board), mouse, keyboard
                (for those with fancy ones), network card, and modem. Latest Direct X (non-beta) helps
                too. New drivers are usually coded to be quicker and more reliable. Even a new mouse
                driver might free up like .01 seconds of I/O time which in computer time can be an
                eternity. New sound and video drivers usually are made to be more compatible with games
                and new ones come out.<br>
                <br>
                Also, be on the look out for good buys. Pricewatch has some good deals
                (www.pricewatch.com). Watch the list carefully. The first item is not always the best buy.
                For example. Cost $120. Shipping $15. 6&#146;th item down might cost $123, but shipping
                might only be $10 hence u save $2. And although everyone always wants the best, upgrading
                a Voodoo 3 2000 to even a G2 Ti is a hell of a difference, Course a G4 IS way better, but
                G2 Ti are cheaper. Also be aware Voodoo went out of business 2 years ago so new OFFICIAL
                drivers are not available anymore.<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, we&#146;ll wait for the next patch and see what happens! If you have any

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the meeting last week it was found
                that Freeze was the favorite mod of several players. Last night, there seemed to be
                noticeable interest in playing the new Freeze Tag mod, Ultra Freeze. Originally, we had
                set out to build a RA3 team, but I feel that more people will do more playing with the
                team if it is a mod that they really like. I would like to only set up the server one
                time. So, I will put this vote out there as well......... RA3 or UFreeze? Personally, I
                will play any mod...... since I enjoy killing people in any fashion (hehe). But if Cyber
                or Puff say one more time that they suck, then I'm just going to have to get a hacked to
                beat them. You may submit your votes publicly or privately. Email me at </font><a href="mailto:nmartin@twcny.rr.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">nmartin@twcny.rr.com</font></a></p>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have figured out the rudimentary
                elements for a nwn game, when I get the module up and running and have taken my own
                character through it to work out the bugs I will send out the name and pw for our session
                this Thursday night (June 27th). time hasn't been finalized yet so if all who have nwn
                could send me the approximate times they are free we will try to accommodate everyone,
                Locutus will be playing and in the same room with me (Josidiah) who will be running it. <br>
                <br>
                I will have a BASIC run through with hack and slash Forrest dungeon type. I will be trying
                out different elements such as possession and NPC and stuff, so the session may be odd to
                say the least. You will be expected to make a NEW character for this game and don't expect
                any great plot or super developed cities. This will be a test and I will enjoy the feed
                back. <br>
                <br>
                Please know that if this goes well I will want to keep a server up and running, I think
                Wipndry was going to do this, I also know that there is a way (although I don't know how)
                to make a spawn time on creatures so the world can run without a dm. </font></p>

                different zones all connected, traps, monsters, npc (no scripts) some good drops and a
                semi interesting story line with some roleplaying BUT.......<br>
                <br>
                I went to dm mode, couldn't push the play button. Went into new game couldn't get a
                character to enter the game. Systematically deleted stuff inside the module and tried to
                get in. NADA. So after deleting the ENTIRE module I have restarted. I enlarged the area
                and think that may have been the problem, SO after 3 hours of work. I have to start ALL
                over again. Well stupid me for not trying the areas out as I created them.<br>
                <br>
                So for those of you out there that will be playing Thursday and get exasperated because I
                goof up on some things, just remember all the work I did for naught and laugh until your
                heart is content. :)<br>
                <br>
                I do have it up and running again and have the first area done, I will have the rest done
                tomorrow and will attempt to have Locutus come in online with the server name and pw, then
                I will email the info out, so check your in box on Thursday morning, I have not received
                any specific times for anyone <strong><u>so plan on 7 PM PST. I will be on at 6:45 waiting</u>.<u>
                I NEED anyone that will be on to be there at that time because the mod I'm making wont
                allow for individuals to come in late. 7:10 will be the latest to get going.</u></strong><br>

                interaction between divisions and friends of Dragon's Bane, and xfighter's clan-mail list
                was set up for intraclan mail, then I will begin sending all RA3 info via xfighter's
                clan-mail only............ so make sure you are receiving it properly. If not then go to
                the website and sign up for it again, or contact xfighter.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok...... so far we have a pretty good
                turnout for the RA3 Team. So far we have:<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cyberdragon, Puff, Sinseven, Wolverine, King of Evil, Bando, MovingTarget, Damnit,
                Janabear, Steelheart, Darby</strong>, and <strong>myself</strong>. I also hear that some
                of the 3vilution guys may joining us as well.<br>
                <br>
                We definitely have enough interested people to get this team off the ground. If there is
                anyone else out there, that is interested in playing on the DB RA3 Team, then left me know
                soon.<br>
                <br>
                The following members will need to register with the OGL at www.worldogl.com: King of
                Evil, Bando, Steelheart, Darby, Janabear, and any 3vilution guys (if you can pass that on
                to them KOE), and anyone<br>
                else who wants to play on the team and is not currently on the OGL. Once you are
                registered, then let me know so I can send you an invitation to join the clan roster.<br>
                <br>
                We have already been added to the OGL RA3 East ladder, and the RA3 Open ladder. I will be
                working on getting us set up on the Teamplay.net RA3 ladder as well.<br>
                <br>
                The power supply of my server fizzled. I am assuming that there was no damage done to the
                components when it went down. The new power supply has been ordered, so we should have a
                server after it arrives and I install RA3 on it.<br>
                <br>
                I will keep you updated on all team progress.<br>
                <br>
                <u><strong>June 6, 2002</strong></u> - Sandman<br>
                Starting tomorrow, I will be away on vacation until the 15th. During this time, the
                server's power supply should arrive. I won't be around to work on the server, set up
                meetings or practices, but the ball will<br>
                get rolling when I return. On Monday evening, June 17th, at 8:30pm EST, I would like to
                have a meeting of all of the proposed RA3 team players and any other Quake Division
                members that would like to attend. A new channel has been set up on mIRC Enterthegame
                server, #DragonsBane. We will discuss a couple of necessary changes to our Quake Clan
                rules, and also an issue that has surfaced about RA3. I would like opinions and input from
                Quake members and RA3 Team players. I will send a meeting reminder notice on the day
                before the meeting.<br>

                  this fabled land of Hib<br>
                  A bow unslung<br>
                  a cloak unfurled was all I had to give<br>

                  Like others of my archer kind<br>
                  I hid amongst the trees<br>
                  the sun shone bright upon my face<br>

                  <br>
                  But dark and roiling clouds assailed <br>
                  the courses gentle greens<br>
                  and Rangers from across the land <br>
                  glanced upward from their tees<br>
                  <br>
                  A midnight wave of undoc'd nerf<br>
                  descended from the sky <br>
                  it hid the sun blocked out the stars <br>
                  shaded victory from my eyes<br>
                  <br>
                  The prayers I prayed<br>
                  the words I spoke <br>
                  now rang hollow to me ears<br>
                  <br>
                  My strength decreased <br>
                  my quickness waned<br>
                  spite the vestment of my years<br>
                  <br>
                  Still confidant within my class<br>
                  I strode upon the field<br>
                  times and tactics these may change said I<br>
                  but Rangers never yield<br>
                  <br>
                  Neath sheltering boughs <br>
                  I stood en'stealthed<br>
                  and gazed at what I beheld <br>
                  <br>
                  My foes like, <br>
                  rabbits joined <br>
                  and seeded Emain with their yield<br>
                  <br>
                  Their skin now pulsed with <br>
                  eerie light 'gainst which <br>
                  my shots rebound<br>
                  the wounded revived with wicked speed<br>
                  and instas all abound<br>
                  <br>
                  With caution I crept around<br>
                  now searching for my nads <br>
                  I preyed upon the old and weak<br>
                  the kobolds and the adds<br>
                  <br>
                  A mighty voice then spoke to me<br>
                  and trembling I received <br>
                  the word from high <br>
                  like rivers waves come babbling to the seas<br>
                  <br>

                  find your team, <br>
                  and lend your eager bow<br>
                  A solo stealthers an evil thing <br>
                  as every caster knows<br>

                  Your glory days are over kid,<br>
                  we've heard the Albs' lament <br>

                  nerf your hide and make your melee shit<br>
                  <br>
                  Whine not to us<br>
                  the Makers said <br>

                  Still no new spells <br>

                  his sire too<br>
                  did sprint without a limp<br>
                  but here their heir<br>
                  in shadows hides <br>
                  a lone and unloved gimp<br>

                  despite the jeers <br>
                  tis a solo life for me<br>
                  <br>

                  Having said that, this game is becoming less and less enjoyable, and I'm find it
                  exceedingly boring.<br>
                  <br>
                  My opinions ...<br>
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately you really need a constant and enjoyable group of people to make the game
                  fun for a long period of time. Think of it like a card game. It's the same old game, but
                  the socializing keeps it fun. I team up with a semi-local group of players and we have a
                  pretty good time every night. We use roger wilco (voice) to talk, I can't imagine a text
                  only experience (yuk) and I think this helps a great deal.<br>

                  Check out the May 28th interview with Dragon's Bane. This is a family oriented guild and
                  something unique to the community I think. Might not be your bag, but it gives some
                  thought to how important community is to a MMORPG.<br>
                  <br>
                  A single player game might have more content than DAOC, but it ENDS, and that's very
                  important. DAOC never really ends, so you'll have to find other means to entertain
                  yourself. This is one reason I like the additions of new content, no matter how small, to
                  keep things interesting.<br>

                lumps and start swinging. So I F6 /stick F8 (triple wield) and figure I'm toast. Amazingly
                I kick his troll butt. He even threw a 25-30% insta heal (bp item?). I wasn't even buffed
                up. Look what his bolt hits for, and Ice hates his DOT. The big troll hits like a sissy.
