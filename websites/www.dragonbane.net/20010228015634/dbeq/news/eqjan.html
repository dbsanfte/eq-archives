                &quot;Hiya all! Just wanted to let you all know (for those of you that weren't there) that
                our guild event in Permafrost today was a lot of fun and very exciting! <br>
                <br>
                We had 4 groups of DB's and we all camped the King's area and we were on such a roll! We
                were killing ice giants, diplomat (looks like an ice giant), huge spiders, and magis (they
                look like ice giants too). We were killing 5 ice giants at a time and lived! <br>
                <br>
                Amun was the puller for all the groups and during one pull he fell in a trap. So he was
                using FD to get out and found himself right by Lady Vox. <br>
                <br>
                All of a sudden while we were talking to Amun about how he could possibly get out, Lady
                Vox sent out her priest and more ice giants. As soon as Zasc saw the priest he told
                everyone to run, that Vox was on her way. So some groups teleported, some ran, some gated.
                There were a couple casualties at this point. So then we all came back to the gate at the
                King's area and rested there and we could still see the ice giants through the gate. <br>
                <br>
                Well what happened next? Several of us got summoned by Lady Vox! Amun from his position
                could see us being summoned to her and killed. [What does it feel like to be summoned?
                Well you're sitting down doing nothing, then all of a sudden your screen looks all twirly,
                and 1 second later you see your body on the ground, with the saying &quot;you have been
                knocked unconscious.&quot; You don't even see who or what killed you or summoned you lol
                and you don't even see it coming!] <br>
                <br>
                Now we thought &quot;omg what do we do?&quot; hehe! (But it was still very exciting.) We
                got a necro to use his summon corpse spell (which costs 162pp per person) to come to perma
                and he was able to get all the bodies back! <br>
                <br>
                All DB pitched in to find the necro, teleport him, buy coffins, pitch in money, res, etc.
                It was truly a group effort to accomplish this and it made us feel proud to be in the type
                of guild we have :) <br>
                <br>
                All in all, the event was a ton of fun and one day soon, Lady Vox will learn that she is
                Dragon's bane!&quot; <em><strong>- Pantera</strong></em></font><p align="center"><a href="images/perma5.jpg"><img src="images/perma5_small.jpg" alt="perma5.jpg (44071 bytes)" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75"></a>

                &quot;Several of us in DB fought in Guk (Lord's room) last night alongside our allies,
                Legendary Heroes. This was the first time I've ever grouped with LH and they were very
                cool. There was no worry about loot or exp as both were shared by all! So I think that
                when everyone in DB gets a chance to meet or group with members of Legendary Heroes that
                you all will feel the same way :)&quot; <strong><em>- Pantera</em></strong></font></p>

                During the last three nights, several DB got together and hunted in Lower Guk. The members
                included on varying nights, Amun, Tamas, Zasc, Tammuzz, Ettore, Kalene, Aelen, Sharac,
                Burl, Mato, Dolgare, Pantera and Doloiel. They succeeded in obtaining so far, numerous
                serpentine bracers, skull shaped barbutes, two ykeshas, two shiny metallic robes and
                silversilk leggings. This hunt will be going on for the next week as well and all members
                are invited to join up in this group hunt late at night eastern standard time. Any items
                not needed by the hunting members are being giving to other members in the guild.</font></td>
