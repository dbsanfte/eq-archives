                Evoc</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">Tonight, the brave guild known
                to the Quellious server as Dragon's Bane faced the Wrath of Sir Lucan and braved the
                horrors deep within Mistmoore Castle! We started out the evening by helping Ishan slay Sir
                Lucan for his Soulfire quest. After the first pull in which Sir Lucan failed to race to
                his doom, we tried a second time and sir Lucan fell before us! There were no causalities
                on the raid except for the fair Silanea who was slain by the guards on the first pull due
                to one keystroke that she did not mean to make =( Our raid upon Lucan was successful, as
                Ishan got the component he required for his quest! After helping Ishan acquire Sir Lucan's
                Blade many of us turned our sights on Mistmoore Castle. Upon arriving we quickly dealt
                with the evil beings of lesser power which blocked out way to our goal, the castle itself.
                Upon reaching the castle we stormed in full force, felling any that dared to stand before
                us. Upon reaching the Bedroom, (and restraining Ladwenya from pursuing other interests ;),
                we continued to destroy all the evil that inhabited the castle. Alas, it looked like the
                raid would be over before it started, as our brave leader and many of our party were
                forced to leave. Thankfully, reinforcements were on the way, and the raid continued
                without Cmitchel and the rest! <br>
                The small band of adventurers, consisting of myself, Tammuzz, Blazz, Fistgar, Omen, and
                Synsear, fought our way through hoards of foul demons until we at last reached the Ball
                Room. Upon reaching this accursed place we cleared it of all its bloodthirsty inhabitants,
                and continued our assault upon the minions of Mayong! Alas, our time grew short, and<br>
                the evil grew strong, and in the end we decided that discretion was the better part of
                valor and Evaced. The only person to die during the raid was poor Synsear, who death
                visited twice. Luckily, the noble if somewhat femininely dressed, cleric Fistgar was there
                to Rezz her both times. The raid upon Mistmoore was also a success! Not only did we<br>
                vanquish the evil within, but we also acquired 4 treasures, including a Werewolf Talon, a
                Gypsy Lute, a Dimondine Earring, and a pair of Crested Spaulders!<br>
                <br>
                /ooc In short, both raids were a great success and a lot of fun. For those of you who did
                not attend you missed a wild ride =)</font></p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;I can tell you some
                  about last night. I played the ref for our side. DB had the East Commons Plague Village
                  base and LH had the North Ro Platform. Meeks was the ref for lh. It was a roughstart,
                  because there were many LD because of router trouble. Teeth was the first on our side to
                  get a flag from me, using his travel song. Made him invis and faster then anyone. We also
                  learned over time that he couldn't be rooted, which was a big plus for us! Kobes got the
                  flag first for the LH side. For the first part of the game, the teams were very even, I
                  believe as each side was feeling out how to do the best strategy. Score was 4 to 3 in
                  favor of DB when game was paused for LDs. When we returned, the flags had not all been
                  gotten by teeth...Kalene and Tanithelas had gotten flags also by then. So we were ahead
                  not only because of teeths song....but it was an awesome weapon!<br>
                  <br>
                  We started again and DB had used the down time to plan. Teeth again was there for flag. He
                  poked and flag given before LH even knew he was around. As he ran through the tunnel, DB
                  had members somewhere near me at the nro base invis. As soon as flag in was called, I was
                  poked again. Ishan, Brutalone, Tantithelas, Kalene were all people to get flags over time.
                  As I sat at the base , they (LH hehe) discussed ways to stop Teeth with his song. During
                  this time, we racked up the points....it was a wonderful stratigy that worked because all
                  of the guild communicated with each other and worked together. LH had trouble getting a
                  person even to their referee for a flag. LH was killed prior to getting there or just
                  stopped. My favorite flag grab was made by Blazz! It was one of the highlights. Blazz made
                  himself into skellie form and lay right next to me on the platform. You could hear LH
                  shouting who was<br>
                  in zone from DB, but they couldnt find him. Blazz told me where he was, and I told him to
                  wait till flag in was called. As soon as it was called , Blazz stood up and poked me and I
                  handed him a flag, with about 4 or 5 &quot;guards&quot; from LH around me. Blazz was off
                  long before Kobes and others knew he was there. They even insisted on a scroll back to see
                  if he poked me. Troubles we had were when members were waiting for flag turn in, they
                  would be seen and attacked, but this was minimal. In fact, after the game was over, and
                  suggestions were made, it was said that we needed to promote more fighting next time. We
                  continued to get points. DB worked together so well! Flag carriers told in guild when they
                  were close to Meeks and the next carrier would move close to me. It went like
                  clockwork....like we had practiced this routine for days. At 13 6 favor DB, LH
                  surrendered.<br>
                  <br>
                  We gathered in the tunnel...both teams....for a group pic and to talk about future
                  sugestions for CTF. Everyone had a great time and had many thoughts for next time. Some
                  wanted to do a dungeon...ACK. But the one thought all liked was next time no buffs or bard
                  speed song at all. Most, as I said before, wanted to promote more fighting and less just
                  running.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I made a mad Flag run with
                  Blazz last night! I used my old skelly form spell that turned me into a white skelly and I
                  floated above the LH base and let myself land right next to the person who gives the flag.
                  Behind two other players I dropped my levitation and just sat on the ground in skelly form
                  like I was a pile of bones - it was too funny because they had one of their druids saying
                  &quot;Blazz is on track!!&quot; and they all came close to the base to protect it waiting
                  for me to appear but I was sitting there the whole time! Finally I poked Ellise, got the
                  flag and took off running! It was such a great feat for me and I was laughing my butt off.
                  I made it clear back to our base and with the flag - and make a cap!&quot;</font></p>
