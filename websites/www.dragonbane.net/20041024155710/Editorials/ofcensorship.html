        Censorship and Stuff</strong></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The staff of this board
        has taken a lot of crap lately regarding censorship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
        &nbsp; </span>Let's examine this issue, as a lot of people seem sensitive to it. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First off,<span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to those who cry that their freedom of speech is
        being infringed upon, I assure you, it is not. For one thing, freedom of speech (and First
        Amendment rights, for Americans) is not what you may think. Freedom of speech as commonly
        meant implies the First Amendment, which protects the American's right to speak out
        against the government without reprisal. It entitles you to say something like
        &quot;President Clinton is a moron, and a hamster fetus could govern more rationally&quot;
        without fear that the secret police will kick your door down and make you disappear.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Freedom of speech does
        not entitle you to spew verbal/written trash everywhere as you see fit(Spraypainting stuff
        on buildings isn't freedom of speech, its vandalism). Newspapers, television stations, and
        yes, even websites, all have an editorial &quot;slant,&quot; a general attitude or tone
        they set forth in their official statements, actions and overall tone. Now, you could go
        on the air on a TV station, and if you say something they don't like, they're gonna turn
        the camera off. That is their right, its their TV station. When you get your own TV
        station, you can broadcast whatever you'd like, but until then, you have to live with
        their policies on what makes it to the public. You can write a letter to the editor of the
        local paper, and they may or may not publish/edit it ; again, that is their right to
        choose, not yours. When you post on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>message
        boards, think of it more like adding to a collage in someone's home rather than a place
        where you can spout off whatever you want. We here at QQ can and will delete posts we feel
        are contrary to the tone we want to set, or feel have zero substance value (I won't even
        go into the topic of posts with no substance value that are also plagiaristic).<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">I<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">f you want to create
        your own website to say whatever you want, that is your right. But when you use someone
        else's website, you abide by their terms. Things on QQ have gotten out of hand lately with
        people trying to agitate each other and provoke the site staff; all we ask is that people
        try to be civil, basically. That's what it all boils down to, really. Lots of cuss words
        and little real point isn't very civil. Saying Soandso did this or that, he's a scoundrel,
        weasel, thief, etc, isn't very civil, even IF it happens to be true. Personally, I regret
        this fact, but we have no way of verifying what is actually true, and what is not. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There are several other
        websites where people can and do say whatever they want, civil and uncivil, and they're
        not exactly hard to find. If you want to bash/flame/cuss your brains out, go there. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So this leads us now to
        what is a flame? To say &quot;Soandso ripped me off&quot; is a flame, even if its true. To
        say &quot;a gnome warrior in rubicite boots that hangs out in EC ripped me off&quot; is
        semi-flamish but at least you're not mentioning names.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If Soandso says &quot;I think this&quot; and you
        post back &quot;well Soandso, I totally disagree, I think you're wrong&quot; that is NOT a
        flame. That is a debate. The problem is, quite frankly, is that a lot of people couldn't
        tell a debate from a hole in the ground. And a lot of those who can tell the difference
        can't reply to a debate without stooping to insults even if they tried. Some people just
        can't tell the difference between name-calling and debating.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Example- Debate vs.
        Flaming/Namecalling<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Debate:<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Poster A: I think the
        shortsword of ykesha is the best weapon in the game.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Poster B: I disagree, I
        think the ykesha is an average weapon at best, I think the sword of morning is far
        superior.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Flame:<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Poster A: I think the
        shortsword of ykesha is the best weapon in the game.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Poster B: You're a moron,
        the sword of morning totally owns the yak you dumbass.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think that example
        speaks for itself. Just because a person holds a different opinion from you (which may or
        may not be wrong) is no excuse to call them names. Again, if you feel the need to flame
        someone, we at QQ ask you to take it somewhere else. That's what the official QQ position
        boils down to. It is our vision that the QQ site supports the positive aspects of
        interaction and makes people think, not that it becomes a battleground for senseless
        name-calling. If you think you can make a better website for the Quellious community, I
        say do it. If not, then please keep in mind that you're a guest on the QQ messageboards.
        This website exists because a few people were willing to work to make it come into being.
        Those people don't &quot;owe&quot; anyone anything, not even free airspace to be dorks.<o:p></o:p><br>
