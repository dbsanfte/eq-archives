              <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Endless career
                opportunities. Be a humble fisherman, a legendary smith, a friendly<br>
                baker, a trusted hunter, a superb tailor, a mercenary hiring your sword arm to the<br>
                highest bidder, a magician teaching other players powerful spells of magic, an<br>
                explorer telling tales of dungeons explored and exotic islands visited, or a fearless<br>
                clanleader, leading your clan to countless victories over your enemies </font></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Darkfall has all the features
            of its predecessors, meaning hundreds of combat skills/trade<br>
            skills, hundreds of spells, hundreds of different monsters to kill, hundreds of dungeons,<br>
            more magical items than you can shake a battleaxe at, vast wilderness, player owned<br>
            houses and castles, and everything you expect from an online roleplaying game. Darkfall is<br>
            highly geared towards player vs. player combat, and especially towards racial wars and<br>
            player-run clans conquering city states owned by other player-run clans. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Darkfall has six different
            main character races: Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Mahirim, Orks and Alfar. Each race has
            different political standings with the other races. The Elves are at peace with Dwarves
            and Humans, but are wary of Mahirim, and are at war with the Orks. Everyone hates the
            Alfar, and the Alfar hate everyone. In effect this means that Elven players may travel to
            Dwarven and Human cities without having any problems with the city guards, and may buy and
            sell in stores. If an Elven player traveled to an Orkish city, he would be killed on
            sight, both by city guards and other players. In Alfar cities, everyone gets killed
            anyway.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Darkfall has no traditional
            character classes, and no levels. The character advancement system is 100% skill based,
            meaning you learn a new skill or spell from an NPC or another player (yes, neat huh?) and
            this skill or spell is raised by being used. In effect this means that if you purchase the
            skill Swordsmanship from an NPC or another player, it is raised by wielding a sword, and
            fighting monsters or players with it.<br>
            <br>
            They wanted to give the players total control of what and how they want to play. Customize
            your own character to suit your playing style best, without traditional templates to limit
            your character. If you want to be an axe wielding dwarven fighter you simply pick up the
            Axe skill, Axe Mastery, Parry, Dodge, Cleave and other linked skills. If you later decide
            that some magic would be nice as support, you pick up a few magic skills and spells as
            well. Same goes for trade skills. Want to be able to create weapons? Pick up Smithing and
            Weapon Crafting. Want to make clothing when you are tired of battle? Pick up Tailoring. No
            need to reroll your character. There is no way to &quot;gimp&quot; your character by
            picking the &quot;wrong&quot; skills or spells. <br>
            <br>
            Get what you want, play as you want.</font></p>
