                thinking &quot;Gee, it would be nice to get a little DAOC time and maybe earn a bubble or
                two in the next few hours&quot;. The previous night, I had finally nailed 44.<br>
                <br>
                I logon at 11am EST, and low and behold there are some fellow DBers online: Natune,
                Jockoo, Art, and Soreale. Very graciously, they invite me to kill some pooks with them in
                CF. This is a rare treat for me b/c not only do I get to group with fellow DBers, but as a
                lowbie, I don't spend a lot of time xping in CF. Okay, maybe a lot of time waiting on the
                fins list......<br>
                <br>
                Before I know it, we have started a group at the fins tree and the xp is FLOWING. For
                roughly a solid 16 hours, minus a patch install, bio and food breaks, we xp'd. It was
                particularly sweet given the fact that DB owned the fin list, and we had plenty of db'ers
                at one time in the group.....<br>
                <br>
                EVERYONE ding'd (except for our gracious host Natune, 50 Druid, who was our healer
                extrodinaire!!). Special congrats go out to Soreale, who has achieved her 50! And I'm also
                pleased to announce that I dinged not once, but twice! Dalbin, the noobie hero, is growing
                up! Still a ways to go tho....<br>
                <br>
                So thanks everyone for the help! When I finally left at about 2:30amEST, Strokke and
                Gelrog (Grinder) had joined the fun and were carrying on at the tree with Natune providing
                heals.....honestly, it was pure torture tearing myself away.<br>
                <br>
                I hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving, and I'll see some of you on Friday!</font><p><a name="Latest Level 50 Members in DAOC| by cmitchel"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Latest Level 50 Members in DAOC| </strong>by cmitchel</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><br>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Just did some quick tests on test
                server regarding some realm abilities, thought some people might be interested.<br>
                <br>
                Long Wind testing<br>
                Normal sprint: 22secs<br>
                Long Wind 1: 26secs<br>
                Long Wind 2: 34secs<br>
                Long Wind 3: 52secs<br>
                Long Wind 4: 1:42secs<br>
                <br>
                With Long Wind 4, starting from the north gate, I could do just over a full lap around the
                TirNaNog loop.<br>
                I didn't have enough points to try Long Wind 5 with the char i was using, but I'll
                probably try with a different one once I get it copied over.<br>
                <br>
                Tireless<br>
                <br>
                Tireless 1: 1 minuscule tick (maybe 1 or 2% of total endurance) per 8 seconds<br>
                Tireless 2: 1 minuscule tick per 7 seconds<br>
                Tireless 3: 1 minuscule tick per 6 seconds<br>
                Tireless 4: 1 minuscule tick per 5 seconds<br>
                Tireless 5: 1 minuscule tick per 4 seconds ?? didn't have enough points to test<br>
                <br>
                I found tireless to be useless. The amount of endurance you get back per tick is waaaaay
                to small to be usefull. And all increased levels do is decrease the length to the next
                tick, it does not increase the amount of endurance you get back per tick. Useless.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Managed to test Long Wind 5: 1:42secs.<br>
                <br>
                Identical to Long Wind 4. I suspect it's a bug that Long Wind 4 allows you to run 1:42 as
                this is a nearly a 100%(50sec) increase over Long Wind 3 which is huge in my opinion.</font></p>

                Now for the Highlight story:<br>
                <br>
                Tonight I load up my 24 SB and head to Thidranki. I got my Uber Shamie buffs goin and its
                a ok night. Im killing pretty good but also dyin a lot (we GROSSLY outnumbered by
                Albs/Hibs. So i'm running around keeping tabs on the 20+ Hib Gank Squad and decide to run
                back to MPK for End regen buff (wore off about 20 minutes ago). I place my order (no
                pickles) with Halfbot and she promply delivers. I run out and halfway to Mid Bridge
                Albkiller goes down. He relays he was attacked by 4 Hibs. So I go investigate. On <br>
                my way I see tihs dead Elf then a Druid (no pet) and chanter (pet) go racing towards Mid
                bridge away from the dead elf. I see them disappear then notice the Blue Con Celt running
                in a tight circle around the dead body. I move in. ATTACK! He dies to my uber lvl 20 DOT
                and a couple hits (im Axe/LA not <br>
                crit). I restealth and await the Hib Zerg. Well that Druid shows back up. With the
                chanter. He rezs the dead elf caster. Then he rezs the dead celt. I move in on the
                chanter. BAM! Miss my rt hand (my Dot cause of BT). I stick on her and and Snowsquall my
                dot then sprint run. She dies to my poison while I got this Druid and Celt chasing my
                butt. I manage a restealth just in time. Reaply my poison. The just rezzed caster followed
                in pursuit :))). I turn and BAM (no BT hehe). He died. I sprint again with the druid hot
                on my tail. Restealth...DONT reapply. While Im moving back in the druid rezs the caster
                again. I immediately move in and BAM he dead again. Celt closes in but he's hurt. I
                restealth and reapply this <br>
                time and BAM he drops in 2 hits. Now the druid closes in and I evade. So i whip out my
                trusty secondary 2H axe with dot and miss. ACK. He hits me. I miss AGAIN. He hits again
                (hardly doin damage though). This time I hit and the dot lands. I switch back to my LA
                styles and he's falling damn fast. He insta heals to no avail. Down he went. I stroll back
                to Mpk and call it a night.<br>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I logged onto Bedevere last night to
                level my Zerker and Shammy. It was slow going, cuz money is tight, and my tank was wearing
                green tattered drop armor. I slog my way from 6 to 7 on a diet of blues and yellows, and
                head to Atla to train. While I'm training my Shammy, a level 4 Mystic asks if they can
                group. I figure what the heck, may as well PL the little guy. I need cash more than exp,
                so slower exp is np. We go out and chain pull crabs on the beach. Since the Mystic is
                levelling a lot faster he heads to <br>
                train lvl 5 within 20 minutes. While he's gone I stumble into a grove of imps, which were
                neutral to my toon on PC1 but hostile to toon on PC2. So, the zerker goes down. The mystic
                says 'don't release' and logs an alt, a 25 shammy. He rezzes me, and asks if I'll pass
                some money to his Spiritmaster. <br>
                I say, of course. He hands me 100gp and relogs. When his Sprirtmaster gets back he say
                'just give me 25gp, you can keep 75' ! Woot! We run to Atla, so I can get some decent
                armor. Man, what a difference. The three of us spent the rest of the night killing reds
                and purples. We all got to level 9 before I had to camp for the night. Pish went from 4 to
                9 in about 4 hours ! Turns out his main is a level 50 and has several Plat. I thought I
                was doing a lowbie a favor, but ended up with a 75gp nest-egg, and made a <br>
                new friend. Maybe I can get him to come play some on Pellinor, he's never played a Hib.
                All in all, a good night. In case you're curious, hammer/left axe hits really hard. I've
                had to double-take a couple of time when the mobs health drops to half on the first swing.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a name="For Spellcrafters| by Hammerthought and Phlow"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>For Spellcrafters| </strong>by Hammerthought and Phlow</font></a><br>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok today's tale comes from Bevedere
                Midgard. I play a 24 Dwarf Zerker (24 axe, 23 Left Axe)<br>
                Contrary to beliefs....Left Axe increases the damage u do with the left hand and NOT how
                often u hit...Also, please note I have a 22 Aug Shaman Buffer (10m end regen) Str 184, 736
                hp fully buffed<br>
                <br>
                There I was. Waiting for the 40 Albs to show up on Mid Pk (no joke. SB counted em all and
                this is NOT unusual against our average 8 mids).<br>
                <br>
                So I'm standing on this hill and suddenly im attacked by 2 infils and a scout. One infil
                gets his PA off but the other fails. So I immediately zoom into action. I hit f8 then hit
                my UBER ZERK MODE (lasts 10-15 <br>
                secs....100% crits on every hit) I open up with the first of my triple combo (starts use
                anytime). I hit him then hit my 2nd combo. He died. WOAH! nice (evil grin). I f8 to the
                2nd infil. 2 hits and he's down. By <br>
                this time im down to about 40% health. So I chase off after the scout. Luckily he isnt
                far. By the time I get to him i'm down to about 15% health. Hit him with my first move. He
                hits me (WEAK). I hit with my second in my chain. OOPS he almost dead. Unfortunately so am
                I. I evade his second attack and I finish him off. WOOT. Loc 3...Albs ZERO. I limp back
                towards my bot for some healing.<br>
                <br>
                30 minutes later we got a group including a very experianced Healer (Heals/mez/stun). Our
                group ends up finding 8 ALbs at the Mid bridge. I run up and unfortunately for them, Ozill
                (the healer) gets off a nice mez. Stupid Albs all standing in a close group. I stroll up
                to the Armsman. /wave. ZERK! 3 hits dead Armsman. I immediatelly pick another target.
                Vernnon is a 24 zerker too. He decides to zerk. Both him and I take out the group of 8
                Albs in under 20 secs. No Joke. It was funny as crap.<br>
                <br>
                Well, the other 30 albs didnt think it was funny as we ended up /releasing.<br>
                <br>
                So there I am standing next to my Bot and I get hit by an arrow. Barely moved my bar. So I
                stand there and let this scout hit me for like 10-15x. Ole Halfbot was healing me after
                each one. Well, poor dude ran out of End or something as he started to haul butt. I have
                Halfbot throw a DOT to prevent his stealth and chase him down finally catching him. Beat
                him into submission.<br>
                <br>
                Later on I come across a Lone Hero. We stroll up to each other, I zerk, and pound him down
                to low health in 3 hits. He mooses. BAH, NOT AGAINST THE ZERK! Dead moose. Moose Jerky
                anyone?<br>
                <br>
                As a Zerker on Bevedere Middie, I end up /releaseing quite a bit cause we are severely
                outnumbered. But I find this extremely fun. Know why? With my Ratbear Zerk, I ALWAYS take
                2-3 with me as I fall :)<br>
                <br>
                Only 130 RP left to go then its back to the leveling grind. But its cool. Zerkers are a
                blast :)<br>
                <br>
                My shadowblade is 15 rolling onto 16. He is actually a Shadowzerker (at 24: 18 stealth, 20
                envenom, 18 Axe, 10 LA, 4 CS). Ill have more stories on him later :)<br>
                <br>
                Only prob is the money :(. Barely making it, but a kind soul gave me 25 gold today so that
                helps immmensly (and several High lvl loot too Bracers/ncks/wpns).<br>
