        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">EverQuest is a social
        game. Most players will agree that the primary enjoyment of the game comes from the
        friends they make and hang out within the game. However, certain elements seem to enjoy
        the banditry and just plain rudeness of being deliberately antisocial. Amazingly enough,
        these offensive jerks tend to band together in groups. Typical schoolyard pack bully
        mentality at its finest, immune to shame, decency, and fair play.<br>
        <br>
        To illustrate this point, allow me to relay the experience of a young druid who confided
        in me. This druid was in Highpass Hold, soloing gnolls when no one wanted to take him into
        a group. At one point he wandered onto the ledge where the named gnolls spawn, to go turn
        in some gnoll scalps. As he traversed the ledge, a gnoll spawned atop him and began
        pummelling him, so he decided to fight it. At this point, a group of three higher level
        players camping the ledge proceeded toward him and began to attack the gnoll, eventually
        stealing the kill from him. These jackals stole the gnoll from him, which, on the surface,
        isn't such a big deal. But this druid expended a large portion of his mana to ensnare,
        dot, and blast this gnoll, as well as to heal himself after the fight, because even as the
        three were kill stealing said gnoll, it continued to pound on the druid. You didn't really
        think gnoll-stealing bullies would taunt it off of him, did you? So these three people not
        only robbed the young druid of his experience points and a few coins of loot, but they
        robbed him of his TIME, as well. Following this fight, the druid had to meditate for
        almost 5 minutes, doing nothing. Five minutes of his play time stolen for their benefit,
        not his own.<br>
        <br>
        When the druid protested their attack, these three yahoos (two of them members of a guild
        we shall call, um, the Disciples of Mental Illness) told him this was &quot;their&quot;
        area and &quot;their&quot; gnolls and he should go elsewhere. Not satisfied with that, the
        three became abusive and began insulting this druid's name, his sexual preferences, even
        his mother, on the OOC channel.<br>
        <br>
        Now our young hero truly was getting angry, so he challenged the ringleader to a duel,
        even knowing that this jerk was 4 levels higher and virtually guaranteed to defeat him in
        single combat. Lo and behold, the druid began to beat the stuffing out of this monk who
        was 4 levels higher than he. His spirits began to soar, thinking that sometimes good does
        triumph! Well, how naive of him... because of course, as soon as it became apparent that
        he was going to defeat his adversary, the rest of the monk's party began to heal and
        damage shield him. Our brave druid was defeated. Not defeated in the single combat offered
        and accepted, but defeated by lack of honor and sense of fair play. When the druid
        returned to recover his corpse, he saw a small crowd of people gathered around it, making
        rude gestures at the corpse and continuing to mock him. At this point, the young druid
        backed away before being seen and opted to log out and spare himself further humiliation.
        Even in victory three on one, these antisocial ruffians weren't satisfied, and kept piling
        on the insults.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, same location. Our young druid has recovered his corpse and is again minding
        his own business, quietly soloing gnolls in the pass, with 2 of the three bullies again up
        on the ledge. As the druid is recovering from a fight, a high level member of the
        Disciples of Mental Illness guild asks him for a SoW, because he has a long walk to
        recover a corpse in West Karana. The druid politely refuses, stating that because of the
        actions of Whatsisname, he's unwilling to render any assistance to any member of the
        Disciples of Mental Illness. At this point, the SoW-seeking player begins to threaten and
        berate the druid for his refusal to cast this buff upon him. Various threats of
        &quot;you've messed with the wrong people&quot;, &quot;we'll remember your name&quot;,
        &quot;this isn't over&quot;, and &quot;we'll come make sure you don't get a kill on ANY
        gnoll&quot; are made. As if this weren't bad enough, once the high level player left the
        zone (still with no SoW, bully for the druid for sticking to his principles!) the yahoos
        up on the ledge again began to insult him in OOC channel. Three strikes and you're out.
        These guildmates have not only acted rudely, they've embraced rudeness and revelled in it
        like hogs in slop.<br>
        <br>
        So let's think about this scenario, people. Firstly, when you're in a guild, your actions
        reflect upon ALL members of your guild. People tend to remember the guildtag of an
        individual who's treated them poorly, believe it or not. In this instance, apparently
        rudeness, threats, and selfishness form a foundation of this guild's behavior pattern.
        Speaking personally, if<br>
        someone were to tell me that a member of my guild had treated them in such a fashion, I
        would have apologized for the sake of my guild, and then spoken to the offending member
        and urged them to at the very least apologize to the offended individual. I certainly
        would NOT berate and threaten someone who already had expressed reservations about my
        guild. Hmm, nothing like reinforcing a bad first impression, is there?<br>
        <br>
        Secondly, don't be greedy with spawns. The servers are overcrowded as it is, and a group
        can have six members, folks. It's very disappointing to have 3 or 4 people wanting to hog
        a spot soley for the sake of them making the most exp in the minimum amount of time.
        There's limited enough places to go in the game without doing stuff like this, and the
        game isn't about who can level the fastest. For all you know, that person you shooed away
        might have been one of the most generous, friendly, and entertaining players you might
        ever meet in game. Let's not put exp making above the chance to interact and meet new
        people. And have the common sense to recognize someone passing through and being attacked
        by a spawn as being different than them trying to take &quot;your&quot; spot. In a word,
        SHARE.<br>
        <br>
        Thirdly, in the case of the aforementioned buff demander, no one OWES you buffs, not even
        SoW (or Ressurection). Don't go around demanding it as if it's some kind of right. It's
        not. Any buff is a favor bestowed upon you by the caster. After all, they had to purchase
        the spell, and they'll have to use their time to meditate the mana they used on you. If a
        druid or shaman cast SoW on everyone who felt entitled to it, they'd get very little else
        done. My advice to those SoW addicts who feel it's some kind of divine right: play a druid
        or shaman, or go do the jboots quest.<br>
        <br>
        It's the Golden Rule, just like in life. Many ways to say it: Do unto others as you'd have
        them do unto you. What goes around comes around. Karma. Lots of cliches, but the basic
        point is the same. If you insist on acting in an antisocial manner, don't be surprised if
        people you encounter are unwilling to assist you. <br>
        <br>
        If you're treated poorly, don't give in. Don't think that if the druid in our example had
        changed his mind and cast the SoW that all would have been well. No, it would have merely
        reinforced the idea that being a jerk will get you what you want. Not allowing yourself to
        be cowed isn't the same as stooping to someone else's level (and in this instance the
        druid did allow himself to stoop, thinking that perhaps he could outmock his
        tormenters...net result, he just made himself look bad to anyone who saw it on OOC). Stick
        to your beliefs, and be kind to strangers. You CAN make the world of EQ a better, more
        sociable place for everyone.</font></p>
