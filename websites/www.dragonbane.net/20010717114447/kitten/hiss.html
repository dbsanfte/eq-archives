            <td bgcolor="333333" width="523"><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First off I am sincerely sorry I have been so silent... May is a beyotch
            of a month for me. I hate mother's day and May 27th. Both of those days do bad things to
            me (curled up on the kitchen floor in the fetal position gibbering why me like an idiot
            for days at a time bad.) Mom was born May 27th and it went downhill from there. She more
            than dabbled in drugs, alcohol and men most of her life. This led to an interesting life
            for me, and the cliff/coles notes versions include such highlights as being dragged by my
            boots down an icy side walk by a boyfriend of hers, seeing her in ICU after getting beat
            up by someone who &quot;loved&quot; her, sewing her wrists back together when I found her
            passed out with them slit (luckily mom was also stupid and went against not with the
            vein), (and this is terrible but maybe that wasn't so lucky), oh and an incident with her
            plunging a butcher knife through a door I was leaning against because I didn't want her in
            my room. So umm yeah May is not so good a month. I needed personal time to re-explore me.<br>
            <br>
            PLEASE NOTE the preceding paragraph is not meant to show how evil all people on drugs are.
            Some people can do it responsibly as can those who drink (I drink). I personally don't
            care what drugs people do as long as their kids don't see it, or aren't affected by it in
            any way.<br>
            <br>
            I also learned on June 11th (and am still experiencing) what a truly sick individual I am.
            I am vehemently opposed to the death penalty as sanctioned and enforced by ANY government.
            That said I have been EX-FREAKING-STATIC since 9:15 am AST Monday June 11th. The day the
            most evil cowardly SOB since Hitler was killed. Don't get me wrong, you wanna be pissed at
            your government feel free. Most people know that I am opposed to government (gooooooo
            MARX, Karl not Richard) You wanna bear arms, have bare arms or arm bears feel free, you
            wanna print anti-government books, newspapers,<br>
            etcetera, knock yourself out, y'all wanna meet in a basement, barn, or cornfield and call
            yourself a militia that's cool too. What isn't cool is 1) blowing up a building with
            innocent people including children in it, 2) not having the <em>cajones</em> to stay in
            the vehicle while blowing up said building, 3) Calling 19 children in kindergarten
            &quot;collateral damage&quot;, and then 4) trying to make yourself look like a damn hero
            and misunderstood. His last meal was mint-chocolate chip ice cream - please send me email
            and let me know if you think this will raise or lower ice-cream sales in general, the sale
            of mint chocolate chip ice-cream or will the people that wanna eat it now to be like him
            be completely counteracted by those people who will never touch the stuff because they
            don't wanna be at all like him.<br>
            <br>
            Further on this note, there were 10 parents/victims a door away from him when he died and
            for about an hour prior. I truly wish they had all decided to go through that door and lay
            some damn smackdown on him. Also in the building were 10 reporters, his legal team and 2
            other people he invited, the warden, the doctor, the ekg specialist to pronounce him dead,
            and maybe 2 guards. I can't see the reporters or his legal team stopping the parents, and
            the warden wasn't armed - that leaves 2 guards Vs 10 people that should have been
            inflicting damage, and to be honest, were I those guards, I would toss the parents night
            sticks and close my eyes. Yet I am still against government sanctioned and carried out
            murder. Vigilante-ism ohh hell yeah give me some of that. He however &quot;needed
            killin&quot; and the government was nicer about it than any human would have been and way
            nicer than any &quot;dark elf&quot;. But ever since, I have not had a &quot;down&quot;
            moment. Any time I try I<br>
            remember a line from friends that was in a sound archive for &quot;worms&quot; ( a truly
            awesome pc and now console as well video game) &quot;Ding Dong the psycho's gone&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Obscure video game reference (feel free to email me if you can name where it comes from)
            Talangirl and King of evil the pic of your hamster in a food processor (the cover was off,
            the thing wouldn't start so all of you stop emailing the ASPCA or PETA) was cute but don't
            you think a microwave would have been a more appropriate dwelling for a hamster?
            &quot;Ding&quot;<br>
            <br>
            If no one emails where that came from I will give more hints next column.<br>
