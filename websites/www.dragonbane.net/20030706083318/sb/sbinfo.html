            We do not currently have a required contribution percentage or amount. We do ask that
            members try their best, within reason, to sell loot acquired while hunting to the vendors
            in our city. Our new city standard payout amount is 9% higher than the safehold rates so
            this should be good inspiration to do so.<br>

            If by exclusive you mean that only guild members will have access to them then the answer
            is NO. Any money generated from buying or selling at our vendors is cash flow for the
            guild to help maintain the city and upgrade. If by exclusive you mean that guild members
            are required to utilize only guild merchants - see the section above on donations.<br>

            What is commonly known as &quot;griefing&quot; - killing, stealing, or purposely reducing
            the positive experience of another player or group that is not currently KoS to the
            guild/nation WITHOUT PROVOCATION is unauthorized. This is also a regulation of the nation
            in which we are a member. Guild members should check with IC officers to obtain the
            political status with another guild before initiating any aggressive action. In situations
            where you are not the aggressor and are being attacked, the following guidelines apply:<br>
            <br>
            1.) If you are attacked by a player or group with ERRANT status (no guild or nation
            affiliation), you should defend yourself appropriately and with honor. Report the names of
            the offenders immediately to officers of the Inner Council.<br>
            <br>
            2.) If you are attacked by a player or group with ENEMY guild affiliation (that guild or
            nation is currently KoS to our guild or nation) you should defend yourself with honor and
            show no mercy.<br>
            <br>
            3.) If you are attacked by a player or group that carries the CREST OF OUR GUILD or
            NATION, give the offenders a verbal warning to back off and withdraw their attack. If they
            persist after repeated attempts to communicate your friendly status, defend yourself with
            honor. It goes without saying that a member of Dragon's Bane should be given extra care in
            this matter. Any attacks of this type are considered high priority and must be dealt with
            immediately by officers of the Inner Council. In a situation where another guild in our
            nation is involved, negotations must take place to determine their status.<br>

            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#B3FFFF"><strong>Any level requirement?</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            None currently, though as we increase in numbers we may want to set a minimum level (30
            comes to mind) for new members that are not prior DB or alternate characters or RL friends
            of existing members .<br>
