        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hi all. My apologies for
        being so tardy with something new here. There was much confusion (and effort from Pantera)
        getting the site moved. And during that period, I kind of lost the fire. Well, now that
        the site is up and accessible again, let's relight the torch!<br>
        <br>
        I want to talk about greed. Now there's many different things people are greedy about.
        There's been much discussed and debated about looting policies, but that's not really what
        I want to discuss. Specifically now I'm going to discuss greed for experience rather than
        the more common loot greed.<br>
        <br>
        I'm going to spill the beans about something that's really not much of a secret anymore.
        There's a severe flaw in the formula EQ uses to determine group aggregate damage and exp
        award. In situations involving ubermobs such as encountered on the planes, the system used
        by EQ fails. I'm not going to go into formulas and tables and mathematics. That's boring.
        But in instances<br>
        of mobs with 10,000+ hit points, it would seem that the formula EQ uses effectively just
        ignores most of those hit points, that the exp award goes to whoever does the most damage
        in the final 2,000-3,000 hitpoints or so.<br>
        <br>
        A lone wizard can, with a well-timed ice comet, KS a mob that it took 4 groups of people
        beating on. Not only CAN a lone wizard do this, they DO do this. And brag and cheer about
        it. In the planes it's very common for a wizard or 2 to be alone or grouped together,
        depending upon the number of people present. Lo and behold, it's astounding how often that
        wizard or pair of wizards get the kill and exp for a mob. <br>
        <br>
        Now granted, any group with a wizard could do the same thing, you say. True, true.
        However, most people just fight to get the mob killed. Then there are a small number who
        brag about being the &quot;KS group&quot; that sit on their hands while tanks melee,
        clerics heal, etc. 20-some other people actively fight this critter until this cute wizard
        judges it's sufficiently crippled for his well-timed spell to finish it off. <br>
        <br>
        In a day on the planes recently, we had 33 people present. Five groups of six, and one of
        three (the self-proclaimed &quot;KS group&quot;). Would it surprise you to learn that that
        group of 3 got the exp/loot right on about 2/3 of the mobs? They thought it was a great
        joke. Thirty other people weren't laughing. Thirty other people were meleeing, healing,
        and yes, dying, so that these three greedy jerks could laugh and giggle and call
        themselves the KS group. 30 people fighting, dying, and losing exp to powerlevel 3 people
        who thought it was a great joke and big fun to steal as much exp from everyone else as
        they could.<br>
        <br>
        That's just sick and wrong, folks. It's sad that the game's programming lets this happen.
        Sadder still that people actively seek to exploit it. Even sadder yet that they brag about
        it even after people have complained. I urge people to not let this happen. Raid leaders,
        stop allowing wizards to solo. Everyone, file feedback reports to EQ demanding that this
        formula be fixed to reflect the REAL group aggregate damage done. It can sure ruin a lot
        of peoples' days to endure a 12 hour day on the planes, dying and losing exp while a very
        tiny majority publicly brags about how much exp THEY are making. Greedy bastards. (And
        then some of these people left in a huff because they felt they'd been shafted on
        loot...THAT was funny) <br>
        <br>
        Stand up, tell these people what you think, and let's try to get this childish, selfish
        practice done away with.<br>
