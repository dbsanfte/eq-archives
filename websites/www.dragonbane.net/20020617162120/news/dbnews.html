                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok..... I have a team set up on
                Teamplay.net. All RA3 players will have to go and add themselves to the roster there. Here
                is how you do it. <br>
                <br>
                First, go to the website: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a href="http://www.eventricity.com/d?e=1" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">Teamplay.Net</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> Register yourself clicking on &quot;Join Now&quot;
                link, and following the step, using your [DB]Name <br>
                <br>
                Next log in by using the link in the upper right corner, and using your email address, not
                your user name. <br>
                After you are logged in, go to www.Teamplay.Net and click the link labeled &quot;Team
                Central&quot; on the left menu bar. In &quot;Team Central&quot; find the Dragons Bane team
                in the alphabetical list or just search for it in the search box. When you find the team,
                click the &quot;Join&quot; link next to the team name. You may then supply the password
                join the team and you are set. Then you should be in. <br>
                <br>
                I also have to make sure that everyone is on the dragonsbane clan-mail list, not just the
                dbane yahoogroup mailing list. Since the yahoogroup email was primarily set up for
                interaction between divisions and friends of Dragon's Bane, and xfighter's clan-mail list
                was set up for intraclan mail, then I will begin sending all RA3 info via xfighter's
                clan-mail only............ so make sure you are receiving it properly. If not then go to
                the website and sign up for it again, or contact xfighter.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">*************</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok...... so far we have a pretty good
                turnout for the RA3 Team. So far we have:<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cyberdragon, Puff, Sinseven, Wolverine, King of Evil, Bando, MovingTarget, Damnit,
                Janabear, Steelheart, Darby</strong>, and <strong>myself</strong>. I also hear that some
                of the 3vilution guys may joining us as well.<br>
                <br>
                We definitely have enough interested people to get this team off the ground. If there is
                anyone else out there, that is interested in playing on the DB RA3 Team, then left me know
                soon.<br>
                <br>
                The following members will need to register with the OGL at www.worldogl.com: King of
                Evil, Bando, Steelheart, Darby, Janabear, and any 3vilution guys (if you can pass that on
                to them KOE), and anyone<br>
                else who wants to play on the team and is not currently on the OGL. Once you are
                registered, then let me know so I can send you an invitation to join the clan roster.<br>
                <br>
                We have already been added to the OGL RA3 East ladder, and the RA3 Open ladder. I will be
                working on getting us set up on the Teamplay.net RA3 ladder as well.<br>
                <br>
                The power supply of my server fizzled. I am assuming that there was no damage done to the
                components when it went down. The new power supply has been ordered, so we should have a
                server after it arrives and I install RA3 on it.<br>
                <br>
                I will keep you updated on all team progress.<br>
                <br>
                <u><strong>June 6, 2002</strong></u> - Sandman<br>
                Starting tomorrow, I will be away on vacation until the 15th. During this time, the
                server's power supply should arrive. I won't be around to work on the server, set up
                meetings or practices, but the ball will<br>
                get rolling when I return. On Monday evening, June 17th, at 8:30pm EST, I would like to
                have a meeting of all of the proposed RA3 team players and any other Quake Division
                members that would like to attend. A new channel has been set up on mIRC Enterthegame
                server, #DragonsBane. We will discuss a couple of necessary changes to our Quake Clan
                rules, and also an issue that has surfaced about RA3. I would like opinions and input from
                Quake members and RA3 Team players. I will send a meeting reminder notice on the day
                before the meeting.<br>

                  A celt of pride I came unto<br>
                  this fabled land of Hib<br>
                  A bow unslung<br>
                  a cloak unfurled was all I had to give<br>
                  <br>
                  Like others of my archer kind<br>
                  I hid amongst the trees<br>
                  the sun shone bright upon my face<br>

                  <br>
                  But dark and roiling clouds assailed <br>
                  the courses gentle greens<br>
                  and Rangers from across the land <br>
                  glanced upward from their tees<br>
                  <br>
                  A midnight wave of undoc'd nerf<br>
                  descended from the sky <br>
                  it hid the sun blocked out the stars <br>
                  shaded victory from my eyes<br>
                  <br>
                  The prayers I prayed<br>
                  the words I spoke <br>
                  now rang hollow to me ears<br>
                  <br>
                  My strength decreased <br>
                  my quickness waned<br>
                  spite the vestment of my years<br>
                  <br>
                  Still confidant within my class<br>
                  I strode upon the field<br>
                  times and tactics these may change said I<br>
                  but Rangers never yield<br>
                  <br>
                  Neath sheltering boughs <br>
                  I stood en'stealthed<br>
                  and gazed at what I beheld <br>
                  <br>
                  My foes like, <br>
                  rabbits joined <br>
                  and seeded Emain with their yield<br>
                  <br>
                  Their skin now pulsed with <br>
                  eerie light 'gainst which <br>
                  my shots rebound<br>
                  the wounded revived with wicked speed<br>
                  and instas all abound<br>
                  <br>
                  With caution I crept around<br>
                  now searching for my nads <br>
                  I preyed upon the old and weak<br>
                  the kobolds and the adds<br>
                  <br>
                  A mighty voice then spoke to me<br>
                  and trembling I received <br>
                  the word from high <br>
                  like rivers waves come babbling to the seas<br>

                  <br>

                  done,<br>
                  You saw me far to late it seems, to throw a mez<br>
                  and run,<br>
                  You friends were near, too far I fear, to salvage you with healing,<br>
                  While off I go, a Bard in tow, two hundred realm points stealing;<br>
                  But O heart! Heart! Heart!<br>
                  O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                  Where on the ground my Caster lies,<br>
                  Fallen cold and dead.<br>

                  O Caster! Red Caster! rise up upon the realm;<br>
                  Rise up -- for you the rez was cast -- for you without a helm,<br>
                  For you some buffs and bladeturns -- for you the<br>

                  This grass beneath your head!<br>
                  It is some dream that on the ground,<br>
                  You've fallen cold and dead.<br>
                  <br>
                  Red Caster does not answer, he cannot speak to me,<br>
                  The caster feels no more harm, my sword has set him free,<br>
                  He lies there snuggled safe and sound, and till he<br>
                  stands atall,<br>
                  From nowhere I shall strike again red caster then will fall;<br>
                  Exult O bards, and play the lutes,<br>
                  While I with gleeful tread,<br>
                  Walk the field where Caster lies,<br>

                  Having said that, this game is becoming less and less enjoyable, and I'm find it
                  exceedingly boring.<br>
                  <br>
                  My opinions ...<br>
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately you really need a constant and enjoyable group of people to make the game
                  fun for a long period of time. Think of it like a card game. It's the same old game, but
                  the socializing keeps it fun. I team up with a semi-local group of players and we have a
                  pretty good time every night. We use roger wilco (voice) to talk, I can't imagine a text
                  only experience (yuk) and I think this helps a great deal.<br>

                  Check out the May 28th interview with Dragon's Bane. This is a family oriented guild and
                  something unique to the community I think. Might not be your bag, but it gives some
                  thought to how important community is to a MMORPG.<br>
                  <br>
                  A single player game might have more content than DAOC, but it ENDS, and that's very
                  important. DAOC never really ends, so you'll have to find other means to entertain
                  yourself. This is one reason I like the additions of new content, no matter how small, to
                  keep things interesting.<br>

                I kick his troll butt. He even threw a 25-30% insta heal (bp item?). I wasn't even buffed
