            </u></font><font face="Arial" size="2">The lineup of new pc games was one of the best in
            the convention's seven-year history! Below are the most impressive PC titles from among
            the several hundred on display on the show floor or behind closed doors. They are divided
            by genre and, unless specified, should be on the shelves within 18 months.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">Action Games</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">: Electronic Arts' <em>Medal of Honor: Allied
            Assault</em> was clearly a &quot;Best of Show&quot; contender for its nail biting WWII
            action. This demo had the crowd speechless as soldiers landed into the choppy waters off
            Omaha Beach.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Max Payne</em>, from
            Gathering of Developers, is best described as <em>The Matrix</em> meets film nooir. In
            this gritty thriller, due to launch in just a few months, players assume the role of a
            fugitive undercover cop framed for a murder he didn't commit. Boatloads of cool moves,
            weapons and sticky situations to get out of.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, Activision's <em>Return
            to Castle Wolfenstein</em> is another WWII based 3D shooter but with lots of fiction added
            into the mix (seasoned PC gamers may remember the classic 1992 action game Wolfenstein
            3D). Once again, players wear the combat boots of &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz who is out
            to stop the super-villain Himmler, his supernatural creations and of course, Nazis.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">Role Playing Games:</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> LucasArts and Verant's <em>Star Wars: Galaxies</em>
            was shown behind closed doors and, while it's at least one year away from release, it's
            shaping up to be a jaw-dropping online-only, massively-multiplayer role-playing game.
            Imagine the game <em>Everquest</em> but with photo-realistic graphics and set in the
            massive Star Wars universe. Absolutely outstanding and another &quot;Best of Show&quot;
            for E3 2001.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Earth and Beyond</em> is
            Electronic Arts' online-only space based RPG where players must explore, trade and conquer
            in a persistent world with thousands of other players simultaneously
            (&quot;persistent&quot; means all the events in the game continue to happen even after
            you've logged off.) In this intergalactic adventure, players can board their own
            spacecraft to engage in combat, commerce or both.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Dungeon Siege</em>, an
            action/RPG hybrid from Microsoft, is shaping up to be the true <em>Diablo</em>-killer with
            its easy-to-get-into-gameplay, deep storyline and beautiful indoor and outdoor
            environments. Players can customize their party to include up to 8 unique characters, plus
            a free editor will ship with the game so players can create their own worlds.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Other promising role-playing
            games are LucasArts' <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>, BioWare's <em>Neverwinter
            Nights</em> and Bethesda's <em>Morrowind</em>.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">Strategy/Simulation:</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> <em>Empire Earth</em>. This astoundingly deep
            strategy game challenges players to control a civilization through 500,000 years of human
            history, from the discovery of fire to laser blasts and beyond. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Microsoft's Sigma: The
            Adventures of Rex Chance</em> has an interesting premise: players use &quot;bubble-gum
            biology&quot; to mix and match parts of animals to create an army of mutants on an island.
            For instance, a beast with the arms of a gorilla and the backside of a skunk make for one
            strong animal that can climb trees. then send a deadly stench toward his enemies!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Other noteworthies include
            Microsoft's <em>Age of Mythology</em>, Electronic Art's <em>Simsville,</em> Blizzard's <em>WarCraft
            III</em> and Sid Meier's <em>Civilization III.</em></font></p>
