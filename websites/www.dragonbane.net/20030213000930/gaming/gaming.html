            <em><br>
            </em>Another impressive-looking online RPG on the horizon is EVE: The Second Genesis
            (a.k.a. EVE Online),<br>
            being developed by startup Icelandic developer CCP Games. Like PlanetSide, it's also a
            persistent-world RPG set in the expanses of space, but the two games couldn't be more
            different. <br>
            <br>
            Set in the far-off system of New Eden, players can create a character from one of five
            very different races. Starting out with a small ship, you can make some cash by trading
            with other players, mining asteroids, investigating unknown systems, or taking on a wide
            variety of other missions. Once you've got some intergalactic green in your pockets, you
            can outfit your ship with new weapons and equipment, as well as upgrading your own skills.
            There's even an in-game paint program that you can use to customize your space<br>
            chariot. <br>
            <br>
            While this would be enough to keep most players busy, EVE Online promises to run much
            deeper. Players will be able to chart their own career path, engaging in peaceful
            activities such as advanced research and cargo transport, or more volatile activities such
            as piracy and smuggling. Groups of players can even band together to form their own
            corporations. Of course, no space game would be complete without combat, and if that's
            what you're after, EVE Online promises to be chock full of it. <br>
            <br>
            Tying this all together are drop-dead gorgeous graphics and a fantastic musical score,
            making the world of EVE: The Second Genesis a joy to simply fly around in. The game is
            entering its final rounds of beta testing now, and should be flying onto store shelves by
            the end of March 2003.EVE takes place 20,000 years in the future. Humans have constructed
            a jumpgate in a wormhole named EVE. After many humans colonize the dimension on other side
            of the wormhole, the gate explodes, denying the humans contact with Earth. In the panic
            that ensues, many of the new colonies are destroyed, technology and knowledge lost. For
            thousands of years the colonies struggle and finally they regain all that they had lost.
            The only problem is that each of the colonies has formed different factions and races. Eve
            is a massively multiplayer, online game that lets you play as a member of five different
            races as you explore, build, and form<br>
            coalitions to protect your empire. </font></p>
