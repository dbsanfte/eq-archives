        I don't really have anything to expound upon at the moment, so I'm going to bore you with
        a few nonrelated snippets.<br>
        <br>
        First off, I want to publicly applaud a druid by the name of Geinie (I sure hope I spelled
        it right). The other night, Geinie was at the West Gate of Freeport buffing people. She
        was giving the deluxe package, too. For over 2 hours (that I know of) she was giving out
        SOW, binds, Skin buffs, healing newbies, and more. And in all that time I never once heard
        her ask for any<br>
        sort of payment, although when asked she did say she was hoping to finance her jewelcraft
        skill. (I slipped her a couple bars of enchanted silver after learning this) But never did
        she ask for so much as a copper. Geinie, you might not know it, but you earned my massive
        respect for your efforts, you're an inspiration to everyone.<br>
        <br>
        On an unrelated topic... Don't you find it annoying when people get into massive arguments
        on OOC or shout? And what makes it worse is they're not even arguing, they're just calling
        each other names. I don't know about you, but watching my chat window spam over with such
        brilliant witticisms as &quot;you're such an ***hole&quot; enriches MY playing experience.
        If you must speak up, do so, but if it turns into a heated debate, take it to tells,
        because odds are, the vast majority of people reading it are thinking &quot;wow you're an
        idiot.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        I've noticed a recurring theme in many of my columns. If anyone bothered to read this
        tripe more than twice, they would notice it too. And that theme basically boils down to
        the old poster &quot;Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten.&quot; Perhaps
        between now and next column I'll dig it up and shamelessly plagiarize it. Or, better yet,
        I could hope one of my 8 readers finds it and sends it to me! Yeah, now you're cooking
        with gas, Tamas! =)<br>
        <br>
        People, EverQuest is a GAME. I'm sure some might find that as startling as learning that
        Santa Claus doesn't really exist, I know. But it's a game, the purpose of games is to have
        FUN. If your idea of fun is getting into screaming matches, trying to humiliate others,
        and generally being a selfish, abusive bully, I might recommend you look into becoming a
        lawyer. But seriously; if that's what you consider fun, turn the PC off and go suck your
        thumb. And you might want to change your diaper, too(phew!). Stop ruining it for everyone
        else.<br>
        <br>
        Ok, I've filled a page with some words, some of them might even mean something. Can you
        release me from the headlock now, Pantera? Pweeez?<br>
