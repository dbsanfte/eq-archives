        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Let me say hello and
        welcome to the second edition of Soapbox. The first editorial pretty much stemmed from
        outrage and was just a vent session pounded out on the keyboard rather than upon the
        individuals who inspired it. =)<br>
        <br>
        Since Pantera saw fit to share my vent with the public as a whole, here I am. The mask
        comes off...I have previously been posted on this site under the pseudonym &quot;coolass
        staff member.&quot; Hehe. I'm Tamas, and this is my column. But it's your column too. It's
        certainly not my intention to always be honked off about something. If you have something
        that deserves mention, please let me know, be it praise or punishment. Email me, just
        please use the subject header of Soapbox. <br>
        <br>
        Let's get to know each other. I'm me, you're you! I'm not much for being shoehorned into a
        paragraph- I'm pretty complex. But basically I believe what I believe until proven
        otherwise. Which is not to say I won't listen to reason; if anything, I give people too
        many second (and third...) chances to state their point of view and redeem themselves. I
        got this fortune in a<br>
        fortune cookie and thought it suited me, so let this serve as the thumbnail description of
        me: You will be proud in manner but tolerant and generous.<br>
        <br>
        And off we go...<br>
        <br>
        Generous, you say. Can I have 5pp? NO! Go away, dammit. As anyone above the level of 2
        knows, those lower level love to beg. I'm quite willing to help a person in need, but not
        in greed. Most of the fun of the game comes from establishing yourself, the sense of
        &quot;wow, I overcame and survived.&quot; I'd not have nearly the satisfaction in my
        character if my sense was &quot;wow, I shmoozed a guy out of enough coin to twink the holy
        hell out of myself.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        New characters now have it so much easier than those of us who started on Quellious when
        it was brand new. Yep, in the early days of Quellious, young elves and dwarves had to walk
        uphill to Crushbone. In the snow. Both ways.<br>
        <br>
        But now trails have been blazed. Newbie zones are uncrowded (as opposed to 287 newbies in
        Greater Faydark going at it tooth and nail for bats. (Damn you, Pantera for having Strike
        at first level, hehe. Love ya!) Player-made equipment is inexpensive and readily
        obtainable. Fine steel weapons and bronze armor are freely auctioned everywhere at prices
        most players can afford by level 10 or so. Once upon a time it wasn't that way, folks. I
        know many people who were level 25 in hodgepodge armor combos that often still included
        entirely too many many pieces of patchwork. And if you want to<br>
        see a rough start, do what I did: play a nice medium sized half elf on a new server, in
        the Lilliputian world of the Faydarks, where 99% of any armor dropped as loot is small,
        and there are very few cats to be found (and those are several zones away assuming you
        know they're there, which most didn't).<br>
        <br>
        Basically, we did it, so can you. Don't beg. Believe it or not, someday as you look upon
        your character with pride for having survived, you may just thank me for NOT giving you
        5pp when you were new! (Well, you COULD thank me, but I have this habit of putting beggars
        on /ignore, muhaha!)<br>
