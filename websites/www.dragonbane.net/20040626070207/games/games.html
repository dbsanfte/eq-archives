            Playing Game (MMORPG) currently in development.&nbsp; Darkfall has most of the features
            one would associate with fantasy based MMORPGs, but also contains elements found in
            real-time strategy and action games. In Darkfall it&#146;s the players and their actions
            that shape the world. We provide you with the platform and the tools to engage in grand
            activities such as kingdom building, politics, strategy, diplomacy, combat, warfare,
            conquest, and racial wars. We also offer you the freedom and the option to not get
            involved in any of that if you don&#146;t want to, and to follow a path of your own. The
            world is huge, possibly the largest single online game world ever created. Besides being
            huge, the world features hundreds of islands you could discover and make your secret base
            on. As you travel across Agon you will encounter unique terrain features never seen before
            in online games, such as mountains ranges that rise for thousands of feet, waiting for you
            to climb and explore them. The setting of Darkfall is a fantasy adventure where anything
            is possible, with dragons, elves, orks, sorcery, epic battles, quests, and the
            never-ending struggle between good and evil. Calling Darkfall a PvP game would be selling
            it short. Of course there&#146;s going to be a lot of PvP combat and the combat gameplay
            will be as fast paced and fun as a first person shooter, but the focus of the game is
            kingdom building, clan warfare, and conquest. The battles will be epic and will require a
            lot more than just PvP skill to be won. Darkfall is as much a social, a real-time
            strategy, and a fantasy role playing game, as it is a PvP game. </font></p>

            <br>
            The minute you acquaint yourself with the white clouds and the eagles in the sky,
            you&#146;ll find yourself caught in the charm of a true 3D online game. Knight Online is
            the first game to successfully introduce the &#147;Party System&#148; in Korea. Raising
            your character&#146;s level, acquiring new items, and becoming the strongest player should
            not be all that an online game has to offer. We invite you to the World of Knight Online,
            where you&#146;ll find a player with better game manners may become more respected than a
            player with expensive items; in a party system where you help your fellow players to
            advance. A prominent and exciting feature of<br>
            Knight Online is the involving, persistent, large-scale war between players.<br>
            <br>
            When a player first registers and creates a character, he must choose between two nations,
            El Morad, the nation of the human race, and Karus, the nation of Orc tribes. The
            successful player will seek to join forces with others of his or her nation in order to
            obtain victory. That character may become a hero in Knight Online, through battle. He may
            also receive a title and reward from the King, become the lord of his own castle, and even
            rule over a city.</font></p>

            will differ from other MMORPGs in many ways. One of our main goals is to ensure that
