    We all know the cliche about the road to hell. (If you don't, you really need to get out
    more)<br>
    <br>
    Some interesting dialogues have taken place in the past week in response to my last
    column. &quot;Interesting&quot; is an interesting word. There's an ancient Chinese curse:
    &quot;May you live in interesting times.&quot; Sounds relatively innocuous, but it's still
    a curse. If only we could all be so polite in our<br>
    disagreements and yes, hostilities.<br>
    <br>
    I wish to repeat that this column was never intended for anything but good. Doesn't mean
    it turned out that way, alas. So anyhow, I started down this road. It's very hot here
    where I've ended up.<br>
    <br>
    The following is an excerpt from a letter received here at QQ HQ.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Over the past few
      weeks I've noticed a trend developing on Quellious Quarters. Particular threads are
      developing a masked (and sometimes blatant) negative and hostile tone. Some remain open
      for now, some have been locked. What's interesting is that the majority of posts that have
      required a lock were in direct response to an editorial written. Guaranteed, none of the
      posts began with a staff member initiating the message, and most of your staff have made
      the attempt to minimize the possibility of a flame war, but the fact remains that if the
      editorial hadn't been written, there would have been no reason for so many to passionately
      respond to it. It's hardly commendable that one attempts to stop a fight after they were
      the ones who (whether with conscious intent or not) initiated it. In regards to the
      non-editorial based threads, I'm left curious as to whether your posters now believe
      because of the editorials, there is an allowance to vent their own issues publicly.<br>
      <br>
      Masked anonymity is a dangerous thing. It's been written in rebuttal that no names, no
      guilds, no groups of people were ever mentioned. One could easily take the editorials
      written as fictional, merely providing and provoking scenarios for each of us to reflect
      on. Very true, very honorable. However, that's not the case. What is written about is not
      fictional. They are actual events involving actual people on Quellious. There are in
      excess of 400 members on your board. If those 400 members had only 10 friends they
      communicated with, that would be 4000 people who are potentially having a dialogue about
      the posts and issues being discussed on Quellious Quarters. Over double of what our
      current server population is. It's naive to believe that because names aren't being
      mentioned, that it's acceptable and people aren't being affected by what's written. <br>
      <br>
      This is a fact I can validate. I was a direct topic of one of the editorials written.
      After a few days of its posting, I received a number of tells from people who should not
      have known of this particular issue, who were not involved, and who had no true business
      knowing.<br>
      <br>
      When there are three sides to every story (trite cliche, but valid), it's a difficult
      thing when one entity of an issue has an open and public reign to express their view. I
      can completely understand those who posted in response, revealing themselves from
      anonymity, because the anonymity wasn't really there to begin with; not in whole. No one
      argues because they believe they are wrong. Whether right or wrong, people fight because
      they feel justified in their beliefs, their issues. Most people, when provoked, will
      defend themselves. How they elect to do so is a personal choice.&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This letter drew me up
    short. Never in my life had I ever been damned with faint praise to such devastating
    effect. The calm, reasonable tone got through to me where irate bluster bounced off my
    armor.<br>
    <br>
    Indeed, as the letter writer says, how people respond when provoked is a personal choice.
    I made my choice. I chose wrongly. Perhaps I underestimated how much other people talk
    in-game about their private conversations with others. Perhaps I underestimated how many
    people read this drivel I spew. Perhaps I thought people like this
    controversial/confrontational stuff. After all, millions of people watch that crap Jerry
    Springer puts on TV every day.<br>
    <br>
    What I never intended was for things to turn out the way they did. What I envisioned when
    I wrote my last column was pretty much this: me, knowing what it was about, one other
    individual knowing what it was about, and twelve people reading it and thinking
    &quot;what's that all about?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Never in my wildest dreams/nightmares did I imagine such a public outcry over this. Thin
    disguise of no names being mentioned or not, the fact remains that only two people were
    directly involved in the incident that inspired my last column. One of them (me) aired my
    feelings on it here, as<br>
    many read. I never once imagined so many people would be able to lock onto it and know
    exactly what it was about. So obviously the other person told a lot of people, whether
    before or after my column was posted, it doesn't matter. That was not a result I ever
    envisioned. Don't get me wrong, I'm not meaning to imply that the person I disagreed with
    was wrong to tell anyone else. It simply never occured to me that they would.<br>
    <br>
    I'm a human being and far from perfect. Due to my background I have in me a very strong
    grain of &quot;I don't start fights, I finish them.&quot; In this case it was a fight that
    never should have been fought. The term &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot; comes to mind. <br>
    <br>
    And so today, here and now, I use my public forum to abase myself before my readers. I was
    wrong. I won't admit to being wholely wrong, because I still feel I was not. However, I
    was wrong to base an editorial off one single event that was so specific as to be so
    easily identified. That was an abuse of my position. I really had no idea how widely read
    this was. And that, my friends, is as close to an apology as I can make. I shall be more
    careful in the future. If indeed there is a future for Soapbox. <br>
