            told them that she'd never wear the full-length leopard skin outfit from the video 'Don't
            Impress <br>
            Me Much' again. Yeah, they acted like I was nuts, and told me they could give me a list of
            retailers in my area. So I gave them my zip code, and guess what. When I went to Best Buy
            yesterday, they had 'just received' hundreds of copies. Hmmmm, they also had hundreds of
            copies of Shania's new CD. Coincidence ? I think not. They're just lucky I didn't have to
