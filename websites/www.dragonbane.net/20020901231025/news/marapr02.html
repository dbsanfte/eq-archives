                they did not have a chance. If we ever met them in the open.. they completely our railed

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well tonight myself, Pant, Wipendry,
                Tiktik, and Kyatico, and Strokke decided to venture forth into Middie territory. As we
                passed the wall, it came across that mids just retook Bledfaste. EH?<br>
                Dang we right next to that.....Well not long after we run into the one and only Darksong.
                Tik graciously<br>
                just laid down when the fight started. So i went toe to toe with him. 1/4 into battle i go
                OOE. Not good.<br>
                Strokke is trying to nuke him but after 5 straight resists Darksong decides Strokke is too
                ugly and kills him then turns back to me. CLose to the end Wip goes OOM but Pant still
                good to go. We managed to kill him :). Well we run back to Portal fort and tangle with
                about 10-15 middies. Dont get me<br>
                started about that one either. Long story short we port back to Middie. Well, we run into
                3 middies and proceed to chase em. Kill one. The other 2 ran into buddies of thiers.
                &quot;Pant speed song lets RUN!&quot;. So, on the way back to get Tik (who died again) we
                run into a few albs. Back to wall. Now we finally reach Tik, rez, and run up a mtn to
                rest. Orange con troll. We take him out but a red con sniper takes me out. I get rezzed
                and the dude comes back for more. Almost had him but i had rez sick and only 1/2 health
                when i started. While im down, the boys (and Pant) take out a troll with the help of a mob
                that aggroed the troll on his way to us. I get rezzed again. We move a lil to rest. Once
                healed we turn back to our first<br>
                resting area and lo and behold the whole Alb Realm is standing there!. I run like mad and
                get away. While im resting on the path, a ylw con backstabber tries to nail me (middie).
                Big mistake as i happened to stand and turn around 1 sec before she backstabs me so
                Backstab fails. She hits me for 45 dam. I hit her back for 200. She hits me again for a
                total (2x) of 89. i hit her back for 210 w/ 130 crit. She tries to run. HAHAHA bad move. I
                throw Sluggishness. Get close, hit her. then blast her out of her<br>
                shoes. I then run back to wall. Everyone either releasing or leaving so I go in search of
                the Alb army. Find them. I jump up and down a few times to get there attn then sit down
                while they hack me to death :). Tonight was very fun and we need to do this more often :)
                - <em>Locutus<br>
                ------------<br>
                </em>You're right we do need to do that more often hehe. Guess what, after all you guys
                logged, Storm and I, I being Tiktik of course, went back to bad ole midland on our own. We
                get to the wall all safe and sound, head down the path to about where we met Darksong near
                the road to Bledmeer. Lo and Behold, we spot a orange con troll named Hallek, well being
                who we are and being in the same room, &quot;I see Troll&quot; &quot; where where&quot;
                &quot;over here&quot; &quot; got im, lets get im&quot; &quot;ok&quot;. I proceed to crit
                shot an orange con Troll, hes in attack mode so crit fails and I hit im for 148 damage,
                get one more shot off, and he blocks me. At this point he thinks its only me, and being
                the good lil ranger I am was by a tree when I shot at him. So here I am lil 2 foot tall
                Tik and a 100 ft Troll running at me. Heres where it get kinda funny, I know Storm has a
                bead on him, so I proceed to run circles around the tree with Troll in tow, I am laughing,
                becuase the Troll cannot hit me while im in ring around the rosy mode (this is a tested
                and approved method by us =)). By this time Storm is pumping arrows into this guy, and hes
                goin ???? im gettin hit still, and I cant catch this ring around the rosy Lurk. So he
                proceeds to try and hit Storm with his big bad sword. Well of course I then start to pelt
                him with arrows. Again Troll is confused as to who he should kill, so he comes back to me,
                again, I run around the tree laughing with glee while Storm pumps still more arrows into
                this poor Troll. <br>
                Even after all these arrows, hes still at about 1/4 health left and he decides to run
                towards Bledmeer. Try to get shots off, but outa range, so now 2 40 pound lurks are
                hauling across the snow at top speed chasing a 2 ton Troll. I stop with a fraction of end
                left to try and shoot him, ack hes outa range, Storm gets one more shot into him and we
                proceed to chase normal speed, Troll is slow and getting dangerously close to Bledmeer
                guards, try to get one more arrow into him..............arg, too far away, Hallek escapes
                with his life, but not after getting a lesson in Lurikeen hunting tactics =).<br>
                <br>
                We then wait around for him to return, we see him come back from the opposite way looking
                for us, but we are split up and not in position to try take him out, we try to keep up
                with him in stealth to no avail. So, we decide to head to uppland. <br>
                <br>
                We are stealthing up to the zone wall just passed the giant, when Storm gets stuck in a
                TREE!! LOL, I was like &quot;get outa there&quot; &quot;I cant I cant&quot;. So /stuck and
                we are on our way. We get to the Crabs near the frontier gates, and no sign of any Middies
                anywhere. So we head down to the road to the gates. AHHHH!!! Middies!!! There are about 10
                at the road intersection near the keep, yellow to purple cons, looking for someone else
                apparently in the area with the same idea we had. Well dang, theres too many of them, lets
                run back up the hill buff and come back down. We get back to the road, and of course, they
                are all gone. I proceed as close to the gate as I can get, while Storm hiding behind a
                tree little ways down the road. &quot;The gates opening&quot; &quot;ok cool, what is
                it&quot; &quot;dunno yet, wait, hehe its a green con Kobold, Im gonna get him.......Ack he
                stealthed&quot; &quot;doh&quot;. I head onto the road, and sure nuf, uncovered him, altho
                he doesnt see me. He proceeds to attack a beetle. Being the kind gentle person that I am,
                I wait patiently while he finishes off the mob, exp death stinks ya know, but Storm says
                &quot; Im gonna kill im&quot; and does =). Poor little Kobold never knew what hit him.
                Fortunately for him no grave when he releases.<br>
                <br>
                At this point its kind quiet, we watch the road, see a few reds run along the road
                &quot;tank types, red con tank types r bad&quot; so we stay away. Few minutes and a rebuff
                later, Bloodsong is running towards the gates, we are at the last possible tree near the
                gate and proceed to unload a vicious volley of arrows onto her, but she is to fast and
                gets to the safety of the guards and out of range. Well then along comes Creepyeye, blue
                con to me, yellow to Storm, hes a Troll zerker. Again a barrage of arrows, and yep you
                guessed it, one dead Troll, Bloodsong runs out to try heal and help him, oooo, big
                mistake, and she pays the ultimate price. After this little bit of action we decide to
                move a bit away from the gates and see what developes. Well Bloodsong and Creepyeye hadnt
                had enough. They came back, to Storm and&nbsp; I's joy. We let them run around a bit, and
                finally they get close. Well a blue Troll and a Yellow con healer arent much of a match
                for us. Creepyeye goes down first, within 2 shots, and Bloodsong in her confusion of where
                we are never even saw the arrows coming I dont think =). There they lay dead again!!<br>
                <br>
                Now the story takes a turn again to the lighter side. Storm gets a tell from Spleenripper
                &quot;BOO!!&quot; Storm says &quot;huh?&quot; &quot;I am right behind you heeh&quot;. Ah a
                44 Shade to add to the mayhem, altho hes looking for death soon so he can log. At this
                time out comes Legoalath. I think he lives at the uppland gates as Storm and I have had
                encounters with him almost everytime we go there hehe. He is a red con at 38 thane, baaad
                news for us as we have found we cannot kill him before he kills one of us. Being the
                vengeful kinda guy he is =). Storm says, &quot;im gonna take him out&quot; &quot;wait
                wait&quot; I say as I am not in a position to help him. &quot;Ok im ready when you
                are.&quot; Well Storm proceeds to die, as I am pumping arrows into Legoalath. Hes only
                about half dead, well survival is a strong instinct hehe, so RUN for my life!! I elude
                him, which one on one isnt that hard. Minute or so later I return to Storms corpse, which
                is near Creepyeyes corpse still, Bloodsong released. There is Legoalath Jumping all over
                Storms body...GRRRRR!!! If only I was level 45 Id show him!! Alas I am not, so I watch
                Helplessly as Storm gets his corpse mutilated. <br>
                <br>
                Another minute passes, and a healer comes by, yellow con, cant member name now, but he
                proceeds to rez Creepyeye, with Legoalath entertaining himself with Storm nearby. Well we
                cant have that can we. You guessed it, Creepyeye lasted about 3 seconds alive =). Well
                being it was a single shot kill, I dont even move, and restealth. Silly healer gonna rez
                him again. So I think &quot;Ok, you next then&quot;. He would have been too, but Creepy
                decides hes gonna join in the fun and mutilate Storm also. HAHAHA, silly Troll cant do
                that. One 388 damage crit shot later, Creepy is again taking a dirtnap, this time smackdab
                on top of Storm. This time I decide I better move to a little different spot to take out
                the rezzer, when I hear scuffling below me, Spleenripper has attacked Legoalath. Ack wish
                hed have told me, I draw a bead on Legoalath who is down to about 1/4 health....I
                miss....grrr...draw back again, Spleenipper then proceeds to get his Spleen ripped out by
                Legoalath, well I will have the last laugh as my arrow flies true to the mark and
                Legoalath is dirtnapping by my good friend Storm and that smelly Troll Creepy.<br>
                <br>
                Well wouldnt ya know it, I go LD.....aaarrggghhh. Storm has released as well as
                Spleenripper, everyone else is gone or out of sight. I wander around a bit and see an
                orange con Norse on the road without his clothes on...yeah right, like im that stupid. Hes
                bait, and im not biting. Well sure enough after watching the orange Norse dance and jump
                and make a fool O himself. Legoalath comes out from behind a tree. Ah sneaky guys. NOT!!
                Well they decide they are going to see if I am up at the Crabs. I say to Storm, ya know,
                that green con Kobold we killed earlier, did something to your corpse too, now that I
                think about it, he needs to pay like Creepy and Lego did. Maybe he will show his lil face.
                Wow, lady luck shinin on me tonight, as I am watching the gates, I can see all the guards,
                thats how close I am, What do I see....a lil Green con Kobold, same one from
                before....&lt;huge grin&gt;. Well he is green con, took 2 regular shots cause he was
                runnin in attack mode but hit for over 600 dam in those shots hehe. Poor little guy,
                payback is a Bit#$. Well now they know I am still in the area, sure enough, 3 come down
                from the Crabs, Legoalath, Skane and the now dressed Norse Muninn. Well 2 reds and an
                orange against lil ol me, isnt very fair. So I decide to see how close to the guards I can
                get stealthed. I inch my way forward, and not more than 5 steps from where I killed that
                poor lil Kobold, Tiktik......BOOM!!!! Thats right, Tiktik go boom. The Runemasters up on
                the ledge near the zone wall, whom I dont ever remember being there..hmmm, made a nice
                crispy critter outa me.<br>
                <br>
                I hope to share many more episodes like these, and the one Loc outlined earlier, with my
                guildmates and friends. Man is it a blast. Well signing off for now, just thought id share
                this with ya.<br>
                <br>
                P.S. It may not seem like it the way I wrote it, but wanted to let you know, that when I
                shot Creepy for the second time in less than 5 minutes for jumpin on Storm, we both bout
                fell outa our chairs laughin, and Storm gets a tell from Spleen &quot;ROFLMAO&quot; It
                really was funny.=) - <em>Tiktik</em></font></p>

                (the first ever!) and unfortunately it wasn't successful.Well some idiot decided it would

                attacking us at the time). All in all the raid was a success and fun. Doing warshades
                before they got there was great because we got exp from that and then exp from all the

                <br>
                Today is the day many people have been waiting for. If you haven't already heard, the
                TOURNAMENT STARTS TODAY!!!<br>
                <br>
                Just a few things you should know...<br>
                <br>
                1) Schedule information will be posted a the very least a week earlier than the scheduled
                matches at http://tourney.q3id.com/schedule<br>
                <br>
                2) Results will be posted as soon as they come in at http://tourney.q3id.com/standings<br>
                <br>
                3) Make sure you check the schedule yourself, we won't be reminding teams of their
                schedule via email.<br>
                <br>
                4) Take a look in our forum once in a while for some updated information on Rules. In
                particular, please read the &quot;Referee Responsabilities&quot; topic in our
                &quot;General Forum&quot; at http://www.q3id.com/forum<br>
                <br>
                5) There will be a password to enter all Tournament servers. <br>
                <br>
                If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. We should be available by any of
                the following means:<br>
