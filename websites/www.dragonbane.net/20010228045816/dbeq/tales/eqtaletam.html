              </strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nay, friend, I
              appreciate your offer of an ale, but I think I'll stick to this cider; spirits and I just
              don't get along. And you can take THAT multiple ways... Which reminds me of an adventure I
              had in the Lesser Fay in my youth. But before I begin, let me just say that I'm not your
              usual Ranger sort. I'm a terrible shot with a bow, in fact I don't even own one. My sense
              of direction's none too keen and my nightsight is dimmer than most. Truth be known, my
              blood runs thicker with human than elven stock. I've been told my temperament is more
              suited to a Paladin than a Ranger, but my social standing wouldn't allow that. That said,
              I will tell my tale; twas the most wondrous thing I've ever seen and I've traveled most of
              the lands of Norrath in my day. I had only recently been instructed in the arts of magic
              by my mentor, Dill Fireshine, I was so green. I was exploring the forests of the Lesser
              Faydarks alone, and in the midst of a most furious downpour I became hopelessly lost. I
              observed a faint glimmer in the distance and approached it hoping to find shelter and
              perhaps even a hot meal. Oh, but curse my luck, that light which drew me was the blighted
              witchglow of some cursed Necromantic altar abandoned Tunare only knows when. I had no
              sooner gotten a good glimpse of it during a bright lightning flash than my guts turned to
              jelly. Running up the hill at me was a foul abomination of the undead, all red-glowing
              eyes and insatiable hunger for living flesh. I didn't hear it's hungry mutterings until it
              was upon me, but I could clearly smell its foul stench even over the moldy wet loam of the
              forest floor. Mercilessly this mummy beset me, taxing all my skill with blades to the
              breaking point and beyond. I began falling back, heart filled with terror, for I knew
              there would be no escaping and no victory for me. I merely fended it off as best I could.
              The fiend was upon me so fast I had no chance to even attempt magically ensnaring it to
              give me more time to escape. I cried out in despair to Tunare. I had pledged my life to
              defend the forests, but to die for naught, against a creature I had no chance to defeat
              brought tears of shame to my eyes. Then again, it may have only been the rain pouring down
              my face....I had stumbled to my knees a time or two and knew death would soon take me when
              I realized that the thunder had changed...as a matter of fact the thunder had stopped
              entirely, and what I heard was the thunder of charging hooves. A unicorn! A peaceful
              sensation flooded me as a voice filled my head; I truly thought this a valkyrie of Tunare
              come to escort me Beyond, but nay. The calming voice said to me &quot;Flee, young Tamas; I
              am Equestrielle, and I shall rescue you from this fate.&quot; I thought surely I was
              dreaming, or reeling from the fever inflicted upon me, as this dazzlingly white unicorn
              charged the mummy at full gallop, impaling it upon her horn and running off into the woods
              with it, away from me. It was the most beautiful thing my unworthy eyes have ever beheld
              in all the world. I have only seen one other creature to even come close to the ethereal
              beauty of Equestrielle, and she is also a gift of Tunare to my life, but that, my friend,
              is another story. I collapsed in exhaustion as the unicorn sped away out of my sight, her
              telepathic message still rattling around my befuddled head. She never spoke another thing
              to me. I heaved a sighed prayer of gratitude to Tunare, and Equestrielle, and crawled into
              the gap beneath a partially uprooted tree and slept. After sleeping a couple of hours, I
              awakened as dawn broke clear and as bright as it ever gets beneath the forest canopy. I
              used some of my newly-learned healing spells and got myself fit to travel again. I rushed
              out to look for hoofprints in the mud, to try and track which way my champion steed had
              gone, but to no avail. I did find a few prints, starting about one hundred yards out from
              me, and ending abruptly much the same distance to the other side. It was real enough, but
              still ethereal; I could not track her down. I've spent many a day in the Lesser Faydarks
              since that amazing event, and heard faint murmurs from others regarding similar sightings,
              but have never seen hide nor hair of Equestrielle again. And oh, how I yearn to do
              so....&quot;</font></p>
