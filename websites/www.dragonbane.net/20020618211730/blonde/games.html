            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">My first interest in the Olympics was way back in 1976. Being
            only 9 years old at the time I didn&#146;t care about nationality or politics (I guess I
            still don&#146;t come to think of it). I held my breath and watched a girl a little older
            than myself make world records. Nadia Comaneci was a wonder to watch and I can still
            remember it like it was yesterday. I wanted to be like her so badly but considering my
            accident prone-ness, it just wasn&#146;t going to happen </span><span style="font-family:

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">A year later I was lucky enough to be able to travel overseas
            and live in Munich Germany. I stayed at the Olympic Village and site of the 1972 Olympics.
            I swam in the very same pool that Mark Spitz did and got yelled at by a lifeguard (in
            German of course) when my bathing cap came off after a jump off the high dive. I
            didn&#146;t know at the time about what actually happened in 1972 at the very place I was
            staying. I was a child. Terrorism and murder were the last things on my mind. It was only
            later after I had returned home that I saw a documentary, recognized the buildings and
            realized what horror actually happened there. I assume the adults didn&#146;t mention it
            due to my age.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">Watching the games now is very different. CNN reported that the
            opening night had the largest amount of viewers ever recorded. I wonder how many watched
            just to see if there would be another terrorist attack? (Sorry but my faith in my fellow
            man is in a downward spiral) I just wish the games could be one time when nothing else
            mattered but watching the best athletes our <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">world</b>
            has to offer. No controversies, no bad sportsmanship, no stupid politics, no our tragedy
            is worse than your tragedy, and best of all no threats or violence. Couldn&#146;t this be
            the one time when we all get together and forget the BS of our differences and current
            events? They are called games after all. Doesn&#146;t that mean fun or at the least some
            goodwill should be involved?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">Enough of my ranting. I guess my favorite event so far has been
            the Snowboarding. The thought of doing it myself scares me when I think of long hospital
            stays that would be required in my case which is why it&#146;s so exciting to me. The rush
            those boarders must feel has got to be intoxicating. Hats off to all of &#145;em </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">The event I have never been able to follow is Curling. I keep
            watching it and just when I think I have got the idea of what&#146;s going on I realize I
            haven&#146;t a clue. Someday I am going to have to do some reading up then maybe I will
            get it. I know if I tried it I would probably be in the same shape as if I tried to
            snowboard. I have a hard enough time on solid footing. Too slippery for a klutz like me. <o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the end I really don&#146;t care who wins. I enjoy watching
            talented people do wondrous things. I am happy for those who do get a medal. I am bummed
            for those who don&#146;t, not because it matters to me, because I know it probably matters
            to them. I just like to watch the excellence all the athletes bring to the games. Hell
            these guys made it to the Olympics; they are all winners in my eyes </span><span style="font-family:
