                wish I could say I had more to do with it, but those of you who have been working so hard

                to wane about a year ago, leaving the clan with only a handful of active players. Attempts
                to merge with other clans, recruit new players, and jump-start players with sporadic
                activity all failed. The last of what was left of DB Quake life fell out of existence
                about 6 months ago. It is hopeful that if Doom3 is ever released (maybe in another year),
                then it will spark an interest amoung DB players, but no one knows for sure. It's been a
                good run, but the time has come to close downt the DB Quake teams formally.</font></p>

                be running some events very soon that should help out the guild lowbies as well as
                generate cash for guild housing. First off I need a list of people that would be
                interested in PLing sessions. Send character names to my email (ice007man@yahoo.com) to
                get on the waiting list. During the PLing sessions, all salvage and cash will go to the
                housing bot, and any worthwhile loot will be auctioned off to the guild. Donations to the
                housing fund for PLing sessions are always welcome.<br>

                to get Organized| </strong>by Burk</a><br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My fellow DB members, are you tired of
                pick-up groups at DL leaving you without a bard or healer? Ever finally get a group, go
                out to emain and get rolled, just to have half your group quit? Even better, quit to join
                their guildies? Well, I say it's time we get organized for some serious RvR action. I'd
                like to see DB get build a RvR team that is:<br>
                <br>
                1. Willing to meet at least once or twice a week. I'd like to see us do it as often as
                possible, but I think 1-2 times a week is a great start.<br>
                <br>
                2. Made up of the right level 50 class mix. I dont mean to sound abrasive, but a group of
                3 lvl 44 NS, 1 lvl 38 bard, 2 lvl 47 rangers etc just doesn't cut it for a good RvR group.
                I'd like to see lvl 50 toons across the board. If you're not level 50, and are seriously
                interested, we can discuss how to best get to 50 (we have a couple chanters, dont we :p)<br>
                <br>
                Buff bots will provide buffs to group from DL or crunchy etc.<br>
                <br>
                3. Well organized<br>
                Everyone needs to understand his/her role in the group. I'm no RvR guru, but I do know
                this. 90% of the problems I have while in pick up groups involve 8 people that each have
                their own game plans.<br>
                <br>
                4. Quitters not invited<br>
                I expect to get rolled. I expect many of us wont have purge, and a nice AOE mez will be
                the death of us a time or two. That's life - especially when fighting RR5+ mids/albs. I
                expect for my &quot;one of many plans of attack&quot; plan to flat out suck. I expect for
                myself and my guldies to make mistakes, and make them often. What I dont expect is for our
                group to get upset and quit. This is a learning experience, and if you really, really,
                really suck at RvR, there's nowhere to go but up :p<br>
                <br>
                We have the best guild in Hib, imho. You will find no better people. RvR should be a fun
                aspect of the game, but we should play to win, and maximize our ability to do so. I think
                organiziation is a key to success in RvR, and without it, (with the exception of some of
                our exceptional stealthers), we are forever bound to the 1 in 15 shot of a decent RvR
                group. My ranger, Burk, has racked up 40K RPs in a single night while playing in a
                balanced group. Other nights, we just go out to get rolled while other groups mop up on
                RPs.<br>
                <br>
                I really see potential for a DB RvR group. We can have great fun, doing everything from
                venturing to Dodens as a group and clearing the dungeon for giggles to hit and run ganking
                in emain.<br>

                <u><strong>NEXT WED. RAID (5/21/03) </strong></u><br>
                We're going to plan to kill Legion in Darkness Falls. IF DF is open, then this will be no
                problem....if we're a keep or two away....we're going to go retake the keeps we need and
                move quickly to get in DF. I am asking that you bring a lvl 40+ toon if you have one if we
                do Legion. MEETING at 830pm EST.....OUTSIDE OF DL! This is so we're rdy to go take keeps
                if needed, if now, we can just hop on into DF. I will make groups and have the CG up for
                you all. <br>
                <br>
                IF This falls through, be prepared to goto Necht, we'll run down and slay The first named
                mob real quick. OR we can head to the Epic Zone. This decision will be made on the spot
                given certain elements. Plan on Legion though.<br>
                <br>
                Legion will be open to alliance. LEGION LOOT will be 45+ to roll....unless the item has a
                lvl requirement.</font></p>
