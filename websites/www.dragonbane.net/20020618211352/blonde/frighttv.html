            TV</strong></u></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I am a news junkie. I
            always have been. I have two TVs in my study so I can watch different news stations. I
            read 3 daily papers and my local weekly. Weird thing was the morning of September 11<sup>th</sup>
            I hadn&#146;t turned on the news all morning. I was bellyaching about a toothache and
            taping the X-Men movie when Larry&#146;s sister called and screamed over the phone line
            that America was being attacked. We turned on the news at 11:30 am to see the whole thing
            played over and over and over. There was no pause for us between the time the planes
            crashed and the buildings came down. There were no delayed reports of the other planes
            that had been hijacked. We got it all at once in one gigantic dose, the whole story. Me,
            sitting in a crouched position on the edge of the couch and Larry pacing back and forth
            behind me. We watched for the rest of the day. I understood the emotion of the newscasters
            and gave credit to the strong who guided us back to some sort of organization. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now more than a month
            later I am starting to tire of the saturation. Rumors being reported as fact. Over anxious
            politicians and those very same newscasters saying on one hand &#147;There is nothing to
            fear&#148; or &#147;You have no reason to be afraid&#148; then showing the people the
            exact opposite. Do as I say not as I do, eh? Not really a motto that will quell any
            panicking citizens. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If people are scared I
            say go ahead and get that gas-mask if it makes you feel better. Wear surgical gloves
            wherever you go, avoid things that you might think are targets. The fear is already here.
            It needs to be addressed instead of swept under the rug. Common sense tells me that
            because I am a nobody I am at little risk. This fact though did not stop me from spraying
            my mailbox with Lysol at 3am so no one would see how silly I was being. It made me feel
            better, and that&#146;s all that matters. I am not going to iron my mail because I
            don&#146;t have an iron and I&#146;m not going to buy one so I can process my mail.
            I&#146;m not going to take antibiotics because one of the side effects for women are yeast
            infections. I&#146;ll have to be diagnosed with Anthrax first, thank you very much. I
            already hate crowds so that risk is out. I was never crazy about tall buildings and I was
            already uncomfortable with flying. Can you remember Sioux City, Iowa (or even further
            back, the Canary Islands incident)? Hey, I&#146;m not that a-scared anymore, go figure. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Truth is there are plenty
            of things to be afraid of. If there is one thing I know it is fear and how dangerous it
            can be if ignored or denied. It does not go away and will bite you in the butt. Due to an
            unpleasant incident 8 years ago I began to be afraid. I was told I had no reason to be and
            I should be strong. I tried this for 5 years and slowly stopped going out. Three years ago
            a major trigger ended in total agoraphobia. I rarely go out now and never by myself. I
            ignored my fears and was taken over by them. I was told by a family member to take St.
            John&#146;s Wart. Talk about a bandaid on a compound fracture&#133;.lol. I have a lot of
            work ahead of me and I&#146;m not going to waste my time being scared of something
            I&#146;m not at risk for. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the end what I&#146;m
            trying to say is examine your fears and make yourself feel better (I am not advocating
            trampling small children to get to the purchase counter with that gas mask or letting your
            imagination run away with you). Use your common sense. If someone else thinks your nuts,
            oh well. They aren&#146;t you and never will be. </font></p>
