            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I don&#146;t
            have many friends who are female. A few through the years but not many. It wasn&#146;t
            until I hit the world of gaming that I actually liked just about every girl player I ran
            into. I think it made me let my guard down because my son has just had his first
            experience with the type of girl I love to hate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A few weeks ago
            (at age 11) my son told me about this girl that he liked. It was cool with me, remembering
            crushes of my own, I teased him a bit and such. The girl seemed nice enough. Called a lot
            and had a later curfew than my son. No biggie. It was the first girlfriend bit and I knew
            there would eventually come a time when it would end and the first pain of a broken heart,
            that seems so distantly minor at 35, would be freshly devastating at 11. There is nothing
            harder for a parent than to see their child learning a life lesson and having to sit down,
            shut up and let it happen. For a normal parent this is hard, for a overprotective mom like
            myself it was excruciating but I am proud to say I did it with the occasional advice only
            when asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Today was the
            day that my normally talkative and grinning son moped into the house with the biggest
            poo-face I have seen in a while. I asked several times what was wrong and got a sad and
            quiet reply of&nbsp; &#147;Nothing.&#148; each time. Finally I chased him around the
            house, and pounced on him, explaining that if he knew me at all he may as well tell me
            what was up because I wasn&#146;t going to stop being a pest until he spilled it. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I got a weak
            smile and he softly said with his eyes downcast &#147;She doesn&#146;t want to be my
            girlfriend anymore.&#148;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I came forth
            with the responses I had stockpiled for the moment. &#147;Honey, you will have lots of
            girlfriends in your lifetime&#148; and &#147;Sometimes things work out like this&#148;.
            All my responses seemed weak and meaningless while seeing the genuine hurt in my sons
            face. It was then that the phone started ringing and I realized this was not over by a
            long-shot. It was the girl calling to say it had all been a trick and everything was ok
            and my son was happy &#133;.AAAARRRRGGGGG!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Being me I
            couldn&#146;t let this one go without asking my son &#147;What purpose would a person have
            to play a trick like that other than to make someone else feel bad?&#148; and &#147;Are
            you sure you still want to be around someone that would play a trick like that on
            you?&#148;. Of course, none of it registered but maybe it will the second time around
            (yeah right). <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I knew girls
            like the one my son likes. In junior high they are cliquey. In high school they excel in
            the art of pretending to be drunk, and graduate with honors in back stabbing and
            cattiness. Mind games and emotional warfare are childs-play to them and I have always been
            very careful to keep my distance. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Something tells
            me I am going to be one hell of a mother-in-law someday,&#133;.literally&#133;lol.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
