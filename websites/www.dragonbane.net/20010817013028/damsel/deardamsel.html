            Dear Damsel,<br>
            When I play my games, surf or work at my machine my underwear goes up my butt. I wear
            jockeys but I have switched around to all the other kinds just to try and solve the
            problem. It makes me very unhappy and making me mean to my friends and family. What can I
            do?</font></p>

            Heh heh, I am pretty much in the same boat. I haven&#146;t really decided what game is

            I am in love with a wonderful guy. We both play EQ and live close to each other too. I am
            worried because I have a good friend who has warned me that my guy isn&#146;t so

            Tricky situation. This isn&#146;t probably going to help much but follow your instincts.
            If you believed that there was no truth to the matter you most likely wouldn&#146;t give
            it a second thought. You didn&#146;t give much detail as to what offenses your guy
            supposedly committed but if it was something serious I would be careful until it was
            sorted out enough for me to feel comfortable again. Take a good look at your friend as
            well. Could they be gaining something from badmouthing him? If not then take caution. Good
            luck and take care.<br>

            Sounds like your first me in Norrath was easier than my own. Truth is leveling on your own
            will always be slower than being powerleveled by a higher character. My suggestion, other
            than paying another player to powerlevel you, (which is not my idea of having fun) is to
            simply be cool to others, never beg, and roleplay a bit. When doing these things you never
            know when an awesome buff or a kindly soul will bless you and help you on your way to
            sixty. Safe travels in Norrath my troll friend.<o:p></o:p><br>

            I live with my girlfriend and we hope to be married sometime in the next year. We both
            play EQ but I was the one to turn her on to it after many fights about how much time I
            spent playing. One day she tried it and liked it as much as I did. My problem is I think
            she is cheating on me with another player in the game. If I&#146;m not playing and I walk
            into the room while she is, she gets all secretive and irritated that I walked in. I
            don&#146;t have any hard evidence but I am not stupid either. Something is going on. How
            can I catch her in the act and should I forgive her for cheating when I find out the
            truth?<br>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Dear Cluckhold,<br>
            You sound very sure of yourself and are most likely correct : where there is smoke there
            is fire BUT let&#146;s go back. What you may consider cheating she may not, so what you
            really need to do is put some effort into a clear calm discussion with your lady instead
            of wasting time and energy trying to bust her. A lot of people think cheating is only in
            the physical sense and she may be one of these. You need to tell her that it hurts you to
            think of her being intimate with someone else on any basis and in any form even if it is
            only roleplay. Once you clearly state the way you feel in a non-threatening manner it is
            up to her. If she chooses that your feelings aren&#146;t important you might want to
            rethink your long term plans. The point in sharing your life with someone else is to be
            happy, if you or your partner isn&#146;t, what&#146;s the point? Maybe there is a way you
            can both be happy with a little trust and reassurance, who knows? It&#146;s up to whether
            y&#146;all can honestly talk about the way you feel. I truly hope you both get all you
            desire. Take care : )<br>

            I have a problem that doesn't deal with any game specifically. My problem is that in my
            house we only have one computer (well actually 2 but one sucks, is not working and not
            worth fixing). We are saving for another computer but until then we have 3 people all
            racing to the computer and fighting over who gets to do what for how long and so on.
            Usually it's just good natured teasing but lately feelings are getting hurt and resentment
            is building. Is there any way we can all get along until we get another computer? When I
            said I was writing you about it we all agreed to go by whatever you suggested being an
            objective party and all : )<br>
            <em>The Wife</em></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <br>
            Dear Wife, <br>
            Talk about pressure....lol. Well,....hmmm,... let me give this a try........<br>
            <br>
            First off, pick a day that no one uses the computer. Do something you can all do together
            to remind yourselves why you all live together. Computers and the Internet are awesome but
            they do have a tendency to isolate the user. The key with anything enjoyed that can be
            abused in excess is moderation.<br>
            <br>
            Then.... work out a schedule that you all can agree on which means everyone will have to
            give up something. Don't worry about what the other person is going to give up,
            concentrate on what you yourself are going to sacrifice for the common good. Create the
            schedule by the hour, by the day, by the night? Whatever everyone can agree on. You didn't
            say what the comp was being used for but I know online time whether it is surfing, gaming,
            chatting or whatever can get away from you. Be strict when one persons time is up, that's
            it, TIME IS UP. Use of a timer may be needed to avoid having to nag. Bartering or trading
            times for special events is ok if everyone agrees and it is pre-arranged.<br>
            <br>
            If y'all decide to do this (please don't try if everyone doesn't agree, it will only make
            things worse) stick to it because once you start changing the rules halfway in, the honor
            disappears<br>
            and the system falls apart.<br>
            <br>
            ........or......<br>
            <br>
            *winks*<br>
            <br>
            ...You could just simply barricade yourself in the room with the working computer,
            snickering and cackling loudly as the others try to break down the door.<br>
            <br>
            Good luck friend, may you receive all you desire.<br>

            <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Dear Damsel,<br>
            I am in a real life quandary and have no idea on what course to take to solve my problem.
            My wife and I started playing EQ about a year and a half ago. We were both addicts for a
            while but where my interest waned, hers only increased. Now that I don't play very often
            we don't seem to spend any time together. I really miss her. Even though she is in the
            next room, she is really worlds away. I have tried talking, complaining, yelling, the cold
            shoulder,...nothing has worked. Please help me. I want my wife back.<br>
            <em>A Helpless Mortal on Earth</em><br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Dearest Mortal,<br>
            Ah, the ever-phases of Everquest. At sometimes losing yourself in Norrath, other times
            forgetting that it exists entirely. This can be hard on friendships let alone significant
            others if the phases don't coincide with each other. Not knowing how serious the problem
            is I will suggest four degrees of action. <br>
            <br>
            The first, easiest, and mildest remedy : The classic &quot;carrot on a stick&quot;, the
            fragrance of a wonderful meal. This can backfire by the intended target only going AFK
            long enough to run to the kitchen to forage a plate before returning to eat mindlessly
            infront of the comp. You can try to distract the target by having a known favorite movie
            starting at the precise time they forage or if all else fails standing in the buff while
            cooking has been known to be an attention grabber. (Take-out works as well for those who
            may be un-inclined to cook)<br>
            <br>
            The second, not so easy, longer term remedy : The reverse tactics. This has worked well
            for me personally but patience is needed. Simply encourage the target to play whenever you
            can. Do not yell, complain, or whine. After a few sessions of uninterrupted gameplay the
            targets gameplay will decrease. I have no idea why this works only that it does.<br>
            <br>
            The third, expensive but worth it, remedy : Vacation of no less than ten days. This was
            the start of my longest Everquest hiatus. A vacation to a remote island with very little
            to do besides lounge in the sun drinking can wean even the most addicted Norrathian. Maybe
            it was the fresh sea air or the real people watching that brought me back to Earth,
            somehow though I think it was the epic event of real life adventure that stimulated my
            senses. Norrath didn't seem so large after that little worldly jaunt.<br>
            <br>
            The forth and most basic remedy : Barter. Always remember it is easier to give up
            something (no matter how partial or limited) if someone meets you halfway. If your wife
            would agree to limiting her time spent in Norrath what could you offer her in return? If
            you don't know, ask her : )<br>
            <br>
            I hope some particle of advice here helps you if only to have stimulated your own ideas, I
            have succeeded. Good luck my friend. May you obtain all you desire.<br>
