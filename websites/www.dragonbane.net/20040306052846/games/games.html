            become tired of endless mouse-clicking over dreary landscapes, come to the world of Knight
            Online and lose yourself in the beautiful sky.<br>
            <br>
            The minute you acquaint yourself with the white clouds and the eagles in the sky, you&#146;ll
            find yourself caught in the charm of a true 3D online game. Knight Online is the first
            game to successfully introduce the &#147;Party System&#148; in Korea. Raising your
            character&#146;s level, acquiring new items, and becoming the strongest player should not
            be all that an online game has to offer. We invite you to the World of Knight Online,
            where you&#146;ll find a player with better game manners may become more respected than a
            player with expensive items; in a party system where you help your fellow players to
            advance. A prominent and exciting feature of<br>
            Knight Online is the involving, persistent, large-scale war between players.<br>
            <br>
            When a player first registers and creates a character, he must choose between two nations,
            El Morad, the nation of the human race, and Karus, the nation of Orc tribes. The
            successful player will seek to join forces with others of his or her nation in order to
            obtain victory. That character may become a hero in Knight Online, through battle. He may
            also receive a title and reward from the King, become the lord of his own castle, and even
            rule over a city.</font></p>

            Lineage 2, Japan Open Beta is running now. Anyone can get an account, and the Beta is very
            playable, even with a lot of the quest/merchant speak in Japanese. So far I think the
            graphics are outstanding, and the content is average. Supposedly much like DAOC the fun
            begins at the higher levels with siege warfare. Haven't gotten there yet but interested in
            seeing how it works out. Anyway purpose of this email is to give you a guide to get a
            Japan Open Beta account if you are interested. Here is how:<br>
            <br>
            1. Go to the following link and click the Bright Red Box on the left side of the
            screen(Says in Japanese &quot;Sign up for Open Beta&quot; I guess) </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><a href="http://www.lineage2.jp/" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">http://www.lineage2.jp/</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <br>
            2. (Page 1) Click the left side bullet and then click the button (This is the license
            agreement)<br>
            <br>
            3. (Page 2) Enter your email address in the next box. Need to use a real one since it will
            then send you a registration code. Click the button once you have entered it.<br>
            <br>
            4. (Page 3) Go to your email box (in another window) and cut and paste the Alpha-Numeric
            code they emailed you (it will be the one in english letters) into the box. Push the
            button.<br>
            <br>
            5. (Page 4) Fill out the next page according to this graphic. <a href="http://www.un1337.org/l2-j.jpg" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">http://www.un1337.org/l2-j.jpg</a><br>
            <br>
            6. (Page 5) Next page is a confirmation of your information. Click the left hand button to
            confirm. <br>
            <br>
            7. You are now signed up. Download the Client here : <a href="http://download.bbx.lineage2.jp/L2_040211_J2.exe" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">http://download.bbx.lineage2.jp/L2_040211_J2.exe</a>
            Highly recommend using Internet Download Manager (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_download/0,fid,22363,fileidx,1,00.asp" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_download/0,fid,22363,fileidx,1,00.asp</a>)
            It very nicely breaks the file down and doesnt lose it if you crash. File is a hefty
            1.18GB so it will take a while.<br>
            <br>
            8. Run the client and enter your account/password info. Go to the options page (all of
            this is in Japanese now so you will have to guess a bit) and select English. Now all of
            the important content will be displayed in English.</font></p>

            Game (MMORPG). In World of Warcraft, thousands of players will have the opportunity to
            adventure together in an enormous, persistent game world, forming friendships, slaying
            monsters, and engaging in epic quests that can span days or weeks.&nbsp; World of Warcraft
            will differ from other MMORPGs in many ways. One of our main goals is to ensure that
            players can enjoy World of Warcraft without having to invest huge amounts of playtime.
            Players will be able to complete quests and experience the world at their own pace-whether
            it be a few hours here and there, or week-long adventuring marathons. Additionally, our
            quest system will provide an enormous variety of captivating quests with story elements,
            dynamic events, and flexible reward systems. World of Warcraft will also feature a faster
            style of play, with less downtime and an emphasis on combat and tactics against multiple
            opponents. We also plan to incorporate several unique features, which we'll disclose
            throughout the course of development. Beta test applications closed as of February 4th,
            2004.</font></p>
