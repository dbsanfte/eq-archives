            <p align="left"><u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What is AO about?</font><strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><br>
            </font></strong></u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">AO is a sci fi mmorpg that
            takes place 30,000 years in the future on a planet called rubi-ka. The main story line in
            AO is supposed to be a conflict between 2 sides. First you have Omni-tek, that is a big
            organization that came to rubi-ka for business reasons and to mine the planet for its
            recourses. Then you have the rebel clans that are opposed to the things omni-tek wants to
            do. So when you start the game you have to pick which side you want to join. There are
            supposed to be an advantage to each side. I think weapons and armor is supposed to be more
            available to omni tek players and skills and such are supposed to be more available to
            rebel players. You can also choose to be neutral, and you can switch sides at times during
            your characters career. since there is a conflict between the 2 main sides there is PVP.
            How they have it set up is different zones have different levels of pvp. When you are in a
            main city you can attack anything, once outside you can only attack wildlife ( all the
            different mobs) then they have political zones where you can attack wildlife and players
            of the other side, then the mayhem areas that are free for all pvp. But to get to the pvp
            areas you have to do some traveling, so you don't have to worry about random PK if you
            don't want to. They want to make it so that all pvp will be story based.<br>
            <br>
            There are 4 races and 12 classes- there's some info on them on the Dragon's Bane website
            (http://www.dragonbane.net).<br>
            <br>
            The game world is huge, it took me about 3 hours to run from one side to the other just
            following the roads and I hit a invisible wall where it was the end of what was in beta at
            that time. But there are other ways to get around that are faster. They have teleports in
            most of the main areas, vehicles, and the grid system which is like teleports but you can
            go more places and there's your average run buffs.<br>
            <br>
            AO has zones but not as frequent as eq. You don't have to zone each time you get to a new
            area. It's sort of like <em>Asheron's Call</em>, where you could run through different
            zones without &quot;Zoning&quot;, you would just get a message that you are now in
            whatever zone. most of the time you could run around 4-6 zones before you have to
            &quot;zone&quot;. For example in <em>Everquest</em>, running from Quellious to Freeport
            would be all the same zone. but the cities and mission dungeons are always a separate
            zone. <br>
            <br>
            The one thing that is different about AO than what's been in the current games is the
            mission generator. Throughout the game you will find mission booths that you can get
            missions (quests) from. You can adjust different things in the mission like the
            difficulty, if you are looking for experience or money, and a few other things and it will
            generate several missions that you can pick from. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Each mission will have a
            description on what you have to do - which could be to assassinate someone or find an
            item, destroy something or something like that and it will have your reward and experience
            listed for completing the mission. Once you accept a mission you will get a key to the
            mission dungeon ( which is randomly generated) and it will tell you the location of the
            dungeon and it will point you in the direction using your compass. that dungeon will only
            be accessible to you so you don't have to worry about anyone camping or anything. you can
            get people to help you by buying a mission key duplicator and make copies of the key. so
            you can do missions as a group or by yourself. You can also create missions to give to
            other players.<br>
            <br>
            There are a lot of different weapons and armor in the game, so much that I have never
            really held onto anything I got that I didn't plan to use, just sold them to vendors.<br>
            <br>
            Oh yea, another interesting thing they have are implants. implants are items that you have
            installed on your character that can buff stats, add spells, increase armor etc. in your
            inventory you have your average weapons screen and clothing screen but you also have slots
            for implants. there are a slot for each part of your body that you can install implants.
            Implants can be found or bought but also can be made using trade skills. <br>
            <br>
            Also I haven't seen it done, but you are supposed to be able to take any weapon apart and
            see what it is made of and create your own weapons and armor (this is a trade skill also).<br>
            <br>
            <u>What is combat like in ao and the apartments like?</u><br>
            The combat is sort of like <em>Asheron's Call</em> and <em>Everquest </em>mixed (ever play
            AC?) there are different skills like EQ but a lot more, there's martial arts (hand to
            hand), 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, pistol, rifle, shotgun, smg, bow, energy melee and energy
            ranged. Each skill is available to every player, but to raise it you have to put points in
            it like how it is done in ac. Using it doesn't raise the skill, only when you put points
            in it. You have a aggression slider (like ac) that goes from defense to offense. Everyone
            mostly slide it all the way to offense, it makes you attack more. When you fight a mob its
            just like EQ. You click on it and hit attack and the damage you do and the speed at which
            you attack is according to the weapon and your skills. Every thing else is like EQ as far
            as fighting. <br>
            <br>
            There's a few differences in melee weapons and the guns. The range at which you can attack
            something. melee weapons are close ranged like in EQ so you have to be in close distance
            to fight, where the guns have different ranges depending on which gun you have. Some you
            can be<br>
            way off from the mob and fight it some you have to be closer but if you are in a group for
            instance, you can stand back and fight if you are using a gun and not get hit. One thing
            that is a problem right now in beta is all the root spells are unbreakable so you could
            get a group of gun<br>
            toters together and root something 50 levels above you and blast it away without getting
            hit.<br>
            <br>
            But the guns and swords and stuff are all basically the same if you don't think gun. each
            weapons stat would look like this. damage: 10-50(25) speed: 1.50. the only difference is
            the range on a sword will only be like 10 meters while a gun might be 40 meters. The
            second difference in guns and melee weapons is guns have special attacks ( which right now
            makes them not balanced against melee weapons). guns could have 1 or 2 of these attacks:
            burst, full auto, flingshot or sneak attack. these are extra attacks that work basically
            like bash did in EQ. You use it and have to wait till it times out. Also they are all
            skills so the damage you do with those attacks are dependant on how high your skill is.
            There is a special attack that everyone gets called brawl. it's like a 1, 2 punch that
            works the same way. But if you are using a melee weapon you only have brawl while a gun
            toter might have brawl, full auto and burst. the martial arts class does however have its
            own line of special attacks. So other than the graphics and distant there's no difference
            in fighting with a gun or melee weapon than it is in EQ.<br>
            <br>
            Oh if you use a gun you have to buy bullets and you have to reload the gun when its out.
            It reloads automatically but its slow. You can reload manually and it is quicker. Also you
            can make shortcuts to your weapons on the hot bar- that way if you have 3 different guns
            that all have different special attacks you can have them all hot keyed and switch from
            gun to gun in a fight so that you can use all the different specials.<br>
            <br>
            As for apts you start out with one, it has 4 rooms and I think you can upgrade it later.
            You can store stuff in your apt like a bank and you can invite people to your apt. this is
            new but when you start the game, to cut out on lag what they do is create a newbie level
            that only holds so many<br>
            people. it will have things to fight up to level 4. You can only leave that newbie area
            once you get to level 4 or have 1000 credits(money), getting to level 4 doesn't take long
            at all.<br>
            <br>
            The way they handle death is different than EQ also.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The rumors I was telling you
            about in the last email turned out to be true ... here is a post from someone that is in
            the &quot;secret beta&quot; from the beta forums...<br>
            <br>
            I have seen build 11.something run at E3 and to say it's a huge jump from 9.x doesn't even
            give it justice. Hennig spent a good 20-30 minutes with me showing me the new things in<br>
            version 11. <br>
            <br>
            All I can say is that all of the crap we've all been bitching about has been fixed 20
            times over. It looks better, it plays better, it's laid out better, missions are better,
            the game is leaps and bounds better from what I saw. <br>
            <br>
            I suppose it's ok to give a few spoilers away since everyone is seeing it at E3. <br>
            <br>
            1) Mapping is now a skill, it's green to adventurers. <br>
            2) I have SEEN vehicles work.<br>
            3) Missions are fixed and there's more than one 'mission dungeon type.'<br>
            4) User created missions I saw working.<br>
            5) Newland is no-longer lag-land and is VERY beautiful and cool now.<br>
            6) All the surrounding areas of Newland are amazing and updated.<br>
            7) As far as I saw, camera angle in 3rd person is user move-able. <br>
            <br>
            I asked specifically about static dungeons, and you guys won't be disappointed in that
            realm either, but that's something I'll let funcom address. <br>
            <br>
            Hennig went out of his way to help me, he even remembered specifically what I had talked
            about in my Emails. The guys at Funcom take EVERYTHING we write VERY seriously. I have
            never been so impressed with a game company as I was today. I'm extremely excited to get
            beta 11! Thanks Funcom, you guys did not disappoint me at all!<br>
            <br>
            Also I attached a doc I wrote up that talks about each class and profession, at the end of
            that doc is 2 links, 1 to a site that talks a little more about it and the other is to a
            thread on the main ao site that is sort of a question and answer session from what a
            person saw at e3.</font></p>

            <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Here is a little bit of info on the breeds
            (races) and professions (classes) of anarchy online and some of the things they can do.
            There are a lot of nano formulas that aren't known yet and are not in the current beta yet
            but this will give you a good idea of what each class is about and may help you to choose
            your breed/profession if you decide to play ao. </font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There are a few things to keep in mind
            when looking at this:<o:p></o:p></font> </u></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) there are levels in
            this game ( 200) but your abilities are skill based not level based, at the beginning of
            each level you get ip points to put towards the skills of your choice. you are limited on
            how many points you can raise a skill per level but you don't loose those potential points
            if you don't max it each level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>for instance,
            if you can raise pistol<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>5 points per level
            and you decide not to raise it at all for 2 levels, the 3rd time you can raise it 15
            points not just the 5<o:p></o:p>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2) there are about 30
            different<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>skills. each skill has its own
            color coded rating depending on which breed/profession you are. skill colors are light
            green, green, dark green, light blue, blue, dark blue, what that means is depending on the
            color it takes more or less ip points to raise that skill 1 point. for example if you have
            a pistol skill color of light green as a level 1 it may only cost you 10 ip points to
            raise it 1 point but if its dark blue it may cost you 60 ip points to raise it 1 point.
            you start out with 1500 ip points and then you get 5000 each level and at level 15 I think
            it raises then again at other various levels although I don't know which and how much.
            also as your level in a particular skill gets higher the amount of ip it takes to raise it
            also gets higher. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3) you can choose to
            raise any skill you want, so you are only limited to using different weapons and equipment
            and some spells that aren't class specific buy your skill. for instance you can be a
            martial artist (similar to eq's monk) and use a rifle if you are willing to pay the higher
            ip cost to raise the rifle skill<o:p></o:p>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">4) the spells that are
            general spells that anyone can use are mostly buffs and debuffs of almost every skill, a
            few healing spells and some other various spells but they do not copy most of the
            profession specific spells. they are good if you don't have a high enough skill to use
            something and you can use a general spell to buff that skill so that you can use it.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">5) <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">and this is important to know. </b>EVERYTHING has a
            skill requirement. this will cut down on twinking. when I say everything I mean every
            weapon, piece of armor, implants, spells, firstaid/treatmeant kits, stims (one time buffs
            that you can buy), the use of maps etc. everything. also there are skills that allow you
            to &quot;hack&quot; items with a hack kit that will reduce or remove some or all of the
            skill requirements of items.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">now on the the breeds and

            a little more skill work to wear the best armor. professions that work well with this

            SMG is the greenest weapon skill they have along with 1hb. also there is something that is
            going to be added in the game called grids which is sort of like portals. there are wompas
            that are portals in several areas of the game but they have predetermined and limited
            destinations ( if you go to city x the wompa will only take you to city b and c. so if you
            are trying to get to city f you might have to go through a few whompas). when you enter a
            grid you can exit at any other grid destination ( depending on skills) the spells aren't
            in the current beta yet but fixers are going to be the only class that can access the grid
            from anywhere without having to travel to a grid. also fixers have low concealment and

            basically a hand to hand combat class and have its own class specific special attacks.
            this class is a pretty good class as it deals a good amount of damage and have moderate
            hp. other green weapons skills are 2hs and bow and some thrown weapon skills. ( its not in

            The Soldier is supposed to be the top damager of all combat classes ( although a fixer
            with the right weapons can hang). most of the ranged weapon skills are lower for them to
            raise so you basically have your choice without having to worry about sacrificing
            something else. warriors also have a good amount of hp, sort of up there with enforcers,
            their greenest skill is the rifle skill, which currently, rifles does the most damage out
            of all of the ranged combat skills. I played with this class a bit and I do say that this
            class can take down mobs really quick when compared to the martial artist ( some balancing
            needs to be done with ranged vs melee). some spells include:<o:p></o:p></font></p>
