    Evil</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I've been a participant in various online
    communities now for a bit more than five years, and from time to time the issue of real vs
    online persona has cropped up. I've seen many a person in chat rooms, emails,
    messageboards and games do and say some truly reprehensible things and come<br>
    back with the defense that &quot;it's only online, its not real.&quot; Well, if online
    weren't real, there'd be no reason why the FBI prosecutes cases of online fraud. Police
    departments wouldn't set up stings to catch child molesters who stalk their victims in
    chat rooms. People have this opinion that the<br>
    online world is only for their own amusement and anyone they interact with there aren't
    real. That opinion is wrong. Even if you only see a pixellated icon, or only text
    representing a person, that doesn't give you any right to treat them wrongly, they're
    still a real person. And yes, words can and do hurt. What might seem like a coy game to a
    person &quot;playing&quot; online can shatter trust and leave emotional scars to the
    person that was &quot;played with.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Is it possible to be &quot;online evil&quot; in a play sense, but be a nice person in real
    life? Way back, in my early days of the online world and AOL chat rooms, a room I
    frequented was haunted by a guy I'll call Kenny. Kenny would go off on anyone who
    disagreed with him on anything, and the depth of his insults usually was &quot;you're fat
    and ugly.&quot; Now, its true, many of the people frequenting those chat rooms were fat
    and ugly, but that didn't make their opinions wrong just for disagreeing with Kenny.
    Basically, it made Kenny a total jerk for stooping to hurting peoples' feelings to get
    them to stop arguing with him, even when he was dead wrong. But Kenny was always the first
    to claim that he was a super nice guy in real life. &quot;This is only online&quot; was
    practically his mantra. To him the chat room was basically a game, and those that he
    didn't like were simply there for him to harass for his own amusement. This chat room was
    a local one and the chatters often met<br>
    at local bars, including Kenny, where he continued to be insulting to people he didn't
    like from the chat room. Now, if he was only mean to them online, and was really such a
    nice guy in real life, how could this be? Basically, Kenny was a jerk online because he
    was a jerk in real life.<br>
    <br>
    In the realm of EverQuest, there are evil races. This provides for some interesting
    roleplaying potential. But does playing an evil character give a player the right to act
    antisocially and be a jerk? Nope. Just because you're an evil character doesn't mean
    you're entitled to train people, KS,<br>
    or call them names. If that is the limit of your comprehension of roleplaying, try playing
    a human warrior and doing the same things you did as a troll/ogre/dark elf. That wouldn't
    make you an evil human character, it would make you an evil player. Doesn't really matter
    what the race of your character is, if the player is a jerk, does it? A nice person could
    play the most vile dark elf necromancer, worshipper of the god of hate, and be the kindest
    most thoughtful person you could ever group with in Norrath.&nbsp; Conversely, you could
    play a priest or knight of the goddess of love and be a total asshole. In either case, its
    not the pixels and faction code of the character that people see as your character's
    attitude/alignment, its the actions and attitude of the player that matter.<br>
    <br>
    How does one go about roleplaying evil in the EQ world, then? Truthfully, I'm not really
    sure. I don't find it fun to even try thinking of how to be evil. I would much rather play
    an &quot;evil&quot; hero- a dark elf trying to be accepted by the world at large, for
    example.<br>
    <br>
    I can't offer you suggestions on how to roleplay evil in EQ, that's not my intent. All I
    can tell you is that roleplaying an evil character isn't the same as being an evil player.
    Look around, and when you see people in EQ saying/doing bad things, ask yourself if
    they're doing it to roleplay evil,<br>
    or because they're just a jerk. I don't think you'll see roleplay come out ahead on that
    little survey. &quot;Its just a game&quot; is no defense for treating people like dirt.<br>
    <br>
    Remember, all that is required for evil to triumph in the end is for good people to do
    nothing.<br>
