            <br>
            One thing that I've seen happen over the last year or so is that the creativity in gaming
            appears to have leveled off. The realism and playability has reached a sort of peak. If we
            look at the progress made from about 1995 to 1999-2000 (ex. Doom to Quake III), the
            difference is staggering. What modification or advancement in technology/programming
            techniques will produce the same variation? On the creativity side, what hasn't been done?
            Few games have come out in the last six months that are truly novel concepts. Black and
            White is a great example of a rehashed idea with the addition of the current technology,
            is what the market produces. Don't think so? What about Populous for the Sega Genesis?
            Sure the techniques for converting followers and increasing faith in said Deity (the
            player) are different, but the concept is the same. I loved Populous and I was planning on
            buying B&amp;W this weekend, then my girlfriend's brother told me about how much there was
            to do in each game. It's becoming apparent that the gaming industry has been dominated by
            games that have that fast learning curve and ease of play that I spoke about in my first
            article. The prime examples are the Doom/Quake series and the Warcraft/Starcraft series.
            If the enormous following these games continue to have aren't enough proof, then take a
            look at the huge number of spin-offs, modifications and games developed completely with
            the original engines and changed visuals. <br>
            <br>
            So it appears the industry is stagnant. There is more focus on modifications of current
            games that have already proved their hold on the market, than on coming out with new
            ideas. At last count, there were almost 200 modifications for Quake III ALONE!! Not to say
            the publishers aren't trying; right now dozens of new titles hit the stores every week.
            What will it take to break this trend? The answer belongs in the next article, but I think
            it's important to focus on what's bringing the industry to a grinding halt. First, Quake
            III is such an overwhelming success, both technologically and in game-play. Such a success
            that with the gamers that enjoy familiarity in the games they play (me for example), that
            there is substantially less motivation to spend $40-$50 buying a game and then realizing
            it doesn't do this as well as QIII or that as well as QIII. Understand the dilemma? I
            can't foresee a time when I will ever become bored with the game. The funny thing is I
            almost never played the game. I knew it was a popular game, but the couple of times I saw
            it played, the graphics looked weird to me. I was totally sold on Unreal Tournament and
            didn't see any reason to even try Quake III. It took going to a big LAN party where they
            didn't play much Unreal and someone gave me the game for free to get me to even try it.
            I've tried going back to Unreal and do from time to time, but it just lacks something now.
            <br>
            <br>
            Second, the technology as peaked. I have a GeForce256 32 MB DDR with a PIII 733 and I get
            160FPS running 800@600 resolution and that's with everything turned up full. What benefit
            would I have in buying a GeForce2 or 3? What benefits does the new hardware being
            developed have that will motivate me to buy it? If it looks real, then it looks REAL.
            There's no such thing as MORE THAN REAL. If it mimics real life, than where do we go from
            here? Ok, so there is VR, or total immersion gaming, and believe me, when it gets here,
            I'll line up to buy it. (I'm not talking about VR glasses or voice activated gaming, or
            those stupid motion games I've seen in the arcade, but a real Holodeck!) <br>
            <br>
            So I leave you this time with this question: what is going to be the next Quake III?
            Maybe, next time I can provide some ideas as to what COULD happen. Have a great week!</font></p>
