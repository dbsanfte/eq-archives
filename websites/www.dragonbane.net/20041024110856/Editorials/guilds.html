        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><em>FOREWORD: Any guildnames I may mention
        in this column are purely fictional. Any resemblance to guilds of Quellious, or any server
        or other game is purely coincidental.</em><br>
        <br>
        There are a helluva lot of guilds in EQ, but what are they REALLY? What does your guild
        mean to you? How do you perceive other guilds? Think on these concepts a moment before
        continuing.<br>
        <br>
        Some guilds have fancy codes of conduct and lofty ideals. Some guilds are just a handful
        of friends who want to share a chat channel. Some guilds are collections of people
        striving to make a whole that's more than the sum of its parts. And, some guilds are
        basically just a bunch of misfits banding together because no one else can stand them.<br>
        <br>
        Is a guild a family? Is it a social club? Is it like a political party? Is it a mark of
        honor, of pride, of disposition? Is it some, all, or none of these things?<br>
        <br>
        Let's proceed on the concept that a guild is like a family. Guildmates (especially in
        larger guilds) might not always personally like one another. Heck, in real-life families,
        not all people like each other. But even though you don't like Cousin Joe, are you proud
        because he got into a prestigious<br>
        college? Even if you think Aunt Jane is a total bitch, aren't you outraged that she got
        mugged on the street? Family goes beyond personal likes and dislikes; a guild should, too.
        Even if you don't particularly care for Joe Necro in your guild, you should cheer his
        accomplishments, and stand up for him if you can. A guild loses strength when members let
        their individual differences come between them. After all, if you let a guildmate down,
        aren't they likely to let you down next time? And if a guild is continually letting each
        other down, what good is it? Treat your guildmates like family; without mutual obligation
        and support, a guildtag is just words behind your name.<br>
        <br>
        Now let's look at guilds from the outside. When you see a stranger sporting a guildtag
        you've never seen, what thoughts cross your mind? Do you feel positively toward them if
        the guildname is something noble or poetic? Do you look on them negatively if the
        guildname is something punkish, or dastardly? Speaking personally, I'm going to be more
        inclined to trust a member of the<br>
        Legion of Valhalla, than a member of the Throatslitters. Sure, it's just a guildtag, but
        that guildname means SOMETHING. It didn't just appear there by chance.<br>
        <br>
        Now, if you're dealing with a stranger, but of a known guild (I'm not going to even
        address the concept of twinks of known players, that's a headache waiting to happen), how
        do you react? Do you look on them positively if it's a guild you have friends in or have
        had good experiences with in the past? Do you look on them negatively if it's a guild
        you've had negative dealings or bad experiences with in the past? I bet you do.<br>
        <br>
        Is it wrong to look at a person and think &quot;I know 10 members of that guild, and
        they're all jerks, he's probably a jerk too&quot;? Perhaps. But again, I bet you do. I'll
        admit it, I do. A person is known by the company he (or she, sorry ladies) keeps. Guilt by
        association, you could call it. Granted, one<br>
        shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but first impressions ARE important.<br>
        <br>
        Do you scold your guildmates when they've publicly acted like asses, or cheated people, or
        ninja looted, thus lessening your guild's reputation? If a person sends you a tell and
        says &quot;Soandso your guildmate just screwed me over&quot; do you ignore it, or look
        into it and attempt to see the right thing is done? Do you even care? You should. Again,
        people judge you by the company you keep. If you have a guildmate who's a bad seed and
        makes the rest of you look bad, everyone suffers.<br>
        <br>
        I could go on posing different questions all day, but I'll stop here. I urge you all to
        examine the actions of yourself and your guildmates. The point has been made over and over
        that reputation is key at the higher levels in EQ. But the concept of reputation goes
        beyond you personally, and extends to your guild, too. If guildmates come down on you
        about something, don't just say &quot;what the hell is your problem?&quot; Because if
        you've done something bad, it doesn't only reflect on you, it reflects on them. By the
        same token, compliment your guildmates when they do something great. Too often, thanks are
        taken care of privately, and disputes handled publicly. If someone in your guild does
        something nice for you, thank them in guildchat, let everyone know! It seems silly, but
        you'll all be the stronger for it. And, isn't that something we join guilds for in the
        first place, to overcome our limits as individuals?<br>
        <br>
        Enough babbling for one session. Now go forth and be excellent to each other. (Bill &amp;
        Ted's Excellent Adventure is on cable, lol)<br>
