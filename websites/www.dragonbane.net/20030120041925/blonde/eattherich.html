            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Money, there never seems
            to be enough but that&#146;s a given. One thing I have always pondered on is why some
            professions make the big bucks and other professions, which seem much more important
            don&#146;t. Teachers, cops, firemen and so on make so little in comparison with sports
            figures, actors, and the like. Why is that? Is entertainment so much more important than
            our futures or our safety and lives? You would think that if you have a job that has a
            high risk of death/injury or is particularly unpleasant (garbage men come to mind) that
            there would be some compensation in the form of wages but there isn&#146;t.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Doctors make good money
            and I figure they deserve it due to the importance of the job but when you ask your doctor
            why they picked that profession do you really want to hear &#147; Because I wanted to make
            the big bucks&#148;. Personally I try to look for the doctor who decided to be one to help
            sick people. Guess what? I&#146;m still looking, pretty sad. I&#146;m spoiled though. My
            grandfather was a doctor in a small southern town. He actually cared about and for his
            patients and even made house calls. Unbelievable as it might sound nowadays there really
            used to be doctors like that. Shouldn&#146;t our standards be higher considering the
            amount of money we are paying for such an important service?</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We pay large amounts to
            maintain and repair our vehicles. Auto part stores/suppliers have four prices.
            &#147;Jobber&#148;, which is what the storeowner pays. &#147;Dealer&#148;, which garages
            pay and &#147;retail&#148;, what the guy off the street pays. The fourth price is
            &#147;list&#148; which is the price you pay for the part to the garage that fixes your
            vehicle. Now most auto repair places wouldn&#146;t dream of, nor allow, a customer to
            bring in their own parts. It&#146;s not enough that a place can charge whatever they want
            in the way of labor, they like to get you on the price of the part as well. In most cases
            the &#147;list&#148; price is double what the &#147;dealer&#148; cost is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What can you do about it? Absolutely nothing short
            of boycotting your own car and riding a bike or becoming a mechanic. A car is something
            most Americans wouldn&#146;t want to be without so you pay the money. I always laugh when
            a garage owner or dealer repair shop do the &#147;I&#146;m doing you a favor at my own
            expense&#148;act. I worked in that sector and know how the game is played. Being female
            just adds to the mirth <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It&#146;s almost
            laughable (if it wasn&#146;t so pitiful) that one of the few times the American Congress
            and Senate (Dems and Reps alike) agree on something it is to give their paychecks a nice
            healthy boost. The big boys from Enron did all right too. I wonder why no one thought of
            freezing their bank accounts until that whole mess got sorted out? The proceeds from some
            of those Aspen properties probably could have helped those employees who lost everything
            and have no funds to retire on. Unfortunately any profits from those liquidations are well
            hidden now. Score another one for the fat cats.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A few weeks ago (way
            before the &#147;under god&#148; controversy) someone berated me with the saying printed
            American currency, &#147;In god we trust&#148;. I, surprisingly enough and after some
            thought, think it&#146;s a very appropriate saying considering we worship the coins and
            paper it&#146;s printed on as if it was it&#146;s own religion. The holy house is the
            bank, the altar a cash machine, and the sacrifice is our faith in the system.</font></p>
