            The games playing habits of 700 7- to 16-year-olds is the subject of new research carried
            out by directors, Professor Angela McFarlane, who holds a Chair in Education at Bristol
            University, Ysanne Heald and Anne Sparrowhawk, of Teachers Evaluating Educational
            Multimedia (TEEM)<br>
            on behalf of the DfES. <br>
            <br>
            The report reveals the many important benefits that children acquire as a result of
            playing computer games. <br>
            <br>
            The research, which gathered information from teachers, parents and pupils, shows that
            children learn a range of strategic thinking and planning skills that teachers find
            beneficial to their pupils' learning. <br>
            <br>
            Rather than games playing being a solitary, male-orientated activity, the report
            demonstrates that children prefer to play in pairs and small groups, and are excited and
            motivated with the challenges that games provide. <br>
            <br>
            Teachers are particularly excited by the negotiation and exploration skills that games
            playing develops. <br>
            <br>
            One teacher said in the report: &quot;The main advantage, in educational terms, of this
            type software is the problem solving and co-operative skills that it demands if used in a
            paired/group situation. I observed a number of strong, useful discussions between groups
            of children, in which individuals<br>
            were required to listen to other and to justify their ideas in ways that would encourage
            others to accept them.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Parents reported that they see valuable learning outcomes, such as computer literacy,
            logical thinking, creative arts and hand-eye co-ordination. <br>
            <br>
            Parents saw maths, spelling and reading skills being developed through play. Girls also
            use computer games but by the age of 14-16, more sparingly than boys, preferring games
            only when they were bored with other activities. <br>
            <br>
            The report demonstrates that children learn important thinking, strategic and negotiated
            skills via games that are not necessarily encouraged as easily through other mediums. <br>
