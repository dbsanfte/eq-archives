    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Just some thoughts about
    Kunark this week. For the most part I've got to say I like Kunark. I've not been to every
    zone, not even more than 1/3 of them. It took a little adjustment, but I'm liking the
    place very much. (To my readers of lower level, please forgive my high level slant)<br>
    <br>
    One thing I'm really liking about the place is that it seems to be bringing people
    together. I've seen groups forming and been in groups of people who probably wouldn't have
    come together in Lower Guk or gotten together for Planes raiding. This strikes me as very
    cool. Personally, it's given me, at least, a chance to re-evaluate some people I'd long
    been suspicious of and to realize that perhaps I'd been wrong in avoiding some of them all
    this time. I can only hope that perhaps others are seeing people through new eyes in
    Kunark as well.<br>
    <br>
    Another aspect of this is that I've seen some really generous attitudes toward some of the
    neat new items. So far, people seem to be doing a fairly decent job of seeing items going
    to those classes that can use them, and that makes me smile. I've heard about a ridiculous
    trade or two that might make people feel taken once the item they traded so much for
    becomes more common, but hopefully those are isolated cases!<br>
    <br>
    I do have to wonder about something, though. A lot of old near-forgotten names have been
    cropping up, people who made 50 long ago and got bored, either not playing much, or
    playing twinks. What baffles me is that a lot of these people who were 50 so long, and
    bored, are now back and determinedly driving for 60. Kunark's been out a week, and there
    are a few level 53<br>
    people already! (I've heard some other servers had level 54 players before this past
    weekend. Egads.) C'mon folks, stop and smell the roses! Explore a bit. Hell, you might
    even find a spot where you can make BETTER exp...<br>
    <br>
    As for Kunark itself, it still feels vast, like being outdoors. I know the sense of
    hugeness will fade as we become more familiar with the zones, but it's still very
    impressive. The rest of Norrath looks bland by comparison, like a cartoon background. I
    was in West Commonlands the other day and I<br>
    kept expecting to see Elmer Fudd chase Bugs Bunny across my screen. (/shout Wussup Doc,
    Elmer Fudd to Kithicor zone!)<br>
    <br>
    I'm not entirely certain I like Firiona Vie having a seperate faction of it's own.
    Supposedly, being a recently-formed outpost, one would think that your existing faction
    with elves and dwarves, etc, would be the same there. But by virtue of travelling across
    an ocean and slapping up a few&nbsp; buildings (Side note: Verant graphics designers, and
    apparently high elves too, have a LOT to learn about masonry!) these NPCs have suddenly
    forgotten the esteem they previously held us in. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but,
    it's just a game, I suppose. There could have been some high level monsters that one can
    kill to gain faction there, however. It's as if Verant expects level<br>
    45+ folks to go slay level 20 goblins for hours just to build up some faction! (I laugh,
    but I do plan to go do that soon.)<br>
    <br>
    I would assume that this faction situation applies to evil races and their outpost as
    well, but can't say for sure, since I don't play an evil character. Oh yeah, I suppose the
    new faction is necessary for all those who've slain endless legions of dwarven guards, so
    they can have a fresh start, too...<br>
    <br>
    Anyhow, the scenery is impressive, the wildlife and denizens are unusual, and it's just a
    lot of fun finally seeing new stuff! They really do need to get some sound effects made
    though, it's bizarre that so many of the mobs use the default human sounds; I keep
    thinking one of my companions has been slain! If you've not gotten your CD yet, for
    whatever reason, you're in for a treat. Oh...and you DON'T have to be level 49+ to go
    there, as a lot of people seem to think. Kunark is for everyone, even if some of the
    low-mid level spots are challenging to get to. (In fact, some of the low-mid level mobs
    drop items that make many currently prized items look like trinkets from a gumball
    machine.)<br>
    <br>
    I do thank Verant for putting armor and weapons in Kunark that make tanks effective for
    more than just taunting mobs off of spellcasters! There are some items that are so nasty
    that if equipped with one, a tank could...*gasp*...solo!<br>
    <br>
    This is my only spoiler tidbit. Don't get a gate to Kunark, take the boat to Firiona Vie!
    Not only is it a dangerous journey to town, but you're missing one helluva neat-looking
    ship!<br>
    <br>
    I hope to see you there soon.<br>
