              father's arms who is dressed in full green platemail.<br>

              you ok son?! I didn't mean to ... ugh <he is tackled by the young one in wood who pins the man down>wooo Eli your becoming a pretty strong little tyke. <he say's cradling the little one and wrestling with him><br>

              quiet; the bards stop playing and Jovan looks up, seeing the leg of a beautiful wood elf
              lady. He takes a deep breath and follows the leg up with his eyes, till his eyes are fixed
              on a woman standing there with her hands on her hips tapping her foot impatiently. Jovan
              tries to form a sentence as the woman interrupts him.</em><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: umm we were umm I was just teaching them to um and we saw um...<br>
              <br>
              Anilla: Jovan Jovan Jovan, you have to be the biggest boy I ever had! <she says smiling at him and putting her arms around him lovingly><br>
              <br>
              Elijah: but momma, I thought you said I was the biggest boy you ever had!? <the young boy looks up to Anilla asking curiously><br>
              <br>
              Anilla: No child, Your my biggest man, your father here is my biggest boy <she say's smiling humoring the boy and everyone starts to giggle except Jovan who looks back in disbelief><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: Boy?! me?! Man?! This?? <picks up Elijah for the example, who looks at his Mom smiling with his wood helm on crooked>You must be confused woman, I think I left you to long
              without a man, you need a memory jolt I see.<br>
              <br>
              Anilla: mmmm I missed you baby. <she states to him in the kiss and Jovan stops to smile at her and takes her in a passionate embrace and leans in for another kiss when she feels a tug on her pants and looks down at her son Joven><br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: we do have children here ya know if you two would like to get a room!!<br>
              <br>
<anilla smiles to the boy and states>              Anilla: well Jov kids have got to learn sometime. <she say's laughing and kisses her husband again><br>
              <br>
<people begin laughing at the family and starting to carry on with their day and suddenly out of the crowd another little elf about the same age as Joven comes running and shouting>              <br>
              Zeal: Joven!! Hey JOVEN! <the young one shouts to his best friend running to him><br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: Hey Zeal!! look dad's Home! <grabbing his father><br>
              <br>
              Zeal: Sir! welcome back! <he states to the man in green plate><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: thanks Zeal, its good to be back, how is your Mom doing?! <he asks the boy with much concern in his voice><br>
              <br>
              Zeal: not bad sir all things considering.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: yeah ... well look if there is anything we can do to help her, or you, out let us
              know ok little buddy?!<br>
              <br>
<zeal takes a deep breath and say's to the man a little uncomfortable>              Zeal: Actually sir, there is something ... <jovan looks at him pondering> well see, since the accident with my father's
              death, Mom and I have fallen on some really tough times and our food is very scarce. I was
              hoping that I could borrow your son today <grabs Joven and pulls him to him>to gather some food in Faydark since no one else
              here knows the land better then he 'cept for maybe you ... if that's ok I mean Sir...<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <thinks to himself for a second> Zeal... I have been gone for 3 months buddy, I just got back and was hoping to
              spend some time with my family. Besides Faydark is not the safest place in the world since
              the Inkies started supplying the Crushbone orcs with more weapons... But I tell ya what,
              you and your mother eat with us till this all gets taken care of. Sound good?!<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: Yes Sir!! I will go tell her right away.<br>
              <br>
<jovan smiles to the boy and leans down and hugs him>              Jovan: <in a kind and caring fatherly voice> Zeal ... I said I am spending time with my family, you may not be my blood but you
              and your mother will always be family to us. so you don't have to salute me ok buddy? <smiles and taps hip on the rear> now
              run along and go get your mother tonight I cook! <smiles ear to ear with excitement of cooking for his family><br>
              <br>
              Zeal: <wipes tears away> okay sir thank you very much.<br>
              <br>
              Anilla: <tells Zeal> assure your mother I will be supervising the chef here in the kitchen so the food
              will be edible.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <plays like he is offended> Hey! I can cook as good as I fight ya know!<br>
              <br>
              Anilla: and we both know how bad a fighter you are, 'specially when you fight me. <starts giggling and poking her husband><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <giggling> say hey Jov why don't you run with Zeal to get his mother?<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: sure thing dad.<br>
              <br>
<the two boys hurry off into the city ... meanwhile Jovan heads home with his wife and Elijah to get out of his armor and start dinner.>              Joven: could you be any louder you moron?!<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: what'd I do?! why did you hit me? <holding his stomach and kicking the bag of armor out of the way of his feet so Joven will sleep><br>
              <br>
              Joven: thank you Very much ... <softly to himself> how did he ever live out here this long? <br>
              <br>
<joven begins to drift back to sleep and resumes his dream a month dawn from where he left off... <BR>              <em>Young Joven is with his father who is teaching him how to fight with a sword while
              Elijah watches laying on his mothers lap. The swords are wood and clash, almost as if they
              are steel, at the might the two are putting in to there swings Joven is young but learns
              well his father is very pleased with the boy and foresees him being a great ranger in his
              shadow he toys with the boy in the fight.</em><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: tell me Boy <grunting with thrusts and dodges> your walking in the woods and bandits attack goin for your money and
              food what do you do?<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: <blocking his fathers slashes> Well... <grunts> I would as calmly as possible try and disarm them, without killing
              them if I can, and find out what there motive is and see if I can help them with food.<br>
              <br>
<the father dumbfounded catches the boys sword and turns to his wife>              Jovan: what did you do to my son? <smiling><br>
              <br>
              Anilla: <looks at her husband with a smirk> don't look at me I told you the boy was kind hearted. I don't think he is cut out
              to be a ranger honestly.<br>
              <br>
<joven looks at his father with love and eyes of one who feels he has disappointed another>              Young Joven: dad?! I am sorry if hurt you, did I answer wrong?!<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <looks at his boy smiling> No Jov, you show kindness and wisdom way beyond your years... <kneels to his son> Joven the way you
              answered that makes me more proud of you then you can imagine. I never would have expected
              that from anyone, not even my friend Heartwood the druid master. You show love without
              thought of yourself and that's, well, that's unlike anything I have ever come across in
              this world son. <hugs his son><br>
              <br>
<joven smiles to his mother as he hugs his father and she returns the smile with a kind eye...<BR>              <em>A shout comes from the crowd as a high elf is brought up the lift being carried by 2
              wood elves, he's bleeding bad and missing his right hand and has passed out from the pain.
              Jovan rushes to the man and turns to Anilla.</em><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <in a commanding voice> Come put pressure on this wound I will begin to cast a heal in hopes to stop the
              bleeding, Joven run to the druid keep and fetch Heartwood. Tell him to come immediately <he casts a spell and the ghostly form of a wolf courses into Joven's body>
              NOW GO hurry son!<br>
              <br>
<joven takes off through the city with speed of a wolf as his father commanded. Jovan casts a heal on the man and the blood stops, but he is still unconscious and his life signs are weak. Unsure what he can do, Jovan holds the man's hand and talks to him, to try hoping he will wake>              Jovan: sir!? Sir ?! Wake up please ... please wake up come on stay with me now sir!<br>
              <br>
<the man shows no change in his waking Jovan continued, and finally the mans eyes opened. Unaware of where he was, he begin screaming hysterically>              High Elf peasant: <screaming> AHHH get away from me you Dark bastards Ahhhh leave me alone ! <takes deep breaths realizing he is around woodelfs and halfelfs> where.
              wh where am I? how did I get here?<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: some of my people found you outside and brought you here. What happened to you, do
              you remember?<br>
              <br>
              High Elf peasant: I was walking to deliver some mail for my daughter and I was attacked by
              two Evil Darkelves in full plate. One went to slash me and I blocked it with my hand, and
              then I realized my hand wasn't there no more. I became hysterical and ran till I collapsed
              near a path, then I woke up to you slapping me ... <looking at his stub where his missing hand went><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: a dark elf?! Here?! <jovan gets a pissed look in his eye and turns walking for his house and Elijah starts to jump on him><br>
              <br>
              Elijah: Hey dad! You gonna go get em?! can I come?! I wanna watch you kill em dad
              pleaseeee.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: No! <in a stern voice><br>
              <br>
              Elijah: Dad please I will be ok, I can handle myself. I am strong remember? One of them
              darkpeople try and hurt me I will break em in two, I will tea ... <interrupted by his father kneeling and grabbing him><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: This isn't a Game son! Those people have real weapons in our land, killing our
              people ... it's not as easy as you think to kill someone Eli. So stay here and don't get
              in trouble just do what your mother and brother tell you too, understand!? <br>
              <br>
              Elijah: I don't need Joven telling me how to handle myself I can take care of myself,
              you'll see! <runs off crying><br>
              <br>
<jovan starts to follow but realizes he hasn't the time to waste on talking to his son and runs to his house getting his armor, raincaller, and the weapons he will need. He then hears Joven coming in with Heartwood and fills him in on the situation. Heartwood goes to the high elf and begins to administer heals upon him ... Jovan then gets Regin the warrior and tells him what's going on and heads for the lift to meet Heartwood. The three get ready to go out 'til Jovan turns to Joven, and tells him>              Jovan: I think I hurt your brother, find him for me but stay out of the woods till I come
              back ok? <br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: ok dad.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: promise me Jov, promise me you will stay out of the woods...<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: I promise father. I will not leave this city till you return.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: good boy <smiles> now find your brother and take care of your mother, I will be back soon. <he steps on the lift and the three hero's are lowered into the dense woods and disperse into the night><br>
              <br>
              Dragoon 1: the look in his eyes was worth it all.<laughing><br>
              <br>
              Dragoon 2: yah it was grand ... I still think we should have followed him towards Kelethin
              to make sure he died.<br>
              <br>
              Dragoon 1: no need, with as bad as we beat that man nothing short of a miracle will save
              him.<laughing><br>
              <br>
              Ambassador Dvinn: <steps out of the shadows and punches dragoon 1> You better hope so fool, other wise your dead if word gets out we are
              here. Your job was simple; escort me to Crushes temple and guard us. If you jeopardized
              our position by not being able to resist a kill, then what I will do to you is far worse
              then what Kelethin will do if they get you ... <looks at dragoon as if he is nothing><br>
              <br>
              Dragoon 1: yes Ambassador. It won't happen again, I promise. <holds his jaw and gets up><br>
              <br>
              Ambassador Dvinn: see that it doesn't peasant! <walks back into the shadows and heads to the cave><br>
              <br>
<back in the city Joven is combing it looking for his brother but has no luck. He heads for his fathers bunk at the ranger keep where he studies and sees a note from Elijah;<BR>              <em>Father,<br>
              I know you think more of Joven then me. I am gonna prove that I can do just as good as he
              can. I am gonna bring you the heads of the inky intruders on our lands.<br>
              Love,<br>
              Eli</em><br>
              <br>
              <em>Joven reads it and head off to his house and tells his mother he is going to go find
              Eli.<br>
              </em><br>
              Young Joven: Mom Eli took off deeper in to the city, I am gonna head off to get him ok? <swallows deep uneasy at the thought that he just lied to his mother><br>
              <br>
              Anilla: ok honey be careful out there, and tell Eli to come straight home. <attending to the highelf who was brought in><br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: sure thing Mom. <grabs the fine steel sword behind the door his father keeps as a momento and runs out><br>
              <br>
<activates the lift and heads down trying to track where Elijah was. After about 5 minutes he finds some small fresh foot prints and follows them. When he catches up he sees his brother hiding in the trees. Joven sneaks up to his brother>              Young Joven: what are you doin here dads gonna kill you!! <in a shouting whisper><br>
              <br>
              Elijah: shhhh ... look! <points to a darkelf dragoon guard eating by a camp fire> I say we sneak in a rush him when he is taking a drink!<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: Are you Crazy?!?!! look he has armor and weapons, what do we have? Your rusty
              sword and dad's fine steel. I say we leave now and we may not die!<br>
              <br>
              Dragoon 1: its a little late for that kid.<hits Elijah with the hilt of his sword knocking him out of the tree><br>
              <br>
<joven dives out of the tree and rolls into fighting position>              Dragoon 1: <grunts> my my this might be fun.<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: nothing's fun about killing you. <initiates the fight to save his brother><br>
              <br>
<the swords clash as the first swing is taken. The dragoon pops a dirk out of his back sheath and comes at the boy with both weapons. Joven dodges his pierce, and slashes cutting the guards arm as he retracts the attack>              Dragoon 1: <winces in pain> ok kid that's it you die! <br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: It doesn't have to be this way, please stop! Just let me and my brother go!<br>
              <br>
<the fight continues and Joven is worn down by the mans strength and speed. He takes a slash to the shoulder and pierce in the side, and falls to the ground, still holding his sword up at the guard walking to him about to finish the boy off.. he rears his sword up, about to bring it down>              Dragoon 1 : If its any consolation, you were pretty good for a kid .. shame you gotta die
              knowing you failed to save your brother.<swings his sword down with all his might><br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: Noo!! <leans in to avoid the major part of the blow and thrusts his sword into the dragoon's stomach through his breastplate><br>
              <br>
<the guard steps back causing the sword to pull out of his stomach, and looks at Joven.>              Dragoon 1: noo I don't die to a woodelf, and specially not to a kid! <begins to stab down><br>
              <br>
<the guard falls over dead as an arrow whooshes from the tree's into his neck, severing his spine. Joven looks over and sees his father in the tree's behind the bow and passes out>              <br>
              Heartwood master: I must say not bad for a boy of only 78. You did well out there, you
              will make a fine ranger yet. <smiles to Joven><br>

              Young Joven: <looks at his hands still stained with the blood of the darkelf he helped kill> Mom... I killed him. I took this mans life <begins crying> I took something from him that
              wasn't mine to take Mom ... <lays in his lap><br>
              <br>
<heartwood looks at Anilla in shock over the boys emotion's towards the death of an enemy, who would have killed him and his brother without a second thought>              Heartwood master: Joven ... what you did you had no choice about. Sometimes, things in
              life make us choose when we don't feel we are ready. What you did was very brave, and I am
              proud to know someone like you, who is willing to stand up to a guard for the sake of his
              brother.<br>
              <br>
              Anilla: My baby.. you did what you had to, and I am thankful you did it. <interrupted when Jovan enters the room><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: Can I have a minute alone with my son please? </a></font><a stern and upset voice><font SIZE="3" PTSIZE="10"><i><b><br>

              Certainly ... <whispers as he walks by Jovan> go easy on the boy, he is very distressed about what happened. He did save
              his brother too you know. <receives a cold look from Jovan and walks out><br>
              <br>
              Anilla: <hugs her boy and kisses his forehead> Don't worry baby everything will be all right ..<she too whispers to Jovan> You know he did the right thing
              Jovan... <closes the door behind her><br>
              <br>
<jovan just looks at Joven quietly for a few seconds, then begins to speak>              Jovan: <imitating Joven> I promise dad, I will stay in the city dad ... what happened there Joven? You
              broke your word to me, and your brother could have gotten killed out there! You could have
              gotten killed! What were you thinking HUH?!? Your good, yes, but you are not that good.
              Look at yourself! You would be dead if I hadn't picked up the trail. What do you have to
              say for yourself!?<br>
              <br>
              Young Joven: <tears form as he reaches in his pocket, holding Elijah's note to his father, then crumbles it up and drops it beside the bed> I was wrong dad... I'm sorry, it won't happen again ... I am never touchin a
              sword again. I don't like what it has done to me <looks at his father crying> can I go now?<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: yah <sighs disappointed> you can go ... <reaches to hug Joven as he walks by> I am sorry I yelled, but don't ever lie to me again.. <listens to the door close behind him and runs his fingers though his hair sighing, and sees a note crumpled on the floor by the bed, he reads it and cry's><br>
