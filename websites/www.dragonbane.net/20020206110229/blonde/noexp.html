            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The ad listed above is a
            current one for Denver Airport as of November 6th, 2001. I called Argenbright and the only
            changes that had been made was the age requirement was lifted to 21 and proof of a high
            school diploma. That was it. No requirement to have a P.E.R. card (Permanent Employee
            Registration Card) that is applied for under the Private Detective, Private Alarm, and
            Private Security Act of 1983. Needless to say I wasn&#146;t encouraged. Perhaps the
            &#147;training&#148; they are providing isn&#146;t sufficient. Talk about understatement.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think everyone has
            heard about the incident about the Nepal forestry student (with an expired visa) who tried
            to bring a number of knives among other things aboard a United flight leaving from
            O&#146;Hare Airport this past weekend. Apparently probation for the company entrusted with
            the security for our skies has not instilled the same concern (which should have been
            already present) for safety that ordinary citizens whom are not trained or paid have shown
            in the last 2 months. It was just dumb luck that the young man (now detained) was searched
            a second time before he got on his United flight and the additional 7 (out of 9) knives,
            mace, and stun gun were discovered. After the horror of September I don&#146;t care what
            his excuse or intentions were and neither should anyone else. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What do you do when a
            company gives you bad service? How many 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup>
            chances do you give them? Personally (and I do take it personally) I don&#146;t give
            second chances. Screw me once, shame on you. Screw me twice, shame on me. Our government
            has decided to leave the security of our airways to private companies. Fine, I can deal
            with that but why not give the private company whom is <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">repeatedly</b> screwing up the boot for good and
            completely. I&#146;m sure there are other private security companies standing in line for
            these contracts and would be ready and able to provide the service they are hired for. It
            is plain to see (especially after September 11<sup>th</sup>) that Argenbright Security is
            not doing all it needs to and most likely never will.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We, as Americans, have
            been told that it is up to all of us to protect our country. I agree with this. It is not
            only the responsibility of our authority figures such as the police, FBI, and armed forces
            but all of us. Argenbright needs to take a walk and we, as citizens, need to make our
            opinion heard loud and clear. For those politicians who support the current security
            company in question need to be remembered next time you cast your vote. The airlines want
            us to fly again. The government wants us to fly again. Hell, even the President wants us
            to fly again (he told me so, okay, not personally but he did say that). Want us to fly
            again? Then make it safe. No probation&#146;s, no excuses, no room for error. We just
            can&#146;t risk it anymore. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It only takes a small
            amount of common sense to figure out what are attractive targets to any terrorists wanting
            to create a big bang. Our nations busiest airport located within miles of our nations
            tallest building, Hellooooooooooooo! Even I, a lowly nobody haus-frau, figured that one
            out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would have expected O&#146;Hare to be
            one of the most secure airports in America especially after the tragedies in New York and
            Washington D.C. I guess I was wrong. Somehow I don&#146;t think I&#146;m the only one.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My last column (Fright
            TV) I talked about the &#147;at risk&#148; factor. You might be asking yourself why would
            I be personally concerned about this since I don&#146;t travel. Your right, I don&#146;t
            travel but my family and friends do. My 11 year old son is coming home later this month
            for Thanksgiving vacation. He is scheduled to fly United. I miss him terribly but I want
            him to be safe. Do I feel lucky? Should I even roll the dice?</o:p></font></p>
