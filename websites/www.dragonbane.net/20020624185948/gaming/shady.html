            Web game's conspiracy?</strong></em><br>
            </font></p>
            <p align="left"><em><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Who the hell do you think you
            are?&quot;<br>
            Click.</font></em></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You too can be hounded by those kind of scary
            phone calls, from people who know too much -- just like in the movies.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 1997 film, <em>The Game</em>, Michael
            Douglas plays a man whose life is taken over by a game that smacks of some greater
            conspiracy.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Enter Majestic: a new Internet-based game of
            suspense where you play the role of the man at the centre of the mystery and intrigue.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you've signed up for the game online, a
            series of clues will be revealed to you via the Electronic Arts Web site. Each time you
            log on, a little bit more of the plot will be revealed.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your objective is to wade through all the
            information and solve puzzles along the way that could point to the heart of a conspiracy.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Developed by Electronic Arts, Majestic
            exploits all the methods of the modern stalker. Each player is guaranteed to be harassed
            with creepy email, online video clips, faxes and phone messages from characters in the
            game.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We use the unique canvas that the
            Internet provides us with to paint a picture that's difficult to discern from
            reality,&quot; said Neil Young, the game's creator. &quot;I wanted to create what I
            imagined online entertainment would be like, a sort of blend of interactivity,
            storytelling and communications...over the Internet.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This game, he said, is for people who
            &quot;wanted to be moved by their entertainment, not just run, jump and shoot.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Young, who now runs Synthetic Studios at
            Electronic Arts, can still remember a magazine ad for the company that ran back in 1983.
            The doublepage ad posed the question, &quot;Can a computer make you cry?&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I felt like that was the right objective
            for an entertainment experience,&quot; Young said. &quot;It's something that we have to
            achieve if we want to graduate from being game-makers to being people who make interactive
            entertainment.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The game is still a few weeks from being
            released, but already there is a groundswell of interest in the online community. More
            than 100,000 people have already pre-registered for the game. Hundreds of fan Web sites
            have been made, inspired by the myriad web sites for fictional companies involved in the
            story.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Young said the game's name is taken from a
            real world conspiracy theory that ponders the existence of a handful of high ranking U.S.
            officials charged with dealing with &quot;downed aircraft.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The seed at the centre of the story
            starts with the majestic conspiracy,&quot; he said. It uses that seed to probe the big
            questions, that &quot;the world that we live in today is not really what we think it
            is.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Majestic unfolds at the pace of the real
            world, which means eager players will have to learn the art of waiting. If a character in
            the game says they'll get back to you tomorrow, they mean tomorrow.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Younge, who has been testing the game for
            months, said it's the unexpected phone calls that are his favorite. Young was at an
            airport restaurant, trying to unwind after a long day of presentations when his cellphone
            rang.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Who the hell do you think you are?&quot;
            shouted a voice on the other end of the line. &quot;Why do you give a shit about these
            people?&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Young was spooked.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It took him a moment to realize it was just a
            character from Majestic.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;That is still thrilling for me,&quot; he
            said. &quot;Even though I've received thousands of phone calls from the game, it still
            catches me off guard sometimes.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With testing on the game just wrapping up,
            Young expects that those who have already registered will be downloading the first episode
            of the game later this month.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The rest of us will have to wait until
            mid-July to try a free pilot episode. After that, you'll need a platinum membership for
            EA.com which costs $9.99 (US) a month. A new episode will be created about every four
            weeks.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For those who don't think they have the time
            to be swept up in all the intrigue, Younge said the game is as time-consuming as you need
            it to be.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have 30 minutes a day to spare, you've
            got time to scare yourself silly.</font></p>
