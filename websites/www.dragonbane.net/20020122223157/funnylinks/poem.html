          <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A computer was something on TV <br>
          From a science fiction show of note <br>
          A window was something you hated to clean <br>
          And ram was the father of a goat. <br>
          <br>
          Meg was the name of my girlfriend <br>
          And gig was a job for the nights <br>
          Now they all mean different things <br>
          And that really mega bytes. <br>
          <br>
          An application was for employment <br>
          A program was a TV show <br>
          A cursor used profanity <br>
          A keyboard was a piano. <br>
          <br>
          Memory was something that you lost with age <br>
          A CD was a bank account <br>
          And if you had a 3-in floppy.... <br>
          You hoped nobody found out. <br>
          <br>
          Compress was something you did to the garbage <br>
          Not something you did to a file <br>
          And if you unzipped anything in public <br>
          You&#146;d be in jail for a while. <br>
          <br>
          Log on was adding wood to the fire <br>
          Hard drive was a long trip on the road <br>
          A mouse pad was where a mouse lived <br>
          And a back-up happened to your commode <br>
          <br>
          Cut you did with a pocket knife <br>
          Paste you did with glue <br>
          A web was a spider&#146;s home <br>
          And a virus was the flu. <br>
          <br>
          I guess I&#146;ll stick to my pad and paper <br>
          And the memory in my head <br>
          I hear nobody&#146;s been killed in a computer crash <br>
          But when it happens they wish they were dead. </font></p>
