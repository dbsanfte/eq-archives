            I am in a real life quandary and have no idea on what course to take to solve my problem.
            My wife and I started playing EQ about a year and a half ago. We were both addicts for a
            while but where my interest waned, hers only increased. Now that I don't play very often
            we don't seem to spend any time together. I really miss her. Even though she is in the
            next room, she is really worlds away. I have tried talking, complaining, yelling, the cold
            shoulder,...nothing has worked. Please help me. I want my wife back.<br>

            <br>
            Dearest Mortal,<br>
            Ah, the ever-phases of Everquest. At sometimes losing yourself in Norrath, other times
            forgetting that it exists entirely. This can be hard on friendships let alone significant
            others if the phases don't coincide with each other. Not knowing how serious the problem
            is I will suggest four degrees of action. <br>
            <br>
            The first, easiest, and mildest remedy : The classic &quot;carrot on a stick&quot;, the
            fragrance of a wonderful meal. This can backfire by the intended target only going AFK
            long enough to run to the kitchen to forage a plate before returning to eat mindlessly
            infront of the comp. You can try to distract the target by having a known favorite movie
            starting at the precise time they forage or if all else fails standing in the buff while
            cooking has been known to be an attention grabber. (Take-out works as well for those who
            may be un-inclined to cook)<br>
            <br>
            The second, not so easy, longer term remedy : The reverse tactics. This has worked well
            for me personally but patience is needed. Simply encourage the target to play whenever you
            can. Do not yell, complain, or whine. After a few sessions of uninterrupted gameplay the
            targets gameplay will decrease. I have no idea why this works only that it does.<br>
            <br>
            The third, expensive but worth it, remedy : Vacation of no less than ten days. This was
            the start of my longest Everquest hiatus. A vacation to a remote island with very little
            to do besides lounge in the sun drinking can wean even the most addicted Norrathian. Maybe
            it was the fresh sea air or the real people watching that brought me back to Earth,
            somehow though I think it was the epic event of real life adventure that stimulated my
            senses. Norrath didn't seem so large after that little worldly jaunt.<br>
            <br>
            The forth and most basic remedy : Barter. Always remember it is easier to give up
            something (no matter how partial or limited) if someone meets you halfway. If your wife
            would agree to limiting her time spent in Norrath what could you offer her in return? If
            you don't know, ask her : )<br>
            <br>
            I hope some particle of advice here helps you if only to have stimulated your own ideas, I
            have succeeded. Good luck my friend. May you obtain all you desire.<br>
