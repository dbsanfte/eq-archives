                Dragon's Bane exp/loot raid. We will either do a Daimond group if we have Darkenss Falls
                access or Cursed Forest (Fins probably) if we do not. The purpose of this is to help the
                members who are stuck in their 40's to progress towards 50. I also propose that we donate
                the drops or diamond seals to the level 50 people who come out and help us level in order
                to help them progress their trades (and to entice them to exp with us). <br>
                <br>
                Let's try to do this on Sunday this week at 9:00pm EDT. Please let me or Icewolf know via
                e-mail or in-game if you will be attending. Also, if anyone has any other suggestions,
                please put them forward. </font><p><a name="DB Quake Team: Maps and Times to Play| by Sandman"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>DB Quake Team: Maps and Times to Play| </strong>by Sandman</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I have been away from my email
                for a few days, cuz I was having trouble with my hardware upgrade. But the XP2000 is in
                with 512mb of PC2700, so it should make the Geforce3 whir at the Lan Party.....hehe.
                Almost everything is working again........ so I will definitely respond to your email now.
                Very simply put....... a long time ago....... for a short time, we tried to have more than
                one practice a week, and we found that some people would go to one practice and not the
                other. More people, however stuck to the original practice time, and didn't participate in
                the second practice. So we never had a good turnout in either practice after that. So....
                for that reason, we will not attempt to schedule more than one practice a week, unless the
                overwhelming majority of the team tell me that they can commit to a second practice every
                week.<br>
                <br>
                Most players are willing to frag at various times during the week. So, it would help the
                cause if those who might be up for some fragging, sign onto to ICQ, so others can reach
                them. And for those that are playing, leave ICQ running so it will post the server IP
                where you are playing in an &quot;occupied&quot; or &quot;away&quot;<br>
                message. And by all means, play with your regular name when you are on a public server, so
                others can find you. I play about 4 nights a week, and can play all 7 nights between
                9:30pm and 11:30pm (later on Sat &amp; Sun nights). My ICQ and Yahoo are always running
                with I am around...... all you have to do is send me a message if you want to frag.</font></p>

                out a couple days ago in Albion side of DF. Josi was getting ready to leave house so I
                /realm and noticed that Albion had DF. Well lets see how many I can take. I logged in my
                hiding spot and notice a mob being pulled. Screw it they always gank ours its my turn. See
                a Friar and Infil battling a demonic Familiar. BLAST the Friar into death then turn and
                swing my mighty weapon onto the Infil. 1 rp. Next I mad dash into the merchant area and
                see a ylw con highlander sitting on his arse. Debuff 3x, swing. 30% health gone. Swing 30%
                health gone. He finally stands up but its too late. My last swing drops him and i get
                500+RP. So this green Friar attacks me and I Blast her to 75% life then swing the sword.
                She almost dead. She turns and starts to run so I blast her beyond any hope of recovery.
                By this time 2 greys are TRYING to hit me (well they are but so small damage). I see a
                stealthed Infil coming up behind me so I go for her. She's Blue shouldnt be too much of a
                problem. <br>
                But then a cabalist pet gets on me too as well as the cabalist nuking me. Nukes and Champs
                dont mix. And right before I can kill the Infil, the Cabalist takes me out :( O well I got
                about 800+ RP, took out 4 Albs and made a general nuiscance of myself :P</font></td>

                since I came back. <br>
                <br>
                Well came back and thanks to Josi, had some more experience and gold on hand. Not to
                mention some RP. have made a couple levels in a week and flying high to 47 :). Had a good
                night earning a complete level in the Ranks (was R2L8 to R2L9) in about a 3 hr period.
                only .5 from 46, Josi (known now as Strokke) ventured forth into Cor Mines whereas I died
                trying to save him. Was rezzed and proceeded to the Pit to fight Abys. Really close to
                ding we pulled a tough one. There I was absolutely no health in my bar and Strokke getting
                resisted. Aby still had 1/4 health. I hit it once then parried. Thinking I was prolonging
                my death I was preparing a release command. Strokke got resisted again. I parried AGAIN!
                Woot. Hit it back. Strokke managed to hit him with a pbaoe which brought the aby to a mm
                of health. I missed. I parried AGAIN! Strokke followed up with another pbaoe :) FUN! So I
                managed my ding then Strokke (Josi) created a Champ. Levelled him pretty quick. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fighting at Mbeo (His Champ
                and my Druid) we got taken by surprise. Running our buts to Mardaugh for the guards, Josi
                managed to get aggro back. I notice his health has fallen rapidly. I turn knowing he gonna
                die in the next hit, but he looks FAR away :( I hit heal just in case and was in range! He
                managed to parry right before my heal got him. Another case of close call Champ :P. So
                tonight everyone camping APK I get bored and decide to log at crunch. Get to grogans when
                a &quot;Blackbelt hollers for help <br>
                from the East&quot;. Not thinking I turn that way looking for a fellow Hibbie. That's when
                Black belt hits me from behind for 488 damage :(. Ok my health is already 75% down but I
                got this disease on me and a DOT doing 98 per tick. I manage a lockon and he's orange.
                WOOT lets get it on! Within 2 swings <br>
                I'm down to 50% health but my 2 swings and blast has gotten him to 50% also. Ok fine,
                insta pbaoe. woot there goes another 10% health. O look my blast is up and running :) BAM
                almost dead and I'm currently at 25% health. I miss (GRRR) he hits. I swing again and lil
                Kobold lying on the ground <br>
                :) But my health has fallen drastically and I fear I'm not gonna survive too much longer.
                So I sit. This is when I notice I'm being hit TWICE by DOT. once for 68 Damage and again
                for 52 damage. I didn't think this was possible (any nightshades wanna confirm u can have
                2 DOT's on an enemy?). </font></p>

                Check it out, all your thoughts about cheats that are out are TRUE! myg0t has cheats for
                quake and I have downloaded and tried them on a server for the clan AA (SimKins is in that
                clan), so I know they work, and I know they work WELL! The wallhack part is perfect, you
                can see items and people through walls, no wireframe or anything like that, it looks
                amazing, if you can even say a cheat is amazing. its<br>
                horrid how well it works. The aimbot works too, but its REALLY REALLY obvious, especially
                in freezetag, because it makes the mouse move to frozen bodies... and its hard to unlock
                the aim from a frozen body, so cheaters could get caught easily.. though the hack allows a
                lot of variables you can change, and with the right ones set to the right values I
                probably could have made it work with freeze too.. but I deleted it already. pissed. p.s.
                THIS HACK WORKS WITH ALL MODS OF QUAKE!!! so when you hear things like RA3 is hacked...
                your right! but so is EVERY OTHER MOD!<br>
                <br>
                I'm worried about the wallhack portion the most... its pretty undetectable if you aren't
                stupid and follow people through walls..</font><p><a name="Latest Level 50 Member in DAOC| by cmitchel"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Latest Level 50 Member in DAOC| </strong>by cmitchel</font></a><br>

                <br>
                Tonight's Alpha test found a couple VERY important bugs that my dumb*** overlooked. Should
                be fixed by Sun. Also with tonight's Alpha test is became apparant that due to the size of
                the world, there is HORRIBLE lag. Up to 5 secs. The spawn system I use happened to be
                revised with a &quot;spawn only when a PC is xx range&quot; so that SHOULD help keep the
                lag to a minimum. Otherwise, everything else went smoothly.<br>
                <br>
                Sunday's Beta test is still a go (for the DB NWN mod). Will be tweaking it on Fri and Sat
                in prep for Sunday's Beta test. Also, I included 2 things. There is someone who will reset
                your faction to the peeps in town for 100 gold. I did this for 2 reasons. 1. Factions seem
                to not be resetting properly after a death (game wide). 2. You can beat someone up and if
                you get tired of being chased, you can reset your faction. This will change into a quest
                IF I can get the lag down. Also, there is a way out of the Fugue Plain to restore you with
                everything. Its a SMALL AT by a rock. You can't see it visually you'll have to move your
                cursor around till the icon changes. This will be removed after Beta Test into a Quest

                continue the sharing of players with 3vilution for UFreeze Teams in tournies, we should

                clan looses their identity. It was mentioned to me that the letters representing each clan
                in this tag should be similar to our original tags......... so that anyone that sees the

                recognize the clans as being affillitated under this new tag. Examples are:<br>

                decision to play ufreeze then. I will get the server set up for ufreeze instead then. We
                will need some place to play. So if you hear of some good tourneys or ladders that we can
                play on, then let me know.<br>
                <br>
                The UFreeze Team practice will take place as usual at 8:30pm EST on Monday evening on the
                ETG server #Dragonsbane. The backup server will be Infinity (same channel) should we have
                trouble connecting to ETG. The meeting is open to all clan members, not just those playing
                on the<br>
                UFreeze Team. Practice will begin at 9pm. Our UFreeze server is complete. I just need to
                get it on the net. The server will be up and running this week, and it will ba available
                for next weeks practice. If<br>
                Racerx's UFreeze server is up, then we can practice there, else we will look for a public
                server. <em>Apparently the ETG is full again. We will not be able to connect there for the
                pre-practice meeting. We will meet on the Infinity server instead. Due to the continued
                problems with connecting to the<br>
                ETG server...... Infinity will be our default server of use for our mIRC meetings in the
                future.</em><br>
                <br>
                Over the next few weeks I will propose a couple of changes to our clan rules that seem to
                be outdated now, and need to be looked at for the benefit of the clan's membership. I will
                address these through email, rather than at meetings, since it will reach more people that
                way.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's up and running smooth. Our

                increase it to 20, because it may end up being a pretty busy server. After 20 minutes of
                being online, the server had 13 players in it already. Check it out, and let me know what

                &quot;Longtime DB Freeze Tag team captain, <strong>King of Evil</strong>, and DB Quake
                Division captain,<strong> Sandman</strong>, decide to share the responsibility of the
                UFreeze team captain role. Both members will take on the title of Co-Captain of the
                UFreeze team, and each will perform team tasks according to their individual
                strengths.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Two new DB applicants join Dragons Bane to play on the clan's UFreeze team. Then new
                member, [DBA]Abort, and returning DB applicant, [DBA]Disciple, both come to DB with clan
                experience under their belt. Both exhibit excellent playing skills, and their talents
                should prove to be an asset to the clan and the UFreeze team. Please make them
                welcome.&quot; [DBA]Disciple ICQ# 119875224 [DBA]Abort ICQ# 2514277<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Weeks of efforts and talks between the leaders of DB's UFreeze team and 3vilution's
                UFreeze team, have yielded a successful plan to continue the &quot;merger of members&quot;
                relationship between the two clans. The merged team is expected to yield a formidable
                force of approximately 18 members, enough to enter two full teams into UFreeze tourneys.
                It is expected that each team will be comprised of 1/2 of each clans' players. Team#1 will
                be a kickass team made of the best players of each clan. Team#2<br>
                will be made up of the other half of the players of each clan. Although they will
                participate independently in tourneys, they will scrim, practice, and frag together. A new
                tag (for tourney play) will have to be devised to indicate each of the merged clans.
                Neither clan will loose their identities, and players may use the new, merged tag or their
                standard clan tag when playing outside of tourneys. Anyone who has ideas on the new tag
                should submit them to </font><a href="mailto:nmartin@twcny.rr.com" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Sandman</strong></font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> or </font><strong><a href="mailto:koevil@optonline.net" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">KOE</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">.</strong>

                under construction BUT!:<br>
                <br>
                The main floor Arena and Arena Level 1 is almost complete. Entry is granted correctly, the
                monsters are RANDOMLY spawning at this time. Entrance to 2nd level of arena is working
                correctly (restricted to lvl<br>
                6+).<br>
                <br>
                The merchants seem to be functioning. Lot is dropping as per requirements.<br>
                <br>
                Spawns are spawning at random times with a set # (on one type of random spawner). The
                other type spawns at a set interval but with random number of monsters.<br>
                <br>
                Lvl 4 Arena will be both good and bad. Restricted to lvl 16+. You die...you loose your
                equipment (EVERYTHING!). You kill the beast(s) and there will be custom UBBBBER loot (my
                own design).<br>
                <br>
                Level 2 is being prepped at this time. Then I'll do lvls 3 and 4. THEN I'll add the PVP
                and the Group PvP areas. After the arena is complete to my liking, I'll finish the town
                itself. Once BOTH areas are<br>
                complete, I'll put it up for testing. Also, There will be a &quot;teleport&quot; to a ship
                (where the loot is great but the portal is WELL hidden).<br>
                <br>
                Also the drunk dwarf is ready and is hella funny.<br>

                </u></strong>As most of you know, I had been working hard on a mod. On Fri, July 12 while
                trying to install Red Hat Linux, I had a MAJOR computer failure. I had been able to
                retrieve the mod I was working on but lost all the scripts I had yet to install. While I
                have gotten my WinXp, Red Hat Linux, and other assorted stuff back up and running, my mod
                is delayed for a couple days while I try to bring my system back up to what I had it.<br>
                <br>
                Now, mod news.<br>
                <br>
                Josi was gracious enough to test out the mod as it stood (on Thursday July 11). He was
                really excited with some of the features I have going. Since then I have worked out some
                bugs that he found and added even more content. I run the HardCore Rules albeit a bit
                modified with the Purple Rose Inn. Also I will be adding player housing, vaults, and other
                assorted things I think you will find interesting. I still have the main town, and the
                outlying areas to work on. To get the mod going ASAP, as soon as I finish the main town,
                outlying areas, PvP area and group Pvp area, I will post it live. In the meantime I will
                be working on quests, and other areas to add on. So when it goes live, you will ONLY have
                &quot;hack and slash&quot; with some content installed. Also, be aware of the hardcore
                rules. You can read a description here:<br>
                </font><a href="http://nwn.darkemud.com/~darke/HC/documents.htm" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">http://nwn.darkemud.com/~darke/HC/documents.htm</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                <br>
                NO local characters will be allowed. All characters will reside on my server. Due to the
                HardCore Rules, I will need 1 other volunteer to periodically check the game from time to
                time besides myself. This person will have access to the DM side of things. No
                requirements except that they will need to check it with a DM character every now and then
                UNTIL I can make a work around for the Hardcore Rules. Basically if you are the ONLY
                person on you will not be able to respawn (due to the nature of the hardcore rules). I
                will from time to time log in and resurrect any dead bodies I see (under my criteria).<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, I'll post more as the mod comes along. Here's what I have as of now:</font><ul>

                Well I've been up for the last 36 hrs working feverishly on getting both my system back up
                to operational standards and working on the mod. So without further ado here it is:</font><ol>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Player Vaults are fully implemented. You can
                    store stuff with the Vault Person and retrieve it anywhere there is a Vaultperson.</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Player Housing is loaded in. There are 4
                    types: Cheap, moderate, expensive, and mega-rich (broken down 8, 7, 3, and 1 in that
                    order).</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cheapies sell for 500 gold and the mega-rich
                    sells for 100,000 gold. Also, Rogues CAN break into the houses and I decided to implement
                    FULL RVR in the housing district (just in case you see someone trying to break in your
                    crib). Even though Rogues can break in, its not easy for them.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Housing District is fully detailed and
                    ready. With one exception. Major one too. Can't figure out how to make the
                    &quot;seller&quot; retain memory that the house was bought. In other words anyone can own
                    the same house at the same time. I Might have a workaround soon.</font></li>

                    is bugs in the game that make it hard for respawning creatures and chests. Just got my

                    tonight before I collapse from exhaustion. If this respawner does<br>
                    what its supposed to then the arena is gonna get REALLY fun. Also, I put Lvl 4 Arena (lvl
                    16+ only) on the back of the list as I dont THINK anyone gonna get there soon. Still gotta
                    detail the main town (its ready but sure is bare), and add the outside freebie grounds,
                    PvP, and Group Pvp. PvP I should have ready tonight also.</font></li>

                    your brand new character, DO NOT MOVE AT ALL! Hardcore Rules strip you of everything but
                    give you gold and a one-time CHEAP merchant pops up automatically. If you move, he leaves
                    and your stuck.</font></li>

                    Sunday, July 21 for an all day test run. After that Sunday, I'll get some
                    comments/suggestions, add a couple more areas then put her live 24/7.</font></li>

                Hopefully I can get Josi to make a pre-test jog through the system this week and find any
                &quot;DOH&quot; bugs.<br>
                <br>
                Again if you haven't read the HCF Rules I URGE you to read them. It changes this game a
                LOT compared to the &quot;standard&quot; version. Death is handled TOTALLY different.<br>
                <br>
                I'll send more updates this week as we mosey along.</font></p>

                generosity, Ill be downloading the Linux Dedicated server for NWN. Soon as I get Linux
                installed, I&#146;ll get the server up and running. Ill keep ya posted in the following
                week on how it is going. Also in the middle of totally revamping my personal homepage. Did
                away with my DAOC stuff and converting it into a Tech guide area (with a special DB
                section)<br>
                <br>
                The new site will also include:<br>
                <br>
                - Tips and Tricks<br>
                <br>
                - How to put a computer together from scratch<br>
                <br>
                - Overclocking: The Basics<br>
                <br>
                The address will be </font><a href="http://locutus.dns2go.biz" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">http://locutus.dns2go.biz</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> and the site is located on my personal computer.
                The speed is 56k and that really jerks my frog. There will be times it will be REALLY slow
                (more than one person on) but unfortunately there is NOTHING I can do about it yet. ATT
                has promised cable and I&#146;ll be the first one to sign up for it if it ever gets here.
                But until then, this is the best I can do. Anyway, the site IS up and running the
                &#147;old webpage&#148; if you want to try it out. I&#146;m working hard on the new one
                and will replace it as soon as its done.<br>

                All about the expansion for Dark Age of Camelot. New races info. New classes info.
                Spellcasting (not part of expansion but stated it will be here around August), and
                housing. So much for &#147;adding&#148; housing for free. Means to get a house,
                you&#146;ll have to buy the expansion.<br>

                movie trailer has been released at:<br>

                I am a HUGE TREK fan and this movie I have anticipated since I heard about it. The preview
                is 10 megs and you need the Quicktime viewer to watch. If you like Star Trek, you cannot
                miss this preview. The movie debuts Dec 13. From the preview, it looks to be one of the
                best movies yet. I've heard<br>
                the movie will even rival Star Trek 2 which was praised for its indepthness story and
                &quot;battle&quot; scenes.<br>
                <br>
                The most successful Trek films have always been &quot;even&quot; numbered films and we
                happen to be 10 :)<br>
                <br>
                DL the Trailer and see for yourself. Dec 13, I'm at the movies for the first time in 2 yrs
