                researching of guild quests - &quot;some of the guilds I have talked to don't do the quest
                things but they do put aside one night a week to help another complete a quest one member
                wants to do. Also we can ask GMs for quests I have heard. The ones the GMs put together
                take alot of time and are pretty dangerous. I heard of one GM quest that spanned from NRo
                to West Karana to rescue some girl and return her to her mother in NRo with level 50 monk
                NPC and other NPCs tailing you along the way. But from what I am hearing from other guilds
                is that our server is still quite young so not much is going on right now except a few
                trade bazaars...some guilds plan on hosting drunk fests<br>
                at certain cities as well and teaming up with other guilds to camp certain areas or duel
                other guilds. I don't think we'd want to get involved with dueling another guild - it
                seems to be against the code hehe. But I will hunt down some other guilds on more
                established Servers like Povar and ask what they do.&quot; She'll keep us all updated as
                she gathers information. Great work, Ladina.</font></p>
