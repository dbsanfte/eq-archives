                Enduring Freedom. I was just recently selected for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel, in the
                United States Marine Corps. My job description is Communications Officer, which means I
                plan and manage communications systems (phones, networks, satellite communications,
                computers, etc.). I guess thats about it! Wish I was at home kicking back and playing some
                DAOC - please make sure that Gelrog isn't abusing little Valk too bad! <br>

                Haven't been on since my wife and son got back. He's such a cute little guy I can't get
                away from him. haha But anyways, I'm a SrA in the Air Force. I pretty much do about the
                same thing as Valk. Networking and cryptographic communications. I'm stationed at Eielson
                AFB, Alaska at the moment but I'll be moving to Langley, Virginia in the middle of next
                month. Hopefully I'll see you all again in game soon.<br>
