                BM and druid... druid was out of group. Looks pretty cool!<br>
                <br>
                Sphere of Rejuvenation<br>
                Casting time: 15 sec<br>
                Recast Timer: 5 min<br>
                Power Cost: 20% power<br>
                Duration: 10 min<br>
                Radius of Effect: 250, no drop off<br>
                Effect: On a level 50 druid with 36+12 effective regrowth healed between 72-121 hits per
                tick, ticks every 5 seconds. Healing happens whether you are in combat or not, and
                apparently doesn't make a diff as to how much is healed. When I stood in the effect while
                fighting, my out of group druid got exp from the fight, so it looks like aggro will be
                generated from it. The message you get is: You are healed for X amount of hits by &lt;name
                of caster of the sphere&gt;.<br>
                <br>
                The visual effect created is a downward spiral of stars on each pulse... the spell creates
                a fixed node on the ground which looks identical to the housing hookpoints. Please also be
                aware that multiple Spheres WILL stack effects. I haven't had a chance yet to see whether
                the sphere will also heal pets.</font></p>

                introductory E-mail, for the heck of it.<br>
                <br>
                My real name is Numkene as you can see on the DB website. In case any of you are
                wondering, my name is Native American, My dad is full-blooded Indian, and my Mom is of
                European descent. My tribe is called Flathead (yes...Flathead, I won't go into
                explanations as to why we're called Flathead, you can look that up yourselves, Im just
                glad it's not something my tribe practices anymore) which is part of a larger nation
                called Salish. Salish is also the language my tribe speaks, my real name is Salish for<br>
                &quot;strong boy&quot;.<br>
                <br>
                On a side note mine and my wifes in-game names are also Salish, here's the rundown:<br>
                Qway = Black<br>
                Melqnu = Eagle<br>
                Sceyt = Spider<br>
                Ncicen = Wolf<br>
                Qxwmin = Antlers<br>
                Kwil = Red<br>
                Mla = Raven<br>
                <br>
                I grew up in Montana, Northern Idaho, and Eastern Washington and moved here to Phoenix
                Arizona the summer before my freshman year in High School. I graduated with honors in May
                of '96 and promptly married my wife (who I had been friends with for 2 years then dated
                for almost another 2), 3 days after<br>
                I turned 18 (not for the feint of heart). We have 3 kids: Jessica (6), Nathaniel (4), and
                Erin (1) and we've never been happier.<br>
                <br>
                My job: I work in a factory that makes control circuits and monitoring equipment for
                airplanes and helicopters (both commercial and military). Best job I ever had and I plan
                on being there for a while.<br>
                <br>
                I first started playing DAOC a couple months after SI came out. My friend, Razerwing (who
                is also one of Smash's good friends) got me started. Unfortunatly, if you see Razer
                in-game it won't be him, he played for a long time and finally lost interest and sold his
                account (at least the account is in good hands though. *wink* *wink* Grendel). The only
                guild I've been with other than DB, is A League of Warriors. And both have been an honor
                to be a part of.<br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately a change is coming. In mid-December I will probably be switching to 2nd
                shift at work. Which will probably greatly decrease my playing time except on weekends. So
                you will probably be seeing less and less of me in-game. Currently I have no plans to
                quit, no matter how little I play, but things might change if it gets to the point where
                paying the monthly fee isn't worth it. I hope that day never comes (well, at least untill
                a better game comes out).<br>
                <br>
                That's all I can think of atm. See you all later!!</font></p>

                I&#146;m going to step away from DAOC permanently. I&#146;m just not having fun playing it
                anymore in RvR or PvE. All the patches Mythic does and the expansions have done NOTHING to
                help make my class enjoyable anymore. Instead, I have to fun ways to compensate for
                everything they have done to my class just to make it somewhat fun.<br>
                <br>
                I planned to sell my Ranger and Druid Buffbot on Ebay as a package, but I figured I&#146;d
                ask my guildies if they would like to purchase them from me. I prefer to sell them as a
                set as I&#146;m pretty sure I can&#146;t sell the Ranger by himself and I&#146;d really
                hate to just /cancel my Ranger. If anyone is interested, shoot me an email and give me an
                offer. Just make sure it&#146;s a respectable one as I&#146;m sure I can get some good
                money off the Buffbot. Email me at <a href="mailto:das_boot@sbcglobal.net" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)">das_boot@sbcglobal.net</a><br>

                With all that said, I&#146;d still like to be a member of Dragon&#146;s Bane. I just
                don&#146;t like DAOC anymore. FF XI was fun, but I found the game very lacking in
                gameplay, hard to learn, and just annoying that there are already max level people running
                around from Japan. I&#146;m thinking of Horizons or Lineage 2 so if anyone or if
                Dragon&#146;s Bane starts guilds there, let me know!<br>

                of Twilight, except step 7, which is right outside the zone. I will be starting tonight in
                getting groups together to start on ML3. This isn't guild only because alot of this
                requires 3+ groups. So I will be inviting the rest of the realm to help out/join. You CAN
                get credit for the steps, so dont feel like it will be a waste. Attached is a map i've
                made of the zone (copied it from someone else, but mine's alot cleaner than his scribble).<br>
                <br>
                Yes, I know some people need so and so steps done for ML 1 and ML 2.... all I can say is
                that I've set up &quot;catch-up&quot; nights for MLs. I'm not going to constantly drop
                what i'm doing to make sure the whole guild is up on their MLs. Yes, if i'm not doing
                anything and we have personel on, i'll gladly help. My bot has ALL the keys needed for
                ML2, only exception is step 9..you need 4 items that are farmed from the chiefs, so you
                need to get a FG together yourself and go farm those (there's a sword, shield and two<br>
                staffs). :)</font></p>

                <br>
                For anyone interested in continuing alchemy, it cost 15.5 plat to go from 1050 (the point
                where the drop -based potions turn grey) to 1094. This was using the crafter quest skill
                up reward. I estimate that my total costs were in the neighborhood of 25-30 plat.<br>
                <br>
                It would have cost me slightly less, but I made the mistake of buying extras of the most
                expensive component of the last reactive I was skilling up on, so that was approx 500 gold
                lost due to resale of the extra component items back to the merchant.<br>

                greetings and my second impressions of FFXI. Pummel, Jakkill, Menntal and I are finally
                getting used to the game controls etc... I have talked to Bootleg once but have never seen
                him in person. Most of us have created human characters except for Pummel (He was bold and
                made a Tarutaru, he named Cartman lmao!). I'm liking the game more and more. The fight
                sequences are really<br>
                cool (Spell effects, weapon effects and such). One thing that I like the most is the
                Auction House. That's where you can sell your drops, old armor, weapons etc (Nothing
                degrades but you can only buy armor/weapons in a certain level range). You can bid on new
                armor, jewls, weapons, spells etc. It's centrally located and gives us a place to make and
                spend money without having a lot of running around. You can also send things via courier
                to folks in the other countries (You can have someone look for an item in another country
                and have it shipped to you and pay them via courier). I guess the main thing I don't like
                is the fact that you can lose a level when you die. I have kinda developed a solution of
                killing easy mobs til I have a buffer of exp and then I start on some harder stuff. Well
                there's too much for me to tell ya about and don't wanna bore anyone further. But if

                what other games DB plays but I'm gonna find out and get into one of them. With that said
                I am giving my account away and I am going to be doing a lotto for it. So tuesday night at
                9pm pacific time, I am going to<br>
                hold a lotto for anyone who is interested in the account at domnan, only DB can lotto for
                the account and there is still about 1.5 - 2 months paid for.<br>
                <br>
                The two chars you might be most interested in are:<br>

                </a></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well... here's some of the general
                rules and processes I use when I'm out RVRing:<br>
                <br>
                - Use /colornames so that all enemy stealthers pop into view the red named. This has made
                a large impact in my own playing, as I no longer have to _read_ a name to find out if I
                should engage, but instead just identify a color. It's much less work for your brain, and
                doesn't waste those fractions of seconds deciding what to do. Those seconds matter a great
                deal if you run into more than 1 enemy stealther. Your brain can instantly identify
                multiple enemies with red names, and you can choose what to do from there.<br>
                <br>
                - Strafe during your fights, timed between swings so you don't lose rounds. This is a good
                way to avoid the mercfiltrator's Dual Shadow's style (front positional, big damage), and
                also makes it tough for the enemies friends to sneak in and PA you, mid fight. If you're
                in a fight that's looking favorable for you, and you see another enemy stealther pop into
                view, quickly break away from the fight so their PA misses, then pop AP (if you have it),
                and go back to fighting the same guy. Optionally, if you have a piercer in your other
                mainhand with a DOT on it, switch to it, and smack the other stealther once to apply it,
                then switch back to the first stealther. The DOT will tick on the 2nd stealther while
                you're fighting the first one,<br>
                and when it comes time to switch to the 2nd stealther, you'll already have a good 300 -
                400 damage on him.<br>
                <br>
                - Always keep your enemies in your evade area. You can strafe, you can back up to pull
                them to your front, but never let them get outside your evade area. You'll live a lot
                longer in fights where you've got multiple enemies on you if you're able to evade.<br>
                <br>
                - Use Snow Shower (CD back positional) if you have it. This style snares an enemy, like
                garrote, only it uses less endurance, and does a reasonable amount of damage.<br>
                <br>
                - If you sprint to catch someone, then manage to snare them, turn sprint off! So much
                wasted endurance before I realized that if you're turned sprint on, even moving at snared
                speed, it's taking sprint endurance!<br>
                <br>
                - Always use positionals when you can. If you backstab someone, follow Thigh Cut up with
                wasp's sting, hornet's sting.. if they keep running, use Snow Shower to snare them..
                positionals use less endurance, and do more damage typically than anytimes.<br>
                <br>
                - Don't stand close to AMG doors if you can help it, and especially not when Albs are
                approaching. Enemies like to AOE the doors with dots and mez, and can ruin your day if
                you're near. Nothing's worse than being AOE Mezed in front of the door and then getting
                PA'd by an enemy stealther as he comes<br>
                through. If you get caught in this scenario.. don't wait to see if you'll live.. purge and
                run to hide. You might get caught by TS, but if you're sneaky you'll live.<br>
                <br>
                - Carry lots of endurance and health potions. Get used to using them, minimizing the time
                it takes to stop combat, hit the potion, then start combat again. The least you should
                expect to lose is one round of combat.<br>
                <br>
                - Use AF charges. I personally have an AF proc on my offhand, but since I've slowed down
                in my playing, it's more beneficial to use charges. These make a pretty big impact on
                encounters with tough infs.<br>
                <br>
                - Be conservative with purge. Use Purge only to save your life, not to help you get RP's.
                If you go after a minstrel and you get stunned and/or mezzed and the minstrel takes off,
                unless you fear there's another stealther near that will take you out, don't bother
                purging just to catch up to them. It's not worth it.<br>
                <br>
                - Disease has a snare component.. If you're diseased and trying to run away, it might be
                wise to purge the disease. Even with the small snare that this has, it's enough to get you
                caught. Get into the habit of checking your buffs region when you're trying to run away,
                and note whether you're diseased. It's really a judgement call whether you feel you're far
                enough away to not have to purge it, but be aware of it anyway.<br>
                <br>
                - If a pet class is chasing you, try to lead the pet through agro mobs. If you're lucky,
                mobs will agro the pet and slow it down. It will also put the enemy in combat mode, and
                they'll lose speed. Sprint away if you can.<br>
                <br>
                - Don't try to kill the following classes, unless you expect to die: Bonedancer,
                Spiritmaster, Savage, Bezerker, any hammer spec (2H or polearm), Friar.<br>
                <br>
                - I use str/con on mainhand, dot on offhand, and dot on 2nd mainhand. I don't use 3
                poisons per fight. I save the 2nd mainhand for long fights or multiple enemies. If you
                know you're about to fight multiple enemies, put a str/con on the 2nd mainhand, and be
                sure to hit the 2nd target with it early. This will allow you to last longer, as the
                target's damage output will be lessened.<br>

                whats up and let everyone know whats going on. Right now im working 2 jobs, so i can start
                college next semester. Im training again for boxing, so anyone who keeps up with college
                sports, look my name up, in the next two years i hope to have my name on that number one
                board. As it stands, right now working 2 jobs, im not going to have time to come back to
                DAOC....and by the time i do have time, the game will have probly died out. I might give
                horizons a try, but right now im focused on boxing and getting enough money for
                school.....its my biggest goal right now, and nothing else really matters to me at the
                moment. I do miss all of ya alot, and i definately miss playin the game, but real life
                comes first. im sure you all understand. well, i hope to talk to all of ya again sometime.
                Time for me to go to sleep.<br>
