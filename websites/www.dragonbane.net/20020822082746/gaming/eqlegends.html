            has just recently had a signup for a new type of server, called the Legends server. The
            list filled up the first day, even though they are charging $40 a month!!!<br>
            Why would people pay $30 more? Here are some of the aspects that set this server apart.<br>
            <br>
            1. Character Pages-&quot;Everquest Legends players will have a whole new way to show off
            their characters and equipment - personal character pages!&quot;<br>
            <br>
            2. Dynamic Server-&quot;Our dedicated team of Customer Service &amp; Development staff
            will not only be providing in-game support to our Legends players, but also running new
            quests and adventures for players of all levels to participate in&quot;<br>
            <br>
            3. Legendary Items-&quot;Some of these Legendary items will even be named after the first
            player who discovers them&quot;<br>
            <br>
            4. Calendar of Events-&quot;This web-based calendar will be kept up to date by the Legends
            Team, and will let you know who, when, where, and what is going on server-wide&quot;<br>
            <br>
            5. Interactive Maps-&quot;New dynamic maps help chart the travels of your character with
            step by step tracking of your progress through the world of Norrath and beyond&quot;<br>
            <br>
            These are just the highlights. Nice little features but hard to believe that people would
            pay $40 a month....<br>
            <br>
            Anyway how does this affect us? Well the average developer will see that the gamers are
            addicted, and will pay whatever price necessary to get more of the game. Who knows, maybe
            Mythic will start raising the price of the game. I think the legend server's features are
            great ideas...but all servers should be like it.<br>
            <br>
            I fear for the future :(. The people who signed up for this server have doomed us to
            spending more and more money monthly. Originally it was said that any charge by month
            games would fail, but a few years down the road and all the Verant employees are filthy
            rich. Recently I had heard before the sign-up that nobody would pay that much money...but
            the server list is overflowing, and they will probably open another server.<br>
            <br>
            You can't blame the developers. Raising the price just means they get more money. With
            such an insanely popular game like EQ, raising the price is not going to affect the
            customer base.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway....what does the future have in store? One day will all the games be $40 a month to
            play? How can I get over my addiction of DAoC? Is that a banana in your pocket or are you
            just happy to see me?<br>
            <br>
            Only time will tell!<br>
