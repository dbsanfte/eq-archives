                    The accounts which had Lewt/Armari and Sharus have been closed. Just sick of Mythic and
                    how they run their game. I've just finally got sick of how uber casters are too. Yup, they
                    are uber. NF makes them 10 times more deadly! And not to mention how they managed to screw
                    up dualboxing for some AMD users (those without HT) and then wait for the next big patch
                    to fix it, which happens to be NF. Pretty sure this is for good, unless someone wants to
                    use them. (with your credit card not mine :P)<br>
                    <br>
                    I will be playing WoW though (who isn't!), so probably game with you all again when that
                    comes out. No real need for goodbyes then, since I am still on mailing list, talk to you

                    <br>
                    For those that don&#146;t know, I&#146;m a relatively new member of Dragon&#146;s Bane who
                    just joined maybe 2 years ago through the game Dark Age of Camelot. Although I have since
                    retired from DAOC and have given my 50 Elf Ranger away to a guildy (originally there were
                    2 other owners, but I ended up leveling him to what he is today until ToA came out); I
                    have (and so have all of you) purchased City of Heroes.<br>
                    <br>
                    I&#146;m loving this game, and it will be great to play until EQ2 or WoW come out! The
                    point of this email is to find out who all is playing, what characters you are all using,
                    what levels we have people at, and all the servers we are all on. In an effort to organize
                    everyone, I just wondered if there was a specific server we should all have toons on and
                    play together as a division of Dragon&#146;s Bane?<br>
                    <br>
                    Justice seems to be a popular server (that&#146;s where I have my main toon) for people
                    and I know we have others than Dawnsha and myself on. It would be fun to get a
                    Dragon&#146;s Bane guild going on CoH so we can do what guilds do (like in DAOC). Please
                    reply with any insightful input as we can go about doing this.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also, by no means am I trying to &#147;lead&#148; us (unless someone has to do it). I
                    would just like to organize all the collected DB efforts into one place where we can own
                    and be known as a force to be trusted/reckoned with. If you can continue adding names to
                    the below list so we can get an &#147;inventory&#148; of toons we all have, it would be
                    greatly appreciated!<br>

                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">OK, here's something I ran across, it's
                    about what I try to do in rvr so I thought I would pass it along in case any of you up n
                    coming bards wanted some hints:<br>
                    <br>
                    The bards role in combat:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Initial mez. Try to cast it, if you fail in getting one or two off (however many is
                    needed to hit a reasonable amount of enemies) use your instant. Sometimes you'll want to
                    just always insta, i.e. against a good mid group that has all sorts of instas of their
                    own.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Get up endurance. If you have two bards you can skip this happy.gif<br>
                    <br>
                    3. At this point the majority of posts seem to agree that bards are now useless. Totally
                    wrong. There are now two facts, either your are being attacked, or you are not.<br>
                    <br>
                    If being attacked: good! that means your druids are free to heal, and your casters are
                    free to nuke, which means your probably not going to die and whoever is on you is probably
                    going to die. Kite who ever is on you in front of your nukers range of vision, kite them
                    to your bodyguarders, kite them to your shield slammers, kite them to pbaoe, kite them to
                    your druids line of sight for root! Kite kite kite! Just don't kite them towards a druid
                    who's actively healing or you just screwed your group over. While your kiting enemy tanks
                    toss out your insta mezzes on enemy healers and casters, use your shout and two lulls to
                    interrupt, you are king of the interrupts, use them!<br>
                    <br>
                    If not being attacked: good! Spam aoe mez, spam it some more, spam spam spam! AOE
                    interrupts win fights. Use your shouts, lulls, and instas where needed, if you have a
                    non-grayed out timer on your shouts and lulls your wasting time, find a caster and healer,
                    lock them down. If your paying attention you can conceivably keep three or more
                    casters/healers interrupted non stop. Throw out a heal when necessary, you mostly
                    shouldn't be healing, your heals are total garbage, even if you have 33 regrowth, still
                    garbage. Druids heal, your job is to keep enemies interrupted and on you so the druids can
                    heal. Rez, druids generally cant stop healing to take the time and rez someone, not to
                    mention the power it will cost them to rez, you and any local wardens are the in combat
                    rezzers. Demez, hot key this. Most importantly keep an eye out for more incoming enemy
                    groups, your the only person in your group (except maybe a nature druid) who can let your
                    group win consecutive fights in a row, stop incoming groups with a super mez and win that
                    VIP trophy.<br>
                    <br>
                    The only flaw with bards is that if you mess up your entire group dies and they *know* it
                    was your fault. Any one else can mess up, someone can not pay attention and not heal fast
                    enough, or make a dumb target selection, or nuke a near by torc by accident, and whatever,
                    you still might win. But if the bard misses the easy mez, or forgets endurance, or just
                    gets locked down and killed, then the fight is over, you have lost and its entirely your
                    own fault. So the only flaw I can put on bards is that a group is entirely dependent on
                    them, no CC and no end, and no interrupts / extra rezzers / demezzer = death. </font></td>

                    bit. I didnt want to actually email a farewell because i felt i really hadnt
                    &quot;left&quot; the game yet. But after many months of just stopping in to say hi to
                    friends, and checking the merchant on my house, I feel it is time to say farewell to DAOC
                    for Soreale. Heck i dont even know the people putting in applications now! <br>
                    <br>
                    I have tried so hard to not admit that RL has taken over my life, but.............. it
                    has. 17 years ago, i had 4 babies in 5 years, and changed double diapers (2 kids in
                    diapers at once) for 6 years........ ughh!! Well, Now in 1 month, those 4 babies will all
                    be teenagers. For the next 6 years i am going to have 1 or 2 teens at a time getting a
                    job, getting a license, graduating from high school, then leaving the nest (POUT, CRY) As
                    if this isnt going to be hard enough, I just finished potty training my little Joshua. So,
                    i cant call him a baby any longer. I want to hold onto as many memories as i can as he is
                    growing as he may be my last. They are truly taking 30 hours a day 7 days a week right now
                    of mommy time. So, cant do ML or artifacts or Realm ranks :) hehe<br>
                    <br>
                    It was an awesome 2 and half years i must say!! Thanks to all my great online gaming
                    buddies!! So many of you made it so much fun to play. I play for the companionship more
                    than the game itself so you are what kept me having fun!! CM and Panterra, thanks so much
                    for recruiting Oreale and I so long ago into your family! It was so much fun for us! And
                    for our kids as they grew into playing as well. Your friendship and companionship were
                    great. To my many hunting partners/farming partners/whining partners.....(hehe) Gelrog
                    (and all his alts :)), Valkarian, Barab, Jockoo, Arm (and all his alts:)), Dyrn rabits!,
                    Phlow, Rhymes(my favorite fellow homeschool mom :)) Wipndry, Padrig, and Odysseus, I have
                    missed you all and will miss you greatly until we game again!!<br>
                    <br>
                    I am going to try and make the fun even planned for tonight :) I will probably be late,
                    but am going to try like heck!!! Hopefully i can see most of you then :)<br>
                    <br>
                    Until the next great game for DBANE..........<br>
                    Farewell from,<br>

                    Crafting (Level 800 Quest) Information for you!</strong>|by Skaull</a><br>
                    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hello this is Skaull and I suck at
                    playing a NS. hehe. Now that that is out of the way I wnated to share my lvl 800 Alchy
                    quest with you all. Hopefully this will save other peeps time if they decide to do this
                    quest. Remember that I have only done the Alchy one. SO if Mythic has the WCing screwed up
                    blame me anyways. :)<br>
                    <br>
                    First off I talked to my trainer. He gave me an item to make. First important thing. The
                    NPCs ALWAYS want lvl 96 or better. Now the materials I needed were not all in TNN. Too
                    high of a lvl for newb capital. So one needs to plan ahead. I needed Carbide metal and had
                    to go to housing twice. Time sink. If you looking to get lvling tools and you want more
                    than one I suggest making batches of items. The quest appears to repeat. I have <br>
                    done it twice now and same stuff.<br>
                    <br>
                    So I made the item and gave to trainer. Then I had to make another item and give to girl
                    in MM. She had me make 2 more items and run them to 2 NPC that were in Ardee. Then it was
                    back to MM to talk to girl and then back to my trainer. I receive a lvling item with 19
                    charges and 8% add to crafting lvling chance. It took roughly 2 hours to do this once.<br>
                    <br>
                    NOW this is the reason for this email. TO SAVE YOU ALL TIME hopefully. You want to do this
                    quest and thinking you might need more than one item from it planning is key. Make items
                    in batches. Then repeat the quest after you get your crafting item. The second time took
                    roughly 15 minutes on NS speed. Also all 4 quests are given at once by trainer. So you
                    have to be aware of the thread you chose. Me I pick one and when going to the accept box I
                    back off to stop it. then I get spam telling me which quest I <br>
                    declined. Tells me the lvl on this. Then I just started it again if the lvl is the one I
                    wanted.<br>
                    <br>
                    I hope this helps peeps out with the lvling grind. Me I think it is well worth doing the
                    Alchy one at least. Each batch of 11 tries now cost me 343g at lvl 987. And that is with
                    using metal I salvaged. No real cost there for me. Thanks for your time and Happy
                    Crafting. :)<br>

                    kept count of as many fights as he could during the duels. As most of you know DBane put
                    it to Heart of Albion pretty hard. At one point we counted 14 consecutive DBane wins. I am
                    sure that we missed several fights, but thought the tallies would be fun to share with
                    you. Here are the results that we were able to capture (Note I only individually listed
                    those with a winning or even tally):<br>
