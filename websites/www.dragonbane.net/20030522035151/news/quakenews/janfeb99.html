              though I think that DB has really pulled together in the last month, I<br>
              think it's time I leave for awhile to do other things. To be honest,<br>
              Quake was taking up WAY too much of my time and I want to try and get<br>
              my life back on track a bit. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoyed<br>
              playing with DB and it has been a great experience. I will definately be back when Quake 3
              comes out and possible even DN4ever. But for now I must say goodbye. It's been a real
              pleasure.&quot; Omenborn<br>
              &quot;P.S. I will still be online once in awhile, you can bet on that. :)&quot;</font></font></p>

              <font size="2" color="#808080">The freeze tag team had it's second match Friday Night.
              Unfortunately, we lost again. The first level was Tokay's Towers. We held them real close,
              but they beat us 8 to 6. The second level we played was The Warehouse. We lost 8 to 1. <br>
              <br>
              Thanks to the Freeze Tag Team. You all played a great match. These 2 matches were a great
              learning experience for us. I would also like to thank </font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">AX</font><font size="2" color="#808080"> and </font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Omenborn</font><font size="2" color="#808080"> for stepping in at the last
              minute to fill in for a no-show. That's the kind of spirit DB is known for. <br>
              <br>
              I also want to pass on a comment that was told to me after the match by BAMF, the server
              admin. They commented how, while DB complained about lag especially when DB had high
              pings. Even though we lost the 2 matches, we are building great respect with the
              Tournament hosts and the Freeze Tag community. Keep it up. <strong>- [DB]Xfighter</strong>.</font></font></p>

              Well now, on to the match which started 1 1/2 hours later :). In 2vs2, the match is a best
              out 3 affair. So the first map consisted of Wargrounds (lmctf20). </font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake</font><font size="2" color="#808080"> played well on O, capturing
              the flag 4 times, with some stellar attacks that I don't remember seeing him do before.
              Must be because I was away for a while. I kept the enemy at bay with my D, allowing only 1
              cap for the opposing team while we got 7. Needless to say, we won the map, with style for
              once. None of this nail bitting crap :).</font></font></p>

              started bitching at me too stay on D near the beginning, <br>
              because I would grab the blue flag. What he didn't know was that I would have stayed on D,
              but the enemy flag carrier was leaving our base, so I <br>
              had to chase 'em down all the way back to their base. Strange that he would say something
              that. Figured I might as well pick up their flag while I was there ::shrug:: :) . Strange
              that he would say something like that. This game was a bit closer at the beginning when we
              had 2 caps a piece. But then with Ho's great offense and my D, we managed to pull ahead
