            didn't include any multiplayer support when it shipped in February, but Legend
            Entertainment had intended from the start to include a multiplayer mode called
            &quot;XMP&quot; (for &quot;extended multiplayer&quot;). While deadline pressures forced
            the team to cut the multiplayer support a year before the game's release, Legend got the
            go-ahead from Atari to start work on XMP several months ago. When it's complete, XMP will
            be released in an expansion pack that will be freely downloadable for PC owners of Unreal
            II. The upcoming Xbox version of Unreal II will also feature the XMP mode, which will be
            playable via Xbox Live. <br>
            The Unreal 2 Expanded Multi-Player free expansion is up and taking requests for the closed
            beta. This multiplayer mode is a class-based team game where players fight for control of
            artifacts and energy using a deadly arsenal of weaponry, vehicles, and defenses. If you
            would like to participate in this beta test, please register for an account in Atari's
            beta testing system and request to be a part of this exciting project.<br>

            Game (MMORPG). In World of Warcraft, thousands of players will have the opportunity to
            adventure together in an enormous, persistent game world, forming friendships, slaying
            monsters, and engaging in epic quests that can span days or weeks.&nbsp; World of Warcraft
            will differ from other MMORPGs in many ways. One of our main goals is to ensure that
            players can enjoy World of Warcraft without having to invest huge amounts of playtime.
            Players will be able to complete quests and experience the world at their own pace-whether
            it be a few hours here and there, or week-long adventuring marathons. Additionally, our
            quest system will provide an enormous variety of captivating quests with story elements,
            dynamic events, and flexible reward systems. World of Warcraft will also feature a faster
            style of play, with less downtime and an emphasis on combat and tactics against multiple
            opponents. We also plan to incorporate several unique features, which we'll disclose
            throughout the course of development. </font></p>
