                out a reiminder to update your systems at home and at work. There is a nasty new bug out
                there called W32.Blaster.Worm and it's spreading like wildfire. This thing will cause
                multiple shut downs and crashes on your PC. The update and removal instructions can be
                found here:<br>
                <br>

                </a><br>
                Make sure your system administrator at work knows about this so they can update the
                computers there. I updated Josh's computer already and I am going to update my work
                computer shortly. My mom's computer has it so I'll be over there this afternoon cleaning
                it up :( If you can't access the windowsupdate.com it probably means you already have it
                as the virus blocks access to the site.</font></p>

                Slow news day, sorry, y'all. Got a good tip from a fellow known as &quot;Ant&quot; &#150;
                you can use the new /rpfilter command to help keep track of your friend's alts. Just set
                up the filter so that when you see a friend's alt, it prints out on your client as
                &quot;AltName (MainName).&quot; Meaning, if you see me log in as Gertrude, but you know me
                better as my main, Sanya, set up the filter so that whenever my name prints out, you see
                it as &quot;Gertrude (Sanya) tells you blah blah blah.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Several of you have discovered how much fun it is to mess with each other's names in this
                fashion. By the way, if you change someone's name, and find that you can no longer send
                someone a tell because you can no longer remember what their actual name is, remember you
                can type /rpfilter (without anything else) and a pop up window will tell you what
                you&#146;re currently filtering.<br>
                <br>
                Might help some of you remember who is who.</font></td>

                <br>
                What's particularly interesting about this cloak is that it's damn near the exact same
                stats that I have on my custom SC cloak.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Cloak:</u><br>
                Name: Vonhinten's Cloak<br>

                My custom cloak is degrading really fast.. it's already at 48% durability. I'll be able to
                switch to using this cloak in my template by only redoing my helm (which I want to do
                anyway to get a wreath) so it has Hits instead Dex.<br>
                <br>
                Omen and I believe Soreale all have cloaks with similar stats as mine... For everyone else
                with a shade, the MP template I use is now actually doable.<br>
                <br>
                I've attached a revised MP template including this cloak instead of my custom cloak.
                (Note: I optimized it a little more than I would be able to do for myself.. this template
                assumes you don't already have the original SC'd). Click <a href="cloak.zip" style="color: rgb(0,255,255)"><strong>here</strong></a> to download it.<br>

                <br>
                A few weeks back I joined a small group of almost solid melee and healers.. with 7 people
                we managed to take down 2 of the 3 Princes ourselves. The Midgard Prince spawns 2 high
                level offspring that respawn when they die, and we didn't realize this, so we lost that
                battle, unfortunately (I also didn't get a good screenshot of this one :( ). The Hib and
                Alb Princes were no sweat. I actually had agro for a good amount of the 2nd fight.. bubble
                + buffs + NS evade + 50 shield spec guard = win!<br>

                correctly). I had seen this in a daoc video a long time ago, but I had never actually seen
                it myself... Nothing much going on here, but it's one of the cooler areas in DF.<br>

                This last one was this morning (sunday). A small group of us made it all the way to
                Legion, past several high lord mobs, and through a few big wipe outs (including the
                computer crash resulting in death and LD of my own buffbot Betcha :T). Unfortunately I
                didn't get a screenshot of us actually fighting legion because we didn't get to :( We
                managed to pull the Chamberlain and get him down to 10% health before a bunch of adds came
                and took out our pet. Who knows what would have happened if we'd have played things really
                safe. Interesting to note that this group contained two class specs that I've never
                thought anyone was crazy enough to spec: a 50 nurture bard (for crack 5 song), and a full
                mentalism mentalist (for big heals).<br>

                </a>These new rules are slightly modified from the past ones i've been using. I've had
                many long discussions with people about these in the last couple days. Here's what i have
                come up with, please tell me what you think. I think they're the most fair to the people
                on the raid.<br>
                <br>
                You must be level 45+ to bid for anything, including stones (people 45-49 deserve to
                respec just as much as lvl 50s). Level 45 is a hard limit, so sorry if you're lvl 44.5<br>
                <br>
                Certain items are class specific or geared to a certain spec, so people of that spec will
                get first crack at it<br>
                <br>
                <u><strong>ALT Bidding</strong></u><br>
                * Alts must be level 45+ and the character you bring to the raid MUST be level 50.<br>
                * You must declare it to me BEFORE the raid begins....NOT when we're about to bid<br>
                * You can only bid for the alt, not for the character you came with (if you declared an
                alt that is)<br>
                <br>
                You may only win one item, once you win, you're done.<br>
                <br>
                If no one bids for an item, that item will be moved to be bidded for last and will be open
                to anyone 45+ that has not won something.<br>
                <br>
                These may seem strict to put a lvl 45+ cap on bidding, but hey...it's a lvl 50+ dungeon
                with the mobs ranging from lvl 60 to 80.</font></td>

                The past two weeks have been interesting, and I apologize that I have been unavailable to
                the guild. I've been working quite a few hours and have had no access to Yahoo groups,
                personal email, or Yahoo IM during this time due to firewall restrictions where I am
                working. I am also in the process of starting a new business which is taking any leftover
                time I have.<br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately I am unsure when my schedule will change and therefore cannot guarantee what
                amount of time I will have to play, if any. I cannot and will not leave everyone hanging
                in the game so I am forced to make a quick decision given the situation.<br>
                <br>
                I will be logging in here shortly as I have a short bit of time tonight that I can use to
                make whatever changes are necessary in-game. I will be transferring guild leadership into
                the capable hands of Thaptin so that the appropriate decisions can be made and the guild
                can continue functioning normally. I trust Thaptin and believe that he will do the right
                thing.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for trusting me to put DB back together again in SB - it's been a pleasure to see
                everyone working as a team and having a good time. I regret that the current combination
                of the in-game situation and my sudden change in real life schedule requires such an
                immediate re-organization but if and when my status changes I will be sure to let everyone
                know. I wish everyone the best of luck and I will miss you!</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;Well the target has been painted on my back or the torch

                in Atlanta at the end of August and thought it would be fun to have a DB get-together
                since we have so many in the area. <br>
                <br>
                DragonCon will keep us busy for several days and nights so I was thinking that maybe we
                could get together for drinks, food, or whatever somewhere on Labor Day, Mon. Sept. 1.
                Some place NE of Atlanta would be best. At this point, I know it will be, Icewolf, maybe
                Xfighter and his wife. Let me know if you are interested, have any suggestions, etc.<br>
                <br>
                For anyone that is interested in attending DragonCon, the website is www.dragoncon.com.
                Please let me know if you can make it by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:sharac@earthlink.net" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0,255,255)">sharac@earthlink.net</a></font></p>

                Bane is now live on the Death server! Thanks to everyone for your help and input! We have
                decided to swear our fealty to the Heavy Foot nation, lead by Grimme. We reviewed other
                options such as ST, FC, and RoS but settled on Heavy Foot due to their neutral position in
                politics and similar policies to DB.<br>
                <br>
                We are currently sworn to a sub-guild of Heavy Foot, called Heavy Thinking until Grimme is
                available online at which time I will re- sub us directly to the nation after his
                approval.<br>
                <br>
                We are reunited with some of our old DB family - joining us (and providing ALOT of
                expertise and advice on current Death server politics) are Wipndry, Thumos, and Dalbin.</font></p>
