            </u></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You're deep in enemy territory,
            your ears are melting and you're running out of birdseed. The Necromancers are bearing
            down on you, and there's nothing left to do but ask yourself: &quot;Do I feel lucky?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Afraid? You should be. This is what can happen when you take role-playing games into
            another realm - live action. Here, anything you could have conjured while playing Dungeons
            &amp; Dragons in your parents' rec room can come to life with a little makeup, some
            faux-fur and plenty of duct tape.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The game is called Nero. It
            is, simply, a group of adults - ages range from 16 to 55 - wearing elaborate costumes and
            beating each other with foam weapons. It's motto: &quot;Be all that you can't be.&quot;
            They are the largest Live Action Role Playing organization in the United States and Canada
            today. In Live Action Role-playing, you become the character of your fantasies, acting out
            the action you used to describe as you sat around your gaming table. Instead of dice, you
            use skills that your character has earned, as well as the skills the player brings to the
            game. </font><br>
            <br>
            <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Since its creation in 1989, more than 40
            chapters have sprung up all over North America. Nero is time consuming and players often
            devote most of their summer weekends to the game. Many of the organizers spend even more
            of their time, writing the plots and playing minor characters at events (usually
            monsters), arranging and collecting props and costumes, as well as handling the general
            administration.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Although it may seem just a
            bit over the top, Nero is just an extension of many other, by now more traditional
            escapist pursuits. Beyond live action role playing games (and there are many - from
            fantasy D&amp;D based games such as Nero to medieval games like the Society for Creative
            Anachronists), role-playing takes place online.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There is Ultima Online and
            Everquest. In mainstream circles, escapism comes in the form of paint-0ball or laser-tag
            games, Medieval Times dinner theatre, and murder mystery weekends.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The weekend in Nero begins
            Friday night and, as the players begin to arrive, the weapons - hatchets, broad swords,
            daggers and lances made from foam padded PVC pipe and duct tape - are checked for safety
            and given stickers, once approved. Characters don their costumes, affix elfin ears or
            ogre's horns and final plot revisions are made.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The fictional town of Thrush
            Peak is the setting for the action, and it's hardly a peaceful place, having been besieged
            by the Necromantic Wars for 1,000 years now. It can be hard to keep up with the plot if
            you're a new player or if you've missed an event, but the Haylem's Herald, Thrush Peak's
            newspaper helps keep everyone current.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's 1:00 a.m. Saturday before
            play gets under way, but no one is willing to sacrifice game time to sleep. Sleep means
            leaving yourself vulnerable to attack and missing out on the action, because the game
            doesn't stop for weary adventurers; it runs 24 hours a day. There's magic - and bug spray
            - in the air.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some NPC's hide among the
            trees to stage &quot;random encounters&quot; with adventurers and skirmishes often ensue.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The impromptu meetings offer
            NPC's the opportunity to leak plot clues, and for players, it's a chance to hone their
            fighting skills, By casting small birdseed packets, which represent spells, or dueling and
            scoring points for each hit, the random encounter usually ends in victory for the playing
            character.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Full scale battles happen when
            a group of players set off together and encounter a collective of Necromancers or
            Elementals who've been plaguing local villagers.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">NERO, an acronym that stands
            for the New England Role-playing Organization, is a new concept in game playing. Under
            NERO's unique rule system an entire fantasy medieval town or world can be created.<br>
            <br>
            In the NERO game, you create character concept for a fantasy story and actually play the
            character. It is much like improvisational theater in that you have a framework created by
            the props and supporting characters and must develop your part as you progress through the
            storyline. Your character's attitudes, ambitions, and history are yours to define.<br>
            <br>
            If the adventurous life is your calling, you may play the part of a wanderer, meeting with
            some friends in the tavern. While swapping tales, your party could get hired by a poor
            farmer in desperate straits, and spend the afternoon slaying a foul necromancer and his
            undead abominations.<br>
            <br>
            If the epic life is not your style, then you can play the part of a town merchant. You can
            make your money selling your wares-and information-for the right price.<br>
            <br>
            Or perhaps you wish to be one who investigates the magical arts, selling your scrolls and
            potions to earn the money you need to continue your studies.<br>
            <br>
            Or would you rather try and become leader of the Mages' Guild? The choice is yours.<br>
            <br>
            NERO is dedicated to the legendary days of high fantasy, while running a fun (and above
            all safe) game.<br>
            <br>
            They have fierce warriors, crafty scouts, powerful mages, noble knights, and benevolent
            healers. There are smelly goblins, blood-chilling spectres, evil necromancers, villainous
            spies to fight, and your very own legends to create.</font></p>
