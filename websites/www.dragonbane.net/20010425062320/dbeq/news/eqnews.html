                Gather round me members of Dragon's Bane, and I shall tell you a tale of a strange and
                forbidding tower, and the brave people who mastered it! Upon traveling the strange lands
                of Vellious I came across a black tower rising out of the newly fallen white snow. Upon
                exploring the tower somewhat I knew that I would need help to defeat the evil that lurked
                within, so I called forth aid from my fellow guild. Upon entering the tower we quickly
                dispatched of the inhabitants of the lower floors, using the magic mirrors to transport
                ourselves ever upwards. Upon reaching the 6th floor we were at last met my some resistance
                from a genie by the name of Vhal'Sera. However, he was no match for our combined might,
                and we destroyed him with ease. Upon reaching the 7th floor, we began to depopulate the
                evil denizens that resided there, making our way to a huge spiraling staircase. Behind a
                secret panel in the wall, hidden by a large tapestry, there lurked 4 evil bats, all of
                which we knew would turn into vampires once killed. Upon killing the first bat, out popped
                Tserrina, the mistress of the foul tower. What followed was a great battle, with us coming
                out the victors in the end. Alas, after awhile<br>
                people had to be going, but 4 of us stayed, and continued to wipe out the evil that
                inhabited the 7th floor!<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                Wow, what a great time last night was! I want to send out a huge thank you to all those
                who attended, even those who came late: Lao, Tanit, Lolan, Carla, Aykin, Gammbit,
                Daarkwood, Tepaloo, CM, Auuar, Raines, and a guild applicant and great Cleric Shauga.
                There were no deaths this raid (yay) and I think that it helped us learn to work together
                as a team, after working out the bugs just a bit. Just as a note, after everyone left
                myself, Auuar, Lolan, and Shauga stayed to give the bats one more try. We were able to
                kill Tserrina again, with the cleric going OOM and lolan at about a bubble of health! The
                following loot was won, in order of the floor we won it on:<br>
                <br>
                5th floor: <br>
                Velium Spiked Skull Helm, 10ac 5str 5cha 20mana 5sv all, went to Tanit.<br>
                Ceremonial Wedding Sword, 5str 3dex 3agi 3sta 6sv magic, no mele stats but an awsome look,
                went to Daarkwood.<br>
                <br>
                6th floor:<br>
                Vhal'Sera Skull Earring, 2ac 2str 20hps 15mana, is now guild property.<br>
                Talisman of Vhal'Sera, 2ac 3int 3wis 4cha, it was NODROP and I'm not sure if anyone took
                it.<br>
                <br>
                7th floor:<br>
                Tserrina's Key, a key which will take you from floor 1 to floor 7, went to Lolan and
                myself.<br>
                Tserrina's Whip, 1hs 7/22 4agi 5str 8dex, effect: Muscle Lock 1, went to Lolan.<br>
                Tserrina's Symbol, 3ac 5int 5wis 5cha 40mana, went to Auuar.<br>
                <br>
                Thats it! I had a great time, and I hope you all did too. You you at next weeks Saturday

                Harken to me member of DB and I shall tell you a tale of evil, a tale of death, and a tale
                of wonder, such as you have never heard before! Knowing that much evil lurks in the depths
                of Howling Stone, and wishing to rid the world of that evil, a group of DBers took it upon
                themselves to go deep into Kaesora, the lair of Xalgoz, and destroy the fowl creature. For
                it was known to the members of DB that Xalgoz held part of the key to the zone of Howling
                Stones. The members of DB and a few friends all met at Karnor's Castle, and headed off for
                Kaesora. Although due to someone's oversleeping, someone who will remain nameless (Mordi),
                the raid started a bit late, we still made it to Kaesora with plenty of time to destroy
                the evil within. Starting from the entrance and working our way down, all was going well
                until a Barbarian, who will remain nameliss (Mordi), fell down a deep dark pit, into
                unknown terrors below. Knowing that our friend needed aid, we all jumped down the pit
                after him, not caring about what dangers may lurk. Lucky for us, the pit was actually a
                shortcut to where the evil being Xalgoz resided. We set about dipatching his minions while
                waiting for him to make an appearence. At last he did show up, and we dispatched him with
                much ease, taking his token to make the keys<br>
                that we needed. Basking in the glow of a job well done, we decided to stay and rid Kaesora
                of more of it's filthy inhabitants. Alas, I had to be off and was not able to stay for the
                fun. <br>
                /roleplay off<br>
                <br>
                Thanks to all the DBers who showed up: Myself, Gammbit, Obfob, Mordi, Zenfinite, Corsenn,
                CM, Sarnath, and Daarkwood being played by Tan. We were able to take the zone easily,
                although there were a couple deaths due to a bit of overeagerness =P Before I left the
                following loot was won: Fangs for the keys went to myself, Corsenn, and Daarkwood. 25%
                weight reducing 8 slot medium backpacks went to Obfob, CM, Sarnath, Gammbit's friend
                Doktor, and Mordi's wife(?) Aidience. The Blade of Xalgoz went to Mordi. Thank you all
                again for coming, was fun, although a bit of overkill. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">This week's Saturday Raid is going to be on
                the TOWER OF FROZEN SHADOW. This is a really cool dungeon for those who have not been
                there, it's set up really nicely. You need keys to get to each floor, but they are group
                keys. I have keys to the 6th floor, the tower goes to the 7th. I need to know if people
                will be coming who have keys, so that we can take more than one group up. A cleric is a
                really good idea, as CR here can be a bitch since the keys are not soul. This should be a
                bit harder than last week, but just as fun. There are no really good maps for this zone
                unfortunately. I would like to start at the same time as last week, 7pm EST/EDT. I hope to
                see you all there!! </font></p>

                take on the tower and try get a little exp. I was running Ualen, and was grouped with the
                rangerduo, Aykin, and Carlaeni. Using camo we quickly made it to the forth floor, where
                things started to fall apart quite quickly. After dispatching of three mobs, we where in
                the process of looking for a safe place to med when we where attacked by two of the shadow
                things. Being OOM, and all of us a little low on health, these two critters quickly
                dispatched of us.<br>
                <br>
                Knowing that Laoghaire was on Aol, I asked her if she could lend a hand getting our
                corpses back. No sooner<br>
                was I done with my request I get a tell from Raines, who logged on just to help us out.
                The goal was to get Lolan on, who has all the keys and get us to our corpses. In the
                process of doing this, Raines has organized with Cm to bring Pan on for the rezzes, and
                Gurunt has also come over from EW to help. We also received many offers from other guild
                members to help with the recovery.<br>
                <br>
                In the end we where all rezzed and back to causing trouble in no time :) Thanks to all
                those who came to our rescue, and to all those who offered to help.<br>

                who couldn't. Special thanks went to Hits and Alancia, rogue/ench, without them it
                would've been tough to<br>

                <br>
                Phat lewt discovered: Ornate Rune Shield, went to Evoc, gratz Evoc! (he happened to be the
                only death on the raid so its good he got the shield :) Throneblade of Yakesha and some
                other warrior wep I can't remember went to<br>
                Brut and Gurunt, nice going guys. Sil was able to get a majority of her Shaman epic drops,
                particular three<br>
                books of one of the tougher mobs. Now you've opened a can of worms Sil, good luck with the
                rest of your quest :)<br>
                <br>
                However, we didn't recover any Jade Reavers for the rng/drd epic, so I will be putting
                together another go at it this coming Sunday, 4pm PST. (Making it a bit earlier for you
                east-coasters). We will need 3 full groups, 4 preferably if we want to go all the way to
                the top Black Reaver room. Bring your batwings as its a long fall down.<br>
                <br>
                Hits was able to take care of locked doors for us, and turned out to be a primo scout.
                I'll see if he can do it again Sunday. We do need a Feign Death Puller though, I'm not
                sure which is better, monk or SK. Preferably<br>
                higher level than not (54+). Can you get 15 or so levels in the next 6 days Shenzi? :p<br>
                <br>
                I don't know of any SK/monks in DB who fit the bill atm, so if someone has a friend who
                might be interested, please send them an invite.<br>
                <br>
                We will be meeting at same spot in EJ, 300, neg2000, right at the zone line to CoM. I'll
                be on at 3pm to supply tports as needed.<br>
                <br>
                Send me a holler via email or game chat if you know you can make, the earlier I can
                solidify who's going, the smoother it will run.<br>
                <br>
                Also, in a few weeks time I will be organizing a raid on Kedge, the opportunity you all
                have been waiting for to max your swimming skill :) I will supply anyone who goes with a
                free fishbone earring. Er, scratch that, I'll pack a lot of scales, hehe. Raid will be
                multi-purpose, send me an email if you have a distinct goal in Kedge.<br>

                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">I've had to change the raid day and time to
                next Monday, 15th, 5pm PST due to when Hits could make it.<br>
                <br>
                We need a lockpicker, and Hits was a great scout yesterday, so it really hinges around him
                for now. I hope that day works out for everyone.<br>
                <br>
                And I chose 5pm as a middle ground for west/east coast, late enough for those working on
                the west coast to do it hopefully, early enough for those on the east.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for the many responses to coming Sunday, sorry bout the change, hope you can be
                there :)<br>
