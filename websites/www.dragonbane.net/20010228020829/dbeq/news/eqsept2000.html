                Naked Troll Race and Party. All members had to make a newbie troll (they had to turn in
                their PK books), race naked from Grobb to the Arena in Lake Rathe! It was a hilarious run,
                and so many actually got lost on the way! Some members ambushed other members on the way
                and tried to prevent them from passing them by killing them. Later, at the Arena, we had a
                Drunken Troll Race around the arena and a Dance Contest w/emotes. We swear we could hear
                laughing from members echoing in Feerott, Innothule, Rathe Mountains, Lake Rathe and
                Arena! Special thanks to <strong>Katzen</strong> for helping with the running of the event
                and to <strong>Mato</strong> for judging the Dance Contest. Below are the results and

                <em><strong>&quot;A band of naked trolls just ran by me?...&quot; </strong></em><br>
                <br>
                Yes, a naked troll run (or semi naked) <br>
                <br>
                When: <strong>Saturday, September 23, 2000 </strong><br>
                Time: <strong>8pm EST </strong><br>
                Meet: <strong>outside Grobb (at the entrance) </strong><br>
                For: <strong>Members of Dragon's Bane and Legendary Heroes and friends </strong><br>
                <br>
                Purpose: To create a naked troll (any race/class), non twinked, buffs/sows ok, level 1
                spells ok, rusty weapons ok. Name must be as close to your primary character name as
                possible with the word &quot;OH&quot; preceeding the name, for eg. I would be Ohcmitchel
                or as close to that as I could get (ohcmitch, ohcm, ohcmitce). <br>
                <br>
                Goal: To be the fastest and to survive in a run from Grobb to Innothule to Feerott to
                Rathe Mountains to Lake Rathe to Arena. Winners will be posted on the websites. <br>
                <br>
                Afterwards, lots of naked dueling, races around the arena, drunken dueling and overall
                partying. <br>
                <br>
                We will have a few volunteers at the start to hand out sows and buffs. Will have a
                volunteer as well in Arena to bind the incoming Trolls and to supply lots of beer. </font></p>

                We also need one (1) volunteer to be a referee who will not participate in the actual CTF
                but will be stationed at the Legendary Heroe's base. Their purpose is to give the LH flag
                to the incoming DB member and ensure their DB member makes it back to the DB base with the
                flag. The referee can help his/her DB teammates in guildchat with instructions, etc. <br>

                1. <u><strong>When and Where </strong></u><br>
                On Friday, September 29th, 2000, 8pm EST, we will be waging a guild war in the zones of
                Eastern Commons and North Ro. This battle is not one of anger, but a brotherly test of
                skills. <br>
                <br>
                2. <u><strong>Basic description </strong></u><br>
                War is not waged simply for the elimination of a nation&#146;s people but for specific
                objectives. Remember this is a friendly exercise between nations aligned as brothers, we
                will wage this mock war with specific objectives other than to kill those we call friends.
                Yes, there will be deaths, but these are a factor of war, not the ultimate goal. Each
                guild will be assigned a zone to protect and a specific base within that zone. In order to
                &#147;capture&#148; a base an enemy player must run all the way around it and return
                safely to his own base. Teams will use whatever means it takes to keep them from doing so.
                We will wage war for approximately 2 hours then consume many beers like friends should. <br>
                <br>
                3. <u><strong>About the zones</strong></u> <br>
                a. We will have a coin toss, the winner will pick which zone to defend. <br>
                b. The East Commons Team will defend the Plague Village. <br>
                c. The North Ro Team will defend the platform. <br>
                <br>
                4. <u>Rules </u><br>
                a. All fighting will be limited to North Ro and to East Commons. This does note mean
                participants cannot go to other zones, simply that there should be no fighting outside of
                these zones. If you do not wish to participate do not enter these zones during the guild
                war. <br>
                b. For combat and travel, anything goes except teleports/gates. Please feel free to use
                all of your skills. <br>
                c. The tunnel zone line cannot be guarded. Parties in the tunnel should be in transit to
                the other side. Tunnel guards may be posted, but should be approximately halfway to the
                tunnel entrance from the zone line or further from the zone. <br>
                d. All participants should be in role play mode. This way the &quot;/who guild all&quot;
                function will not display team locations, but guild flags will still be displayed on
                player names. <br>
                e. No DoT spells, no pets. <br>
                <br>
                5. <u><strong>Warnings </strong></u><br>
                a. NPCs will kill you if you fight too close to them. Please be aware that you will lose
                experience if an NPC kills you. <br>
                b. Remember that unlike NPCs, we are fighting real people here, zoning will only save you
                if you leave the field of battle. Zoning from North Ro to East Commons those you were
                fighting can follow you and continue fighting. If you are in desperate shape you will have
                to choose another zone such as Nektulos, reeport...etc. <br>
                c. This will be battle unlike you have ever waged. The combatants are more talented and
                multifaceted than any NPC, or single real combatant you have fought. Do not underestimate
                your opponents. <br>
                <br>
                6. <strong><u>Questions and Answers </u></strong><br>
                a. Why did we chose these two zones? The ability for all members to bind nearby and
                accessibility was a prime concern. The low level of the zones will also make it possible
                for a majority of players to participate without fear of being attacked by NPC gangs. <br>
                b. The tunnel will become a bottleneck, why not use East and West Commons instead? The
                problem of binding becomes a problem here. There is no direct route to corpses for the
                West Commons team, Rivervale is a bit far and level 15 player wandering through Kithicor
                at night will rue the day they were born. <br>
                Also, keep in mind the tunnel is not the only way to get back and forth through these
                zones, it is only the most logical. <br>
                c. Will I lose experience if I die? According to the new release notes there is &#147;a
                possibility&#148; of losing experience when dueling now. I will make no promises that exp
                will not be lost, but will suggest that if there is any lost, it will be negligable. <br>
                d. Won't the two zone format make this event too long? Why not just play in one zone? The
                original concept for this was simply a team duel in the arena off of Lake Rathe. This
                however seemed to lack a great deal of the excitement of this event. Thus we adopted the
                two zone approach. The &#147;flag capture&#148; format of this event should make it
                proceed fairly quickly. The two zone approach gives a better sense of spontenaety and
                surprise to the event. In fact I suspect we will have time to play more than one game. <br>
                e. If I get killed can other people loot my corpse? Absolutely not. We tested this when we
                were checking on the experience loss possibility. Player corpses cannot be looted by other
                players. <br>
                f. How will this be accomplished, do we all have to join in dueling mode? There is an
                actual &quot;guildwar&quot; function in EQ. This is what we will be using. The leaders of
                guilds can declare war and end it using this function. Basically it makes players PvP to
                all the members of the other guild. <br>
                g. How many do we expect to attend from each guild? This is a tough one to answer. <br>
