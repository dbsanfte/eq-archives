              Joven: <smiles> as you wish carry on.<br>
              <br>
<joven proceeds down a center path 10 minutes into the journey he seen a wind mill over the hills and unknowingly begins walking east of the windmill his part look to each other questioning what going on with him>              Kindain: <shouts to joven> I know you elves have a hard time finding your way where there is no tree's to
              hope from but the cave is this way treehugger!<br>
              <br>
<is oblivious to the words from kindain and continues walking east zeal looks at the windmill and suddenly realizes where they are and were he is going>              Zeal: Oh no!! <shouting> Jov! hey Joven Wait don't go over there Wait! <runs to catch up with joven the rest reluctantly follow pantera looking very worried about her friend><br>
              <br>
              <em><joven's mind begins to wonder as he begins walking over the hill in a trance.<BR>His mind takes him to a flash back of about 6 months after his brother Elijiah and he
              were almost killed by the darkelfs his father is teaching the boys how to fight once again
              but Joven refuses to touch a sword now fighting with a staff which he finds he is equally
              good at his mother and heartwood are impressed with the boys control in the fight though
              he is getting tore up by his father whom is much better he still holds his own well.</em><br>
              <br>
              Jovan: very good Jov! <smiles to his boy as he slashing in with the wooden swords> You work that well you put in any thought to heartwood and your
              mother's proposal about studying with him?<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <grunts and twirls staff to block his fathers thrusts and cuts> not really I wanna make you happy so I will probably just try and follow in
              your footsteps <his father drops the sword catches the boys staff and trips him to the ground>I really wish you would stop doing that!<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <keeps hold of the boys staff and pins him with it> Joven anything you do will make me proud son .. I love you your my greatest
              treasure you and your brother <smiles>and your sister who your mother is pregnant with<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <laying on the ground pinned under his own staff> I love you too dad I do very much <pauses for a second> wait wait?? did you just say Mom is
              pregnant?!? <jovan smiles and nods, young joven looks over at his Mom grinning ear to ear grabs his staff pulls it off of him, positioning his foot behind his dad's heel and kicking his thigh with his other foot causing the man to fall back releasing the staff, joven pops up twirls the staff and jolts it lightly into his fathers stomach> Tag your in! <lauging and running to his mother to hug her><br>
              <br>
              Heartwood master: <helps Jovan up smiles to him> I think he won that round <laughing> he will make a fine druid if he chooses to
              be, quite frankly he may be one of the best with a heart like that.. That reminds me I
              never congratulated you on your coming baby <smiles> how do you know its a girl anyway?!<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: I don't <laughing>she said she did. <points to anilla as heartwood helps him up><br>
              <br>
<there moment of happiness is interrupted by a the shouts of a halfelf at the lift>              Halfelf bard: Kelethin!!! Kelethin!! Lower the Lift WE have problems! <gets on the lift as it is lowered and rides it up and begins talking to the crowd awaiting him> the gnomes of
              Steamfront are under attack by the dragon of the mountain it has come down to feed for the
              first time in hundreds of years there being ransacked and many guards have already
              perished trying to stop the dragon They need help! <br>
              <br>
              Jovan: <looks at heartwood master and to his wife who has tears> We have to do something. <br>
              <br>
<heartwood nods and runs off to his place to gather his stuff as jovan does the same.. his son joven runs after him and watches him as he puts on his armor>              Jovan: <looks at his son snapping his breastplate on> don't look at me like that joven I have to go you know that.<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <sighs> I know father I know I just wish for once someone else would have to go
              instead of you.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: I will come back to you Joven I am not an easy man to kill, knock down yes but no
              kill. <smiling to his son><br>
              <br>
              Young joven: OK dad just becareful and dont worry I will watch Eli.<br>
              <br>
              Jovan: good boy<smile> see you soon son love you. <kisses his son on the forehead and hugs him><br>
              <br>
              young joven: love you too dad.<hugs him tightly><br>
              <br>

              Anilla: No! Find him hurry he couldn't have got far <anilla casts a spell on joven as a form of a wolf courses through his body> go hurry joven please!!<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <he asked around and heard of a group of people who went out to find the local bandits camp and get rid of them he knew elijiah wasn't dumb enough to follow dad so he thought he may have went to watch that so he grabbed his staff and heads down the lift, he finds the tracks of his brother heading east of the road as well as tracks of other people heading that way he follows then and see's his brother ducked under the hill gawking at the local adventures hacking into them which made joven sick> What are you doing here! Dad told you not to leave!<br>
              <br>
              Elijiah: No he told me not to follow him I didn't I just came to watch these warriors tear
              into the bandits.<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <sighs> you know this blood shed is unnecessary those bandits never hurt anyone they
              just hunt for food that's all and look what they are doing to them. <points to the slaughter><br>
              <br>
              Elijiah: well they are thief's and deserve no less!<br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <disappointed with his brother> all right come on lets go home.<br>

              Elijiah: NO!! Your not my boss Joven I don't need you to take care of me I don't need you
              I don't need Dad I don't need anyone !!! <shouts his hostility to his brother makes him uneasy which in turn effects the woods around them for his brother shares a bond with nature and his family he hurts they all feel something><br>
<jovan is in the heat of battle with a large group of peopel tryin to hault the dragon when Elijiah Yells at his brother a shock goes into Jovans heart and he slips up the dragon see's the ranger stumble by the time jovan realized that he was off The dragon had him and bit him in two killing him almost instantly and swallowing him heartwood seen what happen and screamed>              <br>
              Heartwood master: JOVAN!!! NO!!!!! <fire courses through his body as his energies build and the dragon see's this his mouth opens wide and he dives down to bite Heartwood who delievers a burst of starfire into the dragons throat igniting his gas he has for his breathweapon and exsploding his neck sending the dragon tot he ground dead but it was far from to late to save jovan for nothing was left of him to save at that time joven moments after his brother yelled felt the spark of his father dissapear><br>
              <br>
              Young joven: <collapses with his brother who felt it too> dad ?!?! <voice breaking> no. ... please gods no....<br>
              <br>
<modern joven snaps out of his trance and opens his eyes he see's the skeleton of the dragon that killed his father there and falls crying, zeal comforts him hugging him kindain had heard the tell but had no idea it was his father and the remains still were about and why joven was distressed pantera figured it out forshe knew all about her friend and ambroshia was sympithetic but to was alitlte baffled>              Zeal: Joven <soft voice> you didn't have to come here with me ya know<br>
              <br>
              Joven: yes I did <crying> this has haunted me for over 50 years... I have avoided this area at all
              cost but your quest for the rangers of kithicor was natures way of geting me to come face
              my past confront my demons..<swallows his tears down> and I have done that now. lets go finish your job. <walks offs off whiping his face leaving ambroshia and kindain baffeled about what just happened they continue there journey to the mino caves looking for meldrath the gnome><br>
              <br>
              Kindain: <beside ambroshia walking with zeal whispering> I don't mean to intrude but I don't get curious about other often but what was
              that all about?<br>
              <br>
              Ambroshia <nods> I am nosey however what was that about.<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: that dragon killed his father back when he was only 79 he and his father was close
              and when he died he felt it he has been the brooding serious type ever sense.<br>
              <br>
              Kindain: If I may ask Who was his father? <br>
              <br>
              Zeal: one of the greatest men who ever lived his name jovan wolfheart the ranger.<br>
              <br>
              Kindain: <in a shouting whisper> THE JOVAN WOLFHEART?! that's his father?! <strokes his beard> I thought he was a little strong and
              fought hard for a druid before but now I know why. <br>
              <br>
              Ambroshia: I have no idea who you two are talking about but I still can't believe that
              poor elf came out here knowing what he had happen hear.. Loving he is but apparently not
              the smartest guy in the world in my opinion.<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: listen lady he may not be all that smart but he does have the biggest heart I ever
              saw I couldn't have came out here knowing this happen to my father but that's me if is
              strong enough to do it that makes him great not dumb are we clear?!<br>
              <br>
              Ambrosia: a little barbaric but I see your point ..<br>
              <br>
<the group arrives at the cave and joven tells them the plan>              Joven: OK I have a plan <they gather> I am gonna shape change to a field mouse and pull them out one at

              OK? <everyone nods cept ambrosia>Excuse me princess we clear?!<br>
              <br>
