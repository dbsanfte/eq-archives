                    We had our first guild event last Saturday in Upper Guk. There was execellent attendance

                    as the froggies kept training and killing us over and over again. We sure underestimated
                    the toughness of Guk! Anyway it was cool to see so many DB's out and hunting together.

                    <br>
                    This was on alt.games.everquest from Brad McQuaid, Producer of Everquest:<br>
                    <br>

                    there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower <br>
                    level group has the right of way. <br>

                    As for the other disciplinary information in that post [referrring to banning <br>
                    if you harrass/argue with a GM], it sounds like the same policy that's always <br>
                    been in place: if you are warned several times and continue to break the <br>
                    rules, you will be banned. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080"><br>

                    things about this new rule. <br>
                    <br>
                    First, we didn't officially announce it yet. Apparently, there was some <br>
                    confusion and a guide or GM enforced it or talked about it, and hence there <br>
                    was a post on EQVault about it. I've confirmed this and explained the details <br>
                    because I didn't want any false or half-truths floating about. An official <br>
                    posting will be made soon, and everquest.com will be updated. <br>
                    <br>
                    Second, there will probably be an exception made for no drop/trade/lore type <br>
                    items which could not be traded for or bought by a higher level player. <br>
                    <br>
                    In any case, the Yield rule is coming, but don't expect it to be actively <br>
                    enforced until we officially announce it. </font></p>
