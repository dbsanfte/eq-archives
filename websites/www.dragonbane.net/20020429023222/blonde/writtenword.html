            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">*long pause as the cursor blinks on relentlessly</b>*</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I am a 34 year old
            haus-frau who lives in a suburb of Chicago named Wheaton. I am very far from being a so
            called &#147;soccer mom&#148;. My tattoos and leather jacket scare most of the soccer mom
            types away and being on the PTA was never my ambition anyway. I am a student of life and I
            take my education very seriously. I wouldn&#146;t have made it this far if I hadn&#146;t
            the ability to learn from my many, many mistakes : )</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have been exposed to
            computers for most of my life but avoided them like the plague. My father, a physicist,
            always tried to get me interested but in my younger days doing what my parents wanted
            would have been too non-rebellious and we couldn&#146;t have any of that. Blissfully
            ignorant I stayed until &#133;..</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Three years ago I got the
            urge to explore the Internet so I purchased a Web TV and one month later ditched it for a
            computer of my very own. I have been online in one form or another ever since. Naïve and
            childlike, I have blundered through the courting process with my machine and have arrived
            here, scarred, but not too worse for wear.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Everquest has been my
            first gaming experience. I was never one for video games of any kind so I was extremely
            surprised at myself when I devoured the online game and became an instant addict. Interest
            lost for the moment I avidly await the new games coming out this year. To be able to share
            the experience of entering new realms with my friends in Dragon Bane is going to make it
            all the better.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This column is not meant
            to be anything other than a place to read my mindless babble and run on sentences that I
            seem to have a penchant for. Enjoy, critique, explore. I am always looking for ideas for
            topics from the silly to the sage so drop me a line if you get a chance : )</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><u><strong>The
            Written Word </strong></u></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Way back when in the dark
            ages a letter could be written with thought and without spell check could be proof read
            for not only errors but appropriateness as well. Even after slipping it in the envelope,
            it would need to be addressed, stamped and walked to a mailing point providing more
            thought on whether this should be sent. Rashness and rudeness while still readily
            available was not so easy to commit as it is in the day of the electronic word. You had
            time for second thoughts in the good old days.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Instant messaging, chat
            and email have given us the gift of quick communication but have we lost something as
            well? I am constantly deleting things I have written out of intense emotion because I
            don&#146;t want to hurt someone&#146;s feelings or have what was written taken in the
            wrong way, or simply put, I don&#146;t want to look like a moron. The lack of the
            face-to-face and the almost nonexistent accountability seems to have increased the honesty
            in the way of seeing others immediate emotions. In most cases no one will ever be
            confronted for some rude remark written in cyberspace thus the freedom to let your evil
            side show thrives. Regrets in hindsight (if there are any) are rarely able to repair the
            damage done by broadcasted reflex reactions. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Anger, or defensive knee
            jerk reactions pop up everyday in response to a perceived tone or insult where none was
            intended. Are we becoming more volatile with all this new found courage of the faceless
            many that populate the Internet? Sarcasm is a favorite brand of cynical humor for me
            outside of the virtual world, is one I have to leave at the door unless I want to use an
            emote. Sarcastic humor doesn&#146;t seem to work as well unless you can see my classic eye
            roll and my flamboyant arm movements to know I am not being mean or rude. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With no view of the
            person you are talking to every decision they will make about you is reflected in what you
            are able to convey via words on a screen. If you have numerous misspellings they might
            think you are under educated. If you use shortcut abbreviations or &#147;k3wl d00d&#148;
            speak they might consider you to be a youngster. In turn, anonymous users can make others
            believe they are something they are not by the same practice. Case point : the classic
            pretty wood elf nymphet played by a 45 year old beer guzzling truck driver.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I see more
            miscommunication than I see quick communication, daily. Whether it is on purpose or
            accident our lives are changed by it. For those who have regretted a lost friendship or a
            rude word passed on to an anonymous stranger just remember to give yourself a moment to
            collect your thoughts, reflect on the ripples your words might cause, and take a deep
            breath before hitting that reply, submit or send button. It might cut down on your quick
            response time but to me it&#146;s worth it. <br>
