              </strong>Just the other night, after a night hunting in Mistmore, Darbycrash and I were
              leaving Mistmore and travelling through Lesser Fay on our way to Greater Fay to camp.
              Darbycrash was leading over the hills and dales of lesser Fay and I was following and
              everything seemed peaceful enough. Then all of a sudden Darbycrash is attacked,
              backstabbed for 40 hp in one hit by the dreaded Whimsy Larktwitter! We both yell
              &quot;keep running&quot; and zig zag like mad fiends trying to lose her. She continues on
              and on, alternately backstabbing both of us until we've lost over half our hit points each
              and we're wondering at this point are we going to be killed. Finally the zone to Greater
              Fay was in site, and we agreed let's try and kill her or die trying. With trepidation we
              stopped and turned around, and there she was, the dreaded Whimsy!</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">We consider her - she's green? A couple of
              hits later from us to her and she's dead on the ground in front of us? OMG we couldn't
              believe it! Darbycrash then says &quot;that was really dumb running.&quot; I replied,
              &quot;lol yes I know but it was instinct from past experiences with her that made us
              run.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">It was too funny to have run and almost
              died from a creature that is &quot;green&quot; to us now. Well we certainly learned our
              &quot;whimsy lesson.&quot;</font></p>
