              </font><a bright new day is affront and our hero's have just awoke from there rest in the city of Ak'anon where they stayed after there adventure against meldrath. Many gnomes praise them in there deeds for getting rid of the menace one approaches inspecting the party curiously and the crowd comes to a hush.><font face="Arial" size="2" ptsize="10" color="#FFFFFF">Gnimm: <looking curiously at jovens equipment and comes to his staff> ahhh you been here before have you?!<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <looks baffled> hmm? me? oh not in a long time this staff was a gift from a dear friend.<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: I see <climbs on joven's back and disappears in his bag and says in an echoing voice> all you got is a few trinkets and food and water in here your not much of a
              collector are you boy.<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <giggling awkwardly at the curious little man scruffing around in his bad> no I suppose not <laughing> are you looking for something particular in there I would be
              more then happy to assist you.<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: <sticks his head out of the bag> no just looking, I do however see your in need of my assistance though.<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <thinks to himself before he asks> what assistance is that my little friend?<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: well your stuff is all cluttered in here I can build ya a better more effecint
              backpack that will have racks to separate your food and water aswell as your little
              trinkets you see to have a dabble for. See I am a tinker I love to dabble in toys.<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <thinks to himself and remember the time a gnome in faydark tried to build a rocket that would launch him to the moon cause he thought it would be a matter of simple propulsion and ended up clear across the continent broken nearly ever bone in his body> hmm no.. I think I will pass my friend but I do appreciate the thought.<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: <climbs out of the bag> but you killed meldrath you gotta let me repay you somehow, he has caused me a lot
              of grief that little man.<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <looks at zeal shaking his head no> actually I didn't kill the man who claims that honor is the fella standing over
              there. <points to zeal who smiles and the gnome and gives joven a look a death><br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: then it;s you I should be talking to <starts walking towards zeal> come here and let me see what I can help you
              with.<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: <protesting politely> nono that's OK I am really all set,<the gnomes walks at him insisting> JOVEN !! its really not nessacery .. Your DEAD
              Joven! <looking at joven laughing himself silly><br>
              <br>
              Joven: <laughing still> well we really should be off thanks everyone. <waves to the people and wakes the dwarf asleep on his axe handle standing up> <br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: I think I will come with you till I feel I have paid my debt to this man here. <grabs zeal who looks at joven like he is gonna just blast him right there and joven just can't stop smiling><br>
              <br>
              Joven: sir I don't think that's necessary we really don't need your payment.<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: nonsense I happen to be a great mage I can come in handy as well as my scientific
              genius ya know. <stands trying to look impressive><br>
              <br>
              Joven and Zeal together: but what about your work here <looking at each other baffled then Zeal starts talking> your people may need you here. <every shakes there head no and say's take him><br>
              <br>
              Pantera: You boys make great friends in your travels... <laughing hard><br>
              <br>
              Zeal and Joven: Shut up!<br>
              <br>
              <em><pantera keeps laughing as they exit the city zeal with a little companion in his bad and a little clockwork spider name charlotte dragging a crate of things he is bringing with him. <BR>Hours later they hit the main roads to kelethin and felwithe, Pantera feels drawn back
              to her home city before they take off to kithicor. The gang follows her there as she walks
              in as though she is possessed of something. As she hits the main entrance she sees a man
              standing at the paladin's guild. He is a highelf, tall, white hair, wearing plate mail,
              holding a shield and has a large one handed sword sheathed at his side with a big cloak on
              his back. Pantera tilts her head slightly and smiles to the man and he returns the smile
              from across the way. Joven walks up behind her.<br>
              </em><br>
              Joven: ummm Pantera you know this man? <she shakes her head no and stands there unable to speak or move as Joven steps back to the rest of the people in the group and looks at kindain>I don't like this one bit.<br>
              <br>
              Kindain: me either I don't trust elves, present company excluded.<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: he looks a little off to me too.<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: <echoing from zeals bag> I don't trust him either, who we talking about?! <br>
              <br>
              Joven: nevermind lets go talk to him zeal stay here with Pantera <him and kindain walk over to the elf standing who never even looks at them. joven clears his through and puts his hands behind is back> hmm hmm umm hey there,
              how's it going?<br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: Fine <answering only the voice not the man>and yourself?<br>
              <br>
              Joven: hmm? me oh grand... <br>
              <br>
              Kindain: <getting restless> OK what have you done to my friend over there why is she looking at you like and
              why are you looking at her start talking or get ready to get flogged. <br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: <still unaffected> that's nice sir, I'll take two please bag them for me <walks towards pantera and she does the same towards him joven and kindain following behind><br>
              <br>
              Kindain: Hey Hey stop right there don't walk to her .. Stop don't make me use this <rears back his axe>
              Alright I warned you. <swings his axe at Mitchels leg, Mitchel lifts his leg and the dwarf misses entirely and spins twice almost hitting joven who jumps out of the way hitting a passerby carrying a bag of flour to the local bakery sending it flying in the air hovering over zeal as gnimm comes out of the bag of zeal's after hearing a crash><br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: I didn't do it! <get plopped on the head and knocked unconscious by the bag of flower><br>
              <br>
              Zeal: well it shut him up. <reaches back and pulls out the bag and walks over handing to the man joven landed on and helps them both up><br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: <to pantera still lost in her eyes> I am Mitchel Merovingian I prayed Tunare would send me a beautiful woman to
              complete my life.. <pantera nods><br>
              <br>
              Pantera: So did I.. I am Pantera Merovingian ... err I mean Pantheon, Pantera Pantheon...<smiles shyly><br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: I liked your first name better. Where are you heading with these trained
              warriors. <points to the group still trying to get themselves composed from the mishap they just had><br>
              <br>
              Pantera:<still in a trance> kithicor for Zeal so we can finish his quest for his guild would you like to meet
              my friends?<br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: sure. <still looking at her> <br>
              <br>
              Pantera: this is Zeal, the one dusting himself is Joven, the dwarf on the ground is
              Kindain, the woman behind me is Ambrosia and the one sleeping the pack is.. well he is
              there that's all.<smiles><br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: starts to wake up and crawl out of the bag, I am Gnimm Tinkerly powerful mage,<in high and mighty voice and then turns to zeal's head> did
              you know there is a head in this bag?! <zeal smiles and nods><br>

              Zeal: yes and its gonna have a friend if you don't stop moving around back there a
              meddling .. What are you doing in there anyways?!<br>
              <br>
              Gnimm: <and growls as he starts to get into his bag> ehh no your not allowed to see till I am done! <starts fighting him off><br>
              <br>
<joven walks over and starts trying to get the attention of Mitchel and pantera but fails miserably>              Joven: well guys I am taking us to Commonlands now so we can head to kithicor. <makes a circle of prairie dust and starts to chant looking at Mitchel and pantera still oblivious to what's those two are thinking then a blue flame comes up around them forming a bubble and collapsing around them bringing them to the commonlands><br>
<mitchel and pantera snap out of it alittle and mitchel looks around>              <br>
              Mitchel: ummmm where am I? <br>
              <br>
              Joven: welcome to the commonlands Mitchel was it?!<br>
              <br>
              Mitchel: Yes it is and why did you bring me here?!<br>
              <br>
              Joven: cause its still day light and we got a job to do while we have some son and you
              would not leave my friend BE! so your coming with us or your can tell pantera you will see

              Mitchel: <smirks at joven> then lets get to where we are going. After you my lady... <bows to pantera><br>
              <br>
              Pantera: thank you kind sir!<smiles to mitchel><br>
              <br>
              Joven: <sneaks up on pantera and pulls her back from the group and whispers to her> I don't trust this guy something's up with him,<looks at Ambrosia> tell her something's not right
              about him.<br>
              <br>
              Ambrosia: Of course something's not right about him he is an elf nothing's right about
              them personally, but better they with there own kind then one as pure as me..<br>
              <br>
              Joven: <looks at ambrosia> ummm... never mind, Pantera becareful I really don't trust him!<br>
              <br>
              Pantera: will you trust me joven! I am a big girl and know what I am doin OK!<br>

              Joven: OK Hon if you say so I trust you but I got my eye on him!<br>
              <br>
<they reach the Forrest and zeal leads the way till he notices this pack got lighter he looks in it and the gnome is gone>              Zeal: has anyone seen gnimm?! <see's gnimm siting on Charlotte with a box thingy with button on it he uses his tools and tinkers with it looking up and waving to Zeal with a big silly grin> what's that?? no no nevermind. <they reach the camp and zeal goes in alone meeting the lady whom he made his promise to help he stays in for about 15 minutes and comes out wearin a green chain tunic><br>
              <br>
              Joven: WOW I thought they would give you money... congratulations man you look great!<br>
              <br>
              Zeal: I know me too !! thanks for your help everyone you are all true friends <he reaches down and picks up his pack and the gnome smiles to him mischievously making him very uncomfortable zeal gets his pack set and starts walking off back to the commons and the gnimm still riding Charlotte pushes the button on the little box he made and zeal's back pack starts to open like a mechanical door completely wrapping the bag in steel and iron making the pack bigger and about 190lbs heaver causing zeal to fall back on his back grunting in pain> What the
              hell is that!?<br>

              <br>
<the sun begins to set as they get near the exit to the Forrest and growling and moaning is heard in the back ground. zeal looks around and gnimm is gone>              Zeal: Where the hell is he <shouting> GNIMM!?? IF I find you I am locking you in that pack! <looks off in the distance and see's the silhouette of a man walking towards him with skeleton behind him and hears gnimm shouting><br>

              Gnimm: Hey look what I found how do you think it works. <running to them with a skeletal trooper behind him among other things><br>
              <br>
              Joven: Oh no spread out and be careful. <joven brings oout a blanket of fire around them in a semicircle for alitlte protection and Growls attracting the wildlife and trees to respond which begin taking down the undead as they see them.

              <br>
              Mitchel: grrr off her now !! <they turn on him and he begins fighting them as hard as he can she assists with her mace and spells as the dwarf jumps over both of them and buries his axe into them><br>
              <br>
              Kindain: never send an elf to do a dwarfs job <laughing> <br>

              he grabs the mace and hits the skeleton shattering its skull on contact. Pantera grabs the
