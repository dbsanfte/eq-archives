            The primary goal of the guild is to enable and encourage our members to have fun playing
            various online games with each other, in an environment which is respectful, mature, and
            friendship-oriented.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Expectations</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Specifically regarding our RPG teams, secondary characters are welcomed, though members
            are forbidden to<br>
            join their characters to other guilds on our server. We will not restrict members'
            affiliations in other games or servers unless such affiliations bring negative attention
            to us.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Participation</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Participation is expected of active members; this includes the website, forums, IRC
            channel, email, and in-game channels. Members are expected to play together when online
            when possible. Attendance at formal events and meetings are highly encouraged. No one will
            be harrassed for choosing not to play, for placing real-life concerns over game-concerns,
            or for going inactive. Inactive members will not be permitted to vote on guild issues, but
            they will retain access to all private guild communication centers and will be encouraged
            to continue voicing their opinions on issues of import.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Activity</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            A Dragon's Bane member who wishes to go inactive or leave the guild must notify a DB
            Founder. Founders are </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>cmitchel</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> and </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Cyberdragon aka Icewolf</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">. Inactive members may reactivate at any time with no penalty. Only
            ex-members who resign in good standing may be permitted to rejoin at a later date; to
            apply for reinstatement, a formal petition with explanation must be emailed to </font><a href="mailto:cmitchel@sympatico.ca" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0,255,255)"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>cmitchel</strong></font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">, who will present it to the membership for
            discussion.<br>

            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Future Plans</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            Members are expected to recognize that while the Group is relatively permanent, the games
            we play are not. We fully plan to explore multiple games, in the present and the future,
            and when the founders decide to migrate the guild, some teams may be disbanded. Please do
            not join or stay if you become so attached to games that you cannot leave should the group
            founders choose to move on.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Conduct</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            The following actions are considered unacceptable behaviour: excessive profanity and foul
            language in public; cheating or exploiting game systems; harrassment; hostility to other
            members and or innocents; disrespect for the team/group or its leadership; regarding our
            RPG teams - unjustified or unroleplayed griefplaying (player-killing, thievery, training,
            looting, corpse-camping, ninja-looting); lying to anyone. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">These are the rules of conduct that all members have accepted to
            play by and live by. It is with these rules that a member may game online with any other
            member with trust.<br>
            1. Have Fun. Our main belief here is to have fun at whatever game you are playing.<br>
            2. Discrimination and Harrassment free environment. <br>
            3. No cursing in large groups. This rule is to curb anti-social behavior in front of
            members who don't want to be exposed to such behavior. If you swear be very careful of who
            may be around you and hearing you.<br>
            3. No lying about or undermining of another member. This rule mean exactly that. No member
            may lie about another member or undermine another member to someone else. <br>
            4. How to resolve conflicts with another member. First step is to go to that member and
            address the problem. Most times that person will apologize and the issue will be resolved.
            If the problem persists, then take the problem to a Leader who will resolve the conflict.<br>
            5. How to resolve an issue with the Team and/or Group. Sometimes there will come a time
            when a member has a problem with an interpretation of a rule or way of conduct in a game.
            If you have a problem with or question a standing rule; or you have any doubt regarding an
            action you want to take...then DO NOT DO IT. Instead contact a Leader immediately and ask.
            Ignorance is not acceptable as an excuse and any action taken without taking in the Team
            or Group's concerns can lead to disciplinary action. and, most important,</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Harrassment Free Environment<br>
            </u>Dragon's Bane members are of the utmost importance to DB. As such, every member of DB
            must be afforded an equal<br>
            opportunity to become a productive member of Dragon's Bane. Unprofessional behavior
            destroys trust and confidence<br>
            among leaders and members, erodes DB's cohesion and is contrary to our core values. <br>
            <br>
            Dragon's Bane is committed to ensuring that our environment is free from harrassment and
            discrimination, that harrassment and discrimination will not be tolerated under any
            circumstances and that action will be taken against any member who breaches this policy. <br>
            <br>
            Note that harrassment includes, but is not limited to, verbal, sexual, stalking, and
            racial harrassment. Discimination includes, but is not limited to, age, sexual, gender,
            religious, political discrimination. <br>
            <br>
            All DB members and other players, are to be treated with dignity, courtesy and respect. <br>
            <br>
            What can one do should they feel they are being harrassed or discriminated against or
            observes incidences of this type? <br>
            - Ask the person to stop, where you feel comfortable. While this may be difficult, it can
            be an effective way of stopping<br>
            the unwelcomed behaviour. <br>
            - Contact a Dragon's Bane Team Leader, if the harassment continues, or you don't feel
            comfortable talking with the<br>
            person about their behaviour. They can help you in dealing with the problem in a
            completely confidential manner. </font></p>

            terms, he will be expelled from the group and/or team.<br>
