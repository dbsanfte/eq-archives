            All Else Fails</strong></u></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I own a townhome, a house
            that is attached to 3 other units, and is governed by &#147;the association&#148; (a
            management company who&#146;s job it is to care for the outside upkeep). My townhome is
            located on a short court thus making all the neighbors very, shall we say, nosey enabled.
            I am rarely seen by these neighbors so this doesn&#146;t really bother me. I keep to
            myself, am respectful of the others who are in such close proximity and basically live and
            let live&#133;&#133;unless you piss me off.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My immediate next door
            neighbors and I share a common wall. They play music (truly awful stuff) so loud I have to
            turn up my TV to be able to hear what I am watching. They have hammered nails in the walls
            at the most ungodly hours and have a penchant for leaving their fast food garbage outside
            so that it blows away usually over to my front and back steps. Needless to say, I
            don&#146;t particularly care for them but I am a quiet shy chickie who would rather avoid
            confrontations. They are renters. They have been here for a couple years already, so they
            can&#146;t be here forever, right?</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Last week I literally
            snapped. Let me explain once again that I am <u>quiet and shy</u>. When I get angry I will
            stuff it down deep inside and it&#146;s usually a long time and over much abuse that I
            actually lose it. When I do erupt it has been described as VERY SCARY due to my normal
            nature. I guess there is a major surprise factor in there. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Back to the story, my
            neighbors decided to jam out once again as I was watching a pay per view movie with my
            family. As the blaring sounds of &#147;Beat It&#148; drowned out the sounds of the movie a
            white hot throbbing started at the base of my neck and quickly spread to my brain. Could
            it be possible in all my non-confrontational behavior that they didn&#146;t realize how
            thin the walls actually were here? Well I decided to show them just how bloody obnoxious
            living next to a crazed metal-head could be and how cool I had been since they had moved
            in and so graciously blessed me with themselves.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As my family watched
            dumbfounded (yes, my temper tantrums still shock them and they live with me) I proceeded
            to turn my stereo speakers to the wall. I then instructed Larry to go downstairs and do
            the same with his stereo. We then blasted them with the joyous <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">combined</b> sounds of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Macabre (a speed metal band who only writes songs
            about serial killers) and NON (a particularly annoying metal band that even I can&#146;t
            listen to at length, you have to hear it to truly understand, just take my word for it).
            This lasted for 5 minutes, enough to give them a massive overdose of their own medicine.
            After shutting both stereos off you could hear a pin drop in the silence. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday my son ran in
            from playing outside to give me the blessed news that the neighbors were moving, go
            figure. I don&#146;t flatter myself with the idea that I am the cause, maybe just one of
            the factors. I guess they want to go live where the neighbors were more respectful of
            others..&#133;&#133;<span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
