              Kick-ass news - the modem team wins a victory in OGL. See details below.</p>
              <p align="left">Well it wasn't pretty, but we got outta there with a win. Our LMCTF Modem
              team receives their first victory in our 3rd match against <a href="http://www.busprod.com/bishop/aod.htm"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">AOD</font></a>.
              No caps, heh. Game started out nice, DB gets quad then a few flag returns. Eventually <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake</font> and <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Justice</font> grab the flags and the rest was DM. Man my nerves are shot,
              never had to hold a flag for an entire match, heh. After watching the demo, I got some
              concrete stuff, One of the AOD guys disconnected with 2 1/2 minutes left in the match
              (seemed much earlier when we were playing) with the score <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">AOD 58 - DB 53</font>. The final score was <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">62 - 38 </font>in DB's favor. Official score would be 62-58 (adding 20
              points for the d/c AOD). Gotta hand it to AOD, they played a very good match. Hard to say
              who would have won if the AOD didn't disconnect, but those are the breaks with us modem
              people. Have to admit, after hearing quite a few unflattering remarks about AOD before the
              match, I was pleasantly surprised with their behavior. Nice guys and a good clan. Can't
              believe everything you read kids :0 Like to thank <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Omenborn, Gonebad,</font> and <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Eramus</font> for playing, you guys did a helluva job. Also thanks to <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sned</font> for playing backup, <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Nagrom</font> from OGL for being our official, and
              last but not least <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Kimberly</font> for
              giving us a server. OMG a server we all ping decent at!!! There is a <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake</font> vision demo available, some nice (lucky :0) rail
              shots in there. And of course a screenshot. GG GUYS!!! <strong>- [DB]Ho-Cake</strong></p>
              <p align="left">To all of DB's LMCTF team - Congratulations on our win last night. This
              should prove that we can play when we want to. 8=) This game was one of the most intense
              games I think I have ever had the privilege of playing in. Even more so than our last
              match against <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">MK(MastaKillers)</font>. From
              the very beginning it was a GAME. <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake,
              Eramus</font>, and <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">myself</font> made a dash
              for the opposing teams flag, when <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Eramus</font>
              and <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I</font> stopped off for a break at the
              Quad area. We then decided to hang out there for it seemed to be a nice area to hang out
              at. <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake</font> got their flag and never
              gave it up. <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">WHAT A HEART POUNDER THAT MUST
              HAVE BEEN</font>. Have you ever tried to hold a single flag for an entire 30 minutes. WOW.
              One of <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">AOD</font> members dropped in the
              last couple of minutes so I decided to guard <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ho-Cake</font>
              because of the score. We had gotten the lead several minutes before that and didn't want
              to give it back to them. Being kinda STINGY don't you think, but hey what the heck we
              needed to win one for DB and get us all back on track. We succeeded in doing so and won
              DB's first game in quite awhile. With practice and strategy, along with team
              communication, I don't see why we can't keep this new found high alive. I just don't know
              if I can take another close one like that again for awhile. 62(DB) vs 58(AOD) and no caps
              is pretty rough to handle. Good game to all that participated and hope everyone had a good
              time. Special thanks go out to <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">OGL-Nagrom</font>
              for officiating the match and to <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">s[POK]babe

DB will square off against <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">WODB</font> in a scrimmage match and should provide a pretty good
              challenge for the DB boys from what I hear. This will provide a good opportunity for both

              this practice, that is IF you can make it. We know not everyone can make, but please try. <br>

              On our 2nd lmctf modem match so far, we did MUCH better. Man what a game it was! I had an
              absolute blast, this is why I play Q2, for matches like this one. As fate would have it we
              lost, but I'll take a loss to play in&nbsp; that kind of match anyday. It was a see-saw
              battle with each clan taking the lead several times during the match. But <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/ClanMK/LMCTF.html"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">MK</font></a> began to pull away with about 5 minutes left. We made a
              strong surge at the end with <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Omen</font>
              killing any and everything that came into base. But it was too little too late and we lost
              by two caps. Gotta give the game <strong>MVP</strong> to <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Omen</font>. His Defense was incredible, man, nice work! Wanna thank <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">GoneBad</font> and <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Jedi</font>, you all did great and I'm sure everyone had fun (if not, you

              Each Team Leader and Co-Leader will be mailed a Team Strategy for tonight's practice. They

              team has 15 mins to discuss the strategy. Note: there will be no &quot;lone fraggers&quot;
              in these practices. Above all, this is about teamwork.<br>

              Even though all members of the clans are listed above, we realize that there will be

              <br>
              This exercise will give us all good experience in strategy planning, communication,
              teamwork and following procedures. It will foster closer relations between both clans and
              will give everyone the experience of working as a team with players you don't know.<br>

              will be 2 maps played, 20 mins each. Each player is expected to stay the full 40 minutes.
