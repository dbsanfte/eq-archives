              Cyndzia lay in the bathtub, her silver hair hanging slightly over the side. She moaned
              lightly to herself as the scent of jasmine and cinnamon wafted to her nostrils from the
              lightly perfumed milk bath. &quot;It has been an interesting year.&quot; she thought as
              she relaxed and slid deeper into the aromatic bath. It had indeed been an interesting
              year. She had found out that despite all outward appearnces she was not in fact truely a
              tier dal, or for that matter truely the daughter of Mayong Mistmoore and his current
              liason the dark elf queen. Her true parents were in fact both koada dal , high elf,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>devotees of Erollisi Marr. Her true father had
              been held captive forced to watch while the lord of Vampires took his form and seduced his
              pregnant wife. Only his faith in the Goddess of Love had freed him in time to save her. He
              was however to late to stop the beast from turning one of the unborn twin girls to his
              likeness. Then after her birth she was stolen away and raised by Mayong and his thrall.
              Only a short time ago had she discovered this truth and then found her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then trajedy had led to her darkest hour. At a
              gathering involving much merry making Her dark father had struck. Reaching<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>his tendrils through a mirror he enslaved her
              brain and had her slay one of her closest allies, and dearest friends. When the mirror was
              broken so was his hold on her .... Or so It was believed.......<o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              She closed her eyes and slid once more deeper into both her own mind and the bath. Leaving
              only her face and the heave of her purple breasts to contrast with the white of the milk
              bath. She tried to force the images of her childhood from her mind but they came more
              quickly now. She sought to drive them out , to escape from the atrocities both perpetrated
              on and by her. But in these times, the times she was alone, they fought back HARD. &quot;
              How can they love me, ? I look like that which they despise though they claim not to care
              about race but the heart. But I killed one of thier friends who had shown me naught but
              her love. I practice arts they can not even fathom and still they reach out with open arms
              to me.&quot;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> &quot;They don't love you , how could
              they? All the light races and those that live with them drive your kind under ground. You
              are an abomination!! They take you into thier house with thier rules because they have a
              sense of duty<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>but NEVER mistake that for love
              whelp. I am your father and only I love you.&quot;</i><o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              She opened her eyes and saw only two red eyes scurrying at rat height out the door she was
              sure she had closed.That however was enough for her to scream..... But nothing came out.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Ladwenya the playful yet not to trifled with warrior stood in front of her mirror. Naked
              except for the choker she had worn around her neck since the last time she had sought to
              get revenge for Cyndzia by attacking the denizens of Mistmoore Estates and the servants of
              that demon which had made her life so hellish. Her hands made thier way up to her perfect
              breasts. She admired her form and had every right to. She was human and female the
              standard by which beauty was measured, and anyone her race or not would have a hard time
              playing catch up to even match her in terms of sheer beauty, let alone her &quot;leave
              them wanting more&quot; attitude. As her hands roamed and lingered over her perfection her
              eyes began glowing a vey pale red. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Ladwenya,
              you were hunting on my estate again weren't you... Dont bother lying , when my maid bit
              you she made you mine. Not used to this are you, you tease, being the one controlled
              instead of the other way around. Now then puppet to business shall we?? hmmm It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>would seem you havent a choice. My daughter is
              free from my control but you are going to help me win her back. She is in the bathroom
              trying to scream .. go help her.<o:p></o:p></i></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              With that Ladwenya turned on her heals and walked staunchley out the door without
              bothering to get dressed. Her new master hadn't made a provision for that and she so
              wanted to please him. So her eyes glazed over , wearing a choker and nothing else she
              stepped out of her room and into the halls of the home all the members of thier
              &quot;extended&quot; family shared. Why should she think twice anyway she was very proud
              of both her form and her sexuality.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;Wow<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lady'!!! Looking good you sure now
              how to make this paladin want to forget his vows.&quot; Tanithelas...... one wondered what
              in Marr's name was seen in him to have him hold the office of paladin. When blood wasn't
              dripping from his sword he was probably chasing some wench in some bar. There were even
              tales told of his misadventure into &quot;the maiden's fancy&quot; because he heard they
              had &quot;dancers&quot;. Except for icicles shooting from her eyes she ignored him. he was
              not her concern the Lady Cyndzia was. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              She strode confidently down the remainder of the hall and into the bathroom. As she slowly
              opened the door she was met with the scent of Jasmine from the bath and corriandyr<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>from the candles. Next she saw the dark-elf
              cowering speechless in the darkest recesses of the room....&quot; Now now Cyndy if you
              calm down perhaps you can talk .... you really need to relax you are safe here&quot; She
              enveloped the whimpering woman in her arms and held her close... stroking her still damp
              silvery hair. &quot; La ... Lady &quot; she sobbed &quot;It was horrible, He was here he
              told me none of you could like me , that I was evil and you ..... you were merely doing
              what mommy and daddy wanted you too out of duty not love...&quot; she broke down and
              sobbed into the strong arms and shoulders that enveloped her fragile frame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;There there silly girly you know I love you. And as far as evil goes ... while you
              maybe a tad ummmm deviant there is no evil in you.... just confusion. Come look at
              yourself in the mirror while I dry this milk off you.&quot; Ladwenya struggled and failed
              against Mayong's control. She really did love Cyndzia. She was someone she could be frank
              and open with, without all those stares and raised eyebrows everyone else always gave her.
              She picked up the towel and stood behind the dark-elf. &quot;See Cyndy that may look like
              the body of an evil person but those eyes, sooo deep and blue&quot; ,Ladwenya moaned,
              &quot;are those of an innocent person.&quot; She began running the towel over Cyndzia's
              body first those perfect feet, then those exquisite legs, lingering on the heaven that was
              between them, then slowly up her waist. Both of thier breaths were quickening now. There
              had always been a special bond between them. Both of them the most deviant people they
              knew. Well some people called it deviant these two prefered to consider it free-spirited
              and openly loving. As cyndzia closed her eyes and moaned at this womans touch her mind was
              all at once filled with the pain of a knee being thrust into the small of her back.
              &quot;ON YOUR KNEES IMPUDENT WHELP &quot; Cyndzia's body crumbled under the shock of the
              blow and her own suddenly off balanced weight until she was face down on the floor. She
              felt someone, It must be Ladwenya, tying her wrists behind her. &quot;Thank you sooo much
              for bringing your night robe in here with you FOOL it's belt allowed me bind you so that
              even if your addled mind remembered any magic you would be unable to cast it&quot; The
              warrioress sneered. Cyndzia felt the knee return to her back, she then felt a hand in her
              silky silver hair, clenching, twisting , now pulling her face up to the mirror.
              &quot;Laaa... Ladwenya what , why are you....&quot; A hard hand slapped her wet with tears
              cheek., she saw Ladwenya's eyes glow red in the mirror &quot;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Because YOU are MY child no matter how you paint
              yourself&quot; </i>Mayong's venomous voice hissed forth from the wet sexy lips of the
              human female. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot; And YOU WILL give yourself back
              to me before we are done here.&quot;</i><o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The door burst open &quot;Cyn are you okay I heard voices&quot; It was Tanithelas, Staunch
              defender of all that was good and pure, and usually in a short skirt. Cyndzia heard her
              dark father's voice in her head. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">&quot; If he
              attacks Ladwenya they will both die I will see to it so you had better be good &quot;</i>
              &quot;She Is fine Tanit. We were just playing weren't we Cyn?&quot; &quot;Yes that's it we
              were playing sorry to have troubled you Tanit, Please LEAVE NOW and hang the do not
              disturb sign on the door.&quot; Cyndzia's heart sank. She hated being rude, and forcing
              her hope away but she couldn't let Mayong hurt anyone else. &quot;As you wish my ladies,
              Fare thee well.&quot; He turned, dejectedly shoulders slumped, to leave. &quot;That was
              rude Cyndzia, Apologize to him NOW.&quot; &quot;Tanit wait please I am sorry, I didn't
              mean to be rude is there anything I can do? ... you are welcomed to stay here with
              us.&quot; Cyndzia purred. She crawled to him on her hands and knees. She kissed her way
              from his clothed waist to his lips before he knew what had hit him. She kissed him deeply
              forcing her tongue between his lips, as she pulled away she bit his lip and whispered ...
              &quot;get out now make some excuse be noble for Marr's sake and don't let anyone else in.
              I alone will face what has possessed Ladwenya.&quot; As she moved to nibble on his earlobe
              he thrust her away &quot; Ladies Cyndzia and Ladwenya I don't<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>know what games you two are playing with myself or
              each other But I'll have no part of it.&quot; He turned and stormed off. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;You were foolish to have unbound my hands to serve him father.&quot; She cast a
              spell to bind his feet so she could leave the room. Success. She turned to leave <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;I will find you later deeper in the house and
              harm more &quot;</i> She hesitated for a moment .. that was all he needed. Though his feet
              were bound he too could cast spells even though the body he possessed could not. The door
              warped and bent and swelled so tightly shut<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that
              Cyndzia knew her frail muscles would have no hope of budging it. She knew she was no match
              for him alone she must turn to another more powerful. To she who had released her light
              father in time to save the other daughter from her dark father all those years ago. She
              knelt and bowed her head &quot; Erollisi, Goddess of love and my new patron I call upon
              you to lend me your aide as you did my father lo those many years ago help me raise up and
              defeat this evil.&quot; She closed her eyes to await her fate. the spell would end soon,
              Ladwenya would be upon her and she would struggle no more. There truly was no point. If
              her goddess didn't aide her she was doomed .. if she did help then any actions Cyndzia
              needed to take would be taken the same way Ladwenya's actions were now, as nothing more
              than a puppet. She could feel the spell weakening, her arm moved and smashed the full
              length mirror. Her bare hand picked up a large sharp shard. &quot;You will never have me
              again father&quot; She moved the glass and mecury knife towards her heart If erollisi did
              not save her she still would not be held again by his vileness. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The door splintered and shattered. Standing amid the rubble after the smoke cleared was
              Tiala, High Elf Paladin.&quot;Mayong Mistmoore In the name of Erollisi Marr Goddess of
              love and mercy I command you Leave this place and these women or feel her wrath and the
              blade of my sword.&quot; Ladwenya's lips smiled though her eyes were filled with fear. She
              knew but was trying to hide from Mayong that tiala would kill her if she had to. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;I don't think you will, You may hate and despise
              me but you won't kill Ladwenya to dispatch me.&quot;</i> He made Ladwenya's lips smile
              then in her voice &quot; No ,Tiala, Please just let him have Cyndzia. We can't keep
              fighting for one of THEM. She has brought us more trouble than she is worth..&quot; Tiala
              chuckled, &quot;You have accomplished nothing but strengthen my resolve. I love Cyndzia
              like none other, If Ladwenya was the speaker I would fight for Cyndzia's honor, And if
              Mayong I am insulted by such an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Assinine
              attempt.&quot; She ran at Ladwenya, head long and blade out. A hand grasped her
              ankle.&quot;No Tiala, You will not sully your hand with the blood of an innocent for my
              sake.Help me up&quot; She strode toward Ladwenya, hands clasped behind her in submission.
              &quot;Bite my neck father make me yours once more and forever&quot; She tilted her head
              exposing her neck, the teeth in Ladwenya's mouth grew. Tiala screamed. &quot;Cyndzia
              No!!!!!&quot; Ladwenya grinned &quot; A wise choice daughter&quot; Her mouth lowered
              towards Cyndzia's soft waiting purple flesh. Her lips closed, Cyndzia closed her eyes and
              moaned. Ladwenya's eyes opened wide as Cyndzia plunged the shard of mirror into the
              human's heart, the mouth fell from Cyndzia's throat. Both women collapsed on the floor.
              &quot;Tiala,&quot; Cyndzia coughed &quot;Get mother tell her she has a resurrection or two
              to perform.&quot;<o:p></font></p>
