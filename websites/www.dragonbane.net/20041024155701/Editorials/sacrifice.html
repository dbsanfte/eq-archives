        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        I want to discuss helping others this time. Last night while playing EQ, I was the
        beneficiary of some amazing sacrifices on the parts of my friends (and even a couple of
        strangers). Every one of them died so that I might gain something.<br>
        <br>
        To my own shame, I was so numbed by my own losses involved in this, that I improperly
        displayed my gratitude. Well, to all involved, let me pubicly express my gratitude. Come
        to think of it, pretty much everyone I grouped with last night, even briefly, went above
        and beyond the call. Not everything went well, but after reflecting upon it, that makes
        things all<br>
        that much better in the end.<br>
        <br>
        So, I want to say, to Akurei, Zasc, Magool, Euclidian, Tantricone, Iceberg, Cmitchel,
        Kalene, Flinte, Aoramek, Mortag, Garadel, Pantera, and Kaylan - Thanks! You all helped me
        on a difficult night. You may not have realized it, but you did. Many of you were having
        difficult nights of your own, and I can only hope that somehow I helped make some of the
        misfortunes we endured a little bit better. You were all terrific, thank you.<br>
        <br>
        In some ways I can't help but feel unworthy of such great sacrifice. But that doesn't make
        me any less grateful!<br>
        <br>
        So it got me to thinking. We all know people who assist us as we pass through Norrath.
        They assist us without any gain to themselves aside from just knowing that they did
        something NICE.<br>
        <br>
        So please, take the time to say thanks for someone's sacrifice. They may not have died for
        you, they may not have camped something for hours for little or no exp so that you could
        gain. But then again, they might have. <br>
        <br>
        Thank the druid or wizard who is kind enough to gate you around so that you don't have to
        take the boat, or cross Kithicor at night. Thank the stranger who heals you when a fight
        is looking bad, or intercedes so that you can escape.<br>
        <br>
        During the past few days I had been so stupid, eyes so glumly focused upon my exp bar that
        I had closed my eyes to the hundreds of wonderful people who make this game so damned
        addicting.<br>
        <br>
        Norrath is populated with a myriad of heroes large and small. Too often we focus on the
        villains and bastards, we see petty insults thrown, accusations of kill stealing, and
        other acts of selfishness, greed and betrayal. So please, I urge you, open your eyes. If
        you really take the time to observe what's going on as you pass through the world, you
        will also see that all<br>
        the little acts of good, the minor sacrifices, truly do outweigh the blatant acts of
        pettiness that seem to normally get focused upon.<br>
        <br>
        Take a moment to help a stranger. Throw a heal or two on that warrior you see sitting
        under a tree healing up. Bind that poor person who's desperately shouting for one. I could
        go on and on about minor acts of selfless kindness we can perform, but you'll see the
        opportunities if you look.<br>
        <br>
        And to those of lofty level who look down their noses at the struggles of newbies, be a
        hero equivalent to your experience! Answer a question, step in and help that poor level 3
        monk with three fire beetles on him. Make someone's day, leave them thinking &quot;Wow, I
        can't wait until I can do that!&quot; Because odds are, if YOU do that now, they'll do it
        too, when they can. <br>
        <br>
        Sacrifice a moment to help someone. Your minute sacrifice can truly help make this game
        more enjoyable for everyone in the long run.<br>
        <br>
        And that, in the words of Forrest Gump, is all i have to say about that.<br>

        Oh, one more thing. If you have a memorable incident where someone assisted you, let me
        know; I would love to write a column in praise of specific heroes and their brave deeds.
        Or, submit them to Kadaf for consideration as Player of the Week!</font></p>
