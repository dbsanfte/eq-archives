            of the Children</strong></u></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This has been an ongoing
            bitch for me, the violence that seems to be the trend in the American schools today. It
            bothers me enormously because as I watch the news I don&#146;t see anyone going back to
            the root of the problem. I see prevention in the form of metal detectors, cameras and
            locked school doors but no one is doing anything about why. Every horrible shooting
            incident committed by a child in a school has pivoted around a bullying or teasing
            situation. How bad does a kid have to feel to bring a gun or weapon to school? How bad is
            the situation for them to think this is the only way to stop the torture? I don&#146;t
            have to imagine how these kids are feeling, I went to grade school and junior high too.
            Some of the worst memories of my life. I never took a gun to school but I was miserable
            enough to have revenge fantasies of my own.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I see parents, and
            authority figures saying all the same old lines. &#147;Kids will be kids&#148;, &#147;Kids
            are cruel&#148;, &#147;These kids need to learn how to deal with bullies&#148;. Well let
            me tell you they are, they have found a new terrifying way. I love the groups of adults
            that blame the music, games and movies. Human beings have been doing horrible things to
            each other for ages before any of that stuff existed. Did Nero play Doom? Did Leopold
            &amp; Loeb listen to Marilyn Manson? I don&#146;t think so.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I went so far as to write
            my congressman. 3 months later I got a very nice form email (I didn&#146;t even rate a
            letter I guess) thanking me for my thoughts when they very obviously had no idea what my
            thoughts actually had been. My ideas weren&#146;t anything special just a little common
            sense. Stop the bullies, stop the borderline teasing.. From the principals to the lunch
            ladies, they are all capable of stepping in when they see a problem. Special classes
            dealing with the problem. Zero tolerance for repeaters. These kids that are striking out
            so violently need to feel like they have someone on their side and some other way of
            dealing with a miserable situation other than a weapon and death.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As an adult now with my
            own 10 year old son I see kids everyday at his school. I have even gotten out of the car
            when picking him up on several occasions to break up a fight or stop a group from chasing
            an individual. The other parents sitting placidly in their cars trying to decide if they
            should get involved. &#147;Yes!&#148; I want to scream to the heavens, &#147;Get involved
            !&#148; if it is only to say &#147;Is everything all right here?&#148; you will be showing
            them (all the kids) that you care. You are the adult. During one of these experiences a
            child was running and crying while a group of children chased him. I got out of my car and
            intercepted the group to ask what the problem was. One of the chasers started to justify
            himself by saying the chasee lied about something or other and they were just scaring him
            to teach him a lesson. Scaring him to teach a lesson,&#133; it made me wonder who taught
            this child such a valuable (extreme sarcasm here) lesson that he is now passing on to
            others?&#133;&#133;&#133;.<br>
