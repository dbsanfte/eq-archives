        one side or the other.<br>
        <br>
        So you've just killed a mob and the rush of the fight is fading. You're talking a bit with
        your groupmates, perhaps you're trying to remember who's turn it is to loot, perhaps the
        looter is A.F.K. (Away From Keyboard). Total side note. Hey Verant, isn't the purpose of
        an acronym to abbreviate something and make it shorter? So why do you spell it out AND use
        the acronym? Excuse me, I had to step A.F.K. (Away From Keyboard) because the UPS (United
        Parcel Service) guy was here with a part for my PC (personal computer) that I ordered from
        IBM (International Business Machines). Now where was I?<br>
        <br>
        Oh yeah. So that mob has sat there unlooted for a moment at the feet of your group. Along
        comes some grabby Gus and loots it! Right out from under your nose. The sheer gall. I'm
        terribly sorry jerkoff, but you could ASK (no, that's not an acronym). It's a verb,
        meaning to request permission, to seek authorization, to obtain consent or denial. To be
        polite.<br>
        <br>
        Yeah, we were just standing here, that mob just fell from the sky, really. No, you earned
        the plat coins and FS weapon just because you walked by. Not like we killed it or
        anything, or deserve to loot it.<br>
        <br>
        Do you walk by someone's table at Mc Donald's and snag their Big Mac because they don't
        happen to be chewing on it at that moment? Maybe not, but I bet you'd snatch a handful of
        fries, dumbass.<br>
        <br>
        It might surprise some people, but even high level folks need money. Just because they
        don't loot something within a nanosecond of killing it doesn't mean they don't want it.
        And even if they don't want it, it doesn't mean they want you to have it. Sure, sometimes
        people happen to be around an<br>
        unlooted mob that they didn't kill. But I guarantee you 99.999% of the time, if you see a
        mob at someone's feet, they killed it and just haven't looted it yet. Just because the
        priviledged loot time has expired doesn't make it right for you to walk up and grab
        someone else's earned loot. Ask permission first. <br>
        <br>
        I'm going to continue to beat a dead horse here (before looting it). This instance of loot
        snatching is mostly prevalent in newbie zones where people hunt guards. Low level
        characters seem to have this idea that high level players don't need loot, and are
        obligated to help them out. (check my<br>
        archives for the Intro to Begging column)<br>
        <br>
        &gt;From my experience, ogre players are particularly prone to this ill-mannered habit
        because often many bouncer corpses lie around due to the fact that they have a lore item
        on them that doesn't get looted. One particular lootsnatcher I can think of, used to beg
        and beg for a weapon or two.<br>
        Several days running. Like we didn't remember that a party member felt pity on you
        yesterday and let you have one? Oh and then, this takes the cake; on another day Mr Green
        Con Ogre On Anonymous, I happen to see you in another zone, not naked, not on anonymous,
        and find out you're 30th level! How freakin cheapskate is a person who walks out of town
        naked and anonymous pretending to be a newbie and begging? Holy cow, have some pride, good
        God<br>
        Almighty.<br>
        <br>
        Anyhow, to recap. Other people aren't playing to make YOU rich. Even if they happen to not
        immediately loot something, that doesn't make it right for you to grab it out from under
        them. Ask permission first.<br>
