        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I play a ranger. A hybrid. Theoretically a
        hybrid combines the powers of the two parent classes (warrior and caster) and is, as
        Verant has repeatedly stated, a very powerful character. However, as most high level
        players are aware, the hybrid classes aren't all that powerful, and in fact, have some
        glaring weaknesses. In EQ, mostly it seems the hybrids combine the weaknesses of the
        parent classes rather than the strengths. I'm primarily going to focus upon the ranger
        aspect of the 3 hybrid classes, that being the one I have personal experience with. Much
        of what I mention will be ranger specific, but some of it applies generally to paladins
        and shadowknights as well. This is a topic I have been loathe to address for fear of
        people thinking this to be no more than another &quot;ranger whine&quot; session, but last
        night something happened to me that pushed me over the top. <br>
        <br>
        While in Trakanon's Teeth zone, I, a level 52 ranger, was set upon by a froglok Shin
        Warrior which conned green to me. I'm not certain of the creature's exact level, but I
        would estimate it at 35. This froglok killed me. KILLED, by a creature which would have
        gained me no experience had I defeated it. That just strikes me as wrong. (If it can kill
        you, you should get experience for killing it.) When I encountered it I was at 80% mana
        and full health, with level 52 cleric buffs including symbol. I was in a corner,
        surrounded by undead spectral creatures, most of which were blue cons, so outright fleeing
        really wasn't an option since this bastard frog had so rudely stripeed me of invisibility
        to undead. (Truthfully, the reason I didn't flee was that I expected my groupmates to turn
        back and assist me, but they didn't arrive in time.) I fought the creature until it had me
        down<br>
        about half, then rooted it, backed off and healed myself, but was unable to leave because
        of the surrounding undead. Shortly after, the root broke and my doom arrived before my
        groupmates. Now, I know monsters have the edge over players at the higher levels, and some
        monsters are drastically more powerful than their level would indicate (giants being a
        notable example). However, this struck me as totally ridiculous- this was a green con
        average everyday mob, dozens, if not hundreds, just like it all over; it wasn't some giant
        or cyclops! <br>
        <br>
        If a level 35 warrior attempted to attack a monster or player 17 levels higher, he'd get
        slaughtered! So how is it that this froglok was able to waste me? Well, for all intents
        and purposes, this froglok was only fighting a level 40 warrior, who was healed by a level
        24 druid. But I would imagine that a level 40 warrior grouped with a level 24 druid could
        easily have defeated this froglok, so why was I unable to? In part, yes, I wasn't fully
        prepared for a fight (since I had a druid in my group I didn't have my own damage shield
        memorized, and also the fact I was cornered by numerous more<br>
        powerful mobs prohibited any sort of kiting) but still I must admit the outcome left me
        flabbergasted.<br>
        <br>
        Another disgusting example is that I have a level 35 druid character, and playing the 35
        druid and the 52 ranger, they both look at the same monsters and think &quot;I wonder if I
        can solo that.&quot; Pretty embarassing that in one case, a ravenous brute in Dreadlands,
        the druid was, in fact, able to solo<br>
        one, but the ranger had to flee! A difference of 17 levels but the druid killed it and the
        ranger fled. I think that makes a pretty powerful statement about the effectiveness of
        hybrids, ranger specifically. But of course, the ranger, combining the weaknesses of the
        warrior and the weaknesses of the druid, comes out as much less than either, despite the
        fact that Verant doesn't seem to see it.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike some other games that determine combat based upon level (D&amp;D being a noteworthy
        comparison since so much of EQ is a pretty blatantly D&amp;D inspired), EQ uses skill
        caps. Herein is where we begin to run into trouble. For all intents and purposes a level
        50 ranger is about comparable to a level 40 warrior and a level 24 druid. He has roughly
        the melee skill caps of a level 40 warrior (much less in some of the skills), and for the
        most part, the spells of a level 24 druid (but only some of them). Now, we've all played
        the game enough to know what happens when a character of a much lower level engages a
        monster of higher level.: the tanks miss often and don't do much damage when they do hit,
        and the casters find their spells resisted. Now, to EQ's credit, spell resists do largely
        seem dependant upon relative level of caster and target, so hybrids really don't get
        resisted any more or less often than their parent caster class, even if their spell
        selection stinks. However, is a level 50 druid going to do very well if he's fighting with
        his level 24 spells memorized? Of course not; they don't hit for much, and aren't as mana
        efficient as higher level versions. But where hybridstruly lose out is in melee. Lower
        offense/weapon skill means hybrids miss more often and hit for lower amounts compared to
        warriors. Lower defensive skills, coupled with lighter armor and lesser hit points mean
        the hybrids take much more of a beating than warriors do, also. Because of the fact that a
        hybrid's SKILL CAPS determine his melee combat rather than his level, he isn't as strong
        as you would think.<br>
        <br>
        Well, a hybrid can't be just as powerful or well-armored as a warrior, of course, so what
        can be done? It's not an easy question. Personally, I think that even if the warrior and
        hybrid had equal offensive and defensive skills, the warrior would still be the far
        superior fighter due to tougher<br>
        armor, higher strength, more powerful weapons, and more hit points. It should be the lower
        hit points, less weapon variety and lighter armor that make the hybrid a lesser fighter,
        not those factors AND the lower skill caps. Hybrids come up out short in melee on both
        ends., both in skills and equipment. If he has lower skill caps, why can't a hybrid use
        anything a warrior can? He's still not going to be as good with a weapon or get as much
        protection out of the armor due to the skill caps, right? But no, hybrids have to get
        penalized twice.<br>
        <br>
        As for their spells, again hybrids take a double hit: not only do they only get spells of
        much lower level than the parent caster class, they only get a smattering of them, AND
        they get a lot less mana with which to use them. A hybrid should either get the spells at
        the same level as the parent caster and have the current mana penalty, or they should get
        the spells in the manner they do now but have their mana calculated using the same formula
        as the parent class.<br>
        <br>
        Let me elaborate on these spell concepts a bit more:<br>
        <br>
        Case A: Hybrid gets the exact same spell selection they have now, and at the same levels,
        but they have the same amount of mana as the parent caster of their level. So in effect,
        what you have is not a level 24 druid in a level 50 ranger's body, but a level 50 druid
        using level 24 spells. The real<br>
        druid is still going to be far superior due to more potent spells and higher base wisdom,
        but this would at least give the ranger some use from the weak spells he gets by being
        able to cast them in quantity, so as actually to be EFFECTIVE with them, rather than
        merely being neat parlor tricks. <br>
        <br>
        Case B: Hybrid gets limited mana compared to parent caster, as they do now, but has the
        full array of spells as the parent class, given at the same levels. This concept may sound
        horrifying to druid or cleric, but bear in mind, even if the hybrid has the full array of
        spells, with their limited<br>
        mana pool they'll only be able to use a couple of them. Perhaps leave out the
        &quot;defining&quot; spells of the parent class, such as the group gating for druids, or
        the exp resurrections for clerics, or the high level pets of the necromancer, but
        otherwise give the hybrid the same spells at the same<br>
        level as the parent class, just with less mana to make use of them.<br>
        <br>
        I've heard a lot of people say things like &quot;rangers used to kick ass&quot; and
        &quot;rangers peak way early.&quot; That's because at the lower levels, when their skill
        caps are par with a warrior and what limits them is lighter armor and weaker weapons,
        they're still EFFECTIVE. Even though their spells were a lot weaker, the monsters were,
        too. At level 20, a ranger tossing his lightning bolts can still be EFFECTIVE as a
        spellcaster, rather than just pissing the monsters off but not really doing much more than
        that. Big deal that a ranger at 52 can nuke out about 1500 points of damage on a full bar
        of mana, considering that the average monster they fight has about 15,000-20,000 hit<br>
        points.<br>
        <br>
        As things stand now the hybrid loses out in every direction: less mana to cast lesser
        spells, and less skill to use weaker weapons and lighter armor. Verant has overdone it at
        paring the hybrid down, to the point where their effectiveness is in doubt. Coupled with
        the larger amount of experience points hybrids need to advance levels, and the way
        experience is allocated by total number of experience points rather than level, can you
        really blame players of other classes for considering hybrids to be exp sponges that don't
        pull their weight? As much as it saddens me, I can't say I do, because after all, you have
        a character that is in effect lower in level at combat<br>
        and casting taking the exp as if they were in fact a much higher level. Everyone loses
        out, and you have disgruntled hybrids unable to find groups because common perception of
        them is that they take more than they contribute.<br>
        <br>
        Something really needs to be done before these classes become total dinosaurs that nobody
        will play, and more importantly, before the people who play them become so disgusted that
        they abandon the game rather than start all over as a &quot;worthwhile&quot; class.<br>
