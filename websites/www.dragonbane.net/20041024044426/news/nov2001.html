                Sandman<br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As of tonight's meeting, it is
                official....... Dragon's Bane now has a Team Deathmatch team. We will start challenging on
                the OGL ladder as soon as Cyberdragon creates the team (hint-hint), and the team is
                populated with players. I will begin configuring the server this week. The people offering
                their time and resources to make this team a reality are as follows: <br>
                <br>
                Captain/Server Admin - <strong>Sandman </strong><br>
                OGL Match Scheduler - <strong>Pufftgd </strong><br>
                Scrim Schedulers and Strategists - <strong>Gadzilla and Tumult </strong><br>
                BC Server - Iridium can you do this again? <br>
                <br>
                Practices will continue to be on Monday at 8:30pm on the ETG mirc server, #DragonsBane. <br>
                <br>
                I have talked to several members this last week, but officially........anyone that would
                like to play on the team please return this email. There will be a few criteria that
                interested players should be able to fulfill, in order to insure that the team doesn't
                fall to pieces. They are basic, and things that we have had problems in the past. If these
                aren't adhered to, then those players will not be put on game rosters until they are more
                serious. Here they are: <br>
                <br>
                - Players should be able to make 3 of 4 practices each month. <br>
                - Players should attend the practice on the week of a game that they would like to play. <br>
                - Players should show up for matches that they are on the roster for (on time and ready
                for 30 min. warm up). <br>
                - BC must be functional...... both transmission and receive. <br>
                - BC should not be constantly abused to the point that it disrupts other players. <br>
                - Players should follow what basic strategy there is in TDM..... not run around and do
                your own thing. <br>
                <br>
                Let's get this baby going........ </font></p>

                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We mounted a surprise attack on Midgard
                from the other frontier, taking many enemies down a long the way. We were at least 40

                against the infidels. <br>
                <br>
                Some of the guilds represented (but by no means includes all), included: Dragon's Bane,
                Pro Patria, Riders on the Storm, Celtic Crusade, Chaotic Order, The Jesters, Power Within,
                Army of Darkness, and Mith Mire. <br>
                <br>
                Plenty of realm points were obtained and unfortunately due to the large number of people,
                a lot of link deaths occurred in the height of battle on both sides. Eventually we were
                defeated deep in their territory, but the victories along the way were as sweet as could
                be! </font></p>

                evil creatures from in front of our frontier castle, several members of Dragons Bane were
                viciously attacked by cowardly high level invaders from one of the inferior realms,
                fearing honorable hand to hand combat with our superior forces, they attacked by<br>
                surprise from a distance using siege weapons on our most defenseless and lowest ranking
                players. After taking some losses, we regrouped with help from other superior Hibernia
                realm members and revived our players and continued removing the evil creatures. We were
                again attacked with siege<br>
                weapons and suffered only one loss this time. Again he was revived and we grouped with
                other Realm players and the cowardly other realm scum hid from our superior forces. Later
                when we were just 4 members, we were attacked by another Invader Infidel, and we quickly
                dispatched him to his afterlife, thus scoring our first R vs R kill.<br>

                that is knowledgable about using SCSI drives in a Win2k Server environment. I am still
                have trouble getting the TA server up and running on Win2k with the new SCSI Drive. The
                O/S will install, then upon the first boot after the installation (and every boot
                thereafter) the O/S will hang after the &quot;log in&quot; and &quot;personalizing
                settings&quot; screens. There are no error messages displayed on the all blue screen, and
                the mouse continues to work, so it is not frozen. I am sure that the cause is a SCSI
                issue, because I borrowed an IDE drive, removed the SCSI card, and performed the exact
                same install, and the O/S installed and performed perfectly. The SCSI hardware works<br>
                fine under a Win98 O/S........ but not under Win2k Server. The symptoms are not caused by
                a bad CD, because both CD's (Win2k Server and Win2k Advanced Server) seem to work great.
