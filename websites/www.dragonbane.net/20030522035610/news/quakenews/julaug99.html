              </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">Re OGL Match. Well, it was a touch
              match and the other team was constantly swamping our base. We ended up with a 7-4 loss. We
              had problems with the wodb server until about 15min before the match and we're not able to
              practice and go over our strategy. Considering this, I think our team did a good job.
              Another note, we have been challenged by HardCore 69. Although, I'm not sure how that
              works because when I tried to make a challenge after our match, it said I had to wait
              24hrs. It seems unfair that we didn't get the chance to challenge someone above us in the
              ladder. Anyway, I'll be speaking with the HPB team soon about the new challenge. - <strong>[DB]Sav</strong></font></p>

              I got 354 frags,,,,, and came in 6th!! and Xfighter came in 12th! I'm used to having my
              mouse set to 25 and had to play with it on 10,, messed me up big time!! And X was used to
              a trackball and had to use a mouse! And they were only 2 button mice! Yech! we were both
              used to 3 buttons!! But we had a blast doing it!! See you all again, sometime late Sunday
