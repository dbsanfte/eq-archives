            rules of conduct that all members have accepted to play by and live by. It is with these
            rules that a member may game online with any other member with trust.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1. Have Fun. Our main belief here is to have fun at
            whatever game you are playing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2. Discrimination and Harrassment free
            environment. <br>
            <br>
            2. No cursing in large groups. This rule is to curb anti-social behavior in front of
            members who don't want to be exposed to<br>
            such behavior. If you swear be very careful of who may be around you and hearing you.<br>
            <br>
            3. No lying about or undermining of another member. This rule mean exactly that. No member
            may lie about another member or undermine another member to someone else. <br>
            <br>
            4. How to resolve conflicts with another member. First step is to go to that member and
            address the problem. Most times that person will apologize and the issue will be resolved.
            If the problem persists, then take the problem to a Leader who will resolve the conflict.<br>
            <br>
            5. How to resolve an issue with the Guild. Sometimes there will come a time when a member
            has a problem with an interpretation of a rule or way of conduct in a game. If you have a
            problem with or question a standing rule; or you have<br>
            any doubt regarding an action you want to take...then DO NOT DO IT. Instead contact a
            Leader immediately and ask. Ignorance is not acceptable as an excuse and any action taken
            without taking in the Guild's concerns can lead to disciplinary action.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">and, most important,</font></p>
            <p><u><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Harrassment Free Environment</font></u></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Dragon's Bane members are of the utmost
            importance to DB. As such, every member of DB must be afforded an equal<br>
            opportunity to become a productive member of Dragon's Bane. Unprofessional behavior
            destroys trust and confidence<br>
            among leaders and members, erodes DB's cohesion and is contrary to our core values. <br>
            <br>
            Dragon's Bane is committed to ensuring that our environment is free from harrassment and
            discrimination, that harrassment and discrimination will not be tolerated under any
            circumstances and that action will be taken against any member who breaches this policy. <br>
            <br>
            Note that harrassment includes, but is not limited to, verbal, sexual, stalking, and
            racial harrassment. Discimination includes, but is not limited to, age, sexual, gender,
            religious, political discrimination. <br>
            <br>
            All DB members and other players, are to be treated with dignity, courtesy and respect. <br>
            <br>
            What can one do should they feel they are being harrassed or discriminated against or
            observes incidences of this type? <br>
            - Ask the person to stop, where you feel comfortable. While this may be difficult, it can
            be an effective way of stopping<br>
            the unwelcomed behaviour. <br>
            - Contact a Dragon's Bane Team Leader, if the harassment continues, or you don't feel
            comfortable talking with the<br>
            person about their behaviour. They can help you in dealing with the problem in a
            completely confidential manner. </font></td>
