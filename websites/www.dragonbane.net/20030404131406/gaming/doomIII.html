            The year: 2145. The place: Mars. We're currently zooming over the Martian landscape,
            passing over a massive installation of the Union Aerospace Corporation. Inside, a number
            of guards are chatting as a scientist passes by and sneaks into a nearby room. Now sitting
            at a computer terminal, the camera pulls in close to the scientist. He's nervous,
            obviously up to something he shouldn't be. His face is lit up by the glow of the computer
            screen, flickering in unison with the display of information on the monitor. After a few
            moments, explosions rock the facility, causing machinery to crash to the floor and sending
            boxes falling off shelves. Cut to: a red portal, with a number of ghostly skulls flying
            out of it. They rip through the installation's personnel, changing them into something
            &#133;not quite human. Elsewhere in the facility, you duck into a corner when a huge
            shadow suddenly envelopes the area. The creature attached to it is at least a few feet
            taller than you, and it's hard not to feel overwhelmed as it slowly lumbers by. You
            smartly choose not to fire your pistol as the creature passes, oblivious to your presence
            &#133; for now. This is DOOM III, <u>and it's going to scare you to hell. </u></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">One of the first things to
            understand about DOOM III is that it's not being designed as your typical first-person
            shooter, where elements like plot and atmosphere often take a back seat to the action. The
            game will take a more deliberate pace, to allow gamers to soak in the surroundings.
            &quot;One of the design goals of the game is to terrify people,&quot; Stratton explains,
            &quot;we're setting up scenarios to scare people.&quot; The demonstration contains a
            number of moments that illustrate this point, including one where your character is
            checking out his reflection in a mirror &#133; and you suddenly spot another creature off
            to the side, rapidly charging your way. While id isn't planning on giving away the entire
            plot of the game anytime soon, Stratton did give us a few ofthe basics: DOOM III is
            basically a &quot;retelling&quot; of the original DOOM, with many of the same characters
            and themes, and even some returning weapons. Most of the game is set on Mars, where you're
            a marine recently stationed at the Union Aerospace Corporation, a company with strong
            military ties doing experimentation with teleportation technology. It seems a few people
            at the UAC don't exactly have everyone's best interests at heart, and after a betrayal,
            things quickly descend into chaos, with members of the facility being possessed and turned
            into zombies. This is where you come in -- as one quote from the demonstration put it,
            &quot;only one man stands between hell and earth... you.&quot; </font></p>
