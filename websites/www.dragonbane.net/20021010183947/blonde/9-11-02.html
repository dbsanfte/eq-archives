            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It&#146;s been a year.
            Not a day or night has gone by that I haven&#146;t thought about that terrible day last
            September. I felt lost because I didn&#146;t understand why someone would want to cause
            such pain. I&#146;ve spent a large amount of time in the past year following politics,
            viewing the many, many hate websites, and feeling helpless as a nameless nobody who
            can&#146;t change a thing. In the meantime our world continues spinning, people keep doing
            horrendous things to others. Has anything really changed? </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As a show of remembrance
            I asked my fellow gamers to write down how this past year has changed for them
            individually. I wasn&#146;t interested in what the celeb of the week, or some political
            bigwig on the tube had to say. I wanted to hear from my friends, the regular joes of our
            world.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Needless to say I
            didn&#146;t get much of a response. Maybe it is still too painful to put into words. Maybe
            with the TV saturation nobody really had anything left to say. I was disappointed until I
            received an email from Cendor. He had taken the time to open his world to the rest of us.
            Thank you Cendor, sometimes it just takes one to make a difference <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

              <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">2001 was not a
              good year for me at all. My father passed away in April. My mother had 2 back surgeries.
              My aunt had heart surgery and I had 2 high school friends commit suicide on top of the
              September 11th events. On September 11th I had actually stayed home sick from work and
              woke up to the news talking about the twin towers. I was half-asleep when I looked at the
              television and seen the second plane hitting. All sorts of emotions went running through
              my head. Shock, confusion and horror were the biggest ones.</span> </font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I didn&#146;t
              know what to do or who to call being as most people were at work that I knew so I logged
              into Everquest to talk to some of my online friends about what had been happening. Of
              course all the zones I was in people were talking about it in ooc, shout, and say chat
              channels. You name it! So I was talking to some friends in my current guild at the time
              and come to find out about a half dozen of our guildmates lived in the very vacinity that
              these events were happening so everyone was waiting to hear from them to make sure they
              were safe. So back and forth I went from the computer to the TV just waiting for news on
              what was going on. As the day went on our friends and family all began getting together
              not knowing what to expect. Once it was released it was terrorist and possibly middle east
              involvement that&#146;s when things commercially in the area started to go crazy. People
              were flocking to grocery stores and gas station (which decided to raise their gas prices
              to over $6.00/gal). Luckily I had just gotten groceries and filled up my jeep so
              didn&#146;t have to deal with all that. As the days went on it really impressed and
              pleased me just how the US citizens all over were responding to helping with donation and
              with labor not to mention just a general increased friendly attitude to one another.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

              passed now in the last 12 months and most people that can have gotten back to their
              everyday life. I think everyone has changed at least a little bit. I had quit playing
              games 4 to 12 hours a day and started getting outside and enjoying what I use to, just the
              peace and quite of the woods. I&#146;ve gotten back into hiking and biking which has not
              only made me happier but I&#146;ve been getting in much better health again as well. I
              plan to continue this trend and use online gaming more as a hobby again than as a second
              career. Just because Dragon's Bane s online that does not mean I don't think of you all as
              dear friends. We form bonds both in games and out in our family/community and no matter
              what game or guild I might currently be in. I will always from this day on consider myself
              a DB member. And since I&#146;m not currently gaming with any of you I just want you all
              to know I do miss that part of the experience dearly. <o:p></span></font></p>
