<p>Ranger epic guide is up in the library. Tell me what you think. :) Druid's next!
<br><br>--H<br><br>

  <b>MARCH 21, 2002</b><br>
The new gallery is now complete. I tried to go functional over aesthetic, but if anyone has
further suggestions, let me know. I truly appreciate everyone's compliments, suggestions and submissions. Thank you. :)
In return, all I ask is that people don't ask me twenty times about when something will be up. It will--but this stuff
takes <i>time</i>. :)
<p>I've changed the library page slightly so that you can tell which links are active or not. If it's in a grey box,
don't bother clicking on it--my apologies for not doing that far earlier and possibly confusing people. I've recently added some tidbits about Haste items and Evac points and am still
plugging away at the ranger epic. Hang in there with me, and as always, if you have any ideas as to what you'd like listed in the Library, just tell me. Take care, all!
<br><br>--H<br><br>

  <b>MARCH 11, 2002</b><br>
The renovation of the website continues; if you look on the navigation menu, you'll see a link to the
Library, which will be methodically filled with all sorts of information to (hopefully) enhance everyone's
EQ experience. Right now, only a quartet of links work--the Foraged Item Tables and
the quest guides for the Trueshot Longbow, Rain Caller, and the Cleric Solusek Ro armor (in progress, but finished soon). The rest will
take time to compile, as you could guess--and I'm somewhat doing them randomly,
although I have more information for certain ones (like, oh, the druid/cleric/shadowknight epics ::grin::).
If you have a quest that you would like researched, or a particular piece of information that you want me
to track down, e-mail me by clicking on my adorable little head in the bottom left-hand corner and I'll be
glad to prioritize them. I would appreciate your patience, but I'll do my best to be both thorough and timely with
information. It's amazing to me in some ways how much *isn't* known about quests after hours of delving through obscure websites for information.
<p>Also, I realize that the gallery page quickly became too cumbersome; I'll work on making it not so graphically intense,
and likely will resort to a much simpler format in the near future. Thanks to those who have sent me pictures, and rest assured
that the gallery page will be less unwieldy soon.

Raadan, Starflie, and I went on our first Naggy raid together last night. There were a few deaths (No Marauders died YAH!!!) and Raadan walked away with a Hierophants Crook, so congratulate him next time you see him on. Hrendra won a GM contest, so congratulate her as well. I learned this past weekend that Raadan, Balbao, and Balboah have started thier epics. And, in case you didn't know, one of our allies, Alliance of the Phoenix, is no more. Roobarb, the former leader, has joined our ranks, along with others, to make Darkwood even stronger. Welcome them with open arms. Check the website out, things are being added almsot daily, especially to the message boards. I try to keep the boards updated frequently (it's rather easy for me to do at work, and much more enjoyably ;P)

Hey, gang, I wanted to ask y'all for a favor--if you have a chance to take a snapshot of yourself, please do so
and mail them to me at Lyon812@aol.com. I need images for the bio page to round out the collection--and if you have
a few lines to say about yourself, please, include them as well. If you send me a picture, please make sure it's in either
.jpg or .bmp format, and taken during the daytime. Something about EQ at night makes the pictures a very poor resolution for
importing into Flash. Thanks!

Big news since the last time anything was posted. The wedding for Skalanis and Lienya will be this Sunday. Check the MOTD for the exact time. There will be a party afterwards, so bring alcohol, for all those lushes :) I'd like to congratulate both of them and wish them nothing but the best. In other news, Darkwood is still looking for someone to step up and prove that they can fulfill the requirements of raid chief. It is not an easy job, but you won't do it alone. You will have two people helping, so if you feel like this is something that you want to participate in, let an officer know. In other news, I will within the next week initiate the first chapter of my epic. Wish me luck and pray I don't die TOO much. Starflie has begun questing the almighty Prayer Shawl quest in Velious, which is a feat in and of itself. We are discussing a way for guild members to retrieve a particular item or finish a particular quest using the guild as help. If you have something that you wish to own, post it on the message boards and if it is within the means of the guild, we will organize a time to retrieve it. Happy hunting and stay safe!

Well, the officers are falling into line and events are starting to be scheduled.
Raadan has been promoted to help assist Hraina in her duties as the recruiting officer,
and Dankena and Nynian have also been promoted to assist Starflie with events. Talked to
Starflie today and she misses everyone very much and is looking forward to getting back to her
game Monday. We have a raid planned for this Saturday and an event for Sunday. If you are curious
or wish to participate in these events, check out the events calendar and then sign up under the
message board. We are making huge strides forward so it's time to get onboard. Good luck to all
and see you in game.

Here it is--the redesigned Darkwood Marauders website. Bear with me while I put some finishing touches on this monstrosity--or at least until my
obsessive perfectionism runs it course. No, really...<br><br>
If you come across any broken links or have suggestions, please click on me in the lower left corner. :) Flash movies are a bit of a pain to work
with, but as with everything else, I'll do my best. Take care, everyone.

Hope this post finds everyone having a happy holidays! I have traveled abroad and am without my computer, so I will not be available ingame until the Wednesday after Christmas. I do have my laptop, so I can further the advancement of the website in my spare time. Keep checking back for additions and changes, especially the guild roster that we will be trying to do on our own, instead of relying on the not so reliable guildmagic.com. In case you didn't know, Lienya has been promoted to second in command. I ask that you would congratulate her and know that her word is law, as far as I'm concerned. I'd also ask that you congratulate Hraina as she has been promoted to Chief Recruiting Officer. There will be a few other positions that will need to be filled, so if you are interested, give me a tell of send me an email. Be prepared to explain to me why you would do well in an officer's position. I will not be handing these out lightly. Once again, have a happy holidays and I'll see you soon.

Due to the release of Shadows of Luclin, we will not have any events planned for this month. This is due to the down time and the patches that we would have to schedule around. However we will begin again in January. So you will need to check back here for upcoming events. As far as this month, just enjoy our new moon. I am happy to see more of us grouping together on a regular basis. We need to continue our interaction, and I'm not just talking about guild chat. And let us all keep our eyes open for worthy recruits. What makes one worthy? I look for one thing- do they put others before themselves. I know each one of us has. I hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season.

Check out the improved site. Something struck me at work today, and I realized that I have been lacking in my leadership, which fails everyone. I have been so involved in trying to get my level up to respectable, that I have neglected Darkwood as well as the website. For this, I solemnly swear that I will stay on my toes at all times. So, to start, I've added some new elements to the site. Once again, if you have any advice, please let me know, I am always up for input.

I am very proud of the attendance last night at the Estate of Unrest raid. I will call it a success because our family has been apart too long and it was good to see all of you. However, as the corpses piled (I think I win with 3 or 4 deaths) it could have been viewed as a victory for the inhabitants of Unrest. There were a few determined (or insane, depending on your stance) who DID in fact did make it to the dwarven room and camped for a couple of hours. We all should thank our friendly neighborhood cleric for all the free rezz's last night (Tekkas' alter ego). DwM's next even will be the naked Gnome race. It is 5pp to enter and the winner will get the entrance fee plus 100pp in prize money. The rules are to create a level 1 gnome and run from Ak'Anon to Qeynos UNASSISTED! You may get a bind in every zone but that is the only assistance you may ask for. Please register a day or 2 in advance with your 5 pp and your level 1 gnomes name, with Ckalla or me if you have any questions feel free to ask either of us for the info.<br>
<br>
Thank you all my friends

<b>NOVEMBER 4, 2001</b><br>
Interesting events in the lands of West Commons, East Karanas, Everfrost, Northern Ro, and Rathe Mountains have caused the postponement of the naked gnome race indefinitely. I hope that everyone has enjoyed them as much as I have. All other events are on as scheduled, with the exception of Zachaiel's night which has been postponed to Sunday, November 18th at 6:00 ET. Information regarding the raid at Unrest will be posted here tomorrow, so check back for the latest information. As for the guild, we are constantly evolving, and you will notice the changes very soon. The decisions that are made are to help strengthen us even more so than we already are. Keep in mind that you are not out for yourself but the greater part of the guild. Stay strong and hunt safe!
