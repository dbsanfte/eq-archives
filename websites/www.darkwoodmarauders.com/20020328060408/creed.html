<font color=#000000>Marauders. Those who roam across the land and raid in search of plunder.<br><br>

<font color=#003300>We roam. From the mirky depths of Greater Faydark to the frozen tundras of Everfrost and the tepid jungles of Kunark,
we are found, taking what we earn and leaving an impression on the minds of all who cross paths or weapons with us.
<BR>
<BR>
We are honorable.<BR>
We are loyal.<BR>
We are noble.<BR>
<BR>
We are proud of the struggles that have made us into what we are. Wealth, status,
aspirations--these are hard-earned trophies; however, we are humble, and well aware
of the whisper of a moment between the top of a mountain and the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
We do not dismiss nor look down upon others, or let our confidence degenerate into arrogance.
We take the time to lend a hand to a stranger in need, yet remain dignified and reserved in the help
we ask for from those outside our family.<BR>
<BR>
We do not panic in the face of insurmountable opposition, but channel our fear into calm and
level-headed behavior, building trust, friendship, and devotion--and smelting heroes in the forge of battle and sacrifice .<BR>
<BR>
We are true..and we are One.<BR>
<BR>
These are the laws that bind us together in faith, the creed by which we live:<br><br>

<font color=#000000><b>GUILD RULES</b>
<font color=#003300><br>

1. <font color=#000000><b>Have fun.</b><font color=#003300> Everquest is a game, and we should always remember that. It is an escape
from real life--and that we want it to be a rewarding, enjoyable experience for all.<br><br>
2. <font color=#000000><b>Take care of our own.</b><font color=#003300>
We should always be willing to help each other if one of us is in need. <br><br>
3. <font color=#000000><b>Help others.</b><font color=#003300>
Rejoice in simple kindnesses and charity--but do not let yourself be taken advantage of. Your good deeds will be repaid
in one way or another, and all of us at one time needed a friendly hand. Be that hand.<br><br>
4. <font color=#000000><b>Do not steal or beg.</b><font color=#003300>
Do not shame yourself or the guild by stealing or begging rather than putting forth the effort to ascertain what you wish.
Do not blind yourself with selfnessness or self-pitying behavior. If you are the benefactor of a great favor, then always repay
that kindness with thoughtful words or a worthy donation.
<br><br>
5. <font color=#000000><b>Never harm an innocent.</b><font color=#003300>
Never intentionally harm or bring harm to innocent bystanders. Be aware of where you fight and travel, and do not mislead newcomers
to Norrath with cruel pranks or deceptions that could lead them to harm or trouble.<br>
<br>
6.<font color=#000000><b>Do not killsteal.</b><font color=#003300>
Accidents happen, and there are many times when innocent actions result in accusations being thrown about. Watch your own behavior,
and be considerate and understanding when these situations occur. Do not, however, killsteal deliberately.
<br><br>
7.<font color=#000000><b>Be considerate about contested spawns.</b><font color=#003300>
There are enough creatures for all of us to share throughout Norrath. If you are camping somewhere--excepting various rare or named spawns--be considerate of those
who may want to join the group, share the spawns, or are in search of specific loot that you have no need of except to sell.
<br><br>8.<font color=#000000><b>Do not excessively use vulgarity or racial slurs.</b><font color=#003300>
Bigotry and hatefulness are not tolerated in any form.<br><br>
9.<font color=#000000><b>Do not harass others.</b><font color=#003300> Harassment is a safe form of cowardice when people are anonymous to one another--but it is still
despicable and ineffective. If you have a legitimate gripe, back it up with authority, and /petition a Guide or contact an officer to discuss what should be done.
<br><br>
10.<font color=#000000><b>Do not spam.</b><font color=#003300> Do not fill the /shout, /ooc, or /auction channels with exccessively improper comments or behavior.
<br><br>

Even the closest of families have arguments or disagreements.  If there is a problem within the guild, try and handle it quietly between the parties
involved.  If this proves impossible, contact an officer in order to settle it. Everyone makes mistakes; however, more than one violation of a rule
will result in removal from the guild.
