TAILORING
<br>
<br>A detailed guide to the creation of clothing.
<br>
<br>To become a Tailor, you will need a Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits
    can be bought at most leatherworking shops.
<br>
<br>Once you have a Sewing Kit and the correct component pieces,
    you will need a pattern for the garment you wish to make.
<br>
<br>Place the pattern and the raw material in your Sewing Kit. Start sewing.
<br>
<br>ON SIZING AND ARMOR
<br>
<br>Armor must be sized to your client. There are three sizes of armor:
    Small, Medium & Large. Some races can wear more than one size of armor.
<br>
<br>Barbarians, Ogres & Trolls wear large armor. Large armor is tailored
    from BEAR pelts.
<br>
<br>Barbarians, Elves, Erudites, Half-Elves & Humans wear medium armor.
    Medium armor is tailored from CAT pelts.
<br>
<br>Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes & Halflings wear small armor. Small armor is
    tailored from WOLF pelts.
<br>
<br>PATCHWORK ARMOR

<br>Patchwork Armor must be sized to your client.
<br>
<br>The size of the armor is determined by the RUINED Pelt used. The armor

<hr><h4><a name="wu_3"></a>Volume 3 of the Chronicles of Wu</h4>

<p>... the orcs struck without warning, and only by skill did I manage to excape.
With no hope of returning to our temple, I hide in this empty camp and devise new
methods of making stronger uniforms. Maybe one day our improved garb will save a
Brother's life.</p>

<p>The silk from the giant spiders has proved to be stronger and lighter than I had
dreamed. It requires but two silks to make a swatch, and one swatch is enough for any
part of a raw silk uniform but the tunic and leggings.</p>

<p>Thinking of a way to improve the silk, I recalled the words of Master Thos many
seasons ago. He waves a bottle of kiola in front of me and proclaimed, "This is both
drink...and weapon. Raw silk has many desirable properties, Apprentice Wu, but when
cured with kiola... there is no better battle uniform for a Brother of the Silent Fist..."
I wonder what other wisdom I would have learned if he had not fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Heeding his wisdom, I have tried mixing various amounts of kiola with silk during
the curing process and have found the results encouraging. The cured silk is much
stronger and lighter than the raw silk, unfortunately sometimes it takes more silk
to make cured armor than the raw armor.</p>

<p>Before the massacre by the orcs we had engaged in conversation with a traveling
Enchantress by the name of Minlapus. Observing our techniques of silk tailoring,
she offered to provide us with vials of thickened mana. By using a greater lightstone
and the enchanting fluid she claimed we could make gauntlets capable of smiting
creatures impervious to our bare hands. A side benefit is that the gauntlets would
emit light, a boon in this dim forest known as Lesser Faydark.</p>

<p>One note I should make is the method by which the nearby centurions make whips.
It appears that they carefully trap a wolf and use its pelt, curing it with kiola,
with a whip pattern. A simple process, but one I had not seen until now.</p>

<p>Dawn approaches, so I must put my quill down and cover my lightstone.
The orcs will be patrolling soon.</p>

<hr><h4><a name="tailoring_quivers"></a>Tailoring Quivers</h4>

Many archers prefer to craft their own quivers.
<br>The simplest of hand crafted quivers can be made in a tailoring kit with
a High Quality Cat Pelt and a Quiver Pattern.
<br>There have been archers who have developed more personal quivers usually
for the sake of style, but it is not my place to reveal their secrets.
