  THE ICE RIVER OF EVERFROST<br>
  <br>
  It was just another day for him.<br>
  Ammonon Ymous, disciple of a growing line of Hobbit Druid Companions, was just
  relaxing in Everfrost that day. For some reason, most people did not consider
  the biting cold of Everfrost to be particularly relaxing. The chill did not
  bother him in the least, however. Maybe it had something to do with the Cloak
  of the Ice Bear about his shoulders.<br>
  It was a lazy, fine day, and nothing much was happening, so Ammonon decided
  that he would just mosey into Halas and crash for the night. However, a voice
  was blaring across the frozen plains . . .<br>
  &quot;Paying well for the location of Karg Icebear!&quot;<br>
  Ammonon had heard of Karg; he was the most sought-after, and therefore the
  most elusive, figure on the tundra. Ammonon decided that it would be good
  practice and perhaps a bit rewarding to take time to search for this legendary
  man.<br>
  He searched all over the tundra, trying to pick up tracks of the man, but it
  appeared that he hadn't been around for quite some time. He was extrememly
  bored, however, so Ammonon had no problems with continuing his search for a
  little bit longer.<br>
  Then a message came in on Ammonon's Tell Crystal. The voice on the other end
  was requesting a transportation to the continent of Faydwer.<br>
  &quot;How much?&quot; he querried, starting to get bored of the Karg hunt.<br>
  &quot;Umm . . . 5 plat? A humble shaman of the seventh circle doesn't have
  much.&quot;<br>
  This truly piqued Ammonon's interest. Being the nice guy (some would say sop)
  that he was and really having nothing else to do, he was willing to transport
  the man for free. But he wondered why the barbarian would choose to leave his
  home for the land of the elves, where it would be difficult to acquire his
  Shaman spells...</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Ammonon, having trained himself to be able
  to conduct several actions simultaneously, thought that he could easily chat
  with this shaman while continuing his wanderings and searchings for Karg.
  However, the communication almost proved a fatal distraction to him.<br>
  <br>
  Ammonon plunged without warning into an icy river, slipping beneath the
  ice-covered surface. He realized that he had found a hole in the ice and,
  while he was quite surprised at this sudden event, he was not the least bit
  worried. He had to cut off his conversation in mid-speech, but that was merely
  a minor inconvenience; he could resume it later. He held his breath and
  determined that the first course of action would be an Enduring Breath spell;
  that would enable to search for the hole almost indefinitely. Ammonon closed
  his eyes and focused, recalling to his mind the proper hand movements
  necessary to cast the spell. No incantations could be used safely while
  underwater, but that merely made the casting a little longer. He could feel
  the spell returning to his mind...<br>
  <br>
  A brutal crack on the back of his skull broke his trance and interrupted his
  meditation. Turning to face his assailant, Ammonon could only see a single
  snow orc trooper standing on the ice above him. The solid surface that
  separated them did not seem to hinder the orc's attacks in the slightest. It
  continued to rain punches down through the ice with some unique form of magic.<br>
  <br>
  Normally such a pathetic creature would pose no threat to an experienced Storm
  Reaper, but Ammonon was fast running out of air and was viciously slapped
  every time he attempted to med. In desparation he swam to the ice sheet
  covering the frost river, searching for the hole he had fallen through.<br>
  <br>
  The famed luck of Ammonon held. He did not rediscover the hole immediately,
  but he did find a pocket of air just between the ice layer and the surface of
  the water. With a renewed air supply, he had ample time to seek and find the
  cavity in the ice. The ridiculously weak orc couldn't hurt him when he was
  aware of the attacks.<br>
  <br>
  Finally Ammonon found the tiny crevice and hopped through, then turned his
  rage on this obnoxious creature that had nearly cost him his life.<br>
  <br>
  A few castings of his Combust spell and a few swings with his scimitar were
  all the power he needed to reduce the pathetic creature to a stain on the ice.
  Ammonon dug out his Tell Crystal and continued communication with the young
  shaman who had sought his aid.<br>
  <br>
  After a few minutes of discussion, the shaman decided to take Ammonon's advice
  and wait a bit longer before venturing so far out from his homeland. Putting
  away his crystal, Ammonon regarded the icy brook with a curious eye. He had
  before found the tracks of goblins that the locals had referred to as divers,
  and he had heard about a society of necromancers hidden away somewhere in the
  river valleys, but he had never before even suspected that the ever-frozen
  rivers of Everfrost had locations that were not solid. Now it had all become
  clear to him, and he considered the merits of exploring it. He also briefly
  considered the merits of ice fishing before pushing the thoughts out of his
  mind.<br>
  <br>
  Ammonon sat on the snow by the bank and memorized his Enduring Breath spell,
  cast it on himself, and then dived into the icy waters again. The visit wasn't
  long, but it did give Ammonon an idea of just how many secrets that were in
  the world that he hadn't discovered. After a few minutes he resurfaced and
  strolled away, lost in thought and wonder...<br>
  <br>
  &quot;That,&quot; I told the young Hobbit sitting in front of me, &quot;is a
  very minor tale of Ammonon's; I merely expounded on it because it is most
  recent.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The youth stared in awe. &quot;Is there really a land full of snow and
  ice?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Well, yes,&quot; I ventured cautiously, fidgeting with embarassment.
  &quot;Or so he tells me. I haven't actually gone farther than the Beholder's
  Maze, myself. But you should hear the tales told by him and even greater
  members of the Guild. They tell of giants, lava pools, armies of Dark Elves
  and even dragons! There is no end to the wonders out there. And here is the
  greatest tale of all-it is said that there is an entire new continent out
  there, a land that no known man has tread, just waiting to be discovered. And
  be ye asured, when the ships are finally convinced to sail for this unknown
  world, the Companions will be among the first to explore it.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Will you be with them?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Oh, no, not yet,&quot; I replied, thinking. &quot;I still have a long
  way to go before I am ready. But I will be able to visit all these places
  eventually, as will you, if you wish. But even though I am child compared to
  them, I consider all of the Companions to be my friends, and I am very proud
  to be numbered among them. There is no greater title in all of Norrath more
  noble than that of a Companion of the Gate.&quot;</font>
