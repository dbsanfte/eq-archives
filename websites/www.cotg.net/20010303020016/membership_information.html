<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Lucida Sans">The Companions of the Gate
would like to thank you for your interest in our guild. At the current time we
are not accepting unsolicited guild applications. If a guild member has invited
you to apply, please complete the application below and submit it via email.
Please make sure that you include the name of the guild member who invited you
to apply.<br>
<br>
There are many who believe that a Guild is for getting groups, and there are
Guilds formed on that premise, The Companions of the Gate is not one of them,
know that before you apply. So know this, if you seek a Guild solely for getting
groups, the Companions of the Gate may not be for you, if you seek a family, a
place to call home, then perhaps this is the place you should look.<br>
<br>
Our membership is comprised of many different classes and levels and as such it
is often challenging to find a group within the Guild in your level range, this
is an inevitable result of a Guild with so many members at so many different
places in the spectrum. Part of the reason this occurs is that your membership
request will not be judged on your class and level, but by your relationships
with guild members and their knowledge of you. CotG is a family, and to be a
part of our family we need to know you first.<br>
<br>
<br>
My thanks for your patience<br>
