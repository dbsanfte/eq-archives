<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>In the beginning there was void and darkness, we
each floundered about the face of Norrath alone, wrapped heavily in our tells,
always hoping for more.<br>
<br>
One day we realized that we were no longer alone, and what was once void had
form and substance, and we yearned to explore and share our explorations.<br>
<br>
It was then decided that we would submit a Guild application to the High
Counselors of Norrath, in the hopes that we might be better able to share our
new find with each other.<br>
<br>
Our stated purpose on that application was simple, we sought to explore, we
sought knowledge and kinship, we sought a sense of belonging to something
greater than just what we were ourselves.<br>
<br>
Luck smiled upon us and the darkness was filled with a green chatter as one by
one, each of our friends were added to our now approved Guild, no longer would
we be wandering adventurers, from that day forward, we were Companions.<br>
<br>
And this is what we still strive for today, we are a place of family, of sharing
and of support. We believe that sharing is best. However, we recognize that it's
not always possible. Sometimes, members need to trade some items to get other
items in order to have the best possible character. We heartily encourage the
sharing and generosity many Companions show when they give away spare items, but
no one should expect free items for being in the guild. We spend our time
improving ourselves, we explore and share this knowledge with each other and in
so doing so we have become a force of information, a living atlas of the world
in which we inhabit.<br>
<br>
Our primary goal is this, to be people worth knowing. Our mission is to provide
every Companion a place of refuge, a friendly voice in the night, a warm welcome
when encountering each other.<br>
<br>
It is not our intention to tell our member how and when to play this game, that
is up to each and everyone of them, the only thing we ask is that you always
realize whatever you do, the Companions name goes along with you.<br>
<br>
One of life’s greatest challenges is to talk and negotiate before reacting out
of anger. A companion strives to resolve conflict before spreading it further.<br>
<br>
While we do encourage grouping within our Guild we do not require it, nor do we
require who hunts with whom and when. All we can ask is that when your brother
or sister asks for help, if you can provide it, do so, if not, say so.<br>
<br>
There is no place in our Guild for animosity, pettiness, Kill stealing and the
other nastiness one sees in the world, we don't like it in the general populace
and we will not tolerate it in our home.<br>
<br>
To be a Companion is to be willing to be part of something great and special. It
brings the chance to grow to be a leader of your own raids, or to sit back and
enjoy the warmth of a family. There is no pressure to strive beyond any level of
game playing you are comfortable with. You can play an hour a week or fifty
hours a week and you'll be respected the same. This is what it is to be a
Companion.<br>
