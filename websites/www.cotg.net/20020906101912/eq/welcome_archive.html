  however.......</p>

  left them in a message for me. On a personal note, Can Lythander and Phreaky

<h4>June 8, 2000</h4>
<p>It is with heavy heart that I bring this news to you my friends. Moonshadow 
  and I received this new back in March, but somehow we missed the e-mail altogether. 
  On reviewing our mail, this is what we found</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is with heavy heart, that I pass on these unfortunate 
  tidings. You may not remember me, I am a real life friend of the man you knew 
  as Arazhan</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">Runehammer, and we have spoken 
  before, but not frequently. I regret to inform you, that our friend has passed 
  on. Scott died Friday, March 10th in an automobile accident. Scott introduced 
  me to this pastime we have in Everquest, and spoke of you all so highly. Recently 
  he had spoken with me about missing all of you in the guild, as his time had 
  become so limited with his job and family. I am destroyed, as I am certain all 
  of you knew him to be kind and good-hearted, in real life he was a man of the 
  noblest of statures, and I will miss him so deeply. To make things all the more 
  tragic, Scott leaves behind two young children and a wife of nine years. I ask 
  that all of you please remember Scott's family in your prayers. I had debated 
  so long wether or not to post you and let you know, but I decided that you were 
  all his friends too, and have every right to know what has happened to our lost 
  friend.</font></p>
<p>During his time with us, I had come to respect and admire Arazhan, and have 
  missed his company very much. Now I know why he came to be missing from our 
  home. Arazhan was one of our first non-founder members, he also played the character 
  Cyntax - a Rogue. They joined the guild around June 10, 1999. This message was 
  passed to us by his in-game friend Brittonaliel.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that a person of great renown in the guild hit 
  level 50 on Saturday - the 29th of April. I am truly sorry that this is so late 
  in coming - but I only found out tonight that this was the case. Nokk Woode, 
  a most deserving Druid in the Guild, Congratulations friend.</p>
<p>Also of note, tonight, Moonshadow Litherial, our Guildmistress, has hit the 
  level 50.</p>
<p>Congratualtions both of you - may your journeys continue to be exciting and 
  fulfilling.</p>

<h4>May 09, 2000</h4>
<p>There is very little that could ever happen to make me post on the message 
  of the day, but this news hit me pretty hard, and I felt it deserved to be put 
  up on the guild news section. A guild that I have had profound respect for these 
  past twelve months has decided to call it quits. The guild I refer to is Innoruuk's 
  Brood. The Companions was founded on good roleplaying and was modeled partially 
  in the spirit of what Innoruuk's Brood has accomplished. The following is the 
  eulogy for this great organization.</p>
<p>~Lythander Lotus'Root~</p>
<p>Guild Eulogy </p>
<p>Its been just over a year now that seven tier'dal, two trolls and a human joined 
  together to form the guild, Innoruuk's Brood. The guild has grown and shrank 
  in size over time, members have come and gone, there were also those who faded 
  away and were never seen again. Now as time has passed, it seems through all 
  our differences the guild has grown apart. The time has come for those of the 
  brood to form their own alliances, to find our place in the world and serve 
  The Father in their individual capacities. To pass on the knoweldge and teachings 
  we learned in the brood and bring that knowledge to others. There will be those 
  who find their place amongst friends, others may wander a solitary life, either 
  way we will always share a bond, we will always be part of what was once Innoruuk's 
  Brood. Go out and spread HIS hate, children of Innoruuk. </p>

<p>YAY - Nemx hits 50! Bets have it he loses it within 5 minutes - bets are wrong. 
  Congrats Nemx - well done - our First 50th Ranger :)</p>
<p>Also congrats to Amethystrose and Balyn for getting their first pieces of Planes 
  Gear last night in Hate - Gloves to Balyn and Pants to Ame. Keep it up guys!!!!!</p>

<h4>April 18, 2000</h4>
<p>Just a quick note to say Congratulation to Jaredor, out first Level 50 Shaman. 
  Well done Jaredor, lots of&nbsp; hard work and time was put into getting there, 
  but it has certainly paid off for you. Also of note is that a number of our 
  members are now being seen regularly on the planes and claiming their share 
  of the loot. Qendian, Vashti, and more I am sure (sorry to those I have forgotten). 
  And a late Congratulations to Achenar for claiming his Soul Fire. Keep up the 
  good work guys. 
<p>Again, though late, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Moonshadow 
  and Toki for all the work that they have been putting into getting events and 
  things organized for the guild. It is a tough job, and often thankless, but 
  I know that I really appreciate it and am sure all of you do as well. And Phreaky 
  is taking the plunge into arranging things by being the CoTG Rep for the Hate 
  Raid this Thursday. He has arranged the team, see the posting in the message 
  section. Good Luck Phreaky. 
<p>I think that's it for now, nope, Lythander, great job on the new Portal into 
  the site, it looks great, and Nokk, great job on the new members listing. Everyone 
  should send in a photo of themselves for posting with their character information. 
<p>Take Care Everyone, and Happy Gaming, 
<p>Zzrod

<h4>March 29, 2000</h4>
<p>This might actually be considered March 30, but since I haven't gone to bed 
  yet :-P!&nbsp; You guys are keeping me so busy, that I'm way behind on my updates... 
  First, Congrat to Phreaky.. Level 50!&nbsp; I'd also like to say congratulations 
  to our very happy newlyweds.&nbsp; Congrats to Lythander and Nileema, and to 
  Odinh and Fjori.&nbsp; We're all very happy for you, and whatever we can do 
  to help, just let us know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tried Nagafen tonight and it was well, slightly less than successful.&nbsp; 
  Whether due to a patch buff, or a nasty bit of training of LDC into the support 
  area, we failed to vanquish him.&nbsp; We will try again though.. and we WILL 
  succeed!&nbsp; With determination, and the support of each other and friends, 
  we can accomplish anything!</p>

<h4>March 22, 2000</h4>
<p>Wow, now we're at TWO level 50 wizards, Congrats to Qendien. We've taken out 
  Phingle and are planning on Lord Naggy next.&nbsp; And in the midst of all this 
  mad leveling, you guys are still getting compliments for how you handle yourselves 
  and help others.&nbsp; I'm really proud of you guys!</p>

<h4>March 15, 2000</h4>
<p>Okay, we have our very first... *signals for a drum roll*&nbsp; Level 50 Wizard!&nbsp; 
  Congrats to Wolfah who made it to 50, researched ALL of her spells, and is currently 
  taking Norrath by storm.&nbsp; Way to go Wolfah, I'm only sorry I wasn't online 
  when it happened.</p>

<p>Way to go Drizzi!&nbsp; Congrats on 50!&nbsp; You guys are doing so well...our 
  bubble at 40 is growing, although Taralonx is going to break out of it soon 
  (if he hasn't already).</p>
<p>I'm looking to add a couple of things to the website and I need your help.&nbsp; 
  I'm going to be putting together a &quot;how to register on the Message Board&quot; 
  FAQ, as it seems some members are having some trouble with it.&nbsp; What we 
  need to know now is...what do YOU want to see?&nbsp; What links do you want 
  me to add to the links page, what kind of information do you want our website 
  to hold. This is our home, and I want all of us to feel comfortable here.&nbsp; 
  Thanks guys,</p>

<h4>February 13, 2000 - Late Edition</h4>
<p>Congratulation Amethystrose!&nbsp; We now have a level 50 mage!&nbsp; The guild 
  undertook two firsts this weekend.&nbsp; Efreeti Lord Djarn on Saturday and 
  the Allizewsaur on Sunday.&nbsp; Good work everyone.. before you know it we'll 
  be running a planar trip.. or a dragon hunt!&nbsp; Can't wait!</p>

<h4>February 13, 2000</h4>
<p>Congratulation Balyn!&nbsp; Our first level 50 cleric!&nbsp; Way to go!&nbsp; 
  And also, I've received some compliments about the way our members are handling 
  themselves in the planes.&nbsp; In fact, I was told that they had not seen a 
  Companion in the Planes that they wouldn't love to have at their side.&nbsp; 
  I'm so proud of you guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had an up and down Efreeti camp, but we learned a lot and I'm looking forward 
  to going back to get more Companions boots.&nbsp; The timing we used was right 
  I think.&nbsp; Thanks to Barawin for staying with no experience and no interest 
  in the loot.&nbsp; Your presence was much appreciated my friend.</p>

<h4>February 6, 2000</h4>
<p>Okay, I'm off on vacation this week, so any guild membership applications that 
  get emailed to me will be delayed a bit.&nbsp; If you'd like to apply, feel 
  free to post your application on the message board.&nbsp; The officers will 
  take care of it from there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to get some GREAT pictures 
  while I'm away!&nbsp; Hmm,&nbsp; I wonder if the Grand Canyon was the inspiration 
  for Lavastorm?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>:mentally paints the Grand Canyon red and adds lava</p>

<p>Hmm, Zzrod, what can I say, ding, thwap, reding... welcome back to level 50!&nbsp; 
  Congrats Zz, job well done.&nbsp; Hmm, we can almost field a whole team of level 
  50's now.&nbsp; And we can field at least two teams of 40+.&nbsp; Perhaps time 
  to start discussing some big game hunts?</p>

<h4>January 31, 2000</h4>
<p>Marcolek has hit 50 so now we have two paladins and two druids :-)&nbsp; Funny, 
  I never thought of Paladin's as power gamers!&nbsp; Drizzi, Balyn, and Zzrod 
  are all 49... so the next level 50 WILL be a new class.&nbsp; Unless Thaycalme 
  decides to start playing again ;-)&nbsp; Had a blast with the arena event and 
  I'm looking forward to another in late February.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand some of you are having trouble with the message board, please 
  send me an email to <a href="mailto:Moonshadow@cotg.net">Moonshadow@cotg.net</a> 
  and I'll look into it.</p>

<h4>January 17, 2000</h4>
<p>Major updates have been done to the members page.&nbsp; Please verify I haven't 
  made any mistakes. A thread has been created on the message board for changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, all I can say is WOW, someone really lit a fire under the Companions.&nbsp; 
  Daggeniel reached 50 yesterday, Thaycalme is 49, and Amethystrose, Balyn, Zzrod 
  and Spjor are all 48.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A landmark day, COTG had more members on Fear Sunday than Succoring Winds did.&nbsp; 
  Congratulations everyone!</p>
<p>Just imagine, soon we can have a guild event ON a plane!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working on getting high enough to be there,</p>
<p>Moon</p>

<h4>January 11, 2000</h4>
<p>First of all, congratulations MITHAS!&nbsp; What a week, Sprinkler, Soulfire, 
  and level 50.&nbsp; We're so proud of you!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Next, your guildmistress is experimenting with web updates herself, so if I 
  mess anything up, blame Zzrod, she showed me how!

<p>OK, another long time between updates. However, this last one is a significant 
  one. The members page has been updated so please check and let us know if there 
  is anything missing. 
<p>I have heard some grumbling about the lack of changes to the images section 
  and how there should be an image section for each guild event. I agree. However, 
  for that to happen you all need to send in the pictures you have taken at the 
  events. Remember, we need you to help with the content of the page.

  Membership Criteria</a>.

  in. Please continue to send them in for posting to <a href="mailto:COTG@HOME.COM">COTG@HOME.COM</a>. 
<p> If you have not visited the message board yet please do. We are currently 
  discussing where we should hold our next guild event. All ideas are welcome. 
<p> As usual, if there is anything you would like to see added to any of these 
  pages, please feel free to droop me a line at the <a href="mailto:cotg@home.com">COTG</a> 
  mailbox.
