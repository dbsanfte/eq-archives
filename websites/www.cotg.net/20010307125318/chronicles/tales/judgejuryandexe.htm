<b><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Judge, jury and executioner.</font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Tarthug entered the Cave of Elders and
headed to an unused cell near the back. He had not come to be sociable or speak
with those who had only barely acknowledged him of late. They still hated him
for his opposition to their stuffy outdated vision and the tall youth had lost
little love for them as well. Had he been the same boy that left Halas so many
winters ago things would not have changed. As it was they had begun to fear him
and that would allow him to be alone today. He was here to learn the trade of
alchemy and practice the shaded skill in a dark corner where none would pester
him. The smells in the cave overpowered his senses for a moment. The scents of
spirit smoke, sweat, dried mammoth dung, and rot combined to create a powerful,
yet less than pleasant sensation that forced the eyes to widen and then water.
Gradually he became accustomed to it and was able to sit and set his mind to his
work.<br>
<br>
He ground the birthwart, a terrible weed that grew in dry desolate lands, and
combined it with the fenugreek, a plant that’s growth was most noticeable in
graveyards. Reaching into his backpack he withdrew the vial of blood, taken from
a wolf killed while hunting, and added it to the pasted contents already in the
bowl. He carefully mixed the contents and grinned at his success.<br>
<br>
“A smile, how odd that looks on your face” an all too familiar voice offered
from the entrance to Tarthug’s cell. “On most people it is a welcome sight,
but on you it looks unnatural.”<br>
“Much has changed Shamus. I have found more cause to laugh than in the old
days.”<br>
“Good to hear Tarthug. One cannot carry the judgement of the Tribunal and
remain sane long without a sense of humour.”<br>
“Yet you continue to look well my old mentor. Perhaps the drink sustains you
and has pickled your blood.” The tone in the younger shaman was pleasant and
level to the ear but carried a distinct and dangerous edge to it.<br>
“You may have grown Tarthug, but you have yet to grow up. I am not here to
stab at you with words, to play mentor, or be social. I come to give you a task,
to ask you to fill your oath to Halas and her people. There has been a killing.
You will bring justice, the Elders have chosen you at my request. An outsider is
dead at the hands of a Wolf who guards the town. The outsider was unarmed.”<br>
A startled look crossed the face of the one eyed shaman at the revelation of the
last news. His mouth worked in a futile effort to express thoughts that had yet
to form. A sense of betrayal overcame him and he finally voiced it to his old
mentor.<br>
“Why?! How could you do this to me Shamus? Whatever judgement I pass I will
condemned, perhaps they will seek justice on me after. Am I here so little that
you think I can afford or abide by banishment?”<br>
“You are not a child anymore, stop acting like one. I chose you because they
will judge in favour of the guard as they consider outlanders to have no place
here and I want true justice. This will impact how those you cherish will see us
as a people. I’d sooner they see a people who practice the values they hold
dear, rather than a people who determine justice by the place of birth of those
involved. Of course you can choose not to honour your oath…”<br>
“No. I will honour it. You are right, although it will cost me any peace I
ever hoped to have here.”<br>
“Halas will ever be you home Tarthug. Do not abandon it for a selfish
fantasy.”<br>
“The guard, who was he?”<br>
“McFynn.”<br>
“Old McFynn?”<br>
“No, his son Tomas”<br>
“I knew him, he was always sound of mind. A gentle young man, honourable, like
his father.”<br>
“He still is. He is devastated by this turn of events and gave himself to his
fellow Wolves despite that they offered to release him if he ran. He could not
run from home. He awaits death in the caves of judgement, you may kill him
there.”<br>
“Is he already determined to be guilty? I thought I was to pass judgement on
this matter? Who was the victim?”<br>
“A man of Qeynos, a monk.”<br>
“I know many monks Shamus. They are far from helpless without a weapon. The
old laws do not include or account for them.”<br>
“The Elders ruled on it shortly after I recommended you for this.”<br>
“A trap. May the judgement of Tribunal be harsh on them, those bloody walking
heaps of fleshrot!”<br>
“What is the law?” asked Shamus<br>
A puzzled look overtook Tarthug’s face yet he answered quickly following
Shamus’s question “We have few laws. We forbade the murder of a Shaman or
unarmed man and the worship of any god is not to be done inside of Halas.
Thieves will not commit violence while plying their trade.”<br>
“What is the punishment?”<br>
“Only one punishment for all crimes, death.”<br>
“How is justice given?”<br>
“A shaman is assigned to oversee the judgement. Of course there is the ancient
code that allows trial by combat. That is rarely used though.”<br>
“Very well, I am done here. Speak to me when you have passed judgement.”<br>
With that Shamus turned from his former student and left. Tarthug watched him
go, words left on his lips yet unspoken.<br>
<br>
Tarthug sat heavily in his cell, unable to continue with alchemy after
Shamus’s news. Thought consumed him, black thoughts of old laws, and terrible
fates. There could be no exception, he knew he had to kill a man who was by all
accounts good for the sake of preserving justice. He hoped the Tribunal looked
well upon him for killing a good man. If only it had been a warrior with fewer
graces, one who had been frowned upon for rape and killing. It was astonishing
that some vile acts were not considered to be crimes. What a Wolf did after
conquering a village was up to the Warchief or even the Packleader. They would
handle punishment if they were disobeyed. There were many warriors that showed
little honour in the gifting, some were Packleaders making how the spoils were
divided, including captives, dishonourable at times. If only he could bring the
Tribunal’s justice on one of them instead of Tomas McFynn. Of course, he could
declare a trial by combat, but that would only get another Wolf killed. Unless
of course, he selected a warrior he knew to be dishonourable. A plan formed in
his mind, one that would convince all that the laws were obeyed and justice
done. He had to chose a powerful champion to represent the people of Halas, one
the Elders and Wolves would not disapprove of, one that would likely defeat
Tomas. He would have to drug that champion to ensure Tomas’s victory and in
such a way that none would dispute it. This would solve all of his problems. He
would save Tomas and send a foul-hearted warrior in his place to pay the
butcher’s bill.<br>
<br>
Hurriedly he went to the Elders and declared the trial by combat and his choice
for champion. He had chosen Bulhorn, a mighty warrior who had once led the
slaughter of a party from Surefall Glade as they hunted on the plains of
Everfrost. It was said that when the bodies were found some had not been killed
in combat but by torture, and it was rumoured that one had been drowned under
the ice for not pleasing Halas’s new champion. Tarthug held a special hatred
for the man, one reserved for only the vilest creatures. The Elders hearing his
selection were shocked, they had wanted to see Tomas die for no other reason
than to bring shame upon the man they chose to be the Justice Giver, permitting
Bulhorn to champion Halas achieved this more completely than they could have
hoped for. Tarthug scheduled the contest for 2 days and immediately left Halas
for the Everfrost.<br>
Tarthug knew something of alchemy and of a poison produced by a giant woolly
spider. Having always favoured means to improve a Wolf’s performance in
combat, he had studied the effects of comfrey. It was an herb that grew in the
swamps and was not sold in Halas. A message to Hittokiri and Cryth got the
needed herb to Tarthug from Paineel, although at some expense. Tarthug felt it
was fitting that those who had helped him were the ones he was condemned for
supporting by the Elders, who had made this whole matter difficult in the first
place. The spider took some time in finding and Tarthug had to kill 2 in order
to get a pure extract. After several attempts and a sleepless night, Tarthug was
successful. He had brewed two potions. One to give to Bulhorn, the other to
Tomas. The Elders would know if he cast on the two combatants, but they would
not expect the effects from potions. All he had to do was get them to drink
them.<br>
<br>
On the day of the combat, Tarthug entered the Pit of Doom and walked towards the
cells holding the combatants. He went to the Champion first. He was easy enough
to find, surrounded by a few of his friends and loudly bragging of his status
and how he would protect Halas from all that would destroy it. The shaman
strolled into the middle of them, his face a mask of stone.<br>
“Tarthug! Clearly some beast must have knocked some sense into you. You have
chosen Halas’s latest Champion well!” Roars of laughter accompanied
Bulhorn’s comment, yet Tarthug noted with some satisfaction that few had the
nerve of making eye contact with him.<br>
<br>
“I would speak with you alone … Champion of Halas.” The pause before
speaking Bulhorn’s title had been a little longer than Tarthug had hoped, but
he hadn’t realised how difficult it would be to give the title to a man he so
completely loathed.<br>
“You may speak anything in front of my friends.” Bulhorn replied placing
each arm around his nearest comrades.<br>
“Very well, if you fear to be alone with me then I will speak to …”<br>
“You!? Fear you!? I fear no man or beast. If only I had the chance to fight
you, to kill you with my bare hands for the grief I suffered over my many
hunting victories on the plains of Everfrost! Grief that you brought upon me!
You are soft from the comforts of the lands beyond Blackburrow and I have no
cause to fear the likes of you.” He then spat upon Tarthug’s boots for
effect and grinned broadly.<br>
The look that Tarthug returned might have frozen lava. He looked around at
Bulhorn’s friends. “Leave us.”<br>
Bulhorn’s friends left seemingly in turn. Finally alone Tarthug’s glare
returned to Bulhorn. “It is important you win today. Justice will be done.”<br>
“I will win today.” Boasted Bulhorn “I will kill him quickly and prove my
manhood to all. I will prove I am fit to be Packleader and even Warchief. Tomas
is soft from weaning too long from his mother’s teats.”<br>
“His father has given him his sword for the fight. The one he used to hunt ice
giants with.”<br>
Bulhorn’s face paled slightly. “A fine blade it is, but I can still beat
Tomas.”<br>
“You seem less sure of yourself Bulhorn. This will not do. I need a convincing
victory to prove the will of the Tribunal.”<br>
“Then get me a sword forged on the planes and I will defeat him in but
moments!” Shouted the Champion of Halas.<br>
“I will do better than that.”<br>
“How?! Fool, you don’t just summon such weapons out of air!”<br>
“No, but a potion that increases your strength and quickness might.”<br>
“You have one?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“Give it to me! I would kill the so-called Wolf quickly and gain the favour of
Halas. I will have a different woman for each night to warm my bed, two during
the coldest nights. All will shout my name! Give it to me now!”<br>
With that Tarthug handed him the poisen and turned to leave as the warrior
gulped the contents down in short order.<br>
“Perhaps I misjudged you shaman. It might be I have a use for you when I
become Warchief.”<br>
Tarthug stopped. Without turning to face Bulhorn he replied “Kill the accused
quickly and we are even. Beyond that only the Tribunal knows.” Then Tarthug
left Bulhorn alone to his schemes.<br>
<br>
Tomas sat alone in his cell. He had refused all but Tarthug. He was hunched in a
corner, resigned to his fate.<br>
“Tomas, I could not bring myself to harm you. You are a credit to Halas and
her people. I have called this trial to bring true justice. Justice cannot be
served unless you believe in your innocence and fight for your cause with all of
your heart. Otherwise it is an execution. Believe me when I say that the man who
you killed left you with little option, despite the ruling of the Elders. I
believe the combat will prove the will of the Tribunal and that we will see a
change in our laws. To do this Tomas I need your help.”<br>
“Mighty shaman, I know how hard the man I killed fought, I swear I did not
feel as though he gave me a choice, but I am resigned to see justice done today.
Today I die for Halas.”<br>
“Oh well then, that does seal it then. A man trained in combat without weapons
is no more a threat than an unarmed Wolf. It is the will of the Tribunal, it
must be, because you say so. Perhaps you should have been a shaman to see the
will of Justice so clearly?”<br>
“I am sorry, I meant no disrespect. Please forgive me and I will do as you
ask.”<br>
“If you are truly sorry Tomas, you must drink this. It will be a symbol of
your faith in seeking the truth.” Tarthug said as he handed him the potion.<br>
Without question Tomas took the potion from Tarthug and drank it down, the sour
taste registering on the young warrior’s face. “It must truly be a sign to
taste so bad.”<br>
“See, your humour returns swiftly young warrior.” With that Tarthug turned
to leave.<br>
“Do you truly believe in me?” Asked Tomas<br>
“I have staked my life upon it. One day Tomas I too will be judged for what I
do today.” With that Tarthug left the warrior alone to himself and proceeded
to the arena for the combat.<br>
<br>
Tarthug sat in the Chair of the Judgement, a ringside seat said to afford the
best view. It had been made so many years ago when trial by combat was more
common. Anyone passing justice would have to witness the fight and death of a
combatant. It was meant to weigh heavily on the mind of those who stood in
judgement. Today it weighed very heavy on Tarthug.<br>
<br>
The two combatants entered the ring to the cheers of the crowd. Each was armed
in their own fashion, no armour was permitted. Bulhorn charged Tomas, screaming
for blood. Tomas looked desperate to defend himself at first, but gradually
seemed more able to fend off the many wild swings Bulhorn made with his axe.
Bulhorn tired quickly, sweat breaking his brow before the fight had been long
closed. It was clear after a few minutes that he had spent himself, yet he still
gave no thought to defence. His swings were many and grew wilder with every
swing. Tarthug noted several of the elders present, a look of concern rising on
their faces, yet throughout the fight Tarthug kept his face like stone, it was
necessary to maintain the illusion. Finally Tomas took advantage of Bulhorn’s
exhaustion and delivered several critical blows, concluding the fight by
decapitating the doomed warrior with his final swing. As the Champion’s head
rolled across the arena towards where the Elders sat, the crowd erupted into
wild cheering and many leaped into the ring to congratulate Tomas, who smiled in
disbelief at the sight of his victory. Shamus was the first to stand among the
Elders, applauding the victory. Tarthug Noted he was the only Elder who wore a
smile. Tarthug rose and approached the Elders.<br>
<br>
“Shamus, you smile? It seems so unnatural on you.” after a brief pause he
continued “Justice has been served and the will of Halas, her people, and the
Tribunal is clear. Does any question the will of the spirits?”<br>
The silence that followed was thick and heavy, broken finally by Shamus. “No
one will question what has happened here, your duty is done. You have served the
Tribunal and your people well young shaman. We release you of your duty in this
matter. Safe travels Tarthug.”<br>
<br>
Tarthug bowed and left for the docks. As he left the arena he smiled at
Bulhorn’s friends who had gathered away from the crowd, hoping to escape
notice. To his satisfaction they moved away from him, one making a sign to ward
against evil. He had barely noticed Old McFynn in enough time to prevent from
walking right into him.<br>
“You have done more than you will ever know Tarthug. You have preserved my
son’s life and honour. I don’t know how he won, but I owe you for that
victory.”<br>
“Save your thanks to the spirits who guided Tomas. He is a good man and will
one day make a great leader. You have no debt to me. The matter is settled.”<br>
<br>
As Tarthug left Halas, he noted that the air felt cleaner, more pure. He felt
lighter as though a weight had been lifted. He would answer to the Tribunal for
his actions over the last two days, but he had traded a life for a life to pay
the toll, and a good man still breathed. Tarthug smiled and the world seemed to
smile back at him. Judge, jury and executioner perhaps it was not always a bad
thing.</font>
