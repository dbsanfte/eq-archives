<p>
Silvina quietly opened her bedroom
window and listened to the night sounds of Freeport. The moon was high in the
sky, and most folks were sound asleep. Even her parents, finally, were in bed.
It seemed as if it took them forever to finish shooing the last sleepy customers
from the pub to their rooms upstairs or to their own homes in the city. The
young woman listened to her father's snoring. It was safe.</p>

<p>
She stuck her arms through the straps
of her backpack. It was so pitifully small - she felt a momentary pang as she
thought of all of the things she was leaving behind. But she straightened. They
were only things, and she had to go. She could never grow here, never learn. Her
family would never understand her magical abilities, but she could not repress
them. If she didn't learn to control it, she knew she could become dangerous to
herself and those around her.</p>

<p>
Hiking up her skirt, she threw a leg
over the windowsill. Grabbing hold of the jasmine trellis, she lowered herself
from the third story as quietly as she could. Silvina breathed a small sigh of
relief as her feet touched the moon-bathed ground. She tiptoed to the back fence
and squeezed between two loose boards.</p>

<p>
It was a short walk from her parent's
inn to the docks. She still stayed to the shadows most of the way, a somewhat
difficult task under the full moon. She gasped when a shadowy figure stepped in
front of her. A few muttered words, and she held a small dagger in her hand. The
robed figure raised a hand. &quot;Peace. I am merely here to bid you a safe
journey.&quot;</p>

<p>
Silvina smiled. &quot;Master! I
should have known you would guess I was going to leave. I will miss you so
much...&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;Hush, child.&quot; But he
smiled. &quot;I shall miss you as well. You show much promise. But that is why
you must leave. I know you will never be able to study as you need to if you
stay here. When you get settled in, send me a message to let me know how you are
getting on.&quot; He flicked his fingers, and was suddenly holding a small bag,
which he handed to her. &quot;A going away present. It's not much but...&quot;
Silvina threw her arms around the old magi.</p>

<p>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; She peeked
into the bag. Food, a few silver, and a neatly folded garmet. She drew it from
the bag. It was a magicians robe, one suiting an apprentice. &quot;Oh, master, a
robe. They would have never let me...&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;There, there...&quot; he patted
her shoulder clumsily. &quot;You will make a fine magician, Silvina. Now, it is
late, and I must get my old bones to bed. And you must begin your journey.&quot;</p>

<p>
Silvina gave her teacher one last,
unmagician-like hug, wiped her tears away, and watched as he walked away through
the darkened street. When he disappeared into the shadows, she continued to the
dock. Finding a group of boxes, she slipped behind one, pulled on her new robe,
and pulled a cloth hood from her backpack. Leaning over the water, she checked
her reflection in the little light available. Once satisfied that she was
relatively anonymous looking, she walked toward the ship at anchor. She hailed
the watchman.</p>

<p>
&quot;Is this ship bound for Faydwer?&quot;
The watchman nodded. &quot;I wish to book passage.&quot;</p>

<p>
&nbsp;Through a haze of nausea, Silvina
seriously pondered her decision. In her heart, she knew she was right to leave
her home and family, but her seasick stomach wished to argue. She reminded
herself of the times during her childhood when she had no control over the power
she had - times when objects flung themselves from shelves when she was angry.
Times when she was scolded for playing with globes of light that she plucked
from thin air. She remembered one time in particular when a her terrified mother
found the toddler playing in the garden with a small earth elemental that came
to visit her. Her mother screamed, snatched Silvina away from the friendly
spirit, and ran into the house.</p>

<p>
Since that time, her parents looked
at her with fear behind their eyes. It was an uncomfortable relationship, made
harder by the successes of her older brother. Watching her parents glow with
pride at his every acomplishment made her lonely and confused. She thanked the
Gods that blessed her brother that he was a kind soul. He was the only member of
her family who did not fear her. He was saddened that their parents didn't
embrace his sister as they did him. His presence and protection was one thing
that kept her going.</p>

<p>
But time continues, and her brother
grew into a man with his own dreams and life to live. He could not stay forever.
He became a skilled warrior, and joined the ranks of the Militia, but soon
discovered that the ranks of good men were tainted with the powerhungry and
selfish. His strong opinions collided with his superior's and he was now
assigned to a small outpost in a quiet corner of the Commonlands, counting the
days until his enlistment is up.</p>

<p>
The last time she spoke to him, he
was talking of travel, wanting to see the world. She knew that her one tie to
her family was leaving her, and life at home would be very bleak. She determined
that if she was ever to harness the powers she was blessed with, she would need
to leave home. Her parents would never let her enroll in the Academy in Freeport
- they had a distrust and fear of magic that she could not understand.</p>

<p>
She had a sympathetic ear at the
Academy in the form of her Master, and he taught her a bit when he could. But it
wasn't enough. She needed to study, and she couldn't do that at her parents. If
she went and enrolled herself, well, she knew her father would just march down
to the Academy and drag her out by the ear.</p>

<p>
She huddled into a miserable ball and
fingered the fabric of her robe. She hoped she had made the right decision.</p>

<p>
Silvina stumbled off the boat,
thankful for the sun on her face. The queasy trip was over. She looked around at
the small port in Butcherblock. There were more dwarves here than she'd ever
seen at once. She gave a weak smile to one of the fishermen at the edge of the
bay. He glanced at her warily, with distrust. She noticed the rest of them
didn't look too pleased to see her either.</p>

<p>
The young woman pushed her chin up.
She wouldn't let the less than warm welcome push her away. She tramped tiredly
down the trail toward Kaladim, the city of the dwarves. All along the way, the
short citizens gave her odd looks and distrustful stares. Silvina begin to feel
quite unloved.</p>

<p>
Arriving at the under-mountain city,
she began to look for a room and a warm bath. She found a warm but humble little
place, but when she reached for her purse to pay the night's stay her fingers
discovered the cut strings of her coinpurse. She'd been pickpocketed! The little
innkeep sniffed at her.</p>

<p>
&quot;Go on then. If you've no money
- we've no room for ye. 'Tis a rough lesson on the young, but a well needed
one.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;I would trade work for the
room...&quot; she began, but the innkeep would have nothing of it. Dejected, she
wandered back out of the inn. She looked around behind some of the buildings for
an out of the way spot, but when she began to settle in, a guard came along and
shooed her out. Saddened by her situation, she walked back out of the city. As
she emerged, she realized that clouds had gathered overhead and were weeping
down on her as the sun set. Huddled in her beloved robe, she finally found a
relatively dry spot beneath the tall trees outside the city. She spent a
restless, wretched night.</p>

<font face="arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<hr width="50%" color="#996600">
</font>
<p>
She awoke to the sight of two
green-skinned creatures poking and prodding her. The spoke in a strange,
sing-song way. &quot;Mmmm... human girl at my feet. Think she will be good to
eat.&quot; One slipped a short knife from it's belt. Silvina bolted to her feet,
angry.</p>

<p>
&quot;Chew on this you pointy-eared
freaks!&quot; She muttered the arcane words, and pointed at the knife-wielding
goblin. A small burst of flame flew from her fingertips and struck her
attackers. Its shrieked as it's skin blistered. A few more words and she had a
dagger of her own conjured. She set about ridding the world of two miscreants as
she rid herself of the anger of last night's events. Soon the corpses of the two
lay at her feet.</p>

<p>
She started to sit back down, but
noticed a pouch on one of the goblin's belt. She rifled through it, and found a
few coins. She was in the midst of checking the other body when she heard
footsteps. She froze, fearing more attackers.</p>

<p>
A dwarven man appeared from between
the trees. He nodded at her. &quot;I see ye took care of them. Found their
tracks in front of the city. Blasted Runnyeye trash.&quot; He spit on the
corpses. &quot;Did ye find any beaded necklaces on them? There's a bounty on
them.&quot; Silvina shook her head. &quot;Eh, no matter. I'm off. Watch yer back
in these hills. Little lass like that, the goblins would love to corner
ye.&quot; The little man trundled off across the landscape.</p>

<p>
Silvina thought for a bit. She would
need money if she was to do anything, and these goblins had a bit. They were
obviously a barbaric lot, and wouldn't be missed by the land's dwarven
residents. She set off cautiously to do some hunting.</p>

<font face="arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<hr width="50%" color="#996600">
</font>
<p>
A few rough, hardworking days later,
she brought her bulging pack to the small group of shops outside Kaladim. She'd
found that the dwarves there were a bit more used to outsiders, and somewhat
more friendly. At least they didn't glower at her as she traded the few things
she'd won by defeating goblins in the hills. As she talked with the merchant she
noticed a tall, pale stranger in the corner. He was a high elf. She bowed. He
smiled back.</p>

<p>
Silvina found herself wishing she'd
taken some of her hard-won gold and found a hot bath. Shyly she greeted the elf.
&quot;Such a lovely lady,&quot; he said. &quot;Surely you should be in the halls
of beautiful Felwithe, not a rough place like this.&quot; The dwarven merchant
glared at him over her beard. He ignored her.</p>

<p>
Silvina's ears perked up. She knew
the high-elf city had a magician's guild. &quot;I am planning on traveling
there, actually. Is it far?&quot;</p>

<p>
When she left the merchant's place,
she had a map drawn by her new friend, and a few gold coins in her pocket.
Things were looking up. She set off for the High Elf city with a little whistle,
and a new spring in her step.</p>

<font face="arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<hr width="50%" color="#996600">
</font>
<p>
With her heart pounding in her ears,
and a red sheen of blood pouring down over her eyes, Silvina ran screaming
through the woods of Greater Faydark. An orc centurion was hot on her trail.
Bursting through the trees, she saw a wonderful sight: the decorated towers of
Felwithe. She ran for the guards at the entrance screaming, &quot;HELP!&quot;
Just as she was sure the orc would deliver her death blow, one of the guards
sprang into action. He made quick work of the centurion. Silvina breathed a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>
The guard courteously helped her up
and began to staunch her wounds. He directed her to the Magicians Guild in the
city, and assured her that they would welcome her.</p>

<p>
They did indeed. After being offerred
a bath and a bed, she spoke to the guild's Mistress. The regal woman assured
Silvina that she could learn with the other students there. &quot;We are a small
school, but dedicated. We would enjoy having you. There is the question of
tuition, but then, I need a strong youngster to perform some tasks for me. Are
you willing?&quot; Silvina nodded. &quot;Fine! Welcome to Felwithe, then!&quot;
The two women smiled at each other.</p>

<p>
As Silvina blew out her candle and
pulled the warm blanket over herself, she felt confident for the first time that
she had made the right choice. She was going to be just fine.</p>
