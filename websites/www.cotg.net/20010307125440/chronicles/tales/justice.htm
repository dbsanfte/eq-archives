<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">He casually sauntered through the treed
city, without a care. His facade was that of careless indifference, when in fact
his attitude was the complete opposite. Watching the torchlight flicker around
the entrances of the brothels and other establishments, casually scanning the
shadows for danger, or unwanted attention, he moved silently through the city.<br>
<br>
Ronar grew up in this city of Kelethin, mostly in the back streets and alleys,
but it was his home, nonetheless. His parents were either killed in an Orc raid
on the city, or had abandoned him, he had never known them. His upbringing was
not gentle, by any means. He made his way by the skin of his teeth, and from day
to day. His bed was whereever he fell asleep at night, and his supper whatever
he managed to &quot;acquire&quot;, at least, until he had met Tyflon, the
commander of the Kelethin Scouts. Tyflon, with unmatched generosity, or possibly
seeing an opportunity to create his protege, took Ronar under his wing. That was
the beginning of Ronar's new &quot;career&quot; and his training began.<br>
<br>
He headed purposefully to the third tier of the city in Kelethin, relegated
quite a distance from the shops and accepted buildings of profession. He strode
up the ramps and walkways to the meeting place of the Scouts of Tunare. Some
called them spies, others called them thieves. Ronar preferred the term Rogue.
He was neither a thief or a spy, but his skills would enable him to do either,
with ease. Ronar considered himself a bounty hunter, of sorts. There were those
in the world of Norrath who had escaped the traditional justice system, or had
outright fled, and the current state of raids and impending war with the Dark
Elves, left the local law enforcement with little resources to pursue these
criminals. Something had to be done, and he did not hesitate to disappear into
the shadows to take matters in hand.<br>
<br>
Ronar had information to deliver from his latest trip to the stronghold of
Highkeep, and an item to return.<br>
<br>
Ronar eyed the single story building curiously. The front door was unlocked, as
usual, the place was never closed. He knew the front door was trapped, and
without someone letting you in, it would be a painful experience.<br>
<br>
Ronar was never one to use the front door, unless it was absolutely necessary,
anyway. He skirted the building and entered the shadowed alley behind the
building. He retrieved a small flask of oil from his pack and placed a few drops
on the hinges on the shutter of the window. Replacing the flask in its' place,
he gently ran his hands over the shutter, and chuckled quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good old Tyflon&quot; he thought to himself. He retrieved a small packet
from his belt and pulled two thin rods from their place and laid the packet on
the windowsill. He worked them in the frame of the shutter, until he heard a
soft &quot;click&quot;. Replacing the tools in their place and returning the
small pouch to his belt, he quietly opened the shutter and slipped into Tyflon's
chamber where the &quot;private&quot; business was conducted. As usual, Tyflon
was attending yet another meeting with the leaders of Kelethin on how his
services, and those of his followers, could assist the warriors of Kelethin to
repel the Tide of Darkness that was about to besiege them.<br>
<br>
Ronar slipped a small leather bag, about the size of a platemail helm, from his
pack, and laid it on Tyflon's desk. Feeling around under the desk, he found what
he was looking for, a series of grooves and indentations. He worked his finger
in the intricate pattern that would open the compartment, one that only Tyflon
had access to (or so Tyflon thought), and gently placed a palm-sized stone, that
glowed with an earthy deep green, into the velvet lining of the compartment.<br>
<br>
Removing a sheet of parchment from the drawer, and silently closing the
compartment, Ronar lifted the quill from the inkwell on the desk and hastily
scrawled a message on the parchment, in a script none but the senior members of
the &quot;business&quot; would know.<br>
<br>
Ronar silently drew a dagger from the folds of his cloak, it shimmered with a
soft blue hue. With barely a whisper, he slammed the dagger through the
parchment, point first into the desk. Turning without a sound, he slipped back
the way he came, stopping only to reset the trap that Tyflon had left him on the
shutter, and faded away into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Tyflon returned from another long planning meeting with the War Council. He had
convinced them, finally, of the use of his people as scouts for the advancing
horde. They finally saw the need to know what kind of evil they were going to be
up against, and he promised them he would get the information. He smiled
graciously, a nod to each member of his &quot;familY&quot; as he entered the
building, and proceeded back to his private chambers where he could mull over
the rest of the comments from the strategy meeting.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the room, Tyflon was aware of a soft blue glow from the center of
the room. He knew that his chambers had been violated by someone. Suspecting
foul play, he drew a dagger with a wicked edge, and scanned the darkened
interior of the room. Finding no immediate threat, he sheathed his ensorcelled
blade, and whispered softly, and the room was aglow with a cold white light from
several sconces along the walls.<br>
<br>
He spotted the dagger, point first, in his desk next to a leather bag. He
removed the blade, admiring it for a moment, it was fine workmanship, and
perfectly balanced. Setting it aside, he examined the note, and started to
decipher the script.<br>
<br>
T,<br>
<br>
The proof you required is &quot;in the bag&quot;. My apologies, but I was not
given a choice. The item has been returned to its secure place.<br>
<br>
R<br>
<br>
Tyflon deftly untied the knot at the top of the leather bag, and as the sides of
the bag fell, Tyflon stifled a gasp. He was surprised to be eye-to-eye with
Xentil Herkanon, the betrayer that had stolen the Heart of Kelethin. He had
thought that this one was lost, since he had fled to mainland quickly and had
disappeared into his safehouse inside Highhold Keep. Tyflon had not wanted to
send anyone on this mission, as it was surely a death sentence, as Xentil was
surely surrounded with Dark Elven guards, to whom he was to deliver the mystical
Heart of Kelethin. If the Dark Elves would have ended up with the Heart, they
would have been able to activate the ancient portal from Neriak to a point
almost directly under Kelethin. The resulting invasion would have been
devastating. He had been working with the various guilds in Felwithe to try to
ascertain a magic that would shut down the ancient portal for good, but it had
all been for naught. Nothing had been successful, yet.<br>
<br>
Tyflon reached under the desk and found the familiar grooves, a perfect
impression of his hand, and worked a pattern only he knew. A small compartment
slid open, and he was pleasantly surprised at the deep green glow emanating from
velvet lined compartment. &quot;How in the world....&quot; he began to mutter,
which ended in a chuckle. He was rarely surprised by Ronar's skill, after all he
was his personal trainer for many years.<br>
<br>
Tyflon stood from the desk and walked to the shuttered window. Feeling along the
edges of the frame, he noticed that the trap had not been triggered. He disabled
it and opened the normally creeky shutters to peer into the night. The swung
open silently, and again Tyflon chuckled. He worked himself up, almost to a
frenzy, he was not angry with Ronar, but he was going to teach those that were
suppose to be his personal guard and those that were to make sure the
&quot;house&quot; was secure, a lesson that they would not soon forget.<br>
<br>
Grabbing Xentil's head by the hair, he let the bloody bag fall to the floor, and
let loose with a typical Tyflon war cry, and all those in earshot cringed. THIS
was not going to be good.<br>
<br>
Ronar sat quietly below the windowsill where he had felt the breeze of Tyflon
opening the shutters. He almost choked on his jerky when he heard Tyflon start
his tirade. He could barely stifle a laugh.<br>
<br>
Soon, the whole house was buzzing about a supposed breakin to Tyflon's private
chambers. The place started swarming with initiates trying to find clues as to
who and what had been taken. Scanning the shadows at the mouth of the alley,
Ronar quickly scrawled another note. Checking to make certain that Tyflon's
chambers were still empty, Ronar secured the note to a throwing dagger that had
been a personal gift from Tyflon on the day of his &quot;graduation&quot; into
the real world, then threw it through the still open window in Tyflon's
chambers. With a satisfying &quot;thunk&quot; he heard the dagger embed itself
into the back of Tyflon's door.<br>
<br>
An initiate came rushing in and seeing the dagger in the back of the door,
immediately went into a defensive posture. Seeing no threat, he sheathed his own
dagger and examined the dagger and note in the door. Though the room was lit
with the light of many lightstones, the dagger did not reflect any light. In
fact the light seemed to be absorbed by the dagger, instead. Wisely choosing not
to touch it, he sent word and Tyflon came to examine the new ruckus. He
recognized his gift to his former student and new its power. He ran his finger
over the R carved into the base of the dagger, and smiled. He pulled the dagger
loose from the door and it dissipated in a small puff of smoke, leaving only the
note behind. Ronar grinned, feeling the heft of his dagger replaced in the
sheath on his chest, knowing that Tyflon had gotten his message.<br>
<br>
T,<br>
The dagger I left, please find someone worthy to wield it. It is a good weapon
and will benefit its owner greatly, it seems to help in finding an opponent's
weakness.<br>
R.<br>
<br>
With the guild house in an uproar, Ronar easily made it unnoticed out of the
alley.<br>
<br>
Ronar disappeared back into the the shadows of the night, until he was needed
again.<br>
