  <p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Nemx was born with his brother, Renox, under 
    the foolish care of a drunkard of a druid who didn't do his job too help the 
    family out, and a mother who flirted with every wood-elf male she saw.<br>
    As a baby, Nemx was dropped on his head far too often.. from the top of Kelethin, 
    to the forest floor down below. <br>
    With his incredible hard head, he survived these falls and lived to become 
    old enough to venture out by himself into the world.<br>
    <br>
    With some very hard times growing up, it was all for the best. Good things 
    were to come upon Nemx during his life.<br>
    <br>
    Bound only in leather armor and wielding minotaur axes, Nemx struck it rich 
    with the discovery of an Abu-Kar box, and quickly sold it for 700pp at the 
    young age of 17. </font> </p>
