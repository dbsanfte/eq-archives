<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Tarthug gathered his senses as he
materialized in the West Commonlands. Group transport spells always left him a
little dazed, wizard teleports a little more so, but neither felt as natural to
him as his own gate spell. Unfourtunately, his gate spell would not have left
him as close to Najena as Cryth’s group teleport, nor would it have brought
Khazz and Cryth. Being a companion had many benefits and having two good friends
like Cryth and Khazz was a major perk. They would go to Najena today, a place
that no sane person wanted to be in, yet they were all willingly going.<br>
<br>
Cryth informed them that she had to wait for Wynn and a friend of his in order
to transport them to Butcherblock. Tarthug’s stomach greeted the news by
rolling and his face paled for a second. He wanted to meet Wynn, but had no love
for what would end up as two more teleports. He knew Wynn only by reputation and
briefly through the guildhall. Wynn was reputed to be one of the greatest
warriors in all of Norrath, not just for his skill, but also for his valour and
free spirit. Tarthug had been surprised by the skills of many warriors since
leaving Halas, more so by the fact that some were not Wolves of the North. He
had noticed that his own prejudice had faded greatly, but that he still had a
sense that the North bred hardier, stronger folk than the thin-skinned
softlanders. In his travels he had found few areas which were truly soft.<br>
<br>
He had been so deeply drawn into himself that he had failed to notice a bronze
clad Dwarf talking with Khazz and Cryth. Tarthug was very fond of the Dwarven
folk. They reminded him of short Barbarians, although they did have an odd
streak on the whole. The young warrior’s name was Bannak. Tarthug wasn’t
sure how the conversation got started, but likely Cryth introduced herself. She
had to be one of the friendliest people he knew and if anyone could charm a
dragoon, it would likely be her. Bannak had let slip that he had yet to meet a
she-dwarf to keep his hearth and heart warm and had less of a taste for wood
elves. Cryth immediately told him about Badafi Stonebeard, a friend and
companion. She was a single Dwarven she-warrior, as skilled at the grill as with
an axe. Bannak seemed to perk up a bit and asked if Badafi had a beard, as only
the finest dwarven women wore beards. Both Tarthug and Cryth replied that she
did, almost in unison. Khazz showed his first sign of interest in the story by
bursting out in laughter.<br>
“She’s gonna kill you both when she finds out that your playing matchmaker
for her”<br>
<br>
Cryth beamed a mischievious smile at Khazz, while Tarthug quietly considered
Khazz’s words and replied “I think she will see that we merely care for her
and desire to make her happier. She might be pleased by the likes of little
Bannak and may bear him many young warriors one day.”<br>
<br>
Suddeny Tarthug felt a little uncomfortable as his friends and the young Dwarf
looked at him with disbelief and shock. Bannak and Cryth eventually burst out
into laughter, while Khazz stood there shaking his head at Tarthug. Outlanders
were so strange. He had merely made a judgement of the situation and voiced how
he saw the result of his actions would be. That they found it shocking and then
even funny puzzled him. How could they see any other result? Badafi was
intuitive enough to know when an action was being taken out of friendship, and
if she liked Bannak, love might blosom and they would breed. It was as logical
to him as the sun rising and setting, yet the reaction of his friends left him
questioning his conclusions. His only response was to raise his palms and ask,
“Have I erred in some way? Why do you laugh?” This of course made them all
laugh harder and Tarthug shruged his shoulders and fell quiet. Outlanders were
so strange.<br>
<br>
Eventually Wynn and Paeolin arrived. Tarthug took a liking to Wynn in an
instant. He was a charismatic Wood Elf, fun and charming. He stood side by side
with Paeolin, a proud Wolf of the North, and Tarthug could immediately see
differences in way each was armed and armoured. Wynn shifted around a lot,
trusting in his exceptional agility, while Paeolin relied on brute strength and
raw violence. Tarthug could tell a sound warrior as easily as a succesful
gambler could assess horseflesh. He would trust either to screen him in a tight
battle. Tarthug could also not help but notice chemistry between Wynn and Cryth.
Some might miss it, but he had great success in seeing thing in others they
might not see themselves. He only wished he could see into his own soul the way
he saw into others. He recalled as a child when Pryde had told that Elsa
McFadden had taken a liking to him and that he was the only one in the village
who hadn’t realised it. Tarthug was not what most women would consider
handsome, and he never suspected that she had made him that necklace out of any
other reason than friendship. No, his keen senses were directed outside his own
life, he had become confident of it.<br>
<br>
The group teleported to Butcherblock, where he followed Wynn and Paeolin to the
entrance to Lesser Faydark, binding Wynn and casting the wolf sprit on the pair.
He gated back to where Khazz and Cryth waited and they teleported to West
Commonlands to commence the journey to Najena. Cryth teleported herself to the
Lavastorm Mountains while Khazz and Tarthug newly refreshed with the Wolf
spirit, began the long run to Najena through Necktalos Forest and the Lavastorm
Mountains. Khazz won the footrace with Tarthug who stopped to peddle loot he had
gained from his adventure in Unrest. He was glad to get rid of it as it reminded
him of Unrest and all the evils he saw that day. The trades had consumed much
more time than Tarthug had planned and he was fortunate that his run through the
Tier’Dal homeland was uneventful. Tier’Dal made Tarthug feel uncomfortable
and he hated the number of necromancers in the forest. The guards always showed
their dislike for him, trying to kill him even though they were for the mostpart
hopelessly outmatched by Tarthugs powerful magic. He respected their valour and
let them live for it, but still only the dragoons had the power to stop him. The
entarnce to the pass into the Lavastorm Mountains was a blessed sight, as
always, if not more so now that his friends were becoming impatient for him to
get there. When Tarthug finally arrived in front of Najena Cryth, Khazz and
Ronar greeted him with warm smiles and pleasant humour. Ronar was a Wood Elf and
rogue. Tarthug knew him to be both crafty and brave, yet he also knew that he
had designs on Mistress Moonshadow. After Oake had vanished, Tarthug thought
Moonshadow to be vulnerable, why else would a High Elfven noble and leader of
heros show interest in a lowly Wood Elf rogue. Well, he liked Ronar and hoped
that he treated Moonshadow well as Tarthug hated the idea of having to kill the
affable Wood Elf out of vengence. Tarthug knew that many saw his insecurity and
self-doubt as sensitivity and thoughtfullness, but few ever saw his resolution
on passing judgement. He was very cold and passionless about those he pronounced
sentence on. The shadow that crossed his face as the memories and faces of those
he had damned passed quickly as the mirth of his friends proved too infectious.
Together the band of friends passed into Najena, smiles and laughter confronting
the reek of death, fear and hate.<br>
<br>
The four friends sped through the hallways as guards shrunk away from them in
fear, even the undead allowed passage as the band penetrated further into the
dungeon. Najena was a complex prison, built to hold the worst of the Tier’Dal
race. It had Ogre mercenary guards, Tier’Dal magicians and necromancers who
used conventional methods as well as magic to keep their prisioners in. It was a
death trap. It stank of death and evil seemed to gather around every wall and
object in the caverns. Screams echoed from the depths as the Tier’Dal masters
could not resist the pleasures of torture and maiming their captives. Tarthug
had used torture before to get information from the damned, but he had never
found pleasure in it and wondered how any intelligent being could. He was called
barbarian and savage, yet he found that he and most of his people showed more
mercy and charity to one another than many of those in the outlander societies
did. Tier’Dal were the worst. Most had no more respect for life than they had
for garbage found in the street. In a place like Najena, their savagery showed
tenfold and Tarthug fought several times to keep the bile down. His companions
were much less grim than he. There must be something in Elvish breeding that
allowed them to see past what stares at you in the face and allows you to
complete the task at hand with light heart and cheerful temper. It was either a
calous disregard of the facts or a discipline. Tarthug knew his friends and
counted it being discipline. They were the finest Norrath could present and not
fools to disregard their surroundings. Cryth made light of the place, while
Khazz grinned fiercly, his eyes shifting, watching everything yet nothing in
particular all at once. Ronar had vanished and was likely scouting. Tarthug
could feel malevolent spirits flowing through the walls, mocking him and
assuring him of certain doom. Sometimes being a shaman had certain disadvantages
to it. A keen awareness of the spirit world was not an advantage in a place like
this. It drove a mind towards insanity. Tarthug had known shaman who had
succumbed to the madness brought on by a foul hellhole such as Najena. Somehow
he had remained sane, but the lure of madness crept in at the edges, making him
restless and moody.<br>
“I don’t like this place.” Tarthug mentioned understating his true
feelings.<br>
Almost as though in response, an Ogre guard noted the presence and ambushed the
party. It launched an attack on the large Barbarian shaman first, nearly
removing his head. Saved by quick reflexes, Tarthug stepped back, minimizing the
impact of the first blow, evading the second and the third stopped by heavy
armour doing no damage. Cryth was the first to react, injuring the mighty Ogre
and landing 2 more blows with her scimitar. Tarthug began casting, halted the
spell then recast a lethal poisen spell. The Ogre struck Cryth with terrible
force, that blow would leave a mark. A surprised look crossed the guard’s
face, his blow was outmatched as it struck a magical barrier of flames and
thorns errected by Cryth. At this point Tarthug saw that it recognized that it
was going to lose this fight and die. Tarthug meant to make it suffer. He hoped
to root it and have everyone back off and let his poisen spell deliver the
killing blow so he could stare into the guard’s eyes as he died. Justice would
be servered. Justice for serving its dark masters, justice for hitting Cryth,
justice for the many foul deeds it likely commited. He had declared its
sentence. Tarthug slowed the beast with another cast, while Cryth combusted him
with powerful magic. Out of nowhere Khazz came into the corridor as though in
flight. His blades a whirling funnel of steel. In rapid succession he landed
blow after blow. The doomed Ogre tried to defend, but the Half Elven ranger
would find a new place to strike for every spot the Ogre tried to defend,
opening new wounds with each pass. Cryth kept slashing with her scimitar and
Tarthug began to deliver crushing blows with his Midnight Mallet. Proving that
he was still a threat, the towering wall of muscle crushed Khazz, doing damage
that would have killed a less experienced warrior. He quickly shook it off and
maintained his assault. The three companions continued to pound the walking
horror until moments later Cryth dealt the killing blow.<br>
<br>
Khazz had locaked one of the guard captains and rushed the group into a small
room with a Froglock and three Tier’Dal necromancers and their pets. Before
the stunned shaman could react, Khazz had leapt into room and was bringing steel
death to the Froglock captain. Cryth was next to react, weilding her scimitar in
quick, sure swings. The Necromancers quickly reacted to Cryth’s presence and
joined the fight. . One foolishly tried to melee her while 2 more injured
themselves healing both the Froglock and meleeing necro. The pets attacked in
defense of their dark masters with little effect. Tarthug slowed the Froglock
making it more open to Khazz’s onslaught. Bonecracker, as the Froglock captain
was called, defended himself much better than had the earlier Ogre, but Khazz
dispatched it dispite the healing from the necromancers. He rapidly turned his
attention on the necromancer that had choosen to attack Cryth. He immediately
recieved the undivided attention of the Tier’Dal castors, likely due to his
taunt, “Your mother lets you outside the house with a face like that?! Ouch!
I’ve seen prettier Trolls!” To another he shouted “Didn’t I see you with
your High Elf boyfriend a while back?” Cryth kept Khazz healed and then cast a
devastating damage shield on the ranger that really took a toll on the 3
necromancers and their pets all trying to kill him. One enraged necro spouted
“I'll teach you to interfere with me Khazz”, Khazz quickly dropped her in a
heap and mockingly replied “Teach me then.” Tarthug began to methodically
poisen, blast and crush with his mallet. Another necro anounced “Time to die
Khazz!” to which he replied “Not likely!” She died next. Tarthug crushed a
skelletal pet, watching it crumble into a heap of bone and rotting flesh. Khazz
dispatched the remaining Tier’Dal and its pet concluding the battle. Cryth and
Tarthug began to regenerate their magical energy through meditation while Khazz
stood guard. They were exausted. The fight had lasted quite long and they had
been heavily outnumbered. Gradually they began to relax and the three started
talking.<br>
<br>
“Need an undead froglok tongue?”<br>
“Uhh..I have alot since the guild started hanging out in Lower Guk.” Replied
Tarthug and getting a giggle from Cryth.<br>
“Guys, frog boy had a key on him. I think it goes to Rathyls cell.” The
stench of death, or the bodies littering the floor did not affect Khazz’s
enthusiasm. “Let’s go pay him a visit!”<br>
“Who is this guy and will he give us a tough fight?”<br>
Khazz smiled “He’s an inkie … errr, Tier’Dal necro. He’s pretty
tough.”<br>
<br>
Tarthug grinned and began to recite ancient chants, Tarthug, then Khazz and
finally Cryth were surrounded by various auras. Muscles seemed to ripple more,
reactions heightened, and all seemed more resitant to various magics. It was at
this point that Ronar appeared as though materializing out of shadow. “Well
fought friends. There is more work to be done though, follow me.” Khazz ran to
the door, much like a child who was just told that they were going to the
tinker’s shop. Cryth grinned and followed, Tarthug even noted a skip in her
step. Tarthug rose slowly and surveyed the carnage in the room. Certainly the
Tribunal would be pleased with him. He had come and brought justice. He did not
know how his friends remained so enthusiastic in the midst of this carnal house
and wished he could share in their lighthearted temperment. He knew that they
too had kept his spirits up, but still he felt guilt and sadness. Even Shamus
had once told him he was too serious. Mather had once told him “You can’t
fight if you’re heart isn’t in it. You’ll be a danger to all around you.
You’re heart can’t be into any fight unless you can see the joy over the
shadow, or unless you’re really good at hating. Have you ever seen someone you
hated so badly that to bring about his or her death, you would be happy to die
too? No? Then you’d best get a sense of humour you sour puss.” That had been
a long time ago.<br>
<br>
“Tar! Ya coming?”<br>
“On my way, sorry.”<br>
“Whats on your mind shamie?” Cryth inquires mirthfully.<br>
“Oh, just giving praise to the Tribunal for having great friends who put
things into perspective.”<br>
“Ummm…like what?”<br>
Tarthug stops and looks around causing the others to stop and wait. Tarthug
gathers his friends in his arms and gives them a crushing bear hug.<br>
Khazz exclaims “Oh, Mother Tunare my spleen!”<br>
Cryth grunts and Ronar comments “Is he always like this?”<br>
As Tarthug releases his friends the air rushes back into their lungs. Still
gasping Cryth replies in a high pitched voice “Yep. Hasn’t changed a bit”<br>
Ronar, Khazz, and Cryth look up at the huge Northerner, sniffling and rubbing
the moisture out of the corners of his eyes. His gored armour and weapons
quickly pass without notice as the emotions cross his face and read like a book.
The hardened judge, jury and executioner sheds his shell and begins to cry tears
of joy. The others pass amused looks among themselves.<br>
<br>
“This is going to be interesting.” Comments Ronar.<br>
“Usually is.” Notes Khazz.<br>
<br>
With that the four heros head into the depths of Najena. Life against death,
laughter battles fear, and friendship combats hate. Soon, where there was
darkness, light is found. Shadows are lifted, both those that conceal evil and
those that hold down the spirit. All hail the Companions.<br>
