<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">Fishing is the only &quot;trade&quot;
that I am close to master at. I can't remember what my actual level is, but I do
quite well at is. So here is my contribution.<br>
<br>
As someone else said, buy 2 fishing poles, as you will get the occasional broken
pole until you get your skill up. I haven't broken a pole in quite awhile, but I
think I went through 3 to 4 broken ones. Poles cost a couple gold pieces. You
should be able to buy them at any dock. In Butcherblock, the High Elf merchant
close to the shore sells both pole and bait.<br>
<br>
Early on, you will lose bait, but now that I am higher, I don't lose very often,
and can count on catching something for each bit of bait.<br>
<br>
*A money saving tip* Quite a few foragers will forage grubs and drop them. If
you see something lying on the ground, with no one about, check it out - it
might be droppped grubs. Before my foraging skill increased, that is mostly how
I kept myself in grubs.<br>
<br>
To keep my pole and grubs in, I have a 4 slot belt pouch. That gives me some
place to keep the pole, a stack of grubs, and the products of labor. If you open
the pouch and go full screen, you have some place to put your catch.<br>
<br>
<br>
You will catch one of 4 things that I've seen so far:<br>
<br>
<br>
- a fish<br>
<br>
- fish scales<br>
<br>
- a rusty dagger<br>
<br>
- a sandal (looks like it's got algae on it - ewwww)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Each will consume one bit of bait when caught. I'm still half expecting to pull
out an old tire someday<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->

<br>
<br>
When you are starting out, sell the daggers and sandals back to the merchant for
bait money. The fish you can either keep to eat, or sell. They bring a couple
silver apiece, so you might be able to buy some food for cheaper, and make a
profit by selling. The scales you can either sell or donate to a caster who has
the Enduring Breath spell. I keep them, since I have the spell.<br>
<br>
You have to be in just the right spot to fish - too far from the water and you
will get a &quot;trying to catch land-sharks, perhaps?&quot; message. Too close,
and you will get a &quot;you must be standing on dry land to fish&quot; message.
Guess they've never seen the fishermen I grew up in Florida with<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->

 I usually stand on the edge of a dock.<br>
<br>
Remember to put your catch in the pouch before clicking the Fishing button
again, as you can't fish with something in your hand. I usually practice my
Sense Heading and Forage in conjunction with Fishing, and work out a decent
clicking rhythm. A good time to fish is while waiting for the boat, or tell your
friends to meet you at a dock next time your group up. You can make a small
profit or feed yourself while waiting.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, I enjoy fishing. It seems like it would be boring, since you
are just clicking a button. But it forces me to be still and watch the sunset
for a bit, or watch the interesting conversations go by.<br>
<br>
And 2 last things to remember:<br>
<br>
1. Always remember to put your pole away when done. Nothing is worse than
realizing you are whacking something blue to you with a bamboo pole!<br>
<br>
2. Don't spill your beer while bringing in your line<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
