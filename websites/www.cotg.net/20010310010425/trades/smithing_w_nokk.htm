Freeport is the place for smithing, because the ore is in N Freeport and the
molds are in E Freeport. That's still two zones apart, but it's as close as ore
and molds get in the world. Also, I did the newbie rogue quest 10 times to get
my merchant faction to amiable, for better prices. You will buy and sell LOTS of
stuff.<br>
<br>
The dwarven armor store in N Freeport (by the bard's guild) has the sharpening
stones and ore. Trader's Holiday in E Freeport has the molds. When you get to
making banded armor and weapons, Ithkar's Armor in E Freeport has both the molds
and the sheet metal (armor and weapons do not use ore). Also, a forge is just
outside the door to Ithkar's, making it THE place for armor-making smiths.<br>
<br>
Sharpen weapons till skill 21. Then switch to making scalers till skill 41.
Note: Success at a scaler returns a file and a large container lid mold; I have
never seen a scaler and don't know what one is. Then work lanterns till skill
61. After 61, work skewers (very frustrating; expect lots o' failures) for skill
and make banded for...well, because you can.<br>
<br>
At about 60, you can make banded gorgets and bracers with 2/3 success - enough
to pay for itself. At 75 or so, you can make boots. At about 85 or 90, you can
make everything but cloaks, leggings, and tunics. You can make tunics at 100. At
100, the skill is actually profitable, by the way. Wait for 110 or even 120 to
try leggings and cloaks, and you will likely still get many failures. At about
130, you can make everything often enough to turn a good profit. You can make
armor at much lower skill levels (I know a fellow who made a helm at skill 27),
but it will be a fluke, not a way to make money.<br>
<br>
Stat-wise, use your STR buff every time you go to the forge, and NEVER work
while encumbered. Also, do what you can to boost your DEX; even just a couple
derv rings will help. However, do not lower your WIS to add DEX; WIS helps too.
As with all trade skills, WIS helps with success and INT helps with skill.
That's why I have a Magoo Mug: +5 DEX and +10 INT is a huge help at the forge.<br>
<br>
Good luck at the forge.</font>
