</h1>
<p><font color="#FFCC66">Version 2.0 - updated April 2001</font></p>
<p>Since writing the original version of this guide, there have been many
advances in Fishing. So it's time to haul out the old pole, head off to the dock,
and show you the new and exciting changes. <font face="AGaramond" size="3">Remember
that every fisherperson has their secrets - if I'm going to show you my
favorites spots and bait, then by Tunare, show me yours! If you've got any
suggestions for further updates or corrections, please post them on the Trade
Skills board.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">You might be wondering, why fish? What good
is it? There are several reasons to become a fisherperson [yes, this guide is
politically correct]. One is to make time go faster while waiting for the boat,
or waiting to meet up with friends. You can make a small
profit or feed yourself while waiting. Fishing is a skill that complements other
trades - Baking, Brewing, and Smithing use fish in some of their recipes. Believe it or not, I enjoy fishing. It seems like it would be boring, since you
are just clicking a button. But it forces me to be still and watch the sunset
for a bit, or watch the interesting conversations go by. I usually practice my
Sense Heading and Forage in conjunction with Fishing, and work out a decent
clicking rhythm.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">As a young fisherperson, just starting out,
you will need a pole and bait. Consider buying 2 fishing poles, as you will get the occasional broken
pole, usually at the worst time - you're out in the field, not a merchant near,
and SNAP - there goes your pole. They only cost a couple gold pieces, and it's
worth it in the long run. I am a Master [No bait jokes there! *Thwacks the more
impudent members of the audience with a cane pole*] and I still have runs of bad
luck, sometimes breaking 2 or 3 in the same night.&nbsp; Plain poles will do,
though there are other interesting poles out there. Contrary to rumor, there are
no known unbreakable poles. Here's a tip for you though that may save you a few
gold. Along the Butcherblock shoreline is a dwarf who fishes, when he's not
being hunted mercilessly by ill-mannered druids. When he is killed, he drops his
pole, which is sometime left to rot with his body. Loot it and use it, as Tunare abhors
waste.</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">There are many, many
places that supplies can be had, including most docks. Parn Gylwyn at the
Butcherblock dock and I go <i>way</i> back. </font>Once you've chosen a stout
pole, it's time to get bait. This is available on most vendors who sell the
poles, but here is another money saving tip: <font face="AGaramond" size="3">Quite a few foragers will forage grubs and drop them. If
you see something lying on the ground, with no one about, check it out - it
might be dropped fishing grubs. Before my foraging skill increased, that is mostly how
I kept myself in grubs. Yes, I've heard this windfall termed &quot;druid
droppings&quot; but you'd best not use that term on the quiz, younglings!</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">
To store my pole and grubs, I have a 4 slot belt pouch. That gives me some
place to keep the poles, a stack of grubs, and the products of labor. If you open
the pouch and go full screen, you have some place to put your catch.</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">Keep in mind that early on, you will lose bait, but now that I am higher, I don't lose
it very often,
and can count on catching something for nearly every bit of bait. So when you
start, make sure you've got plenty to keep you awhile.</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">
You have to be in just the right spot to fish - too far from the water and you
will get a &quot;trying to catch land-sharks, perhaps?&quot; message. Too close,
and you will get a &quot;you must be standing on dry land to fish&quot; message.
Guess they've never seen the fishermen I grew up in Florida with<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->.

 I usually stand on the edge of a dock. Take your weapon out of your primary
weapon slot, and place the pole there. Once you are in the right spot, simply
click the &quot;fishing&quot; button.</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">
You will catch one of 4 things that I've seen so far:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="AGaramond" size="3">a fish - varies by zone and type</font></li>
  <li><font face="AGaramond" size="3">fish scales</font></li>
  <li><font face="AGaramond" size="3">a rusty dagger</font></li>
  <li><font face="AGaramond" size="3">a sandal (looks like it's got algae on it - ewwww)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">
Each will consume one bit of bait when caught. I'm still half expecting to pull
out an old tire someday<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->.
 <img alt=":)" src="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif" width="15" height="15"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->
 When you catch one of the above, it will be on the end of your cursor.
Remember to put your catch in the pouch before clicking the Fishing button
again, or you will get a message that you can't fish with something in your hand.
<br>
<br>
When you are starting out, sell the daggers and sandals back to the merchant for
bait money. The scales you can either sell or donate to a caster who has
the Enduring Breath spell. I keep them, since I have the spell. Fresh fish you can either keep to
eat or use in baking or brewing, or sell to a merchant or fellow player. They bring a couple
silver apiece to a merchant, so you might be able to buy some food for cheaper, and make a
profit by selling. Other types of fish are not known to usable in baking or brewing,
but a few are using in smithing and fishing.</font></p>
<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3">Using a tackle box and hooks, found on various vendors
around Norrath, you can combine a few types of the fish and other items, and get fish
scales, lures, and other things (some also require a skinning knife, a
smith-made tool). Currently, lures do not appear to be terribly
useful as they act just like normal bait, but cost more to create. But hopefully
they will be changed to some advantage in the future.</font> Making lures <i>does</i>
increase your fishing skill, but it's really not cost efficient. However, if you
are far away from water, but still want something to do that will increase your
fishing skill at the lower levels, this may be ideal for you. One of the items
needed comes from the tailoring skill - silk thread. It's an item that is made
from combining 2 spiderling silks, which trivials at 15.<font face="AGaramond" size="3"><br>
<br>
And 2 last things to remember:<br>
<br>
1. Always remember to put your pole away when done. Nothing is worse than
realizing you are whacking something blue to you with a bamboo pole!<br>
<br>
2. Don't spill your beer while bringing in your line.
