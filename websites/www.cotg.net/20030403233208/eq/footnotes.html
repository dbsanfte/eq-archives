Footnote-Footnote 1: Master Baiter. Get it? I kill me. I suspect you'd like to right about now, too.

Footnote 3: There isn't really a footnote here. I was just curious to see if you'd look. It's kinda childish to go "made you look", but I did, so I feel like I should say it. "Made you look." There. I feel better. Don't you? No? Well, I'm sorry, that's not my problem. Don't look at me like that. I didn't mean anything by it. Ok, I'm sorry. Now go back and finish reading the updates. You were reading about the new 55s, in case you forgot.

Footnote 1: Of course, that little nagging voice in my head says that it wouldn't have been a huge update if I didn't wait almost 2 months to do it, but we don't listen to that little voice. Usually. Well, ok, sometimes the little voice says we should go for ice cream, but mostly we ignore it. Especially about starting fires. Starting a fire is bad. Even under Aggart. I think...

Footnote 0: You're not supposed to look through the footnotes on your own. You're supposed to follow the links. Stop exploiting, and play the game like it's supposed to be played. You probably parse the spell data file too, don't you. I've just marked you're account. Now, go back to the <a href="welcome.html#jan29">front page</a>. Cheater.

Footnote 2: Well, not new, exactly. Relatively new. New like in relationship, I suppose, since 2 months is pretty new for a relationship. But not new like in bananas. You keep a banana around for 2 months and it's pretty nasty. Ok, sure, you could bronze it and keep it forever, but I mean, it's just a banana. Maybe it's time to just let it go, and move on to some fresher fruit.

Footnote 4: Yes, I *know* fist-guy is lame. I completely ran out of juice. The only thing I could think of also kinda relates to what you call people who just got 101 skill in fishing.<a href="#5">*</a> Pretty childish, really. And since you should never make fun of monks (well, except when they fall down...), I couldn't really say that on the main page, now, could I. Besides, children might be reading this. Now go back to the bit right after the epics.

Footnote 6: And to the rest of you: STOP LEVELING. These gold bars are expensive. Not to mention the cost of engraving, and the little indented class logo thingie... I mean, I'm not made of platinum. Well, one tooth, but that doesn't count. 
<br>
(go <a href="welcome.html#jan29">back</a>. or not. we're all done here, anyway, so you can go on to a completely different page now, if you'd like. and no, i don't know why we're whispering.)

And by kudos, I mean congratulations, not <a href="http://www.kudosbar.com/kudos/index.html">these</a>. I wanted to give the chocolate bars, but when I called the Mars company and asked for a box, they wouldn't take "Stall 186, The Bazaar, Bristlebane" as a valid mailing address. Just as well, I guess, because for some odd reason they wouldn't take a pus-filled rat liver in exchange, either, like my gem merchant does. Weird.

According to the English Accolades Measurement System, there are 1.7 Kudos in a Laudation, and 2.4 Laudations equals 1.83 Admirations (or 7.6 Commendations, obviously).... <br><br>
The complexity of the EAMS led researchers at the <i>L'Informatique Du Pomme De Terre Avec Fromage</i> in Quebec to develop the Laud as a standard unit of praise equal to the polite applause at a 100 seat basement theatre after a college production of "Waiting for Godot"....<br><br>

For reference, a gigalaud is approximately equal to a touchdown cheer for the Buccaneers at the Superbowl. At the opposite end of the scale, a single golf clap is a microlaud, which was previously believed to be the fundamental particle of praise, the "Kudon".<br><br>

In 1997, a team of french praisicists and pastry chefs, using halogen lasers, particle accelerators, and a half-melted chocolate bar managed to split the Kudon. They discovered the Sound of One Hand Clapping, and single-handedly pissed off Zen Buddhists throughout the world.

Cilene was actually supposed to be a part of the previous update, but I missed her somehow. I'd like to take this time to personally apologize to Cilene for this horrendous, monstrous oversight. I am truly and deeply sorry.<br><br>
I'd also like to take a moment to assure everyone that there is <b>no</b> pro-Cilene shadow-mafia, and those batches of cookies were burnt due to my inattentiveness, not because of a mob of mana-burning pro-Cilene wizards and crazed Iksar monks wearing "I Heart Cilene" aprons reducing my oven to a smoldering heap of twisted metal, as some of you may have incorrectly heard. There is absolutely no truth to any of those rumors. Disregard them. <b>Please</b>.
