The rain seemed to fall in sheets. Nothing could remain dry for long and
rivulets and puddles quickly formed in depressions as the water strictly adhered
to the laws of nature and found it’s way towards lower elevation. Eventually
the water would find its way to the ocean where its cycle would begin anew.<br>
<br>
The rain help no appeal to Horgroom Bentle. He and his men had been game hunting
for 4 days straight without a lot of luck. Aside from the rain obscuring tracks,
the Wood Elf he had hired to track game had not shown the results he had
promised. That was the last time he’d listen to a recommendation from Crow.
He’d been tracking a grizzly bear now for the last 2 days in as it seemingly
traveled in circles and now the rain would mean they had lost him. This was not
typical behavior for a bear. To make matters worse, many of their supplies had
disappeared and now the rain threatened to destroy what was left. It did not
seem that anything was going his way. He had considered restocking provisions at
an inn not too far from the guard tower, but his purse had become lighter and he
had nothing to show for it so far. If he was lucky his men would find the
werewolf reported to travel these parts and he could sell the trophy for a tidy
profit. Surely he must have done something terrible in a previous life to
deserve this kind of luck.<br>
<br>
Estlain Aainehyll was in as black a mood as he ever had been. This was no life
for even a fallen ranger. Using his tracking skills for rich idiots with more
money than brains had provided him with a living that was tolerable, but the
last 4 days had been without reward and now his reputation was being torn apart
by bad luck, bad weather, and he was sure someone or something was stalking
them, scaring off the wildlife and stealing supplies. Whatever it was it left
almost no trace of its passage and had managed to dodge some of the traps he had
laid for it. The hunt was anything but and hadn’t so much as snared a rabbit
in the last 4 days.<br>
<br>
There was a mischievous intelligence in the way they were stalked. This morning
one of the porters they had hired to mind the pack animals had ran screaming
after putting on his small clothes. Their stalker had presumably left a small
colony of biting ants in the small clothes and the man’s groin had swollen to
twice its ordinary size from the fury of the insects bites and stings. He’d
live but he walked slower and somewhat hunched over. It had slowed them down a
little, but getting a new porter would have taken them back to Qeynos and slowed
them down till they were able to depart and resume the hunt. The behavior of
their stalker was difficult to anticipate. He was pretty sure he was dealing
with a sprite of some sort, a ranger, or a druid. Anything that could avoid
detection for so long, dodge traps, and scare off game without alerting the
hunters had to have a great deal of woodland knowledge. It could not be an
Unkempt Druid as he would have attacked by now killing them all or dying in the
process, while any protector of the pine would have scowled and moved on. Wood
spirits were almost never seen in West Karana making them unlikely culprits.
There was no denying the reality of his situation, and if he didn’t resolve it
soon Horgroom would likely find another guide and he would have to find another
place to find fools to guide for. He cursed Tunare, something he’d been doing
a lot of late. If she existed, he’d have much to answer for. Of all of the
rotten luck, why was good fortune so evasive for him?<br>
<br>
Javik Grovlok thought about going back to Halas. He missed the comforts of warm
tankards of Halas heaters, a warm hearth fire, and large breasted woman to bear
him lots of children. His size alone had won him many jobs as a caravan escort
and now he was scouting ahead of the hunting party. The blasted rain made it
hard to see anything and his woodcraft was next to nonexistent. That bloody Wood
Elf had clearly placed him as an advanced guard to trigger traps and act as a
moving target against whatever had been hunting them the last 4 days. It was bad
enough when he putt his bronze boots in the morning and found them full of bear
dung. A cleaning and oiling had not completely removed the smell from the boots
and he would need to take a bath at some point to get the stink off of his feet
and legs.<br>
<br>
Javik was deep in thought as he nearly tripped over a white cloaked figure. The
man wore a bushy cloak he recognized as one like Martar Icebear’s. He had seen
it once before as Martar butchered a friend of his. He had his hands and knees
in the wet grass with his ear to the ground. His eyes were open and seemed to
dart from corner to corner without focusing on anything, the rest of him was
completely motionless. Having seen the cloak, Javik backed off and called for
the guide. This was odd and he wanted no part of any strange man with a cloak
like Martar Icebear’s.<br>
<br>
Estlain came running into the clearing and saw the huddled shape. Horgroom
arrived shortly after and stepped forward to talk to the man.<br>
“Who are you and what are you doing stranger?”<br>
“SHEESSHH! “ replied the white cloaked stranger as he motioned the wealthy
human to towards the ground.<br>
Horgroom had no idea what to make of all of this and turned to his hired guide.
Estlain shrugged all the while keeping his eyes on the stranger. They waited
several minutes as the rain continued to come down. They seemed to not notice it
with the recent event of finding this odd white cloaked man. It was then the man
spoke.<br>
“Listen.” He said motioning to the ground again.<br>
Estlain and Horgroom looked at each other and shrugged, they were not sure of
what was happening here, but the cloaked man seemed very sure of himself. His
confidence prompted them to kneel in the wet grass with their ears to the
ground.<br>
“What are we listening for?” asked Horgroom.<br>
“SHEESSHH! “ replied the white cloaked stranger.<br>
The three men knelt there for ten minutes listening to the ground and the
falling rain. Jarvik looked at the others and then put his ear to the ground as
well. Another minute later Jarvik stood up. “I hear nothing! This man is has
been in the rain too long and his senses are waterlogged!”<br>
“Silence fool!” replied Horgroom, clearly losing patience with the large
Barbarian warrior.<br>
After 5 more minutes, Estlain raised his water logged head and quietly asked
“What are we listening for?”<br>
“SHEESSHH! “ replied the white cloaked stranger.<br>
After a few more moments Horgroom raised his head.<br>
“I hear nothing.”<br>
“I know.” said the stranger “Its been like that for the last 4 days.”<br>
Horgroom showed no comprehension of what had just transpired wondering why they
were all listening to nothing for such a period of time.<br>
Estlain on the other hand leapt to his feet baring a glimmering longsword from a
sealskin sheath, backing away from the stranger and pointing at him with his
free hand.<br>
Javik and the others had no idea of the peril they were in and were laughing at
the lunacy of the whole scene.<br>
The white cloaked stranger started moving after Estlain had, but had two weapons
brandished before the other had his weapon fully unsheathed. In one hand he had
a gleaming stone tomahawk, in the other the curved sword that marked him as a
ranger or merit. The smile on his face did not take away from the dangerous
glint in his eye.<br>
“Its him!” Shouted Estlain. “He’s the stalker!”<br>
“I am Farbain Longshot of Surefall Glades. You are poaching on the sacred
lands of Karana and I am about to change that. Leave or die.”<br>
Horgroom responded “You threaten us yet we outnumber you? You must truly be
insane. We are not leaving, not so long as I have…” he turned around to show
the cloaked man his hunting party, but discovered, much to his discomfort that
most of it had fled. He hadn’t seen the man with the swollen testicles
breaking rank, followed by several others.<br>
Horgroom quickly changed the tone of his voice. “We have no quarrel with the
Jagged Pine. We’ll leave as proof of our goodwill.”<br>
The ranger didn’t move and the same dangerous smile remained on his face as
the men he faced began to hurriedly gather their belongings and head back
towards Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Horgroom turned back to look for him but could not see the ranger anywhere. Next
time he’d have to hire someone to kill the man. For now it made more sense to
return another day.<br>
<br>
Farbain slid back the Ivy mail from his head allowing the rain the wash over his
face. The poachers had left without bloodshed. They’d likely be back, but for
now he had won. It had taken four days to properly tamper with their spirit. As
the rain fell across his face he leaned his head back and laughed. He felt
lucky.</font>
