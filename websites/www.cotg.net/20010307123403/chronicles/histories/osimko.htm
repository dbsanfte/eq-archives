<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">I have taken the initiative to fill in
the rest of the story of Osimko, as it was told to me in the Karana's recently.
The initial part was taken for the CoTG Archives.<br>
<br>
A Warrior Confused<br>
<br>
A fledgling member of the Ashen Order, Osimko became a member when found
wandering the streets of Freeport as an abandoned child. Taken under the wing of
the prominent Monk Masoni, Osimko has learned the ways of the order: Peace,
Tranquility, and Inner Harmony. While out studying the movements of the Sand
Scarab, Osimko and his Master were set upon by a horde of Giants; Sand, Hill,
and even Frost were seen that day. Though Masoni fought them, he was soon
overpowered. In his dyeing breath he sent Osimko to report his death and the
gathering of the powerful giants to the Guild. Osimko did as he was bid, and has
sworn Blood Oath to avenge his Master. When informed of the death, the guild was
dismayed; not only because of a death of one of its members, but because of the
violence in Osimko's response to it. The Guild Masters discussed his feelings
with Osimko and could not make him understand that revenge was a negative
feeling and would not allow him to attain the commitment and understanding
required to progress in the Order. With heavy hearts they sent Osimko on a quest
of understanding; understanding of himself and of Life. Today he wanders Norrath,
meeting people, assisting where he can and trying to understand what the Guild
Masters were trying to say. In his wanderings he came upon the Companions of the
Gate, a group that seems dedicated to understanding life and battling evil. He
has pledged to assist them, as they need. Moonshadow, the Leader of the
Companions, has proven very adept at keeping him busy and in shape, not only
with the distance of her travels, but with the Evil she overcomes. Elentari, the
Ranger, has become a role model to him in her dedication and resolve, as well as
in her friendship and teachings. Deep down though, he knows that he will not
find his place in his Guild nor the Companions until he conquers his internal
fears; and that means overcoming the Giants.<br>
<br>
And so Osimko left the embrace of his new friends to travel more and plan his
revenge. His travels took him to the sewers of Qeynos where he met up with
another ranger, Farbain. Together they managed to clear the sewers of the Thugs
and Smugglers that made it their home. Many a hard battle was fought, no quarter
asked nor given. But even this could not keep Osimko content, his blood burned
for revenge. He again left to continue his quest for revenge. Traveling the
Planes of Karana, in its most Northern part, Osimko was assisting some Farmers
rid their fields of the pesky beetles when in the distance he saw an approaching
figure. Soon, Osimko realized he was watching the approach of a Hill Giant, and
it appeared intent upon razing the farm of its peaceful inhabitants. Osimko
tried to persuade the farmers to run, but they insisted they would not leave
their home. Thoughts of running flew quickly through Osimko’s head, maybe
drawing the attention of the Giant away from the farmers, maybe running now
before it was too late. As he was thinking of these things, his green crystal
started to glow again. Having ignored it for so long he was surprised that he
would be distracted by it now. Concentrating, he heard the voices of Moonshadow
and Elentari, discussing the guild gathering about to take place in a land
called Mistmoore. And other voices discussing how the rescue of their brothers
and sisters would require everyone to help and how many would fall to the evil
that lived in that land. Moonshadow pledged to ensure everyone’s final
victory, and Elentari seconded it with her life-vow, to protect her Family while
breath still flowed in her lungs.<br>
<br>
Osimko shook his head to clear it, and his Masters voices came back to him,
talking of loyalty and honour. Looking at the approaching Giant, Osimko vowed to
save the family, or to die trying. He approached the creature and threw a flurry
of punches getting its attention, and was greeted with a boulder sized fist to
the back. Rolling with the hit, Osimko planned to outrun the Giant back to some
friendly guards he remembered. But today was not a good day for running for the
rain had just stopped and the fields were muddy, Osimko’s feet could not find
good purchase and he kept slipping. Taking such a beating, Osimko knew he would
not make it to the guards and decided to put up a fight and maybe start his
revenge on the Giants. With flurries of punches and kicks, he managed to land
many hits on the Giant, but the Giant hardly seemed to notice. Knowing he was
near death, Osimko remembered his old teacher telling him about his ability to
fool his enemy’s by appearing dead, and being able to win the day after they
though him finished. Though having never done this before, Osimko tried, so that
he would get his revenge. Sadly, the attempt failed, and as he lay there hoping,
the Giant finished him off.<br>
<br>
To his credit, Osimko did save the farmer and his family, for though not beaten;
the Giant was wounded and left to heal himself.<br>
<br>
I thought it fitting that his adopted family know what happened to him.<br>
