  OK... all I can recommend is what NOT to do. I got to Master Smith by doing
  everything people later told me was dumb/way too expensive...<br>
  - Do NOT work on skewers until you have trivialed scalers and lanterns.
  Scalers are actually profitable on a success, selling back to the vendors. A
  failure will still give you a new item that you can sell for a partial
  recovery of cost. Lanterns are not profitable but are easier, however there
  are more items needed for them.<br>
  - Do NOT use armor for increasing your skill level. I have had many people
  tell me that armor actually has a penalty assessed against it in learning
  smithing. I have nothing to prove this but I do know my skill did not improve
  much when making armor but did when making other stuff.<br>
  - Do your smithing in Freeport - the stuff to make metal bits, and water are
  both available in North FP, and there are two forges there (there are also
  four other forges in FP, one in the Militia house, one at the Warrior guild
  out the back door, one in East FP at Ikthar's Armor, and one in the bad
  section of town, just beware Scraps, as the guards like him...). Metal bits
  are your life until you start making armor and weapons. Metal bits also enjoy
  failing even when they are 40 points past your trivial level so be prepared
  for that.<br>
  - Do NOT attempt smithing with both a WIS and INT below 80. Find items that
  will boost both of these. Go out of your way to do this. If you are tight on
  money concentrate on WIS items, if you are not go for INT items. STR also
  supposedly affects the success rate, boost that if possible, which leads to...<br>
  - Do NOT do smithing while overweight. Apparently this has an actual effect on
  the success rate. I don't know why, but I've seen this on a few web sites
  (which elude me now...)<br>

  Groflahs' Forge in North Freeport sells sharpening stones and small pieces of
  ore. Two small pieces of ore are used to make one metal bit.<br>
  <br>
  Armor by Ikthar in East Freeport sells armor molds and sheets of metal. I
  don't remember her name, Istlyn or somesuch, but she is the vendor that has
  them.<br>
  <br>
  Trader's Holiday in East FP - Vendor named Tislan sells most of the molds used
  to advance the skill, molds for things like spits, baking items, and, most
  importantly, scaler and skewer molds.<br>
  <br>
  Blue building next to Trader's Holiday in East FP - Vendor in corner named
  Jillian Dayson sells the molds used to make weapons and containers. She also
  sells the books with recipies.<br>
  <br>
  I think one of the armor recipies may be broken, I did not verify this tonight
  but I want to say one item has an incorrect listing for the number of sheets
  you use to make them. I'll look it up at some point soon.<br>
  <br>

  Small tips... OK...<br>
  </font>
  <br>
  I don't know if sharpening stones are useful or not. I think I'd go with
  making metal bits as they can be used again to make other stuff and advance
  the skill further. Making metal bits... go to Groflahs', buy 80 small pieces
  of ore (they stack). go buy 80 waters. Go make metal bits. Take all the metal
  bits, and the 40+ waters you still have left, go to East FP and get as many
  scaler molds as you have metal bits. At least I *think* it's one to one on the
  metal bits (I'll look this up and update this again). Use the forge next to
  Ikthar's to make the scalers, on a success you get a container lid mold or
  some similar such, and a file. A failure just gives you the file (I don't know
  why, but hey, it's free!). In general, you want to stock up on items from
  North, make the items in North, then go to East. It saves you running around
  the city zoning excessively. I'd say if possible get 80 metal bits before
  heading to East FP, and bring water with you. I found that if you buy over and
  over from a vendor tha tthe vendor starts giving you a break on prices. It's a
  small cut but after a while it helps out a bit. If you do develop such a
  break, don't sell all of your items to that vendor; whie he will give you a
  better price, the next time you go buy stuff from him he will have taken back
  the price cuts. It's a balance thing I guess. (:<br>
