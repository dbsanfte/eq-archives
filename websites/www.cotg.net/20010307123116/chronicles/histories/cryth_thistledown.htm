<hr>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Cryth is the second of three sisters from
the tree city of Kelethin. Tunare’s presence was strongest in this middle
child and Cryth didn’t hesitate to devote her life as a priestess of Tunare.
She tended after the great trees of her home as well as the creatures that
inhabited the Faydark. Her strength and healing blessed anyone she crossed paths
with. Cryth grew up on the island of Faydwer, spending many seasons on the
continent that holds her homeland. She spent time among the wee folk of Faydwer,
the Gnomes and Dwarves, and grew to like the Gnomes especially for their
humorous ways. She is also quite fond of Dwarves, despite their gruff humor, for
they too know how to have fun and be merry while drinking strong spirits.<br>
<br>
As Cryth grew more experienced and was hearing of even grander places from her
elder sister Andrea, she began to think of traveling to the far places described
to her. It wasn’t long before she was sitting upon the docks in Butcherblock
waiting for the boat that would take her to foreign lands. Freeport was a dirty
city and much too crowded, but the mix of humanity there was quite astonishing.
The Commonlands were much more to her style and beyond the Serpent’s Spine,
she discovered her favorite place of all – The Plains of Karana. While Cryth
is a priestess of Tunare, she recognizes the value of Karana and his rains that
nourish life and makes things grow.<br>
<br>
Cryth’s introduction to the Companions occurred on a rather fateful night that
I’d share, as it will interest ye listeners. She had returned to Kelethin and
was sitting on the platform outside the Bank. A young man had been shouting for
help for several minutes without seeming reply from anyone below. Deciding that
she would offer her assistance, Cryth asked what she might be able to do to
help. He told a tale of such woe, having drowned in the moat that surrounds the
vile home of Clan Crushbone where he had been trying to vanquish the orcs that
constantly plagued Kelethin. Understanding his distress, Cryth told the young
man to meet her in front of the bank where she would bless him with the Spirit
of Wolf and Enduring Breath. The young adventurer was quite happy to come to her
and within minutes he had returned to the city with all of his belongings and
his manner quite overjoyed. Cryth was surprised when the young man, whose name
was Fenn, asked her to wait but a few minutes longer and he would introduce her
to a friend of his. Agreeable to waiting, she continued to sit upon the platform
outside the bank in amused puzzlement. Then a most powerful druid (at least so
he appeared to her at the time) approached and thanked her heartily for
assisting the younger Fenn. He bestowed fine gifts as well, items suitable for a
young priestess learning her arts, as he gave her a Blackened Medallion and two
Electrum Jaded Bracelets. Cryth had never seen such fine jewelry and was humbled
by the older druid’s generosity. The druid’s name was Oake and he was very
kind to chat with Cryth a bit afterwards. Cryth immediately liked him and when
he offered her a place in his guild, she was more than willing to accept. When
she recognized the voices of Montes and Tadwen through the voice of the guild,
who were two of the bravest adventurers that had once helped her sister Andrea
in a similar situation as Fenn’s, Cryth knew she had found a home among
friends. It didn’t take long before Cryth had made many new friends among the
Companions of the Gate and truly felt as one of them.</font>
