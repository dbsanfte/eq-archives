  <p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have taken the initiative 
    to fill in the rest of the story of Osimko, as it was told to me in the Karana's 
    recently. The initial part was taken for the CoTG Archives.<br>
    <br>
    A Warrior Confused<br>
    <br>
    A fledgling member of the Ashen Order, Osimko became a member when found wandering 
    the streets of Freeport as an abandoned child. Taken under the wing of the 
    prominent Monk Masoni, Osimko has learned the ways of the order: Peace, Tranquility, 
    and Inner Harmony. While out studying the movements of the Sand Scarab, Osimko 
    and his Master were set upon by a horde of Giants; Sand, Hill, and even Frost 
    were seen that day. Though Masoni fought them, he was soon overpowered. In 
    his dyeing breath he sent Osimko to report his death and the gathering of 
    the powerful giants to the Guild. </font></p>
