<p>Lythanders Story...<br>
<br>
I sit down on a near by tree root, fairly tired, but anxious at the opportunity
that has been presented to me. Elentari, the First Ranger of the Companions, has
decided to build a chronicle of who we are, and how we found the companions. Of
course I find it amazing that anyone would want to here my story, being the
knave that I am, but I am honored none the less.<br>
<br>
She sits on the ground in true ranger style, pulls out a quill and paper, and
makes a joke telling me to speak slowly, I smile at her lost a moment in her
radiance, and begin to tell my story...<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it's not much of a story to be sure First Ranger, but since you have
come all this way to hear it, I will certainly speak it true. Though some names
I may leave out... to protect the innocent.&quot; I smile at her, though she
isn't looking at me, but rather at the paper, after a particularly long pause,
she looks up and gives me a raised eyebrow look to imply she is waiting. I laugh
a bit, but go on. &quot;Well, okay then. As you know, when I was young, I lived
in Kelethin in the craftsman district with my mother and father. Mother, was a
baker by trade. Oh, she would make the most marvelous meals! She even cooked for
the king of Felewithe once. Well, okay, that's a lie... But I bet the king
would've loved her food! I know I did.&quot; I pause and see that the corners of
her mouth are upturned in a smile, but she continues to write. &quot;Well, she
taught me to bake, and how to do things like, make dough, find eggs, and I took
to it naturally enough. Twasn't a hard thing to read a recipe book after all,
and I was quite literate at that age. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, my father, I didn't know very well. He was also a craftsman by trade.
As you know the most dangerous job in Kelethin are the craftsman who ensure the
bonds of the tree village are secure. They dangle along the undersides of the
city checking all the fasteners and wood bolts, the repair boards that have come
loose, and spot potential hazards. Well, my father was a good man, and a
trusting sort. But trusting to a fault I fear. For one day, his harness that was
supposed to be secured tightly at the other end gave way. And he plummeted
several hundred feet to the ground. The clerics of Tunare came quickly, but I
think my father chose to stay with Tunare above, for what ever his reasons.
So... I was left with me and mother. Now mother was a dear woman, and she had
the bakery and the towns insurance to keep her going. But we gradually kept
moving to a smaller and smaller house. Well, as you can see I was left with only
one choice.<br>
<br>
&quot;And so I moved out on my own...&quot; I blush a bit and clear my throat.
&quot;Uhm, Ele, the next bit of my history is well.... Less than honorable shall
we say? Are you sure you want to hear it all&quot; I managed to get her to smile
again in her dazzling fashion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, only if you want to tell me.&quot; She remarked. And I did, I wanted
to tell her everything, but Tunare, this was going to be difficult.<br>
<br>
I cleared my throat yet again before I speak. &quot;Well, while out on my own I
learned to do things like forage, track, I learned to use a scimitar that I had
got off one of those nasty decaying skeletons that seem to appear now and again.
And one day, whilst sitting at a druid circle in Kelethin, I saw her...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare?&quot; Elentari breathed out the name in reverence.<br>
<br>
I grinned, &quot;Er. Not quite, it was this cute little woodelf in a crested
suit of chain mail, with her brother. They had sat down to eat for a bit during
their day of hunting. I looked at my foraged roots and determined that, maybe
there was something better out there for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the brother spoke to her, and said something along the lines of I'll
go find one. So, I talked to her. She was charismatic, charming, very
intelligent, and lived upon the fourth tiers. Well, we would talk in between her
brother going out to find crush bone orc's, and eventually, well, to be...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You slept with her.&quot; Elentari stuck her tongue out at me, and I
turned the loveliest shade of red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Er, thanks for being blunt, yes. I slept with her, and I had a great meal
that she snuck up to me and a bed of the finest silk and stuffed with the most
wonderful feathers, and sprinkled with flowers. But of course, this couldn't
last. After all I was a poor person. Well, time passed, and my next meal was
often to be found in some others home.&quot; I smile and shake my head.
&quot;Who all is going to be able to read this story?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, uhm, no one, this is for my own personal collection and such.&quot;
She seemed sincere and honest, but I failed to notice the quiet chuckle at the
end of her words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, time passed, I grew up and eventually discovered the path of the
druid. It seemed the perfect lifestyle, peace with my surroundings, contentment.
I could also slowly being to gain power and prestige and perhaps give my mother
the life style she deserves! So, by the time I was of the 5th rank, I could
afford a cheap apartment on the first tier. I began to curtail my, shall we call
them, habits. Well, when I achieved the 10th rank I had the pleasure of running
into a, of all things, princess! Well, I didn't know she was a princess. I mean
she was dressed in dazzling High Elf fashion, and she smelled of wonderful oils,
and she offered me something no other woman had done before.&quot;<br>
<br>
I laugh as I watch Elentari look from her page, her mind racing for something to
grasp onto. &quot;Uhm, I don't really want to know if it something too
weird.&quot; She said while laughing.<br>
<br>
Even I managed to blush with some of the thoughts racing through my mind, but I
reply, &quot;Her friendship! You should know that at the 10th rank that was when
I ran into Moonshadow. Now of course at the time I had thought that she was the
one I would marry, and we had our great times together. But when I realized she
was a princess, and the thought of being with a scoundrel like me! Well, I
pushed away. But, we kept of friendship, and she met the wonderful druid named
Oake. He had a much better reputation than I to be sure! Shortly their after she
introduced me to this intelligent, and charming Wood Elf ranger named
Elentari...&quot; She looks up from her page and I can see she is blushing a
little, but she buries her blush back on to the page.<br>
<br>
She reads aloud &quot;And... at....this... point...Lythander....tries....to....flatter....me....&quot;
And she looks up and gives me the no nonsense look, I smile and continue...<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, there isn't much more to say. After that I met up with some of the
other founders, Synge, Alintaur, Aeerial, and we became good friends. Then, on
that day at Lake Rathe, the God's them self granted our wish and dubbed us the
Companions of the Gate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...the Companions of the Gate period.&quot; She reads aloud as she
finishes her writing. &quot;Uhm, well, thank you for sharing that with me. Would
you mind if I share it... with the guild maybe?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course not, although... I don't think any of the companions will speak
to me again with out being wary! I mean I have changed my ways, but, in every
fashion I still maintain some of my, shall we call them, survival skills?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed! Well, uhm, I need to meet Moonshadow now to go over her story,
perhaps a ride to the West commons wouldn't be too much of a problem?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course not Ele, but I require a regent for the spell and I don't have
it on me.&quot; I fake a frown.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed, I need the kiss of an Elven Ranger to make the spell work!&quot; I
reply<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, in that case...&quot; She leans close to me, her cheek gently
brushing up against mine, and her lips gently touch my ear, and she begins to
speak... &quot;LET ME FIND KYMMA THEN!&quot; she screams, while laughing.<br>
<br>
I cover my ear for a moment, and sigh wistfully, and teleport us both away...<br>
