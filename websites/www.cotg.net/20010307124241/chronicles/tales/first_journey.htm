<br>
Hamalee finished putting his last spell in his spell book and sat up. Let's
see... there was so much to do now that he had finally reached his 14th Circle.
Now that he could cast the Spirit of Wolf spell, he was finally ready to travel
beyond the narrow walls of Rivervale in which he had confined himself. But he
wondered if he was quite ready yet...<br>
<br>
Probably not, he thought a little sheepishly. Now that he had a useful
Conjuration spell-the Stinging Swarm-he needed to practice its use; he had
neglected to do so when he was younger, opting instead to focus on the now
instead of the future, and thus had no skill in Conjuring. Luckily, there were
plenty of spells his masters had given him after his 14th that were useful for
practice-specifically Summon Food and Drink. Since Hamalee still had a large
collection of foraged food filling his backpack but had recently given away most
of his water to his young friend Fiendgers, he decided to conjure up some drink.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Fiendgers, Hamalee remembered seeing the Rogue head into the Fool's
Gold for training. Hamalee decided to go buff him a bit.<br>
<br>
He then went out to the Misty Thicket and went to the wall, then proceeded to
conjure up water. He had expected difficulties at this new skill, but he was
amazed how much his spells fizzled and refused to take effect. Hamalee, however,
was more stubborn and refused to let a simple spell get in the way of his
progress and continued until he eventually had a large collection of water. He
shouted out a declaration of free water to anyone at the gate, but there
appeared to be a lack of interest in it-or perhaps there was just an
overabundance of water in the Thicket already.<br>
<br>
While sitting down to meditate and recover his mana, Hamalee pondered upon his
future. As was suggested by elder Druids of the Companions, he was now preparing
to go to Lavastorm. For this purpose, he had bought the spell of Expulse
Summoned to use against the many Fire Elementals and Fire Imps that his cousin
Gerry had told him about. And now that he thought about it, he needed a bit more
preparation for the adventuring there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's see...&quot; he muttered to himself. &quot;Expulse Summoned,
check... Endure Fire, check... Levitate, check... non-Fire attack spell to use
against non-summoned beasties, no check. Ability to conjure, no check. Bat wings
to use Levitate, no check. Hmm...&quot;<br>
<br>
He brightened as he came upon an idea. When he had reached the 5th Circle he had
avoided the Whirling Wind spell because of reports that it was easily resisted
and not very effective at its mana cost. But the more he thought about it, he
considered it the perfect solution to all three 'no checks.' The reason he had
avoided it was the very reason his Conjuring ability was so low, of course, so
it made sense to make up for past mistakes.<br>
<br>
He hurried back to his guild to purchase the spell, and remembered while he was
there to get a bit of training from his masters in Conjuration. He then imbued a
visiting Dwarven Cleric with the Spirit of Wolf and received his first ever
donation for spell services. Finally he hurried back into the Thicket and used
his new spells on the many bats, collecting more wings to use with his Levitate
spell. Whirling Wind did not fizzle very often, did not cost much, and did a
fine job of honing his skills. By the time his mana supply was again depleted he
was not a master, but he was no longer making feeble attempts at Conjuring,
either.<br>
<br>
After he spent a bit of time attacking Mooto with his new spell and assisting
the younger Hobbits a bit, Hamalee finally felt he was ready to leave his home
of luxury. He stopped by and said farewell to his friends and fellow Storm
Reapers and stood at the entrance into the Kithicor Forest. Taking a deep breath
and refreshing his Wolf Spirit, he took his first big step into Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Actually, the run through the Kithicor Woods was mercifully uneventful; Hamalee
had heard stories of terrible undead beasts in the forest that scared even his
great cousin Ammonon, but he saw none of them and was in the plains known as the
Commons before long. After stopping to assist a few people with his new and most
cherished spell, he stood at the entrance to the Nektulos Forest.<br>
<br>
This was Dangerous Journey#2, for as everyone knows the Nektulos Forest is
patrolled by the Dark Elves, whose favorite activity was to kill and torture
young Hobbits. Eventually, Hamalee vowed, he teach these miserable guards a
lesson, but for now he just needed to get through without being spotted. He
placed a Camoflauge on himself and stepped into the woods... and immediately
began to feel himself appearing.<br>
<br>
Hamalee almost had a heart attack, but there were no guards around and he
quickly renewed his invisibility and headed north. Once again, all of his
worries were delightfully in vain; he only saw a single stone guardian on his
run and it failed to see through his spell. He silently thanked Karana for
guiding him and finally entered the strange area known as Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
Taking the advice given to him by his cousin Gerry, he immediately headed for
the entrance to lair of Najena. From there, Gerry had said, you can search for
beasts to test your blade on and run into safety when necessary. After all,
everyone knew that monsters that lived out of doors did so for a reason; they
absolutely hated the indoors. Just don't go too far into Najena, Gerry had
warned.<br>
<br>
Once again, Hamalee encountered no dangers in his run to the Najena entrance and
proceeded to prep himself for combat with creatures of Fire. His wonderful
Ignite spell was useless, so he instead readied his Whirling Wind for more
practice and memorized his Shield of Thistles so he could practice his favorite
tactic: porcupining.<br>
<br>
First, Hamalee tried his skills on a fire drake that wandered too close to him.
It's fiery breath was ineffective with Endure Fire protecting him, and the pain
of his Thistles and Wind was too much for it. The battle was pathetically easy.
Gaining confidence, Hamalee next tackled a nearby lava basilisk... and quickly
ran into the safety of Najena when the basilisk's stone stare proved too much
for him.<br>
<br>
Undaunted, Hamalee healed and refreshed himself and ventured out again, this
time picking a nearby Fire Imp as his target. His Expulse Summoned dropped the
monster so quickly Hamalee blinked in surprise.<br>
<br>
This was a good place, Hamalee decided, sitting down to meditate. He could live
here for a long time.<br>
<br>
He was finally down the road to greater adventure...<br>
