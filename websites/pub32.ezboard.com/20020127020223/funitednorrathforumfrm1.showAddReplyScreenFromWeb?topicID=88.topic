<br>
Here are some snippets from the people making the game...(long but covers info on a lot of topics)<br>
<br>
&quot;July 6, 2001 4:15pm<br>
Wanted: A Few Good Player Guilds<br>
<br>
What separates a ragtag band of fighters from an army? Their communication and structure. Dark Age of Camelot is proud to introduce an exciting new player guild system with unprecedented features to help you organize your friends and associates into an unstoppable force. Features include (but are not limited to) the following:<br>
<br>
- Customizable access levels. As a guild leader, you decide what powers your officers and members hold.<br>
<br>
- The player guild bank account. You can even set your guild dues amount, to be automatically deducted from your members’ private accounts. The resulting fund can be accessed by you and designated members.<br>
<br>
- Flexible hierarchy. Will your band be most effective under a dictatorship? Or would you prefer a democracy with guild elections? You decide.<br>
<br>
- Initiate status. Mark new members as initiates, and limit their access to privileges intended for full members.<br>
<br>
Whether your guild chooses to go it alone or join an alliance, in the long run an effective group will have proof of service to their country in the form of realm points and cash. As an individual, killing an enemy earns you realm points. These points get you rewards that serve to set you apart as a loyal defender of your homeland. Guilds will be able to pool their realm points and earn rewards to make their name respected and known throughout the countryside. We can’t go into details just yet, but the rewards being planned have never been seen before in massively multiplayer gaming.<br>
<br>
These things are just the beginning. But ambitious plans need testing, and so Dark Age of Camelot is looking for a few good clans to come in as a team and try it out. Click here for details on how your clan leader can apply.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;I remember reading that you'll be able to put your guild logo/colors in some way on your player character. Where will this show up? On shields, cloaks, etc?&quot; <br>
<br>
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;on uber-groups: It's actually possible to link up to 8 groups of 8 together into a battle group (also called an uber group). The leaders of all of the groups have communications abilities to all of the members of all of the groups on a new channel, while the individual members retain the ability to talk to their own group of course. This is new functionality that's going in along with the new player guild stuff. <br>
on log-in exploits during raids: We'll most likely be dealing with this issue the same way we did in DFC. We won't have the announcement, but you will not be allowed to take a relic after you log in until you've touched your home turf.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ves wrote: [ Why apply an additional bonus on top of this (this is what the philosophy seems to imply)? Why create an imbalance in the direction of grouping? ]<br>
Well, we haven't really applied a &quot;group bonus&quot;. What we've done is structure the XP curve in such a way that the kinds of fights that groups would tend to prefer (hunting above their level and/or hunting grouped NPC's) give larger proportional rewards. A 14th level mob doesn't change the experience it gives based on wether it was killed by a 15th level player or a 10-12th level group, but the share of that XP is bigger in proportion to the lower levels than the whole thing is to the 15th. <br>
<br>
By the same token, two &quot;linked&quot; 14th level mobs (linked mobs always engage together, barring &quot;crowd control&quot; spells you can't fight one without the other, and even then you mostly just put them &quot;on hold&quot; to fight later) is something no 15th level player running solo would touch, but two players working together could. Because linked mobs are an inherently tougher fight, each additional mob in the pack means an XP bonus for all the mobs. Again, if a 19th level (to whom they are green) kills them, he gets the same experience, but that XP is proportionately larger to the lower-leveled group, even after they share it. <br>
<br>
[ 1. Every MMORPG to date that I have played (UO, EQ, AC) have all driven home the fact that most gaming economies are plagued by uncontrollable inflation (after a year of play 10 gold in the economy is worth a lot less than 10 gold). ]<br>
<br>
That's my department. I think I can contain the inflation problem. Not prevent it entirely, but keep it under control. Cash will be easier to come by 1 year after release than it was at launch, but it won't change much in the *following* year. <br>
<br>
[ 2. Greater experience allows access to greater amounts of cash but not necessarily the other way around (or at least not to the same extent). ]<br>
<br>
In a saturated economy, no. But as long as the players are not easily able to afford the &quot;best&quot; gear, cash remains *very* important to XP earning. And Camelot's economy will hopefully never saturate (I define &quot;saturated&quot; as the stage where all established players have more cash and stuff than they really have any use for). <br>
<br>
[ 3. There are various ways to obtain Cash however as far as I know there is only one way to obtain experience. ]<br>
<br>
Actually, you can earn quite a lot (something like half) of your XP through quests and tasks. Of course, you can also get cash and equipment that way. <br>
<br>
[ 4. Cash can be transferred from player to player however experience can not (cash can be twinked) ]<br>
<br>
Well, to a certain extent it can be, it's called &quot;babysitting&quot;. Anyway, twinking (either form) is of only limited utility in Camelot. <br>
<br>
[ 5. Items will have less impact overall (as compared to other games??) as expressed by Sanya in the item loot thread: <br>
<br>
&quot;And it's all fairly irrelevant anyway, this game is not going to be as item-centric as past games have been.&quot; ]<br>
<br>
That's not *completely* accurate. I'd say it's more a case of &quot;Equipment is not character-defining.&quot; Equipment is very important in Camelot, if you're in blue to green equipment and upgrade something to yellow, you notice an immediate and significant improvement. <br>
<br>
But your character isn't defined by what he has, for the most part, &quot;Soso&quot;, &quot;Decent&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, and &quot;Excellent&quot; equipment are always available for your level, and in general you're better off with &quot;Decent&quot; equipment that's level appropriate than with &quot;Excellent&quot; equipment that is below it. And if you're using equipment of a much higher level, you'll wear it out quickly and gain no benefit over what &quot;level appropriate&quot; equipment would do. <br>
<br>
You don't just fit your newbie out with 50th level gear and then power your solo way into the 30's in days. That 50th level gear may not even be equipable, and you'll use it up much more quickly even if it is, *and* it won't have any more benefit than &quot;yellow&quot; equipment. <br>
<br>
The Cash/XP tradeoffs seem to be working well. Most players do not exclusively solo *or* group, neither one is considered mandatory. But as they progress, they do one or the other depending on which type of reward seems more desirable at that time. <br>
<br>
At one level, we don't want everyone to solo all the time because grouping is the community-forming engine, and communities are what these games are all about. On another level, we don't want everyone to *have* to group all of the time, because sometimes you just don't want to deal with it. You don't have time, or your friends aren't on, or you just don't feel sociable. We think the system we've got does well at supporting the widest possible range of playstyles when it comes to the Solo/Group question.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it's 3000 end products. That does count a Steel Longsword and an Alloy Longsword as two recipes, so they tend to come in sets of 8. What's done is the core trades, Weaponcraft, Armorcraft, and Tailoring (used for the non-metal armors). Fletching should be done this morning, there aren't as many recipes for it but each one needs more work. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I think people will be pretty happy with this, and when we start extending the system into the Magical crafts....&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;on allowing alt-tabbing to other applications while playing: I'm not ever again going to play any game that REQUIRES me via GAME MECHANICS to sit for more than ten minutes doing nothing. Now, sitting there for two hours waiting for my guild to stop running around like headless barnyard fowl, that's my own stupid fault =) <br>
<br>
So yeah, the main reason to alt-tab (boredom) will, the pantheon willing, not be a factor.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;on alt-tabbing while running the game: I wish we could have alt-tab. The number of times I've wanted to check a website or my email while playing... grrr, hiss. But from what I understand, the technical aspect of maintaining security with an alt-tab option is the main obstacle. And since Mythic is not a big company, we have to pick and choose where to put our resources. Instead of alt-tab, you're going to get three finished realms and a nice stable gameplay experience.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
&quot;on discouraging the camping of spawn points: Adding my own bump, and clarifying the &quot;anti-camping&quot; measures. <br>
<br>
The more time you sit on your tail and hunt the same ten square yeards, the less experience each mob will give you. Example: feral chickens give you ten experience points. If you set up a camp, eventually the chickens will give you nine, then eight, then seven experience points. And then the chickens will be all hunted out until you leave. If you go to an area that hasn't been hunted for awhile, the monsters will give you bonus exp the first few rounds. <br>
<br>
And if you ever see a monster run within fifty feet of your group, and do a stop-freeze-stare, you best kill him before he gets back to HIS group. Monsters like hunting as much as you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I've read Mu's articles. I don't agree with him, but his logic is sound enough, the reasons I don't agree with him fall into areas where we have no conclusive data yet. <br>
So far, the only MMOG that has had a system where items degrade and players can make things better than those that can be purchased from NPC's has been UO. Neither AC or EQ has degrading equipment, which doomed any hopes of economic balance or trades that were useful in any but the most limited circumstances. In UO, even *without* vendors, the system worked, within the constraints created by UO's other economic problems. <br>
<br>
We've discussed it at great length here, and we don't think vendors are either neccessary or desirable, but that they were a crutch intended to deal with a game environment where long range communication was difficult and travel was trivial. DAoC is the exact opposite on that front, communication is trivial and travel is difficult. <br>
<br>
The key issue is accessibility, connecting buyers with sellers. In UO, communications with someone you did not already have some out of context channel (IRC, ICQ, etc.) to was nearly impossible, if you couldn't pick each other out of the spam at the marketplaces, you couldn't do business. <br>
<br>
In that environment, Vendors were an obvious solution. But they came with their own drawbacks, not least of which was the loss of commercially generated social ties. <br>
<br>
Now, a vendorless environment with a heavy commerce emphasis has it's own potential problems, the biggest of which is the spam issue. But we think that the problem of connecting the buyers with the sellers without spam is solvable. <br>
<br>
In the end, an absolute case cannot be made either way. There are arguments to be made for both sides. This is one of those cases where we have to make a decision based on what we are trying to accomplish in the game. We want to encourage social interaction, and vendors interfere with reaching that goal, so we're going to find out if it can be done without them. <br>
<br>
There's nothing to stop us from putting in vendors if they turn out to be neccessary. But we won't know if they really are necessary unless we do it the other way, first.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Mahrin on players offering items for sale: Actually, this is pretty close to what we do plan. You'd flag an item in your inventory as being for sale, and people would be able to open a window and see what was for sale in their area. You might also be able to advertise services, such as swords to order, on the same system. <br>
Once you had found someone offering what you wanted, you could /send a greeting and open the bargaining.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; Brian on shields: This is a change we just recently put in. Evasion chance was already cut in half against ranged attacks, and we're now adding in a bonus for shield blocking. When you see those arrows coming down out of the sky, get behind someone with a big shield.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;on the quest system: Don't let the quest team hear you worrying about &quot;same old boring quests.&quot; They already have no fingernails or stomach lining left. <br>
<br>
The quest system is already one of the strongest elements DAOC has going for it. I can't wait to do a favor for some lost boy, and then six months later say hello to him and have him remember me, and repay the favor. <br>
<br>
Actually, mostly I'm looking forward to ditching my elaborate post it note system, currently used to keep track of keywords, quest items, etc. We've got a &quot;quest journal&quot; that automatically records for you EXACTLY what each quest mob said to you when you hailed it and accepted the quest. You access the journal via a button cleverly labeled &quot;Journal&quot; on your paper doll.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;[ Oh on a side note anyway you can give a official word that all stats will ACTUALY mean something? ]<br>
<br>
Yes. [ or are you guys gonna do a EQ on us? ]<br>
<br>
No. I guess that is two words. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;on communication between realms: I think I went over this in another thread, but there is no communication between realms. Not even emoting, as that comes across as &quot;Soandso makes weird gestures you don't understand&quot; or something like that. No, sorry, you're going to have to settle for marching band messages. You know, arrange your people so that the folks high in the keep tower look down and see &quot;yo momma&quot; spelled out with archers. <br>
Communication is one of the things that can stop a war between balanced opponents. That wouldn't be any fun, now, would it?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Mahrin on mage clothing options: There's no requirement to wear a robe, there is cloth torso armor that you can wear instead (that doesn't just leave you looking like a naked newbie, it has its own texture). Some people wear it, some don't. <br>
<br>
We plan on having multiple &quot;cloth&quot; skins, it just hasn't been a priority up to now (with Hibernia models almost done, we'll be able to start adding more skins for all the armors soon).&quot; <br>

BTW I saw something on Dr. Twister. One of the guys from the site is in the beta. Though NDA didn't allow for any details he did make a comment on stability and bugs. His biggest concern was...lack of hype for the game! He said he hasn't crashed once during beta and that they are quick to check and repair bugs when they are reported.
