   <p>Ok, I have a small update.&nbsp; I don't want to cram a ton of news on today's 
    news page, so tommorrow look for my encounter with a GM on the Abyss Shard 
    (with screenshots) and <strong>it's not a negative</strong> experience.</p>
   <p>Also look for a bug that allows you to gain 100 STR in 3 hours. If you get 
    caught using it, you could be banned for 12 hours (highly unlikely though)</p>
   <p><strong>Have a good night everyone, I'll see you tommorrow.</strong></p>

   <p>Good afternoon everyone.&nbsp; I don't have to much to say today, only that 
    the GM's on <strong>Test Center</strong> need to <strong>make a gate to Buccaneers 
    Den</strong>, so we can test the new thief system out.&nbsp; Now I know there 
    are gates on all the other servers, but someone must have forgotten about 
    Test Center.</p>
   <p>I got a big e-mail today about how to get all your rogue skills up quickly.&nbsp; 
    It will tell you all the secrets of a thief.&nbsp; Not all of it involves 
    running around like an idiot, there is quite a lot of strategy involved.&nbsp; 
    I have to say it's one of the hardest professions in UO to use.&nbsp; Maybe 
    even harder than being a PK or GM blacksmith (<strong>I'm sure opinions will 
    differ on that</strong>) It's a big, big e-mail, and it's located at the tips 
    section.</p>
   <p>I don't have a lot of bugs yet because I'm getting e-mails that are unreadable. 
    &nbsp; Please make sure your e-mails are readable, because I can't post your 
    bug if I don't know what you're talking about.&nbsp; <strong>Hopefully I'll 
    have more bugs for you tonight.</strong></p>
   <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><strong>Unconfirmed Bug(s):</strong></font></small>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Lockpicking Gain</strong>: This works like the magery and blacksmith 
     bugs that appeared a couple weeks ago and might be a little tough to pull 
     off.&nbsp; Make a macro that will first pick the locks on a couple chests, 
     then have it log you out, and then log you back in.&nbsp; This will help 
     those who are stuck at 90 skill.</li>

   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="1"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Ok 
     guys listen up, thievery is really really easy to build, you just have to 
     know how to do it.&nbsp; I built up a thief to 97. 3 skill in two nights.&nbsp; 
     First and foremost you need a partner, someone with patience, because you 
     have to be manually doing this.&nbsp; It takes maybe 6 - 8 hrs in total.&nbsp; 
     Thievery is all weight based.&nbsp; What I did with my partner, is take a 
     bag or a sack or whatever, and put an amount of weight in it, start off at 
     like 2 stones for new thieves, and when you get so you don't raise from stealing 
     that, raise the weight up a notch.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Here 
     is the full explanation.</font></strong></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Make 
     up several bags, as much weight as your skill will provide, also make a couple 
     bags, less by one stone, and more by one stone.&nbsp; Or you can also use 
     items that weigh as much as a made up bag would.&nbsp; Example is the bow, 
     instead of making an xxx amount of bag, just use the single item that weights 
     just as much.&nbsp; Then just start stealing the bags/items from each other.&nbsp; 
     That's all there is to it really.&nbsp; When you or your partner stop gaining 
     skill off of one weight class, up the ante, and add another stone.&nbsp; 
     The maximum you can steal in a bag is nine stones, it slows down a lot when 
     you reach 90, but it will continue to rise as long as you continue to steal 
     the maximum weight.&nbsp; For me, at around 95 it was horrible slow, like 
     thirty steals for .1 skill.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">I've 
     heard that you can use UOP or UOE for something like last targeting, so see 
     if you can set it up so you can keep stealing the last target off your partner, 
     but I have not done this, so I don't know if it will work, also, <strong>RANDOM 
     STEALING SUCKS!!!</strong>!, it does not raise skill very fast and it will 
     raise it only to a point, it cuts out at around 40 I think, it's really useless. 
     You MUST steal the item directly, meaning snoop the guy and click what you 
     want to steal. </font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Note: 
     <strong>BEING FULL IS A GOOD IDEA</strong>, I was full when I made my thief, 
     and it seemed to really speed things along, also I trained my thief in my 
     friends house, so we where not disturbed.&nbsp; The night before, just make 
     a fisherman, or find some food, plenty of it, and snack away while your build 
     up your char.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">And 
     as for snooping, you all know its real easy, just macro the damn thing, do 
     it with your partner for a night, (a night is all you need, since there is 
     no waiting in-between snoops), and your come out at like 95 - 100, easy.&nbsp; 
     Or an alternative method is hire an NPC, give him enough gold for a couple 
     days, and take him to some remote location, trap him in with boxes, he will 
     eventually move them, but it gives you some extra time, if your cash runs 
     out, and snoop the NPC in a macro, it works really well.&nbsp; Same thing, 
     do that for a night, and you are finished with snooping.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">After 
     that, you also have max DEX.&nbsp; Then build up some STR, gain skill in 
     the weapon of your choice, and you now have a tank thief.&nbsp; Or if you 
     like stat playing, (which I can't stand), make him into a mage/thief.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Start 
     your thief with some fencing skill, <strong>DON'T EVER DOUBT THE POWER OF 
     THAT PRACTICE SPEAR, OR KNIFE</strong>, I personally have killed, TONS, of 
     &quot;I hate thieves&quot;, warriors, and mages, when I was wearing no armor, 
     and at around 70 skill in fencing, They would be in bone, and I could take 
     them, it was almost unbelievable, but it kicked ass, bad thing is, it eventually 
     wears out, and when I tried to get it repaired, it was not the same, but 
     it lasts about a month, and you never lose it when you die.&nbsp; One thing 
     I've notices about UO is it all comes down to skill in a weapon, armor does 
     not seem to effect that much with swordplay.&nbsp; Sometimes you got lucky, 
     and you could take a plated warrior.&nbsp; And this is still at 70 skill. 
     </font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">One 
     thing I hated where archers, if you got lucky, you could steal there arrows/bolts, 
     and then they're useless, an easy target, but they move around so damn much, 
     and of course damn OSI made it so you could not steal when in combat, it 
     gets pretty hard to steal their ammo, so first thing you do, is see who the 
     archer is, and take his stuff.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">A 
     good thing to use is UOE, it has the &quot;bags and boxes wont automatically 
     close&quot;, function, which works really well, run past the guy, while using 
     last skill, and you can open his bag, look at what he has, from really far 
     away, decide what you want, and then run up and take it, no body expects 
     this, hey you where just running by weren't you?.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">One 
     thing I noticed is, people can be pretty stupid, they stand right beside 
     you, when they are trying to track you down.&nbsp; (you are hidden in this 
     situation)&nbsp; Leaving you free to snoop and steal at will.&nbsp; Minoc 
     mines, is always a promising place, and eventually, you get the one idiot, 
     that will attack you, in full plate, loaded up, and will be just a little 
     to close for the guards to come, and WAM, he dies, and its free loot for 
     you.&nbsp; Anger is a wild weapon.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">Lastly 
     I recommend building up hiding, it has saved me many times, and its a good 
     tool all around, a thief without hiding is a dead thief.&nbsp; And in the 
     future, OSI plans on making it so that you can take a couple of steps when 
     you are hidden, and you don't unhide!!, think of the possibilities of this 
     one for thieves.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2">P.S, 
     snooping will not reveal you when hidden, stealing will, just a small note 
     for those new thieves out there.</font></p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Sincerly
