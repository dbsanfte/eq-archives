<hr>
<p>A friend of mine was walking along a very hilly area when he noticed a house 
 (a 2 story house w/ a foundation) that he could walk under completly... well 
 he called me and I came to have a look. We figured that there had to be a way 
 into that house ( and we really wanted in cuz there was a LOT of loot ) we trying 
 clicking on the door from the inside (but we couldnt see the door so it was hard) 
 and it did not work.... then we tried various resurection ways (which didnt work) 
 and then logging out ontop of each other then logging back in (which also didnt 
 work :) so i finnally started stacking tables underneath the house cuz i was 
 bored after it reached as high as it looked like it could go i just pulled out 
 one of the tables.... boom down came a chest that had been on the floor ( YEA 
 BABY! ) it was full with lots of junk! I continued to do this underneath many 
 areas of the house and found that it only worked half of the time and only brought 
 down what was on the first level (which was a lot of shit) if you need a picture 
 of this just write me back and i'll send a couple of me using the bug... </p>
