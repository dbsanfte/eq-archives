   <p><a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="_blank">DELAYED UPDATE OF SPLOITZ.COM</a></p>
   <p>Skunk Works: Was updated with a resource of how to get (3) free domain names. 
    As well as a awesome daily bug. Followed by one of the users favorite retro 
    bugs that still is working great for party tricks! <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">So 
    go ahead and check it out.</a></p>
   <p>As we usher into the new year these are my plans for Skunk Works... Divide 
    it into (2) levels of access. The first level of access, will be basicly everything 
    Skunk Works is now. The second level will focus a lot more on easy to use 
    GUI (graphic user interface) hacks and cheat programs for games more than 
    UO. The reason to this being that Skunk Works is a incentive to keep people 
    interested and submiting information, because they get something out of it, 
    besides the recognition they can't even be given because of fear of OSI's 
    opression. I'm not doing this to be mean everyone will have the same access 
    they still have, just if you do more you get more. You should be rewarded 
    for what you do, right? Anyhow I'd like your <a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com">feedback</a>, 
    if you don't like it, we can do away with my plan and try your guy's plans.

   <p>Hey everyone, this is <strong>Lomo</strong>.&nbsp; Sorry for the late post, 
    I had some trouble with the email server earlier today.&nbsp; Well people 
    are still talking about and worried about UOReport0.log.&nbsp; This is some 
    information sent in by our users...</p>
   <ul>
    <li><small><strong>DesignerD&gt;</strong> &quot;If you see it someplace else, 
     it means your current working directory is changing because of how you're 
     running UO. &quot;</small><br>
     <em><br>
     </em><small><strong>Anonymous User&gt;</strong><em> &quot;Well what I noticed 
     is that it pops in UOE directory so i guess that means because UOE runs it 
     but I use UO assist WAY more than UOE but that UO report isn't in my UO assist 
     directory on my computer? is something odd about that?&quot;</em></small></li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><small><strong>Anonymous User&gt;</strong><em> I do not use any form of 
     3rd party program, but when boot up of UO through the start menu, the file 
     UOReport0.log was created in my Ultima Online directory. Which OSI claims 
     is to report or record Client Crashes, so I decided to test what information 
     it is logging.<br>
     <br>
     I deleted the file which in my case is always 0 megs big. I loaded up Ultima 
     Online through the Start menu like normal, then I checked the file size 0 
     megs still but the file was created, now I know a way to crash the client.exe 
     100%. Recall and drag an item out of the Bank box after you click the rune. 
     I immediately checked the size of the file still 0 megs. Hmm I thought, I 
     then tried this same procedure 5 more times , the file never grew in size 
     but was always modified during the boot procedure of Ultima Online. So I 
     would like to know what this file is actually logging if it does not log 
     when my client crashes like OSI claims!! OSI explain that?!! If someone that 
     uses UOE would like to try this same test procedure and compare the file 
     size to what mine was in the same case , it might be interesting. But then 
     again it may have the same results.</em></small></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Strange eh? Well I will let you guys know as soon as we receive more information 
    concerning this topic.&nbsp; Now for the bugs and tips, check em out.&nbsp; 
   </p>
   <p><strong>Today's Bug(s):</strong>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Unlimited Secure Containers:</strong> Take a chest, armoir, crate, 
     or any other lockable storage container. Lock it down within your house. 
     Then use magic lock on it. People cannot open it because it is locked. People 
     cannot lockpick it because it is magically locked. And people cannot magically 
     unlock it because it is locked down. This makes the container as good as 
     &quot;locked down and secure.&quot;</li>
    <li><strong>Perma Head:</strong> Cast the spell incognito once your change 
     names kill yourself or have a friend kill yourself (near a shrine or healer 
     because you need to rez before your body decays) once you are dead have a 
     friend rez you or a healer and go up to ur body and cut the corpse....grab 
     the head....instead of the head decaying after 10 min or so...the head never 
     decays...the head is &quot;a head of whoever u died as under incognito&quot; 
     take the head to your house and lock it down as a perma head.</li>
    <li><strong>Update to Blacksmithy Bug</strong>: It says you can just log out, 
     then back in to reset the blacksmtihing clock.. but actually, you need to 
     wait for the character to time out.. or log in as another character (at the 
     inn, or in your house), then log back in as your blacksmith.<br>
     Also this has been reported to possibly work on some other skills, try it 
     out and let us know.</li>

   <p><strong>Tip(s):</strong>
   <ol>
    <li>When paralyzed use a chest that u cast magic trap on earlier.The ensuing 
     explosion negates the effects of the paralyze spell, and u *should* resist 
     it and take no damage.</li>
    <li>Being able to see into someone's house..... Stack some items 12 high, 
     or whatever the limit is, step under it, whabam you can see inside their 
     house as if you where a neighbor.</li>
