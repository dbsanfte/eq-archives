   <p>Thank you all for your movie reviews. I got around to seeing Thin Red Line 
    tonight and this is what I found out. Very good movie, extremely confusing 
    I talked to a student who had been studying what this movie portrays at a 
    local college, he agreed the movie is even very confusing for him. Overall 
    it was a good movie, got a lot of my thoughts going, it didn't keep the truth 
    from you (what a real war movie should do) but, alas it was 3hours!</p>
   <p>If any of you have ever seen the show &quot;<b>Talk Soup</b>&quot; you know 
    very well its a darn funny show! Well I was watching it today, and oh my it 
    was funny. Make sure you check out tomorrows rerun of today at 2:00PM (pst)on 
    E! and check the new show for tomorrow at 6:00PM! You won't regret it.</p>

    Minoc, we are still interested so <a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com">send 
    us</a> the directions and a screenshot or two!</p>
   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, 
    just because he worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware 
    store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what everybody else 
    did, which was go up to the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out 
    every day. It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered 
    out. Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided 
    to collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he 
    broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.</p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li>This bug allows the OWNER of a house to enter it at any time without having 
     to carry a key on their person and risk dying and the possibility of someone 
     else looting their house.  This is also useful if you lose the keys to your 
     house and want to get inside it. First, double click on the brass sign outside 
     the house.  Next, declare the house to be a public building (make sure no 
     one is around that might run inside your house).  Now enter your house immediately 
     and close the door. Finally, quickly double click the brass sign outside 
     your house again and declare the building to be private.  You are now in 
     possession of one key, while the other is in the bank, and for safety's sake, 
     you might want to put the key that is in your backpack somewhere inside your 
     house or in your bank where it can't be stolen, it really doesn't matter 
     as when you declare your building to be public next time you want to get 
     inside the keys will disappear. If this is done correctly, you can enter 
     your house with the same speed as if you had a key on you...</li>
    <li>NOT much updates tonight because, you should <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">submit</a> 
     your bugs to the <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">TEST TEAM</a>! We want
