   <p>Ok, more meditation bugs, and again for some strange reason...they are all 
    the same. &nbsp; I'm guessing that they work because 3 people sent in the 
    same bug (almost word-for-word).&nbsp; Since some many people sent in the 
    bug, the Skunk Works accounts will be awarded to the first person(s) that 
    sent in the bugs. <u>You'll know if you get the account very soon.</u></p>
   <p>Check out the bottom, because there are all the other bugs I posted today. 
    &nbsp; Lastly, please note that if you are viewing this page from Xsploitz.com, 
    it may not be updated. <a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="new_page">Check

   <ul>
    <li><strong>New Meditation Tip</strong>:&nbsp; You can wear bone arms and 
     bone legs with thigh boots, and it will not affect your ability to meditate.&nbsp; 
     Once you put on gloves or anything else though. It says that it cannot penetrate 
     your armor.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>New Meditation Bug</strong>: Get yourself a magic trap scroll 
     and a pouch. place the pouch on the floor and use your scroll on it, for 
     some reason the scroll will remain intact!!!! Now, use your meditate skill 
     and gain like crazy without using ONE reagent! btw, as you gain skill in 
     meditate, you will need to start with lower mana , so cast the scroll on 
     the pouch repeatedly to lose more mana and then meditate!<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tip</strong>: <font color="#000000" size="3">First off, try to 
     get a gate to Bucaneers Den or recall there. Go to the BlackSmith and Carpenter 
     shops. Start beating on those NPCs! They might be tough at first but you 
     will get the hang of it. After you kill a blacksmith take his helmet and 
     sell it to one that spawns. After an NPC dies another one respawns pretty 
     quickly. <br>
     </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Tip</strong>: </font>You can use 
     the anatomy skill on a ghost, so if your freind is a pk and needs to macro 
     off some murders have him do it in your house so you can macro anatomy on 
     him.&nbsp; Strange that ghosts would have anatomy. It might also work for 
     evaluating intelligence.<br>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
   <p>Well yesterday turned out to quite funny.&nbsp; First of all, I recieved 
    word that detect hidden on traps has been disabled and the new patch brings 
    new bugs.&nbsp; If you didn't know, there was a detect hidden bug post two 
    days ago.&nbsp; Could they be connected?&nbsp; My mail box is filled with 
    meditation bugs and strangly enough many of them are the same bug. Hmm, were 
    you people copying bugs from <a

    href="http://www.drtwister.com" target="new_page">Dr. Twister's</a> site? 
    Well I'll let it go this one time because everyone should take advantange 
    of the bug while they still can. &nbsp; Otherwise, please do not simply copy 
    and past Dr. Twister's bugs and send them here, you will not receive a Skunk 
    Works account for it. </p>
   <p>First, for a good laugh, check out what <a href="Dyedunderwear.jpg" target="_self">this 
    person</a> accomplished yesterday with the new patch. Now the picture is called 
    Dyed Underwear, so I'm guessing that you can get naked by dying your underwear.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I recieved word of a person who killed 20-30 people last night but 
    did not become murderer. Could that be true?&nbsp; Please try it out, and 
    contact <a

   <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Take a Magic Wizards Hat ( the one that gives 
     you +5 Int ). &nbsp; Equip the Magic Wizards Hat, use Meditation Skill, Unequip 
     Magic Wizards Hat, Since the hat adds +5 to your int, the meditation skill 
     will be available for use. We all know that meditation can not be used when 
     you have full mana.&nbsp; This is a great way to macro Meditation without 
     regeants lose.</li>
    <li><strong>Meditation #2 (Posted as received)</strong>: First off you dont 
     really gain any skill if you do it when your mana's full so you have to have 
     regs to waste mana (and gain magery) if you dont have regs try and find a 
     magic item of mana drain to use on yourself. (Tip: it seems that the lower 
     your mana the lower your chance of meditating, thus lower mana = more skill 
     gain) Now heres the bug: if you succeed at meditating you gain skill but 
     you also start filling up on mana faster, thats a pain, because you would 
     need to cast more often to keep your mana low, so simply wear some bone armor 
     and when you succeed, you still gain well but your mana regeneration doesnt 
     double(you get a message saying teh regenerative forces cannot penetrate 
     your armor).<br>
    </li>
   </ul>
