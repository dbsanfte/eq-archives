<strong>This bug has been confirmed</strong> [<font color="Red">1c 0u</font>]
<blockquote>Go up to someone and use the "backstab" skill. When it says "You have struck whomever for 20 points of damage," or whatever the total may be, quickly click "steal", and then backstab again. It will say "You can't do that," but in fact you have stolen three items from their pack.
