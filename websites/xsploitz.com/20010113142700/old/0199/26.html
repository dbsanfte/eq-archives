"You don't have to tell     me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "<þ@Well," said Coach, "you never     were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out<þ@ of rags     and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice     and th<þ@en either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you     try to tackle people at i<þ@nappropriate times." It was all true what he was     saying. And yet, I thought something is brewin<þ@g inside the head of this Coach.     He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can m<þ@old. But that's     when I felt the handcuffs go on. þ/pÿ   þpÿþbÿTonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):þ<þ@/bÿ þ/pÿ   þolÿ    þliÿCast Metor Swarm on a Door. The door will not die (duh), and you'll gain  <þ@    MAD Magery!! It's that simple!!þ/liÿ    þliÿSimply punch a dummy that is in your home, and get <þ@it swaying, then while      it is  swaying, attempt to move it and place it a few spaces away. Sinc<þ@e      you cannot move a house add-on after is has been placed you will recieve      a message sta<þ@ting that the item could not be moved ,however, the dummy will      keep on swinging!  This obvious<þ@ly isn't a useful bug, but it is very neat      to see the dummies constantly swaying steadily alon<þ@g. Hope you like it!!     þ/liÿ    þliÿFind a house where player is macroing....cast earthquake ki<þ@lling the player....then      use telekenesis on their keys...they will appear in your pack....and <þ@you      can loot all you want....þ/liÿ    þliÿFeel like killing NPC's without getting a murder?  <þ@Just attack them,lead      them back to your house and you can let them in and due to Origin's new <þ@patch      they will be flagged under 'Texas Law' and you can kill them at will with      no reper<þ@cussions.

Boom dead 'thief'.  Loot<þ@ away and repeat.þ/liÿ    þliÿþiÿHear is a fairly useful oneþ/iÿ: I've discovered a bug that allows<þ@      you hear ANYTHING anyone says the only requirement is that the person you're      eavesdropp<þ@ing on only needs to be within approximately one screen width of      you in any direction.  This p<þ@erson can be outside, in his own house, in someone      else's house, or even a ghost and you can s<þ@till hear him.  All you have to      do is place a charged communications crystal in a (preferably <þ@secured) container      within your house.  Link another comm crystal to the one you just placed  <þ@    by dbl-clicking your house crystal and targeting a crystal in your pack.       Also, dbl-click <þ@the crystal in your pack and target the crystal in your house.       The two crystals are now "doub<þ@ly-linked".  Activate the crystal in the house      by dbl-clicking it and targeting itself with th<þ@e targeting cursor.  The crystal      in your house should turn red.  Now, place the crystal you ha<þ@ve in your pack      in the bank.  That's it, all there is to it.  Now, anyone who speaks in the  <þ@    vicinity of your house will produce a message on the bottom of your screen.       We recently h<þ@eard a pair of Antis living next to us, discussing their next      hunting location.  When discover<þ@ed, we swiftly intercepted them and had a      ball!

   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">SkunkWorks</a> 
    was updated with a daily bug regarding.how to teleport while in combat! <i>Also 
    a new version of SecondUO is on its way ASAP!</i></p>
   <p>Hi, sorry for no update this morning.&nbsp; Expect a late update every Tuesday. 
   </p>
    <p>If you haven't already tried the Abyss Test shard, do it.&nbsp; It is loads of fun!
    &nbsp; Could a chaos shard be OSI's answer to EverQuest?&nbsp; I hope so!&nbsp; If you
    want to have a little bit of fun (other than pkilling) go through the snooping and
    stealing gate and begin your crime spree.&nbsp; There's still a lot of work to be done on
    the shard though, which I'm sure it will be fixed if it becomes a permanent shard.
    &nbsp; Personally, I would like to see the GM gates removed and instead you pay a large
    amount of gold to train to GM in a skill. </p>
    <p>There's a couple bugs for you today, nothing spectacular.</p>
    <p>Check out all the <a href="recent.htm" target="_self">recent bugs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong><ul>
      <li><strong>Tailoring Bug</strong>: Right after you make any clothing with cloth and hear
        the cutting sound press last object (which is your sewing kit) and for some reason it
        makes a fancy shirt along with what you made. It still uses cloth but it saves time if you
        are making some cash.</li>
      <li><strong>Vendor Kill (Old):</strong> Do all names, run away from the screen until no one
        is at the screen and then attack the name of the vendor.</li>
      <li><strong>Polymorph Nonsense:</strong> Get drunk.&nbsp; When you see the animation for
        throwingup, cast polymorph and click on chicken.&nbsp; Next time you start to throw up,
        you will get a interesting surprise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's about it. =(</p>
