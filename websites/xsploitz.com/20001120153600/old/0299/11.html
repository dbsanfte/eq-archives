   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    Was updated tonight with <b>(2)</b> daily bugs. The first is a new client 
    crash bug. The second is a instand lich lord kill. Knock yourselves out with 
    these new bugs. I'm curious to hear your<a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com"> 
    EQ bugs</a>, thats what has occupied me the past few days. However my personal 
    expierence with the game is that, it is unappealing and frankly really slow 
    paced. Its more for the patient role player which I am certainly not!</p>

   <p>Ok, here is the bug you have been waiting for.</p>
   <p>This is a boat break-in, and also can be used for secure storage.&nbsp; 
    If for some reason you've seen this bug before, remember, for every one of 
    you that knows the bug, there's 50 others who don't.</p>
   <p>Get on a boat with a friend, and move to a spot where people usually park 
    their boats. &nbsp; Cast gate on a rune that leads to land (right on the shore/cliff 
    is best), and then walk through the gate.&nbsp; Once you walk through the 
    gate, have you friend move the boat so that the gate is now over the water.&nbsp; 
    Once you see that the gate is over water, quickly walk back into it.&nbsp; 
    The gate will disappear, and you'll be standing in the middle of the ocean. 
    Mark a rune.</p>
   <p>Now you can recall to that spot whenever you want.&nbsp; The best part is, 
    that if someone puts their boat in the spot where you marked the rune, you 
    will be onboard the boat!&nbsp; You can also use this as a safety recall (using 
    UOE) and you do not need keys.<font face="Arial"><br>
    </font></p>
   <p><strong><u><small>7:30 AM EST - Spub</small></u></strong></p>
   <p>Good morning everyone.&nbsp; This will be my final post..... until Thursday 
    evening :) &nbsp; For those who care, I'm taking mid-term exams right now.&nbsp; 
    So, Loric will be handling the updates.</p>
   <p>We are constantly expanding this web site.&nbsp; To further improve Sploitz.com's 
    quality of bugs, we are now coming onto all shards for demonstrations of your 
    bug. &nbsp; If you would like to schedule a demonstration with a Sploitz member, 
    contact<small> <a href="mailto:Spub@xsploitz.com">Spub@xsploitz.com</a> or 
    <a href="mailto:Loric@Xsploitz.com">Loric@Xsploitz.com</a>.</small></p>
   <p>A lot of people sent in some new town kills, and they are great! So here's 
    a one for the road:
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Town Kill #1:</strong> Use/get/make a GM fencer with deadly poisoned 
     weapon and a bard friend with high&nbsp; peacemaking (the bard that was with 
     me had 98 music and 95 peacemaking).<br>
     It is rather simple, I would attack person in town, hoping that I would poison 
     him with weapon.&nbsp; Then Bard friend would peace make, stopping the guards 
     in mid swing. &nbsp; This would also cancel auto fight so I would have to 
     strike victim again with bard peace making.&nbsp; After a while we became 
     very efficient with this method. &nbsp; Additionally I could steal from the 
     guards as they were grey to me.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I was very surprised at the amount of responses for the Question of the 
    Week.&nbsp; All of the letters recieved were well thought-out and easy to 
    read.&nbsp; Keep them coming in.</p>
   <p>Well, I'm off to school, looking forward to at 13.5 hour day.&nbsp; See 
    you all Thursday.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>The question of the week is now over, and the results are in.&nbsp; Take 
    a look at the responses I felt, were the best. <a href="reponses.htm" target="_self">EQ
