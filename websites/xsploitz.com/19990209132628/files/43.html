<hr>
<p><i>This bug, is supposed to create so much lag that when you login all you 
 get is a black screen until its gone which is anywhere from minutes to hours 
 to days!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp; Using <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/files/uop.zip">UOP:SE V1</a><i> 
 (Now Public, this is not yesterdays release) </i>use your poisoning skill on 
 a weapon of choice then type %last it should create MASS amounts of empty bottles. 
 Approximatly 400, I'm not quite sure if you have to do it more than once, however 
 once you get enough you'll get connection lost and when you try to login it'll 
 be a black screen. Anyone who comes in contact with this will also get this, 
 including to the best of my knowledge (GM's,Counselor's,Seer's). The lag usually 
 clears up within 24hours for most people so no permanant damage done. The real 
 possiblity of this baby is timewarps, if they work dupe away!</p>
<p>User's Say:</p>
<p> <font size="2">This no longer works but may help -  I was able to create black 
 holes with the poisoning bug.  I found that if I used the bug 10 times,  I could 
 create about 7 seconds of lag,  and if I used the bug 17-20 times,  it would 
 create a black hole.  Now I experimented some and this is how it worked.  If 
 you were on the screen with the thousands of bottles while they were being placed 
 there,  you are unaffected for the most part from lag or the black hole effect.  
 However,  once the thousands of objects appear on your screen,  you will lag, 
 lose connect, and cannot enter again for around an hour,  but anyone who was 
 already there can still kill you and loot you as long as they do not let the 
 items disppear from screen (the bottles in this case).  It took an hour because 
 that is how long it took for the bottles to decay on the ground outside.  If 
 you did it in a house,  nobody can log in withing at least a screens view of 
 the items.    Example:  In the brit graveyard,  if you walk in through the front 
 gates (closest to town), I placed a pile of bottles behind the first gravestone 
 on the right (it's about 16 steps from the gate and looks like a guildstone).  
 When the bottles were there,  as soon as someone stepped past the graveyard gates, 
 they would crash and I was free to kill them and loot them as long as I did not 
 cross that imaginary line where they crashed.  If I did, when I returned to where 
 the bottles were,  I would crash myself.  what I think happens:  I think when 
 you place the items there yourself, you're loading them much more slowly into 
 memory.  When someone all of a sudden has to load 5,000 seperate items (bottles) 
 into memory,  it makes their computer very unhappy and the connection will time 
 out.  I'm not sure if this is because of poor coding or not though.  </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>A BIG NOTE </b>with UOP) Recently OSI bans people for stealing 
 using UOP so don't do it all it takes is one call to a GM and your account is 
 gone. Be careful with this bug its definatly banable I don't know how they could 
 trace it however, its definatly banable.</font></p>
