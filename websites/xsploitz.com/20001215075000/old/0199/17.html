   <p>First off I'd like to thank everyone who has applied for the open position(s)<b></b>! 
    You can apply until 1/19/99 <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/app.html">here</a> 
    sooner the better! Our new CGI should be ready sometime in the upcoming week. 
    Also I'd like to give a big kudos to MTV's biorythm on Dr. Martain Luther 
    King Jr. a very excellent program kept my attention all 30minutes, a great 
    escape from the normal MTV crap.</p>
   <p>Thank you all for your movie reviews. Pretty much Varsity Blues got all 
    thumbs up, and Thin Red Line was a complete disapointment when compared to 
    Saving Private Ryan. In other movie news, Saving Private Ryan is to be rereleased! 
    Thats right, before the academy awards it will be back in the big screen! 
    If you haven't seen this movie yet, definatly do NOT miss this upcoming opportunity.</p>
   <p>We're losing people like flys. The intrest in bugs is losing lots of people 
    every day! So we need your help in ideas on how to out-reach more people. 
    <a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com">Mail </a>us your ideas!</p>
   <p><b>PLEASE:</b> We still are in search of the unlimited *mining* spot in 
    Minoc, we have several leads all posted in <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk 
    Works</a>! Keep on <a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com">sending us</a> the 
    info! <i></i></p>
   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... The next time I have meat and 
    mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate 
    with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get 
    more meat, I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of 
    meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, 
    huh? </p>
   <p>Well we had a treat, because someone reviewed <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/old/0199/16.html">yesterdays</a> 
    update for us! Enjoy: </p>
   <p>Meteor Swarm is an area effect, like Chain Lightning.  You can target just 
    about anything and targetting a door doesn't give you any additional increase 
    over casting at any other target. </p>
   <p>You're number 3 with earthquake and telekinesis.  I think something is missing 
    here.  You shouldn't be able to open the backpack of the person you killed 
    inside the house from outside the house.  Even if you could, you shouldn't 
    be able to use the keys simply by casting telekin on them (nor should they 
    appear in your backpack).  It is possible that if you could open their backpack, 
    you might be able to use the ghost feature of UOP to make a usable copy of 
    the keys in your backpack, but since I really don't use UOP I can't comment 
    on this, and it still sounds like something is missing. </p>
   <p>Number 4 killing NPCs in your house.  You will lose karma for killing them, 
    even if they're gray.  I've done this.  Killing NPCs will NEVER apply against 
    your murder count.</p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li>There is still an old trick that is in use (i use it anyway), where you 
     can meteor swarm a door and hit people outside because meteor swarm hits 
     multiple targets. I'm not sure if it works when casting from the INSIDE of 
     the house, but if you does, someone could easily stand there and just keep 
     dying and just rack up your murder counts. But I do know that the method 
     of meteor swarming a door from the OUTSIDE does effect the people inside 
     the house within the range. It's really fun too, i wish i could see the faces 
     of the people after they die in the "safety" of their own home.</li>
    <li>This is an addition to the christmas tree rechargeds crystals bug.  IF 
     you take down a tree and then put it back up the tree is refreshed with new 
     gems </li>
    <li>Not much use for this one... First go to an anvil with ingots and a hammer 
     in your bag. double click the hammer, and when the menu comes up you can 
     walk away from the anvil and make the item anywhere you want!</li>
    <li>Unlimited Space!!!-    If you have a lot of plate that you want to stack 
     but have no height for all of it then here is what you can do to solve it.  
     (this also pertains to anything else you want to stack.)  Get all your plate 
     legs in a chest where you want to stack the plate.  all you have to do is 
     throw it in the chest no organization needed.  Then Equip an axe and chop 
     the chest.  Waa Laa!  all the plate is stacked on the ground and you can 
     also walk over it!! Plus it takes no heaigt whatsoever!! No more stacking 
     all that plate on yer proch! </li>
