   <p>Please keep <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/submit.html" target="_blank">sending</a> 
    in those bugs! Not much news tonight. Except I'm not sure if you heard about 
    the Chinese Hackers. Anyways these &quot;hackers&quot; from China hacked a 
    chinese bank and stole 30k and now they are being sentaced to <b>DEATH</b>. 
    Read about it on <a href="http://www.rootshell.com">rootshell.com</a> ! Other 
    than that, I am shot on news. So if you have a event or something let me know.</p>
   <p>Update: <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/old/0199/13.html" target="">Yesterdays</a> 
    &quot;forge&quot; placing bug on ships is confirmed! It does work. Just simply 
    place the forge, then when the cursor is up click the deed and it will appear 
    where you are standing. Just remember it can be destroyed by other players. 
    And you cannot place it over your hold!</p>
   <p><i>Application to help Xsploitz.com update</i> will be up before or on <i><b>Friday</b></i>!</p>
   <p>Anyone know about a &quot;unlimited&quot; ore mining spot in minoc? If so 
    <a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com">mail us</a> a screenshot and directions 
    please!</p>
   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... I bet when the neanderthal kids 
    would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, "Don't forget the 
    thick, heavy brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered 
    they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.</p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Make a bard, get some high peacemaking, now, go into town, attack someone 
     (with noto query on) and make like a one button last skill or peacemaking 
     macro. Right as your about to click the okay button, press your peace macro 
     RIGHT after u press it, almost at the same time, but not quite, because if 
     u cast it to early, the guards wont ahve gotten there, so you'll be too quick. 
     Not exactly a bug, but more of an exploit. Now if you did this correctly, 
     right when the guards appeared (And you SUCCESSFULLY: Played your hypnotic 
     music and stopped the fight) the guards would have appeared and stopped right 
     in place. Now since they attacked you, they are grey, so you can steal that 
     gold, arrows, potion, gem or magic item, right off of them, in town. Now 
     if OSI ever gets around to putting in the Magery Does Damage In Town patch, 
     then you can cast this spell, hit someone , then peacemake and stop the guards, 
     and eventually kill someone, but for now, all you can do is freak people 
     out and steal from the guards, but hey, thats free cash.  Note: You are grey 
     since you DID attack a blue. Note: If you fail, you will die by guards. This 
     all depends on your musicianmanship and peacemaking.  So next time ya see 
     El Provikito on Sonoma at the east bank of brit, be careful, cuz he just 
     might have to taunt YOU!</li>
    <li>Using UOP's show deeds I have found that some people will leave unsecured 
     chest and other items on the second floor of their public house.  They will 
     block the entry to the second floor with lockdowns but neglect the upper 
     story itmes completely.  Use UOP's pickup thing if you are standing under 
     other objects and lose sight of the target item when you are directly below 
     it.  You have to be standing directly below an item to steal it through the 
     ceiling.  I made 3k in one house just today!</li>
    <li>With the new eject and ban commands added to the house system there is 
     a bug envolving you being a ghost. If you are killed in your house somehow 
     or loose your keys to a pk, you can simply go to the house as a ghost and 
     ban them WHILE as a ghost. Just do the same command "I ban thee" and it will 
     ban them even though you are a ghost.</li>
    <li>OK for people that have barrels locked down in there houses for display 
     or to stop you from getting somewhere. All you need to do is carry a empty 
     pitcher and a pither of water. If the barrel is empty just fill it and drain 
     the water back out of it and the barrel is no longer locked down. Or just 
     empty the barrel that is filled and take it.</li>
    <li><b>Rumor:</b>I have done this once but I am not sure how to do it really.   
     When you see a wisp, go up to it and spirit speak.  Now you  can talk to 
     the wisp and understand it.  Again, im not sure exactly what i did but it 
     was something like that. then it led me to a magic  longsword. (users unconfirmed 
     information) </li>
    <li>Tired of the NPC cartographer being out of maps. Well not anymore. Once 
     you buy all the blank maps a cartographer has then buy all the other maps 
     also. After that sell back all the maps you bought except the blank ones. 
     Then buy from the Vendor again. All the maps you just sold will now be blank 
     maps. Presto, instant blank map maker. All the blank maps you need to Macro 
     up to GM Cartography.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/old/0199/13.html">Yesterdays</a> &quot;Bad 
     Bug&quot; cause:This actually occurs because you stack to high, anything 
     stacked over 35 high from the floor will dissapear. FYI: in 35 you can stack 
     3 tables and 1 chest on top of the last table, anything else will dissapear.</li>
   </ol>
   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    <i>was updated with a bug that summed up doest the following:</i></p>
   <p><i>Buy a bag/box of reagents at lowest npc price vs what they sell for on 
    vendors, buy a bag full of GM armor/weapons for the price of normal npc items, 
    buy a bag of house add on deeds for a hundred gold, also is damn annoying 
    to the vendor's owner.</i>!<b> Soon members of Skunk Works will be able to 
    chance their password at will as well as some other neat things! As well as 
    another security upgrade to the CGI.</b></p>
