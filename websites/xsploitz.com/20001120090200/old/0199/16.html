   <p>Wow, that was one hell of a fight tonight! Congrats to Mike Tyson, really 
    looked bad for him but it all went down with one punch! Read about it on <a href="http://www.boxing.com">Boxing.com</a>.

   <p><a href="mailto:flameboy@xsploitz.com">I'd</a> love to hear what you guys 
    thought of the movie(s) &quot;A Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;. 
    The ups and downs and any other opinions on the movies. </p>

   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... I remember that one fateful day 
    when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell 
    me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never 
    were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags 
    and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice 
    and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you 
    try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was 
    saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. 
    He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's 
    when I felt the handcuffs go on. </p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Cast Metor Swarm on a Door. The door will not die (duh), and you'll gain 
     MAD Magery!! It's that simple!!</li>
    <li>Simply punch a dummy that is in your home, and get it swaying, then while 
     it is  swaying, attempt to move it and place it a few spaces away. Since 
     you cannot move a house add-on after is has been placed you will recieve 
     a message stating that the item could not be moved ,however, the dummy will 
     keep on swinging!  This obviously isn't a useful bug, but it is very neat 
     to see the dummies constantly swaying steadily along. Hope you like it!! 
    </li>
    <li>Find a house where player is macroing....cast earthquake killing the player....then 
     use telekenesis on their keys...they will appear in your pack....and you 
     can loot all you want....</li>
    <li>Feel like killing NPC's without getting a murder?  Just attack them,lead 
     them back to your house and you can let them in and due to Origin's new patch 
     they will be flagged under 'Texas Law' and you can kill them at will with 
     no repercussions.  Chop em up take their belongings all without any penalty.  
     Great fun and a great way if you are looking to lose karma fast, just cut 
     em up. </li>
    <li>Go town....bank works well.  Drop a stack of 100 gold next to you, invariably 
     someoone will run up tot the gold.  Make sure you have your mouse button 
     held down on the pile.  As he starts to drag it, quickly drop it into your 
     pack (You have control since you had the mouse held down first), if you time 
     it correctly and it hits the interior of your pack before the other persons 
     client says "You cannot pick that up" he is flagged grey and hit your guard 
     macro.  Boom dead 'thief'.  Loot away and repeat.</li>
