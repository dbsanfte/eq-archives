   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    Was updated with a wonderful bug on how to raise your strength without gaining 
    any skill points for your precious skill caps! </p>
   <p>Sorry for the broken link yesterday, here is the correct one for <a href="http://the-egg.net/apocalypse/" target="_blank">Egg's 
    Apocalypse player run shard!</a> This is the only current running public shard 
    besides Origins, go check it out! Don't forget about <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/c&amp;s/">Crasher

   <p>Blah, another Monday. And with that, I bring you bad news (or maybe good 
    news)&nbsp; It looks like you cannot kill macroers in town with spells anymore. 
    There were serveral techniques in town-killing, where you could cast a spell 
    and then just attack.&nbsp; I just tried it, but the guards came right after 
    I casted poison.&nbsp; Try it on your server, maybe it's only mine.</p>
   <p>Now, with that Game Hack bug, I will be getting screen shots of it soon.&nbsp; 
    If those aren't convincing enough, the person who submitted the pictures will 
    give me a demonstration.&nbsp; He says that it does not dupe the arrows (like 
    some of you thought), it mearly changes the graphic so it looks like there 
    are 10,000 arrows.</p>
   <p>There's a new question of the day, and I expect everyone who comes to this 
    site, to send me a response.&nbsp; This is a very important question, so feel 
    free to let us have it with everything you've got.&nbsp; If you wish to use 
    foul language, please do it tasteful manner, or it won't be read.&nbsp; Also, 
    make the subject <strong>LETTER</strong>, because it will help in organizing 
    the responses.</p>
   <p><strong><u>Important news from yesterday</u></strong></p>
   <p>Now, with the boat break-in, a few things were discovered.&nbsp; The bug 
    was demonstrated yesterday evening, and it worked to a certain extent. Loric 
    and I have found out the following:
   <ul>
    <li>You can open and close the planks</li>
    <li>You can give the tillerman commands</li>
    <li>You can grab items off of tables (when it's close enough)</li>
    <li>You can break items</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Unfortunately, you cannot board the boat.&nbsp; Look at the recent bugs 
    section and try it out for yourself.&nbsp; This could be used to play a nasty 
    trick on people, by sending their boat out to sea.<br>
    I took 2 screenshots of Loric and myself trying out the bug.<br>

   <p>The question of the week is now over, and the results are in.&nbsp; Take 
    a look at the responses I felt, were the best. <a href="reponses.htm" target="_self">EQ

   <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Monster Killing:</strong> If you are in your house and monsters 
     come to the front door to try and attacks, you can ban them from the house 
     and they will become trapped under the house sign and cannot move...all you 
     need to do is go outside, cast flame field and boom they are dead.&nbsp; 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weight Limit</strong>: When you try to pick something up and you 
     get that &quot;That container cannot hold more items&quot; message... drop 
     the item on the nearest person to you and then cancel the trade window... 
     The item will go into your pack without checking for the ammount of items 
     you have in it.</li>
    <li><strong>Town Kill:</strong> Cast a poison on a person (or any other spell 
     which is harmful) If you don't die, walk up to the person and begin auto 
     attack.&nbsp; Have a buddy hang onto your sword or bow, and if you do not 
     have the guards called, equip the weapons.</li>
   </ul>
