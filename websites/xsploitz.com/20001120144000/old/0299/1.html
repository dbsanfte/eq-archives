   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    Was updated with a daily bug on how to enter houses you are banned from! This 
    particular bug was very interesting and what was the best part about it, was 
    it worked! So go forth and loot the banned houses!<a href="mailto:xsploit@xsploitz.com"><b> 
    --SickBoy</b></a></p>
   <p>First off, I would like to thanks the 5 people who sent in the firefield 
    bug again, and the 4 people who sent in the Magic/Blacksmithy bug again. =)</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>I have a couple bugs for you, but some are old. Maybe they will come in 
    handy for some of you.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Since today was a really slow day, I did a little thinking on how to avoid 
    this situation again.&nbsp; Please <a href="mailto:spub@xsploitz.com">send 
    me(Spub@xsploitz.com)</a> your suggestions, stories, and strange pictures 
    (Like the invisible paralyze field, or green acres pics) that <u><strong>relate</strong></u> 
    to UO. &nbsp; I'll keep them on file and when the bug bin is empty, I'll post 
    a couple of suggestions here.</p>

   <p>Wow, February already!&nbsp; Time is just whipping by.&nbsp; If you are 
    in highschool or lower, enjoy it while you can.&nbsp; Once you get out of 
    Highschool, expect life to get VERY busy and extremely hard.</p>
   <p>There's no bugs yet that are worth posting.&nbsp; Basically, this update 
    (if you want to even call it that) is just to let you know that someone is 
    keeping an eye on the e-mails and once some more mail comes in, I'll put up 
    a couple bugs.</p>
   <p>Please check back later tonight. Once everyone gets home from work, I'm 
    sure there will some good bugs.</p>

   <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Teleport Bug:</strong> When you need to hide real bad but are 
     getting your ass kicked by something, cast teleport.&nbsp; While teleport 
     is casting (as soon as you click on the targeting cursor disappears), hit 
     your hiding macro and you will hide.&nbsp; Seems that when teleporting line 
     of sight is removed from your attackers so you're free to hide! &nbsp; </li>
    <li><strong>Lower Karma</strong>: Go to bucs den.&nbsp; Use provoke on an 
     NPC.&nbsp; You won't gain skill but your karma drops soo fast.&nbsp; You 
     can hit evil in 15 minutes. &nbsp; Also, theres a bank in bucs den now (on 
     all shards?)!&nbsp; It's very useful.</li>
    <li><strong>Detect Hidden</strong>:&nbsp; Make an arrangement of 8 chests, 
     and stand in the empty corner, and detect the middle. The tinker's skill 
     that made the trapped chests plays a big part, with 60 detect, I still can't 
     detect my gm tinker's traps even 1% of the time, so try to find a newbie 
     tinker with 20-30 or so skill for the first few attempts, then 40-60, then 
     around 80, then gm for the most speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Fishing Bug:</strong> When you go fishing and stack the fish that 
     you've caught in your backpack. If you then use a bladed item on the stack 
     of fish, you get 4 steaks and use up 2 fish. but if you single out the fish 
     and use the knife on each fish by itself, you still get 4 steaks from 1 fish. 
    </li>
   </ul>
