   <p>Boy we are a'lackin on the bugs boys and girls! Really, we need every bug 
    we can get, so do us all a big huge favor and, Please keep <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/submit.html" target="_blank">sending</a> 
    in those bugs!</p>
   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... I bet the main reason the police 
    keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in 
    and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like 
    they just woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"</p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update:</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li> This bug involves making a Public Building in-accessible to the general 
     UO population. This really doesn't have any use now, but when/if House Maintainance 
     goes in, this will GREATLY reduce the House Maintainance costs, by making 
     your building Public, while still reataining it's security as a Private Building 
     would. Basically, what I'm saying is you can effectively "Lock" a Public 
     Building so that only you and the House "Friends" can get inside. Here's 
     how: Take a few chests or whatever, and have them be "Locked-Down" in front 
     of the door. Now, people can't really get inside your House!! </li>
    <li>Also perhaps from that bug you can also pick the locks of the chests, 
     of the people who like that bug. (maybe)</li>
    <li><b>A Personal E-mail:</b>You can get 100 dex and GM Lockpicking in one 
     night of macroing!!!  All I needed was 37 lockpicks and a locked chest (I 
     think the higher the tinker level it was locked with makes for better gain). 
     All you do is make a macro to use the lockpicks on the chest, then lock the 
     chest again. In the beginning, you will be failing 100% of the time (and 
     breaking lockpicks occassionally) But your lockpicking gain is incredible! 
     My first gain was +10 to skill, from failing an attempt. Once you reach a 
     high enough level that you succeed, you succeed 100% of the time. What this 
     means is, you will never, ever break a lockpick on this chest, so you won't 
     even be wasting lockpicks. Letting it run overnight for about 10-12 hours, 
     I made it to Grandmaster lockpicking and my dex went from 24 to 100!!!  The 
     gains on this skill are just insane. I assume its because noone ever uses 
     that skill, so the gain is jacked way up to try to compensate.</li>
