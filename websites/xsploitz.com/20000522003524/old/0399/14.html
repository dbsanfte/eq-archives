    <p><small><font face="Arial">Well, the rogue protest is over.&nbsp; It went pretty good (I
    felt), people got a bit too rowdy at the end.&nbsp; Just over 40 people showed up. 95% of
    the people came to hear what I had to say, and were quiet throughout my entire speech, 3%
    came to hear what I had to say, but were arguing with others, and the last 2% opposed it
    and were being trouble-makers.&nbsp; 3 or 4 counselors showed up, and one told me that the
    GM's were watching.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I just want to point out that the protest wasn't being run by
    Xsploitz.&nbsp; It was a joint effort by all rogues of Britannia.&nbsp; I am a huge,
    hardcore rogue. I saw the problems in the upcoming patch, and I completely disagreed with
    it.&nbsp; Others agreed with me, and joined in the campaign.&nbsp; Just because I help
    maintain a bug site doesn't mean that I hate OSI and hate UO.&nbsp; I've been playing the
    Ultima series for years and years and I'm a HUGE fan of UO, and I have a lot of respect
    for the designers.&nbsp; If I didn't like the game, I wouldn't pay $10 a month. <strong>More

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Unconfirmed Bug(s):</small></font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Tailoring Bug</strong></small>:<small> In addition to
        the tailoring bug, if you click on your sewing kit, then your clothing, and then on your
        fancy shirt. When the shirt appears under your feet for a brief moment, press last object,
        and voila, 2 fancy shirts! But the trick is to time it right! Try to press last object
        EXACTLY at the same time as the shirt appears under you, and you'll get an extra fancy
        shirt, just like the skullcaps or the hats, cept that you get two fancy shirt, and not a
        shirt and hat! Of course you have to click on the cloth to use, but it still is worth it.<strong>

      <li><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Client Crash: </strong>It pretty simple to do. You
        will need a bag, pouch, chest ect. I have only tried it with a bag but I am sure it will
        work with any of the various bags. 1st you give someone a bag. Next you open it in the
        trade window so they can see what is in the bag. Then say something like &quot;WOW look my
        health!&quot; &nbsp; If they drag your health bar away to see it they will get a client
        crash.</small></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Update to Detect Hidden tip</strong>: I have been
        using that rogue tip for a long time, I would like to give some more tips on it. 1st of
        all, you stand in the middle of your house (small ones). A small house has 5x5 tiles, 25
        tiles - 1 (the one you'restanding) = 24 tiles each tiles can stack 6 little box (i dunno
        if u can stack more than that or not), so 6 x 24 = 144 box. The skill level of the guy who
        made the traps are not important at all. What you need to do after setting up these things
        all around you is to detect and target on the tile you're standing on. Doing 1 detect
        equals to 144 times. *grin* easy to become gm.</small></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Old Detect Hidden Tip:</small></strong> <small>For all
        the rogues out there another rehashed tip that works again.Get a tinker/carpenter and make
        as many little chests as your little heart desires then stack um in a little house along
        the wall.Dart traps on all of em and park yer ass in front of them and detect hidden.Your
        skill will go up at a very pleasing rate.(bonus:you get to practice disarming traps when
        you get done detecting them all)</small></font></li>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>If the stealth changes are discarded or post-poned, I might
    help in setting up a United Rogues Guild of Britannia (Like the United Blacksmithy Guild)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Also, I would like to thank Crossroads of Britannia and
    Stratics for posting my ad as well as UO Market and other sites for posting the ad. &nbsp;
    UOVault shafted the protest....oh well.&nbsp; We reach 40 people, and that was the goal.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It's now up to OSI to make the right decision.&nbsp; We still
    must post about how the upcoming stealth changes are unfair.&nbsp; It looks like we are
    starting to make an impression and get noticed.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still more work
    needed to be done. Keep sending in those complaint e-mails to <a href="mailto:support@owo.com">support@owo.com</a>.&nbsp; Don't spam Designer Dragon's
    e-mail address please, it makes us look extremely bad.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>What you can do to help?</strong></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Send the e-mail I made (or make your own up, be nice) and
    send it to <a href="mailto:support@owo.com">support@owo.com</a> and go around the message
    boards posting your opinion on the stealth changes. If you don't know what to say, just
    copy and paste the e-mail I wrote up and tack on a title of ,&quot;All Rogues, read
    this.&quot;&nbsp; We are going full force into this, no screwing around. Basically, raise
    hell.&nbsp; We must stop the changes.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>What's Next?</small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Wait and see what OSI's response is.<br>
    </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>My letter to OSI concerning the subject:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>UO Support and Designers, </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I am really disappointed with the recent changes to stealth
    (currently on Test Center). Stealth was definitely the best skill ever given to rogues,
    but now, it has basically become useless with the proposed changes. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Come on, you guys are being way to hard on rogues! It's hard
    enough to make a living as a rogue, but now it's going to be impossible. What do you
    expect us to do if we are in a crowded dungeon (monsters and players), and need to use
    stealth to get away from a very nasty dragon? We won't be able to stealth and we'll die. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Though, I can deal with that aspect of stealth by avoiding
    the situation completely, but the two that are completely outrageous are, &quot;snooping
    reveals you&quot;, and, &quot;pass through someone while using stealth, reveals you.&quot;
    </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Shouldn't it be:<br>
    -If you are using stealth and fail to snoop, then you become visible? (Same thing if
    you're just hidden) </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-If you're in a building/player house and you pass through
    someone, then you become unhidden (that would be extremely fair, even I would agree to
    that) Side-note: To top it off, a player can just use detect hidden and uncover any rogue
    in their house. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Moves you can take while using stealth are 15 (max)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Success rate depends on how many people are within a certain
    amount of spaces also need to be reduced or just taken out completely. (How will we be
    able to escape any attacker if that is implemented?)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It doesn't make sense to me why you would take this course of
    action. A rogue needs to be able to defend him/herself and the only way it's possible, is
    to run like hell and use stealth &amp; hide a lot. The proposed features simply will not
    work. If the changes go in, the entire rogue class will die. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Mages have meditation, and they're able to pump out an e-bolt
    every couple of seconds. Fighters have poisoned weapons, which delivers devastating
    damages. Archers have super, powerful bows and xbows, that allow them to kill a person in
    seconds without the worry of taking damage. Why do you not let the rogues keep their
    unique advantages? I think it's only fair. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The problem is not with the rogues abusing the features, it's
    that you have never asked us what we would like added into the rogue class. All you did
    was say, &quot;Here it is, test it.&quot; and a couple days later it was public. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, it's lack of communication. We (rogues) make tons of
    suggestions on UOVault and COB everyday. I think I speak for every single rogue in UO when
    I say, &quot;You must reconsider the upcoming rogue changes and take a look at our
    suggestions.&quot; Take a look at the suggestions made at the beginning of the e-mail,
    there's three to start you off. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Please pass this along to the applicable person(s) in charge
    of development. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I'm looking forward to your response. </small></font></p>
