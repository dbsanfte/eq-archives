   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">SkunkWorks</a>: 
    Okay, I came upon some very interesting information tonight boys and girls. 
    As we all know the first semester of most schools is coming to a end. We all 
    have tests, some of them word tests others scantrons. Well finaly a easy way 
    out, a cheat for scantrons! You knew there had to be a backdoor to it, and 
    now there is. <font size="1">(note: this method has not been confirmed yet 
    by any Xsploitz official.) </font>Its posted on <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk 
    Works</a> tonight, remember <i>cheating is unethical and in no way, should 
    you use this for any reason other than testing it on a non-counting test.</i> 
    As well as a update for <b>SecondUO</b>! <font size="1"><b>(Xsploitz.com will 
    not be responsible for you using this method on a scantron test)</b></font><b></b></p>
   <p>As Lomo mentioned, Skunk Works will be getting a new look with some new 
    stuff very soon.</p>
   <p><b>--SickBoy</b></p>
   <p>Small update from <strong>Spub</strong>:<br>
    Just so there's no confusion, in the letter listed below, the bolded text 
    is the suggestion.&nbsp; I took out the rest of the letter because it did 
    not reflect everyone's best interest and certainly did not reflect my views 
    on UO.&nbsp; Read the suggestion though, it is great!.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Hey everyone, <strong>Lomo</strong> here.&nbsp; Check out the tips below.&nbsp; Soon we
    will be moving to Xsploitz.com which will be fully updated with CGI once we get there.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Skunk Works is going to have a new paint job done so look forward to it!
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow or later tonight there will be bugs posted dealing with, possibly
    another tailor bug, house breakin bug (only works in certain scenarios, and a way to raise
    smithy skill faster than normal.</p>
    <p>Well that's it folks! Once again look forward to our move the the main Xsploitz site
    hopefully sometime this week.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Good afternoon everyone, this is <strong>Spub</strong>, bringing you another update.
    The following has nothing to do with bugs, so if you don't care, just skip down the page
    to the bugs.</p>
    <p>I've gotten a huge reponse over the last few days to the Weekly Question, and so I am
    going to start posting the responses.&nbsp; I for one, do not like at all what OSI has
    done to the thief character.&nbsp; Can you honestly say that you would find more fun in
    opening chests in dungeons (keep in mind, you can barely hide when a dragon is chasing
    you) for 100 gold, rather then PvP or monster stealing.&nbsp; Here is a very good
    suggestion:</p>
    <p><em><strong>My suggestion is that all the rogues now band tightly with pkers</strong>.<br>
    -D.S</em></p>
    <p>Well, what do you all say? I'd love to hear your response to this e-mail, and your
    suggestion as to how it could be accomplished. Send it to: <a

    <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong><ul>
      <li><strong>Abyss Shard - Meditation: </strong>First you start meditating <br>
        while you're at full mana, and then, without moving, you cast any spell. You wont stop
        meditating.&nbsp; After that you are free to move around and you will still be meditating.
        &nbsp; As long as you don't put on metal armor or use meditation again, you will keep
        meditating.&nbsp; As one could guess, there are quite a few advantages to having your mana
        come back at warp speed constantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Block Poison</strong>: This is a interesting bug, I had it demonstrated to me
        using the following technique, but I haven't been able to make it work.&nbsp; Give it a
        try anyway.&nbsp; Get two poison bottles and use the poisoning skill.&nbsp; When the
        cursor comes up, select a weapon.&nbsp; As the weapon is being poisoned press alt-p, and
        you will then do you will notice that it looks like you are casting and a cursor comes up
        again. Select the weapon again, and you should get a message something like, &quot;Poison
        not accessible&quot;&nbsp; To test it, drink a poison potion.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiding</strong>: Simply cast Explosion and click on your target, and quickly
        hide. Since the explosion 'lags' a little while, you won't get the &quot;You are attacking
        someone!&quot; message until it goes boom. So, before this, you could hide, recall or run
        quite a long distance before the target <br>
        even knows you attacked!</li>
      <li><strong>Blocking Monsters</strong> <strong>in dungeons</strong>: Get the following
        items: 2 wooden shields, 2 flour sacks, 1 back pack, 1 orange chest. Stack those items in
        the following order: Go 1 sheild, 1 sack, 1 sheild, 1 sack, 1 pack, 1 orange chest. Chest
        must be placed so it sits north to south on top of pack. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So people, send in your bugs!&nbsp; You are what makes this site great and keeps it
    running.&nbsp; As an incentive, you are being offered a free Skunk Works account (per
    person) for every bug or tip you submit.<br>
    Please submit your bugs to: <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">team1@xsploitz.com</a></p>
    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you tame an animal in T2A that fetches it's own loot and such
    (like<br>
    an Ice Dragon), and you bring in back to the old world, DON'T tell it to<br>
    drop the loot!&nbsp; Once the loot hits the ground, the dragon, or whatever,<br>
    well disappear!&nbsp; Take it back to the new world and tell it to there. </p>
