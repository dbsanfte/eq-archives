Look not to your UO guides to help you. When you have the answers, send a numbered list with your answers to <a href="mailto:contest@xsploitz.com?SUBJECT=ultimatriviaentry">contest@xsploitz.com</a>. You must get them ALL correct. The first 10 entries that have 20 correct will win. 8 winners will be chosen to receive free <a href="http://www.Xsploitz.com/skunk.html">Skunk Works</a> accounts. The top two winners will receive $25 each and a Skunk Works account. The contest ends Tuesday, September 15th, or when prizes run out, so hurry and get those entries in! [One entry per person]. Good luck...(as if you have a chance).</font></p></i>
