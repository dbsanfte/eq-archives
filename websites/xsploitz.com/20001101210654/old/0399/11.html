    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Wow, I got a great response to my e-mail concerning the
    Stealth changes.&nbsp; For those of you coming from Dr. TwisTer and UOShack, welcome!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>What you can do to help?</strong></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Send the e-mail I made (or make your own up, be nice) and
    send it to <a href="mailto:support@owo.com">support@owo.com</a> and go around the message
    boards posting your opinion on the stealth changes. If you don't know what to say, just
    copy and paste the e-mail I wrote up and tack on a title of ,&quot;All Rogues, read
    this.&quot;&nbsp; We are going full force into this, no screwing around. Basically, raise
    hell.&nbsp; We must stop the changes.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I think the next best thing to do would be to hold a protest
    on a shard.&nbsp; One person who wrote to me says he could round-up 40 rogues on <strong>Pacific</strong>.
    &nbsp; So that's probably the best shard to do this on.&nbsp; This will probably be
    Saturday evening (this weekend).&nbsp; Details are still being made up, but any
    suggestions for it are welcome.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Now with the tinkering bug, you need more than 100 keys.
    &nbsp; 600-700 will do it, and it will only cost you 1500 gold.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I'll just get to the point, if the new changes go in, the
    rogue class is dead.&nbsp; I am a huge rogue class supporter, and I don't want to see the
    class die.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can stop the changes but we need to work together on this.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I composed an e-mail yesterday and I have recieved a lot of
    feedback (in-game, message boards) on it supporting my ideas.&nbsp; I think it would be
    good if we all used the e-mail, but instead of my name being at the bottom it could be,
    &quot;A Concerned Rogue.&quot; or , &quot;&lt;Rogue Name&gt; of &lt;Shard&gt;&quot;&nbsp; </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Here's phase one of our campaign, copy the following
    e-mail and send <u>only one</u> off to <a href="mailto:support@owo.com">support@owo.com</a>.
    &nbsp; Then tommorrow, send another e-mail off to UO Support.</small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>UO Support and Designers, </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I am really disappointed with the recent changes to stealth
    (currently on Test Center). Stealth was definitely the best skill ever given to rogues,
    but now, it has basically become useless with the proposed changes. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Come on, you guys are being way to hard on rogues! It's hard
    enough to make a living as a rogue, but now it's going to be impossible. What do you
    expect us to do if we are in a crowded dungeon (monsters and players), and need to use
    stealth to get away from a very nasty dragon? We won't be able to stealth and we'll die. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Though, I can deal with that aspect of stealth by avoiding
    the situation completely, but the two that are completely outrageous are, &quot;snooping
    reveals you&quot;, and, &quot;pass through someone while using stealth, reveals you.&quot;
    </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Shouldn't it be:<br>
    -If you are using stealth and fail to snoop, then you become visible? (Same thing if
    you're just hidden) </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-If you're in a building/player house and you pass through
    someone, then you become unhidden (that would be extremely fair, even I would agree to
    that) Side-note: To top it off, a player can just use detect hidden and uncover any rogue
    in their house. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Moves you can take while using stealth are 15 (max)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Success rate depends on how many people are within a certain
    amount of spaces also need to be reduced or just taken out completely. (How will we be
    able to escape any attacker if that is implemented?)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It doesn't make sense to me why you would take this course of
    action. A rogue needs to be able to defend him/herself and the only way it's possible, is
    to run like hell and use stealth &amp; hide a lot. The proposed features simply will not
    work. If the changes go in, the entire rogue class will die. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Mages have meditation, and they're able to pump out an e-bolt
    every couple of seconds. Fighters have poisoned weapons, which delivers devastating
    damages. Archers have super, powerful bows and xbows, that allow them to kill a person in
    seconds without the worry of taking damage. Why do you not let the rogues keep their
    unique advantages? I think it's only fair. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The problem is not with the rogues abusing the features, it's
    that you have never asked us what we would like added into the rogue class. All you did
    was say, &quot;Here it is, test it.&quot; and a couple days later it was public. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, it's lack of communication. We (rogues) make tons of
    suggestions on UOVault and COB everyday. I think I speak for every single rogue in UO when
    I say, &quot;You must reconsider the upcoming rogue changes and take a look at our
    suggestions.&quot; Take a look at the suggestions made at the beginning of the e-mail,
    there's three to start you off. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Please pass this along to the applicable person(s) in charge
    of development. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I'm looking forward to your response. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Thanks for your time,<br>
