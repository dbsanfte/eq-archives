   <p><a href="http://www.sploitz.com/" target="_blank">Well the Test Team is 
    doing GREAT!</a> And I'm proud to announce I've decided to keep all 3 team 
    members, and will have them move to the banner free (and CGI able) xsploitz.com 
    as soon as possible! Until then contiune <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">submiting 
    your bugs to them</a>, and visiting <a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="_blank">sploitz.com</a>. 
    As soon as possible is currently when the CGI is ready sometime next week.</p>
   <p>Well as I promised I have a suprise for you today! Xsploitz.com has a <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/iolo/macrom.html"><b>special 
    offer</b></a> for you all! &quot;Macro Magic&quot; the highest rated and regarded 
    program is being offered to all Xsploitz.com users at almost 1/2off the normal 
    price. <i>Not only that, but I personaly will be compiling a list of macros 
    for you to use with the program that will be sent to everyone who orders it! 
    </i><a href="http://www.iolo.com" target="_blank"><b>Iolo Technologies</b></a> 
    and Xsploitz.com have teamed up to offer you a valuable resource at virtually 
    half off! Not only that but you can get a <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html">Skunk 
    Works</a> account for cheaper too when you order Macro Magic! Check out the 
    <b> <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/iolo/macrom.html">promotion page</a></b> 
    to download a <i>free 30-day demo</i> and then <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/iolo/"><b>order 
    it if you like it! </b></a></p>
   <p>Today in <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk 
    Works</a>, we upgraded the security. Due to rumors that a stolen password 
    file was released, we have changed <b>ALL passwords</b>! As well as, made 
    Skunk Works gateway have a new check-point, that shouldn't effect any of you 
    except with unresolving IP's. If you have a unresolving IP you will now recieve 
    a 30second delay when loading the main Skunk page!</p>
   <p>Skunk Works will always be a fortress of security and it has been determined 
    that allowing users to change their own passwords will be a valuble asset 
    to this security. So over the weekend that feature will be added to Skunk 
    Works. We will always do our best to protect our Skunk users security! (if 
    you have any ideas, let us know)</p>
   <p>Now I'd like to say a word about the Test Update Team! Man'o'Man these guys 
    are the best damned updaters I've ever seen. Its so clear that this is what 
    you guys deserved I made my descision already to keep them permanantly. I 
    hope you all give them a huge welcome, and if you have any compliments/complaints 
    contact me. As soon as the CGI is in and they take over, I (SickBoy) will 
    only be doing small updates to the main page but will always update Skunk 
    Works!</p>
   <p><a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="_blank">Lastly I won't be here 
    tomorrow. I have a concert to attend to, so tough cookies. As usual the updating 
    team is doing a great job, check them out!</a></p>
   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... Sometimes, when I drive across 
    the desert in the middle of the night, with no other cars around, I start 
    imagining: What if there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, 
    no people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made this car? 
    And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick my head out the window 
    into the driving rain---unless there's lightning, because I could get struck 
    on the head by a bolt. </p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li>NO updates tonight because, you should <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">submit</a> 
     your bugs to the <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">TEST TEAM</a>! We want 
     to see what these guys got!</li>
   </ol>
   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>:
