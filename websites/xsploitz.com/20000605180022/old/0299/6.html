   <p><a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="_blank">DELAYED UPDATE OF SPLOITZ.COM</a></p>
   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    Was updated with three daily bugs, and two unconfirmed but <b>big</b> bits 
    of information. The first bug being how to swing your bladed weapons at unbeliveable 
    speeds! The second one being how to secure/unsecure items outside your house. 
    The third one being how to gain massive amounts of resist magic, a favorite 
    in Sploitz history!</p>
   <p>Mmmkay. First off let me apologize for my lack of updates lately, I should 
    be back on track from here on out, the end-winter sickness is going around 
    and I caught it, and now have overcome it. Pushing on, <a href="http://www.empeg.com" target="_blank">check 
    out </a>this little piece of hardware a MP3 player for your care allowing 
    up to 7,000songs (or 580 full albums) play simultaneously, neato (empeg). 
    Our friends at <a href="%20http://the-egg.net/apocalypse/" target="_blank">Egg's 
    Apocolypse shard</a> is now running. <b>This shard is very cool, I highly 
    recommend you check it</b>!</p>
   <p>Our old (but great) updater &quot;<b>Uncle Sam</b>&quot; has left the team 
    for real life reasons, <font size="4"><i>we will miss him</i></font>, you 
    can let him know how much you miss him by writing the <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">team</a> 
    your favorite bugs, and how much you miss him! He was replaced by <a href="mailto:loric@xsploitz.com">Loric</a>, 
    who you'll all get to know in the next few days! New/Changed passwords are 
    a little backed up at Customer Service please expect at least a 2-3day delay, 
    thanks! <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">New accounts</a> 
    are still at a processing rate of 1day or less.</p>

   <p><b>Some words from Uncle Sam:</b></p>
   <p>Well, folks, sorry I can't stay, but it seems I was not able to keep Xsploitz 
    updated as best I could. My real life obligations seemed to out weigh my Internet 
    obligations, and unfortunately, there wasn't enough time for both. I am sure 
    Loric will do a great job in my absence, and I hope you enjoy his bugs. For 
    the last time, farewell.</p>

   <p>I've added a couple more unconfirmed bugs if you scroll down. One dealing 
    with taming, the other with a boat break-in.</p>
   <u><strong><small>1:00 PM EST - Spub</small></strong></u>
   <p></p>
   <p>Well I hope some of you got some use out of yesterdays house break-in, although 
    it wasn't a new bug (see Feb 3, 1999 on Skunk Works).&nbsp; One thing is for 
    sure, it scared the hell out of everyone.</p>
   <p>The question of the week is ready to be taken down, so get your response 
    in now. Expect the results to be posted tommorrow.</p>
   <p>A little update to the indestructable boxes bug from Dupe (the bug submitter):</p>
   <p><small><em>It appears that unlike first reported, monsters WILL destroy 
    the boxes... Or at least Goats and panthers will. But humans still cannot 
    destroy the small chests. I went to town and bought 10 brand new chests and 
    they all seem to have the same problem. The only weird thing is that I am 
    still able to destroy chests that were in my house prior to last night.<br>
    <br>
    I have tried numerous axes, halperds etc. I have tried 3 different<br>
    subservers now. The same result on each server with each weapon. Humans cannot 
    destroy them, but animals can. Havent been able to find a monster long enough 
    to retest it on monsters, but I assume if animals can, monsters can too.<br>
    <br>
    Hope that clears things up. I guess the only good use would be to trap them 
    and leave them for looters, they will not be able to break them down and eventually 
    their curiosity should get the best of them.</em></small><br>
   </p>
   <p>Keep those EverQuest e-mail's coming in.&nbsp; I'm getting a great reponse 
    so far, and most of them are well thought out/get to the point fast.</p>

   <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Taming:</strong> .&nbsp; To tame any creature that you have enough 
     skill for do the following, and you should be successful on the first try. 
     Bring your health close to 0. Start to tame the target creature, while taming, 
     die. Play as a ghost and stand next to the target, you should succeed your 
     tame every time. When you res, your pet should be waiting for you.<br>
     <p> 
    <li><strong>Boat Break-in:</strong> .&nbsp; Find a boat near a bridge. Once 
     there stand on the bridge so you are over the boat. To see if the spot you 
     have selected over the boat is good, try opening the plank. If the plank 
     is open, but unlocked, your in. Once you open the planks you can also give 
     the tillerman commands. Move the boat around so you are over whatever you 
     wish to take. Then simply drag the item into your pack. <strong>(This is 
     sketchy at best, but try it out and tell me what you come up with.)</strong><br>
     <p> 
    <li><strong>Trade Window Rip-off:</strong> .&nbsp; Basically all it is good 
     for is a TRADE WINDOW RIP-OFF.&nbsp; But it is kinda a HACK.&nbsp; You must 
     use GAME HACK, which we all remember was big for a while when the &quot;Gm 
     Newbie MAGE&quot; hack was out and about. Get some X-bow Bolts(10 or so) 
     say you are selling then.&nbsp; When the window comes up do a seach for one 
     less than what you put in there(note you may need to adjust how many are 
     in there till it will work) then do a search for that actual #. Make sure 
     the second search finds only one match! Now freeze it, raise it,and KABOOM, 
     10 bolts goes to 10,000 and u make a lot of PROFIT!!&nbsp; <strong>(Note: 
     This is pretty confusing, give it a shot anyway.. but be careful using Game 
     Hack)</strong><br>
    </li>
   </ul>

   <p><strong>Tip</strong> -<strong> </strong>I just wanted to let you know that 
    I actually have had quite a bit of success macroing Meditation by wearing 
    a chain tunic as it still allows you to go into the &quot;Meditative Trance&quot; 
    but does not raise your mana fast....&nbsp;&nbsp; As a side note...&nbsp; 
    I also have set my macro up to cast a couple spells, Meditate, Walk a step 
    (thus ending the meditation), wait for skill timeout, meditate again, walk 
    a step back, wait....&nbsp; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has worked great for me!</p>
