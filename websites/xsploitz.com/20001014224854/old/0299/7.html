   <p><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html" target="_blank">Skunk Works</a>: 
    Was updated with a daily bug on how to gain parrying during combat. Very useful 
    since you'll be needing it for future combat. It was also updated with a pretty 
    old bug on how to get a daemon to steal from other ships for you. This isn't 
    your normal just send a daemon to &quot;fetch&quot; its quite detailed, and 
    it still works like a charm for boat looting!</p>
   <p>Kind of a slow day in the way of bugs. Well check out <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/c&amp;s/" target="_blank">Crasher&amp;Smasher 
    with there new friend Slasher</a> with a brand new show! Speaking of laughing 
    Jokes 4 U had a really quite hilarious joke today, again I really urge you 
    to <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/jokes.html" target="_blank">subscribe</a> 
    to this, really funny jokes pretty much I guarntee you'll laugh. Again Our 
    friends at <a href="%20http://the-egg.net/apocalypse/" target="_blank">Egg's 
    Apocolypse shard</a> is now running. <b>This shard is very cool, I highly 
    recommend you check it</b>!</p>

   <p>Hmm.&nbsp; Now I am getting unconfirms for the trade window rip-off.&nbsp; 
    I am being told that it is impossible to do what the bug suggests.&nbsp; Read 
    the letter for yourself:</p>
   <p><em>That bug with Game Hack i know doesnt work.. havent tried it, but i 
    can already tell u it doesnt.. Game Hack is a client side program... thats 
    why it works on games like quake and doom... but not for UO... if u were to 
    change 10 bolts to 10000 on UO, it would have to send the information to the 
    shard.. and gamehack cant do that.. gamehack would just change the image(if 
    even)</em></p>
   <p>I'm going to download Game Hack and give it a try.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Now, with the boat break-in, a few things were discovered.&nbsp; The bug 
    was demonstrated yesterday evening, and it worked to a certain extent. Loric 
    and I have found out the following:
   <ul>
    <li>You can open and close the planks</li>
    <li>You can give the tillerman commands</li>
    <li>You can grab items off of tables (when it's close enough)</li>
    <li>You can break items</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Unfortunately, you cannot board the boat.&nbsp; Look at the recent bugs 
    section and try it out for yourself.&nbsp; This could be used to play a nasty 
    trick on people, by sending their boat out to sea.<br>
    I took 2 screenshots of Loric and myself trying out the bug.<br>
    <a href="b1.GIF" target="_self">Picture 1</a><br>
    <a href="b2.GIF" target="_self">Picture 2</a></p>
   <p>Lastly, I am sorry about the screwed up links.&nbsp; Webjump keeps changing 
    them around.</p>
   <p><u><strong><small>12:15 PM EST - Spub</small></strong></u></p>
   <p>Remember the trade window rip-off bug I posted yesterday, well I got an 
    e-mail today that says it works.&nbsp; The person stated that you must mess 
    around with it for a bit (3-4 minutes).&nbsp; The bug is posted in the bug 
    section for everyone to try.</p>
   <p>Also, there will be an update later today on the ship break-in bug.&nbsp; 
    Loric will tell you all about that.</p>
   <p>The question of the week is now over, and the results are in.&nbsp; Take 
    a look at the responses I felt, were the best. <a href="reponses.htm" target="_self">EQ

   <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Trade Window Rip-off :</strong> .&nbsp; Basically all it is good 
     for is a TRADE WINDOW RIP-OFF.&nbsp; But it is kinda a HACK.&nbsp; You must 
     use GAME HACK, which we all remember was big for a while when the &quot;Gm 
     Newbie MAGE&quot; hack was out and about. Get some X-bow Bolts(10 or so) 
     say you are selling then.&nbsp; When the window comes up do a seach for one 
     less than what you put in there(note you may need to adjust how many are 
     in there till it will work) then do a search for that actual #. Make sure 
     the second search finds only one match! Now freeze it, raise it,and KABOOM, 
     10 bolts goes to 10,000 and u make a lot of PROFIT!!&nbsp; <strong>(Note: 
     This is pretty confusing, give it a shot anyway.. but be careful using Game 
     Hack)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>House Ban Blues</strong>: If you get banned from a house, simply 
     use incognito and the house will not know any better and BANG your in.</li>
    <li><strong>Tinker Trap Fun!</strong>: We all know that tinker trapped boxes 
     cannot be placed in trade windows, which is a MAJOR bummer for us mad bombers!&nbsp; 
     But I have found a way to do so.&nbsp; Simply place any other object into 
     the window first, then you can place your trapped boxes in it!&nbsp; You 
     can place 10gp, then pull it out then place your box in!&nbsp; Or you can 
     leave the gp in there!&nbsp; Whatever your heart craves! &nbsp; You can throw 
     and arrow in there, a deed, whatever!</li>
   </ul>
   <p><br>
    So people, send in your bugs!&nbsp; You are what makes this site great, and 
    keeps it running.&nbsp; As an incentive, you are being offered a free Skunk 
    Works account (<em>per person</em>) for every bug or tip you submit.<br>
    Please submit your bugs to: <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">team1@xsploitz.com</a></p>
   <p><strong>Tip</strong> -<strong> </strong>First, get five lockable chests, 
    and line 'em up in your backpack. <br>
    Then buy about 70 lockpicks (buy 'em all at once from different cities so 
    they're cheap) Now get a keyring.&nbsp; Put all the keys for the lockable 
    chests on the ring and all the Lockpicks in one stack.&nbsp; Go to a guard 
    tower, and hide.&nbsp; Now all you do is dbl click the keyring once and use 
    Last Object, until you get to the picks.&nbsp; Do the same for the picks. 
    Now Macro the hell out of it.&nbsp; Using last object saves around 5 hours 
    of time, no exaggeration.&nbsp; You should have from 0 to GM in 3 nights. 
    Careful though, your stamina will go from 10 to 98.</p>
