   <p><a href="http://www.sploitz.com" target="_blank">DELAYED UPDATE OF SPLOITZ.COM</a></p>
   <p>Skunk Works: Tonight was updated with (2) daily bugs. One regarding another 
    location of a unlimited or (fast respawning) ore mining spot. The other regarding 
    a method used to overload your enemy to 400+stones using his keyring. </p>
   <p>What a day, with the UOReport0.log ordeal. I'm just happy to see that the 
    Sploitz.com staff did a great job reporting it, fairly and justly posting 
    all sides of the argument, and when it was finally closed by OSI taking responsibility. 
    We just have to wait and see now if Designer Dragon was completely right, 
    which usually he is.</p>
   <p>Thanks -- SickBoy</p>
   <p><u><strong>Hot off the Presses!</strong></u></p>
    <p>DD Reponds to UoReport0.log:<br>
    <small><small>Taken from<a href="http://uohoc.stratics.com" target="_self"> UOHOC</a></small></small><br>
    <font color="#800000"><b>Rainman&gt;</b></font> *AlienA* why was a UoReport0.log put in
    our computers with the latest client patch. What does it do and why was it put in? <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>RVogel&gt;</b></font> First of all this is not caused by OSI but
    UOExtreme. <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>DesignerD&gt;</b></font> Er, wait, hang on, back up a step. <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>DesignerD&gt;</b></font> The uoreport.log is a log generated by
    the client of wat files it opens and closes. It is to track down sources of client
    crashes. <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>DesignerD&gt;</b></font> It does NOT scan your hard drive. And it
    lives in your UO directory. <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>DesignerD&gt;</b></font> If you see it someplace else, it means
    your current working directory is changing because of how you're running UO. <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>Faceless&gt;</b></font> Certain applications that launch UO
    forgot to set the current working directory back to the appropriate place <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>Faceless&gt;</b></font> Thus people will see files get created in
    the &quot;wrong&quot; directory because of these external programs <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>Faceless&gt;</b></font> I'm not sure what other complications may
    arise from this <br>
    <font color="#0000a0"><b>Faceless&gt;</b></font> If you are experiencing such a problem, I
    strongly suggest running UO directly from the start menu <br>
    <br>
    Well there you have it.&nbsp; If this is true, then let me be the first to <strong>publicly
    apologize</strong> <strong>to OSI</strong> for all the accusations made by Sploitz.com.</p>
    <p><em><small>10:00 PM EST - Spub</small></em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>And so the rumors continue.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.drtwister.com" target="new_page">Dr.
    Twister</a> published a lengthy article on his site today and it is extremely interesting
    so you should definitely take a look at it. I agree with Dr. Twister completely, OSI
    should make a public statement about these files tommorrow.&nbsp; If they are searching
    through our computers for third-party programs, I would like an answer as to why they
    think that they can break the agreement and possibly, the law.<br>
    <strong>WE WANT ANSWERS!</strong></p>
    <p>If the rumors are true, and what they are doing is illegal, then expect the world of UO
    to turn upside-down.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Just in case, if some of you do not think this is a big deal, let me create a situation
    for you.&nbsp; What is a thief broke into your home and went through all your belongings,
    drawers, dressers and fridge and then just left without stealing or disturbing anything,
    is that right?&nbsp; No, of course not.&nbsp; If OSI has snooped through our computers
    (note: I said IF) is it not the same thing?&nbsp; A computer holds a wealth of personal,
    private information. I think it is an invasion of privacy plain and simple.</p>
    <p>I'm following this story very carefully.&nbsp; I hope the answers we want will come
    soon.</p>
    <p><em><small>9:00 PM EST - Spub</small></em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is <strong>Spub</strong> again, <strong>Lomo</strong> sent me those bugs (the
    blacksmith and tailor bugs) so check them out.&nbsp; Also, please send us an e-mail if you
    sent a bug, it was posted (1-2 days ago), <u><strong>CONFIRMED</strong></u>, but you still
    haven't received a Skunk Works account yet.&nbsp; <strong>Do not send messages asking for
    Skunk Works accounts if your bug was never posted or confirmed</strong>.&nbsp; Check out
    the <a href="http://freehosting1.at.webjump.com/sp/sploitz/recent.htm" target="_self">recent
    bugs</a> list to see what's confirmed.</p>
    <p>Next, I would like you to take a look at two pictures I got today.&nbsp; One is a bug
    of <a href="http://freehosting1.at.webjump.com/sp/sploitz/wall.jpg" target="new_page">casting
    paralyze field</a>, but it is invisible. The other is a very <a

    href="http://freehosting1.at.webjump.com/sp/sploitz/covetous.jpg" target="open_page">interesting
    location</a> a player found a rune to.&nbsp; He (or she) says that you can mine on top of
    there, but it is not unlimited (damn).</p>
    <p>Keep an eye on the UOReport files, and send any information in on them to <a

    href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">team1@xsploitz.com</a>.&nbsp; A lot of people are really
    concerned over this situation.&nbsp; Keep sending in those comments!</p>
    <p>Lastly, a report came in the my e-mail today for all UOE and UOP users:<br>
    <em><font color="#000000" size="2">If you use either of these two programs and die in one
    hit, dont call a GM and report it. While GM's cant tell if you are running these programs
    they have added a program that when certain criteria are met your hps will be reduced to
    1pt, but display the normal value. This happened to a friend of mine who at the time was
    using a key from his bank at his house.&nbsp; He was attacked by a player with an excep
    bow and it killed him one hit. They looted his house of what was not secure or locked
    down. So he paged a GM. The GM said your are using 3rd party programs and said his account
    will be banned.&nbsp; Uppon hearing this he quickly changes most of the information on his
    account and logged in with his councelor char(you heard me right), and began asking the
    GMs if there is a way to detect 3rd party program users.&nbsp; Most claimed no but one I
    cannot mention his name said OSI is testing exactly what I stated above.</font></em></p>
    <p><em><font color="#000000" size="2">While I dont know the exact criteria for the gaming
    reading HPs as 1, I do recommend users of UOP and UOE not to page a GM if the one hit
    happens.</font></em></p>
    <p><em><font color="#000000" size="2">-Name Withheld</font></em></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"><big>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; It's much appreciated.</big></font></p>
    <p><em><small>6:00 EST -<a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">Spub</a></small></em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Good morning everyone, this is <strong>Spub</strong>, bringing you today's big update.</p>
    <p>The first order of business is <strong>UOReport0</strong> and now <strong>UOReport1</strong>.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It has been seen in the UO directory, but have you checked you UOE directory
    yet?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's there!&nbsp; Just what in the heck are these files for?&nbsp; On
    reader suspects that Origin could be transmitting information from our computers to
    their's.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the agreement you agreed to, to play UO:<br>
    <em>&quot;You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data through the
    Service from any computer that logs on to the Service using your Master Account.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>If Origin is extracting &quot;hardware system profile data&quot; from our computer then
    they are being extremely low.&nbsp; Somehow checking whether we are using UOE does not
    mean &quot;extracting hardware system profile data.&quot;</p>
    <p>I have no shame in using UOE.&nbsp; I'd rather be a cheater for using fastwalk then
    spend most my time, frozen from lag.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I checked my UOE directory today, and found a new file, UOReport1.&nbsp; What do you
    people think? Is OSI taking information from our computers, or is it our imagination?
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">Send in your thoughts</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    they are in-fact extracting information from our computers, what should we do about it?</p>

    <p><strong>Today's Unconfirmed Bug(s)</strong><ul>
      <li><strong>House Shenanigans (Not a Bug, posted as received)</strong>:<big> </big><font

        color="#000000" size="3">Yeah i know this sounds corny but it works.&nbsp; uo is full of
        dumb people so why not abuse it, i have been.&nbsp; this little thing works pretty well on
        morons, ive been doing it a while and more people fall for it than you would think.&nbsp;
        but find a house that is shared between 2 or more people (just look around for a house
        that has more than one person in it).&nbsp; just go and name your character the same name
        as someone in the house (preferably not the owner).&nbsp; now go back to the house some
        time later wearing some stuff so you dont like a newbie and have your friends hide around
        it kinda.&nbsp; when the owner shows up just pop out and he'll think yer the regular
        friend (say something like it wont let you in) and when go on in and turn around and let
        your buds in and smack that retard (would be good if you can get him to friend you, that
        way you can take secure containers, but ive only been that lucky twice).&nbsp; and if he
        doesnt buy everyone should just attack him for pissing you off.&nbsp; not really a bug in
        programming, but exploitation of someone's ignorance, hope it's helpful.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000"><strong>Thief Bug</strong>: Have you heard of thiefing report on
        UOVault</font> lately?I know how to pull that off, the stealing part tho, not the hiding
        bug. Here's how. When a person is fighting monsters, open his paperdoll and set target on
        his weapon (what I do is try stealing it from distance). Now just wait till he heals
        himself, go near him and use ur steal skill and press last target (need UOE).</li>
      <li><strong>See Housing Insides</strong>:&nbsp; Stack some items 12 high, or whatever the
        limit is, step under it, whabam you can see inside their hosue asif you where a neighbor.</li>
      <li><strong>Blacksmithing Bug</strong>: For all those smiths ought there having trouble I
        found away to increase speed rapidly when you are in the 90's. Evertime you go up .1. I
        found there is some sort of time clock in the game. Log out then log back in you should
        gain .1 as fast as you did the first time repeat this process till gm. You should use a
        lot less ingots and waste a lot less time!</li>
      <li><strong>Tailoring Bug</strong>: Put a sewing kit in a backpack within your pack<br>
        Cross server lines from Area around Destard to area around Shame Kill an animal<br>
        Get the hides</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So people, send in your bugs!&nbsp; You are what makes this site great and keeps it
    running.&nbsp; As an incentive, you are being offered a free Skunk Works account (per
    person) for every bug or tip you submit.<br>
    Please submit your bugs to: <a href="mailto:team1@xsploitz.com">team1@xsploitz.com</a></p>
    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: This tip is great if you want to become a successful thief. This<br>
    little trick using UOX works in and out of town (better out, since no<br>
    guards can be called). Using UOX you have the option &quot;Show incoming<br>
    names&quot; turned ON. You find a potential victim and walk away till he or<br>
    she is off the screen but you can still see their name on the side. Have<br>
    a macro for the steal skill setup and try to steal. It sasy you are to<br>
    far away. So get steal ready again and run right by the person and hit<br>
    F11 when right next to them. This is last target. You steal, or at least<br>
    attempt to, as you run by. Takes a little practice to get timing right<br>
    but works great!</p>
