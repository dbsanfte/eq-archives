   <p>Well it seems UOShack is at it again thinking they are in a contest with 
    us or something, so if you care what I have to say go to the bottom of the 
    page. Keep your eyes peeled for new versions of UOE&amp;UOP OSI installed 
    a new encryption code today. Please, keep on <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/submit.html">sending 
    those bugs!</a></p>
   <p>Enjoy Tonights Updates:</p>

   <P align="LEFT">If you are a UOShack fan, here is some news for you. <font size="4"><b>Don't 
    read this! </b></font>Unless you support the original UOshack with metkorn 
    and his original team. </P>
   <P align="LEFT">UOShack:</P>
   <P align="LEFT">They are now asking for people to buy private accounts. Didn't 
    they criticize me for even allowing people a option close to this? There private 
    section hasn't had a new bug since Metkorn ran the site over two months ago. 
    We can only hope Metkorn can contain these bughouse toddlers who constantly 
    waste space in some sort of a contest with our page. We have no intention 
    in participating in your comparision contest and this will be the <b>ONLY</b> 
    post regarding it.</P>
   <P align="LEFT">Next Hercules bags on me for posting old bugs.... Take a look 
    at the page Hercules you not ONLY post old bugs you copy bugs that have been 
    posted here and are still documented here. At least 4 of the bugs in his yesterdays 
    post had previously appeared on Xsploitz. I'm not even sure how you could 
    know if those bugs even work, UOshack never even tells you.</P>
   
   <p>Now $hocker is just proving that he wants to be in a contest, or wants me 
    to e-mail him begging for mercy. He made fun of Xsploitz claiming we keep 
    bugs for ourselves. Yes, $hocker you got us we love to &quot;steal&quot; peoples 
    bugs and use them for ourselves. Fact I have a <i>HUGE</i> dupe bug I'm saving 
    just so you can steal it from here later. Oh yea what about that GM creator 
    I have several robed GM's a user sent that one in to. Incase you didn't figure 
    it out I was being sarcastic. I would <b>NEVER, NEVER</b> steal bugs and use 
    them for my own purposes. I always post the bugs I feel are postable as soon 
    as possible. With the high volume of e-mail we recieve everyday it is hard 
    to post everyones say but we try our best and we can only try harder.</p>
   <p>My only request is that if you feel that someone with some sense should 
    actually be running UOshack mail <a href="metkorn@uoshack.com">Metkorn</a> 
    who will listen to what you have to say. These fools have been told time and 
    time again they aren't in a contest here, we are both just posting bugs. But 
    time and time again they ignore it even when their own webmaster deletes there 
    posts and has to edit them like little kids.</p>
   <p>Lastly, it would seem that UOshack is threatened by me if they must make 
    a post about me every single day. Well you guys don't need to see this crap 
    if they wanna talk to me e-mail me. This is the only post I will make regarding 
    them on my page and notice I didn't put it where everyone had to read it. 
    UOShack has pointed out some of my mistakes that are true though and the only 
    thing I can do is try to correct them and I will <b>do</b> my best.</p>
