 <p align="LEFT">You can start an apprentice chef, get some raw ribs, and cook 
  them on a campfire. The raw meat will stay in your pack, but cooked ribs appear 
  from nowhere. Cooked ribs sell for 21 gp each, and since you can make 500 of 
  them in a half hour from only one or two raw, you can get rich quick. </p>
