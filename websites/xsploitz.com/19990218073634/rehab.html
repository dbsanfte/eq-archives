<P>     You've said it a hundred times. "It's over. I'm never playing again. I'm cancelling my account tomorrow and I'll be done with UO forever." But you never do it. You simply cannot bring yourself to cancel the account. What is the problem? What is it that keeps you coming back day after day, bug after bug? It's a pain feeling forced to play a game always. It's a pain having an obligation to a <i>game</i>, always feeling as if you're missing opportunities, or as if you're falling behind while you aren't playing. It's about time you restore your life to its fullness. It's about time to <i>break the habit</i>!
<P>     The first step toward breaking the habit is deciding whether or not you are addicted. The deciding factor is not how much time you spend playing UO, but how much time you waste playing UO. Do you often find yourself avoiding other activities outside of UO? When you are participating in some other activity, does UO conquer your thoughts? Do you dream about returning to the game, and catching up with the other all-nighters who, in the last hour, may have gotten ahead of you? These are the signs of an unhealthy addiction, unless:
<ul>
<li>you are new to the game.
<li>you are still enjoying the game.
</ul>
<P>     If you are new to the game (first day to about a month), these feelings are natural. You are going to want to play UO all the time, but you probably aren't addicted yet. If you are still enjoying the game and you are now a mature player, these signs are fine, because you do not want to break the habit. This article is for those that no longer wish to play UO, but are addicted and can't seem to quit.<P>
<center><b>Step #1</b></center>
<P>
     Give away your most prized possessions. You may feel horrible about this. Do it. Give away your house keys, let your horse run free, empty your bank. Once you've given away all your items, what reason have you to play? Sometimes it's easier to let your house get looted than to actually dispose of it. Leave the door open and unlocked, then leave for a day. Enjoy yourself without ever thinking or worrying about the cursed UO.
<center><b>Step #2</b></center>
<P>     Break all personal ties. Leave your guild. Say goodbye. You don't enjoy UO anymore, and your friends should understand this. You can still keep e-mail contact but this isn't suggested. It can sometimes draw a person back into UO.
<P>          Still hesitant about cancelling your account? Try sending a nasty note to OSI, listing all of their many problems. You could start with their lack of support for roleplayers. You could end your nasty note by mentioning the townkill, which is still active today. Another good point are the numerous house break-ins, some of which OSI has deemed legal, because they have no idea how to fix them. Start exploiting bugs, sometimes it is easier to be banned than for you to quit. Remember to send all the bugs you know to Xsploitz, first! 

<P>     Remember why you want to quit. You are addicted to Ultima Online. You want to quit but you don't want to lose such an important part of your life. Think of the alternatives:
<blockquote>
You could try another multi-player role-playing game. <a href="http://www.acvault.com"> Asheron's Call</a> and <a href="http://www.everquest.com"> Everquest</a> look  promising. These games are likely to be just as involved as UO is, but hopefully with better gameplay. For a fun little internet game that has no strings attached, try <a href= "http://www.vie.com">SubSpace</a>. This game can be played anytime you please. If you don't play for a week, or a month, you lose nothing. SubSpace does not require you to do anything except to pay the one-time fee. It is not a commanding game, like you-know-what.
 <P>Some might suggest Diablo by <a href="http://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard</a>, 
  but it'll be a let-down after playing UO. It's not recommended by this author. 
  More recently Starcraft, also by <a href="http://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard</a>.
 
</blockquote>
People shouldn't let highly-addictive games such as UO keep them attached to the computer. It's unhealthy. UO has some of the properties of a narcotic. Delete your account, and replace UO with an innocent internet game such as SubSpace. I, Forsaken, had the highest score in SubSpace during its beta period, but that is beside the point. =]
<P>     Remember, UO is no longer worth the time or the money. One should not let the hoardes of items and riches in UO occupy his mind. You've played UO, you enjoyed UO. You want to be free of this addictive game. Now, let UO go.
