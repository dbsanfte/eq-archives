</div>
<ul>
 <li>Make sure all spelling/grammar is correct! It is a big factor on if your 
  bug is posted or not. Xsploitz has had some <b>BAD</b> experience with bad spelling 
  and grammar.</li>
 <li>Make sure everyone even the biggest idiots could possibly understand your 
  bug. Imagine yourself a <b><i>HUGE </i></b>idiot and you don't even know what 
  &quot;HP&quot; or (Hit Points) means, try to explain everything in detail.</li>
 <li>Be as explicit as possible, if you say &quot;turn left&quot; don't just say 
  that, say &quot;turn left, two steps&quot; be exact in ALL details you give, 
  review the bug once or twice.</li>
 <li>Don't go &quot;I did&quot; this &quot;I did&quot; that, no-one cares what 
  you did. So save Xsploitz some time and write it like your telling someone how 
  to repeat the bug. We don't really like to hear about what you did and didn't 
  do we just want to do the bug ourselves. If you must leave your comments at 
  the bottom and we'll post that also.</li>
 <li>Include ANY screen captured images (or screenshots) that are relevant to 
  the bug and you feel would help people to better understand it! If you do this, 
  you will pretty much be assured a posting on Xsploitz of your bug. Anonymity 
  in your screenshots is a big thing and we'll take care of it for you, please 
  try to keep all screenshots unedited if possible. <b>Please also zip compress 
  all included files!</b></li>
 <li>If you'd like your bug posted exclusively to <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html">Skunk 
  Works</a> please include something saying of your wishes, if Xsploitz sees fit 
  it will only post it to Skunk Works!</li>

    <p>Dear FlameBoy,</p>
    <p>I have this new cool bug for you! What the bug does is help you gain skill 
     in your social life in UO. What you do is...</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Be nice,friendly, and generous to all people.</li>
     <li>Don't hesitate to loan a couple of gold to the local beggar's, your reward 
      comes later.</li>
     <li>Leave the animals alone, they won't help you.</li>
     <li>Try this program called <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> by Mirabillis, 
      it'll help you keep in contact with your new friends.</li>
     <li>Never honestly reveal to someone you cheat, what they don't know won't 
      hurt them.</li>
     <li>Horses will only slow you down in the game of life on UO. Ignore them 
      try buying a new computer. It helps!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Well FlameBoy, thats all I have for you! However I have included a (compressed) 
     screenshot when you get a chance take a look!</p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>Your friend Xsploiter</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Q:</b>Flameboy give me my skunk works account and I'll send you my bug. 
  Its really cool I swear!</li>
 <li><b>A:</b>No, go send it to some other bug page. You send your bug and we'll 
  be the judge if we post it or not. If it is posted then we'll kindly mail you 
  a Skunk Works account. <b>NO</b> bug is ever good enough for one before hand. 
 </li>
 <li><b>Q:</b>YO Flame! I sent you my bug man, why didn't you post it?</li>
 <li><b>A:</b>With 100+ E-mails everyday I cannot post every bug and sometimes 
  unfortunately the best bugs get overlooked.Your best bet is to keep on submitting, 
  your odds are good! Also if the bug is already posted on another page don't 
  expect it to be posted on Xsploitz also.</li>
 <li><b>Q:</b>Flame, you posted my bug and I didn't get a Skunk Works account!</li>
 <li><b>A: </b>Rarely does it occur that this is our fault. The problem is either 
  one of the two. 1)Your e-mail is working incorrectly or you gave us the wrong 
  e-mail and we cannot reach you, which is probably why you didn't get a response 
  to the question either. 2)A different version of the bug you might have also 
  sent in was posted. Sorry, tough luck! </li>
 <li><b>Q: </b>Flame, I just donated money my pin code is XXXX my donation is 
  XX. Make my account!</li>
 <li><b>A: NO!</b> Don't send me this! Send ALL <a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/skunk.html">Skunk 
  Works</a> donation mail to <a href="mailto:service@xsploitz.com">service@xsploitz.com</a> 
  PLEASE!</li>
 <li><b>Q: </b>Flame, you suck my account is banned because of your stupid bug!</li>
 <li><b>A: </b>Who made the choice to use that bug?</li>
 <li><b>Q:</b> Flame, Lets hear some personal info on you.</li>
 <li><b>A: </b>Just an average guy, is that hard to accept? I live a normal life, 
  I have no regrets. I goto work in the day, goto school in the night, I do what 
  I can to update the place.</li>
 <li><b>Q: </b>Flame, Thanks for such a great page. Not many people ever thank 
  you so I hope you'll enjoy this. </li>
 <li><b>A:</b> Thank You! I very much appreciate your personal gratitude towards 
  the page and I will do my best to maintain it in the best I can!</li>

<p><b>Hey all, I'm Johnny B. Buggy! I'm an experienced exploiter who wants to 
 help you out well helping the rest of us out. I'm going to try to explain some 
 main principles of Xsploitz.</b></p>
<ol>
 <li>Xsploitz is not here for Glory,Power,Money, we're here for you. Remember 
  we are a public resource so feel free to contact us at any time.</li>
 <li>Xsploitz does NOT post bugs to online games because we enjoy cheating. We 
  do it because its the only, I repeat ONLY way for bugs to be fixed efficiently. 
  I couldn't think of where games like UO would be today without Xsploitz and 
  pages like it.</li>
 <li>Xsploitz is currently updated by (1) yes that's correct.... 1 person! FlameBoy 
  if you have the personal need to contact him for advice in life do so by e-mailing 
  him at <a href="mailto:flameboy@xsploitz.com">flameboy@xsploitz.com</a> . FlameBoy 
  loves to hear tales of your UO glory and loves to hear stuff about Punk Rock 
  Concerts as well as any new upcoming technology. Please understand Flame always 
  doesn't have the time to read and respond to everything but he'll try his best!</li>
</ol>
<p><b>I hope you better understand what Xsploitz is all about, and if you have 
 any questions for me Johnny B. Buggy that you'd like answered please e-mail them 
 to my best friend <a href="mailto:flameboy@xsploitz.com">flameboy</a>!</b></p>
