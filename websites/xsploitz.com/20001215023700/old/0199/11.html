   <p><i>Jack Handy's thought of the day</i>... If you go parachuting, and your 
    parachute doesn't open, and you friends are all watching you fall, I<br>
    think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming.</p>
   <p><b>Tonights UNCONFIRMED DUPE (and other) Update(s):</b> </p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Dupe:</b> Find a server line map of where the server lines are in Brittania. 
     Look for where lines 1 and 3 intersect (near Orc Fort by Minoc, only 2 that 
     intersect on land). Go to the general area...from here there are 2 tough 
     steps...the first is to find the exact intersection of the lines. To do this 
     walk 1 step at a time north, when weight changes drop a flour sack, the walk 
     east or west depending on where your standing to locate the other (I think 
     1 runs north south, 3 runs east west-all by radar not by screen) A direct 
     line from each sack will show the intersection. To successfully complete 
     this you must walk -diagonally across BOTH server lines at the CORNER where 
     they intersect-. As you pass over the line drop the item, one will be in 
     your pack and one on the other side of the server line. A friend -MUST- retrieve 
     the item because if you walk across the line back and put both items on the 
     same subserver, one or maybe both will be deleted. The timing of when to 
     drop is by far the most difficult, but once you get it its easy to repeat. 
     To dupe multiple items place them in a sack and drop the bag, it will duplicate 
     bag and contents. You -CANNOT- use this to dupe stackables (dont know why 
     it just doesn't work). Good luck with it...</li>
    <li><b>Non-Dupe:</b>1. Get a Bow 2. Equip it. 3. Use a purple potion (was 
     fixed but now works again)</li>
    <li><b>Non-Dupe:</b>How to make a potted x-mas tree! things you need-a barrel 
     and a deed to a christmas tree  Place one barrel on the square you want the 
     potted tree in, next lift up the barrel and walk onto the square it was in. 
     Now drop the barrel 1 square to far away then you can put it so it pops back 
     on you.  Now lock it down, and place the tree. It should be OVER the barrel 
     giving it the "potted tree" look! </li>
    <li><b>Non-Dupe:</b>You can lock down and secure a chest underneath your porch 
     step. This way if you want to macro in your house with another charactor 
     you can just have him use a key to the house in the chest...also...you can 
     instant log on porches of a house you are owner or friend of even without 
     the keys.</li>
