      <p>Tonights first daily bug is how to get mass money on apocolypse shard. 
        Yea that can be fun but it gets boring. The second is how to spawn unlimited 
        monsters from a treasure chest. This is super funny/awesome, a really 
        great bug. The third is the selling cheese wheels bug, back again in full 
        force causing just as much havoc as before. Finaly a rumor on how to cast 
        ele's in town following the upcoming patch!</p>

      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Wait and see what OSI's response is.<br>
        </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>My letter to OSI concerning the subject:</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>UO Support and Designers, </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>I am really disappointed with the recent changes 
        to stealth (currently on Test Center). Stealth was definitely the best 
        skill ever given to rogues, but now, it has basically become useless with 
        the proposed changes. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Come on, you guys are being way to hard on 
        rogues! It's hard enough to make a living as a rogue, but now it's going 
        to be impossible. What do you expect us to do if we are in a crowded dungeon 
        (monsters and players), and need to use stealth to get away from a very 
        nasty dragon? We won't be able to stealth and we'll die. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Though, I can deal with that aspect of stealth 
        by avoiding the situation completely, but the two that are completely 
        outrageous are, &quot;snooping reveals you&quot;, and, &quot;pass through 
        someone while using stealth, reveals you.&quot; </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Shouldn't it be:<br>
        -If you are using stealth and fail to snoop, then you become visible? 
        (Same thing if you're just hidden) </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>-If you're in a building/player house and you 
        pass through someone, then you become unhidden (that would be extremely 
        fair, even I would agree to that) Side-note: To top it off, a player can 
        just use detect hidden and uncover any rogue in their house. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Moves you can take while using stealth are 
        15 (max)</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>-Success rate depends on how many people are 
        within a certain amount of spaces also need to be reduced or just taken 
        out completely. (How will we be able to escape any attacker if that is 
        implemented?)</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>It doesn't make sense to me why you would take 
        this course of action. A rogue needs to be able to defend him/herself 
        and the only way it's possible, is to run like hell and use stealth &amp; 
        hide a lot. The proposed features simply will not work. If the changes 
        go in, the entire rogue class will die. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Mages have meditation, and they're able to 
        pump out an e-bolt every couple of seconds. Fighters have poisoned weapons, 
        which delivers devastating damages. Archers have super, powerful bows 
        and xbows, that allow them to kill a person in seconds without the worry 
        of taking damage. Why do you not let the rogues keep their unique advantages? 
        I think it's only fair. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>The problem is not with the rogues abusing 
        the features, it's that you have never asked us what we would like added 
        into the rogue class. All you did was say, &quot;Here it is, test it.&quot; 
        and a couple days later it was public. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, it's lack of communication. We (rogues) 
        make tons of suggestions on UOVault and COB everyday. I think I speak 
        for every single rogue in UO when I say, &quot;You must reconsider the 
        upcoming rogue changes and take a look at our suggestions.&quot; Take 
        a look at the suggestions made at the beginning of the e-mail, there's 
        three to start you off. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Please pass this along to the applicable person(s) 
        in charge of development. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>I'm looking forward to your response. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Thanks for your time,<br>
        A Concerned Rogue</small></font></p>
