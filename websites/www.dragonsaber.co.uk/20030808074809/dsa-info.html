Who are Dragon Saber Army?<P>
=================================<P>

We are a Guild of EverQuest players, who seek adventure on the Vallon Zek PvP Server.  As a pure dark-team guild we do not involve ourselves with concerns of the other three teams, except to execute them and show them the true power of the Dark Side.<P>

The Guild was created by Lizzerda, an Iksar Necromancer, and whilst originally consisting of Iksars, has now expanded and embraced the darker inhabitants of the other continents.<P>

With around 25 members we vary in level up to low 50s (subject to change ;), altho the majority are 20+ we do not discriminate against younger members.  Quest activity is encouraged and aided where possible, and there are several excellent quests being embarked on by the higher levels in the Guild.<P>

For more information, or to request application to the Guild, simply write your level and class and current whereabouts on the Forum and we'll get back to you ASAP.<P>
