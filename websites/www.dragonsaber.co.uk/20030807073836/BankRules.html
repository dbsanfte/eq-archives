<P>Initially the bank will have stuff donated by players in the
Guild, and as such probably wont be fantastic. The aim is for those
players who arent twinked to both work for the guild by providing the
bread and butter stuff (eg words, runes, pages, and items they've
upgraded from) and obtain items easier to improve stats and generally
strengthen the Dragonsaber Army as a whole. However, for obvious
reasons we cannot just let items go as the system will be abused, so
here goes...it sounds a lot more complicated than it will turn out,
honest! 
</P>
<H4><FONT COLOR="#00ae00"><U>Saving: </U></FONT>
</H4>
<P>All Members begin with Zero credit and therefore donations must be
made to the bank before items are &ldquo;paid&rdquo; for. For the
lowbies, this isnt that hard, including common drops/components like
bone chips/bat wings and other stuff highbies need but cant be
bothered to source. 
</P>
<P>Items placed in the bank will be given the  price agreed by one of
the DSA Bankers, altho will usually be slightly lower than the
current average bazaar price.  The person donating will have his
account credited with the value. Each Official Raid(as organised on
the forum) that is participated in will increase your balance by
50pp, the organising Raid Leader should jot down who turns up and let
me know if I was unavailable during it. Research items
(Words/Runes/Mage Components etc) are worth 5pp each when handed in
this way. 
</P>
<H4><FONT COLOR="#00ae00"><U>Spending: </U></FONT>
</H4>
<P> Thus once you've saved up a little, and u find an item that your
class can use you can &quot;purchase&quot; them and have your account
debited by the current value of the item...how much credit u have
will be shown on this web site.</P>
<H4><FONT COLOR="#00ae00"><U>Notes: </U></FONT>
</H4>
<P>This is NOT intended as a 'freebie' area for beggers or scavengers
but a way of enhancing Dragonsaber Army, allowing us to support our
brethren. As you travel and accumulate items you may pick up things
you cannot use, think about donating them! Nobody expects to find
items worth thousands of pp in here, but in time, as we grow and raid
bigger and better places who knows what u'll be able to find! 
</P>
<P>**No Items will be given to players below level 15. (even alts)** 
</P>
<P>**Casters requiring research components for spells are to be
charged a &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of 5pp ** 
</P>
