<font size="4">The domain name <a href="http://www.feigndeath.com">
www.feigndeath.com</a> has been registered. It will soon point to this site. Of 
course we have to wait until the domain propagates to the world DNS.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A lot of changes have taken place on the message board. Forums 
have been merged, some added some changed. A new LIVE CHAT application has been 
added. I am going to work on it some more, seems to have a couple of strange 
problems but in general it works. The colors are kind of weird, but it beats 
messing with ICQ.</font></p>
<p align="left">A lot of content is being sent in and will be added as quickly 
as I can. Keep up the good work and remember this community can only be what you 
make it.</p>
<p align="left">Help Wanted: I am looking for an assistant webmaster. The 
qualifications are simple. You must have Front Page 2002, and WSTFP. You must be 
willing to work long hours, for no pay. Your only reward will be the 
satisfaction of creating something new. The assistant webmaster will work on 
content. I will continue to do the behind the scenes programming. Interested? PM 
me on the board.</p>

<i><b><font size="5">Sony removes MB from their links.</font></b></i></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="+0"><span class="359183218-03122002"><font size="2" face="Arial">
Nathan Pearce, Director of Web Presence, Sony Online Entertainment made the 
following statement today. </font></span></font></p>
    <div>
      <span class="359183218-03122002"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="359183218-03122002">We've 
      been watching the Monkly Business events closely and we are removing the 
      link.&quot; &quot; I expect several new monk boards to pop up in the coming weeks in 
      reaction to these events, and until one or two are busy and have the 
      'endorsement' of a good portion of the Monk community, we won't be linking 
      to them.&quot;</span></font></div>
<p align="center">
Looks like Sony is cutting all ties to MB. Can anyone really say they did not 
expect this to happen? MB is now officially dead to Sony. It really is a sad 
thing that people actually thought Sony would continue any ties to MB with the 
current sponsorship. What amazes me is people actually believe Sony does not 
care about this sort of thing since as long as an account is paid for, it is 
money on their bottom line. I imagine a lot of people are in for a rude 
awakening regarding this.</p>

<font size="4">Since I have received over 800 emails regarding the creation of a 
new monk web site to replace the now ebayed one I am going to make the changes 
requested by the majority of people who have emailed me in the last 24 hours. 
The overwhelming number of email suggestions want the name changed. There is no 
way for me to know if these are people who support the ebayed monk site or not, 
but since it seems to be the general consensus I am going to change it.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Obviously this site is now under development. 
We will be adding content, information and everything we can think of for the 
monk. We will be looking for board moderators as well. If you are interested in 
becoming part of the creation of a new monk community then contact us at

<p align="center"><font size="4">Originally I was going to use the artwork from 
Zad's monkly-business since it seemed he really did not want to (SELL IT) but 
had to for money reasons, it was done originally in honor of that site, but he 
threw such a fit that along with the suggestions already received, I have 
decided not to use it. Despite the fact that the artwork in question is in the 
public-domain, as well as 99 percent of the material on Zad's site is. The 
messages and the posts regarding this have been removed from the Ez-Board forum, 
probably by the new commercial owner of the site. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">If you are wondering who I am and why I am 
setting this up, here is the story.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">First I am NOT new to EQ. My family plays EQ. 
My wife, my daughter and myself. My brother and sister play EQ. Four of my 
nephews and several cousins play EQ. All total 17 members of my family play EQ. 
My wife and I have 14 accounts between us. My daughter has one. So I am NOT new 
to EQ or to being a monk. My main character is a soon to be 60 wizard (one 
account), a 60 monk, (another account) and a 58 warrior, (another account), yes 
I three box. My wife plays a 61 cleric and a 60 druid, yes, she two-boxes.&nbsp; 
I am co-founder of one of the largest guilds on the Xegony server. I maintain 
the guild website as well as host it. The website this is hosted on is OWNED by 
me. The bandwidth is OWNED by me. So there is no danger of it going away. I am 
retired and probably have way too much time on my hands but my wife and I enjoy 
EQ and love to see the game played as it was meant to be played. We are OLD 
SCHOOL EQ players. Many of you will know what that means, many will not. I am 
setting this up after reading all of the crap about the current situation with 
regard to who paid for the gold community. It is here, it will never be 
commercial, it will never have pop-up's or ads of any kind, and it is ready to 
be built into a new monk community the way it should have been elsewhere. With 
that said I need moderator's and content editors. If you want to become involved 
in the NEW MONK website, then email me at
