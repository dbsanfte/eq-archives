<p><font face="Arial">Twas raining when Mainiac stepped into the mouth of Black burrow,
not that it mattered much being he was a ranger. He was hunting a Gnoll named Slammer he
had tracked from the hills. Slammer had slain a fellow ranger who was recovering thanks to
a necro, the thought of a necro helping was alien to Mainiac but he was thankful.Slammer
had also killed several Bears before fleeing back to BB. Mainiac stopped next to a large
opening to the BB lake and examined the Gnoll tracks and found what he was looking for,
Blood. The last bear Slammer killed to a chunk of his leg and this blood trail was slowly
killing. Mainiac just hoped he would reach him before he expired, he wanted to take his
head before he died. Mainiac kicked through the door and headed up and the down the path
sending two weak skinny Gnolls running for their lives. they ran but for their effort they
only died tired. Mainiac could not let the alarm be raised before he kill Slammer. He
reached the lobby where a pair of Gnolls tried to stop the new intruder. The first Gnoll
tried to spear Mainiac but he dodged and slammed his kite shield under its chin driving
its spiked top through the top of it's head. The other Gnoll turned and fled, Mainiac let
go with a swing of his trusty axe. He followed the blood trail across a bridge the down a
ramp and back under the bridge to an opening. Another Gnoll pacing on a bridge was in the
distance, It was a guardsman who if allowed would bellow an alarm. Drawing his Elm bow he
said a pray to Tunare to guide its tip and released. The arrow was true and Struck the
guardsman in the base of the the neck sending him into the water. The only sound heard was
the splash. Mainiac crossed the bridge and let a Patrolling Guard ove away from the
passage ahead then slipped behind him and took his head with one swipe. He dragged the
body to the cliff at the waters edge and dumped it over. He then gently tossed its head
after its lifeless body. In the water he noticed something and gave himself a mental note.
He proceded down the corridor and found a Gnoll Guard sleeping. He left the guard alone,
leave sleeping guard sleep. Moving past the guard he finds a large door and behind it he
hears gnoll voices. Then he hears the name Slammer, it seems he is being yelled at by
another Gnoll. Shouldering his bow and pulling out a bottle out of his tunic he covers the
hinges with excessive amounts of oil and discards the container. He then draws his
throwing axe and slowly opens the door. The passage move ahead and curves to the right
about 20 feet up is a room on the left and the torch light casts shadows of 2 figures.
Mainiac creeps silently up until he can see in and finds Slammer kneeling in front of a
larger Gnoll who is eating raw meat and yelling full volume at Slammer.Mainiac noticed
another door leading out of the room was closed also. Knowing little of the Gnoll speak he
was only able to grasp the words &quot;idiot, moron and slacker&quot;. Guess everyone was
mad at Slammer today but Mainiac would fix that right now. Stepping into the room Mainiac
placed his throwing axe squarely into the larger Gnolls head which seemed to just annoy
him. Then took a full power swing at Slammers neck, Slammer never felt the blow that
killed him but Tunare's wraith was quenched. The larger Gnoll a Commander pulled the Axe
out and let fall to the ground and smiled. With the speed of a puma he struck knocking the
wind out of Mainiac sending his shield bouncing down the hall. Mainiac using the momentum
from the blow drove his mino axe into the side of the Gnolls neck causing blood to shoot
out onto the wall. As Mainiac gasped for breath the Gnoll clamped one hand on his neck to
slow the flow of blood and kicked Mainiac who was sent spinning into the hallway. Mainiac
spun up to a one knee as the Gnoll Commander charged. The Gnoll Commander raised his fist
to crush Mainiac's skull but before he could Mainiac Struck. Leaping forward he struck the
Gnoll commander square in the chest full force with his Mino Axe. The Axe sunk into the
the Gnolls chest cutting his heart in half killing him before he could react. The Gnolls
body fell on Mainiac covering him in blood. After struggling for several minutes Mainiac
climbed out from under the corpse and retrieved Slammers head from the corner of the room.
He also gathered up the remaining meat, pelts, and the fallen Rangers looted belongings.
He also took the Gnoll commanders scalp, spiked collar and earings as battle prizes. As he
grabbed his shield from hallway he heard a door open and a Gnoll howl. He spun to see a
scawny Gnoll yelling at the top of his lungs. Unable to stop the alarm and having not been
seen yet he bolted down the hall and closed the door he oiled behind him. The sleeping
Gnoll was stirring but not waking yet. He bolted by the sleeping Gnoll and made it to the
bridge outside the passage. Coming across the other bridge and coming towards him were
many torches being carried by alerted Gnolls. Mainiac then jumped from the bridge into the
water and waited. The Gnolls ran in circles for many hours until the Gnolls carried their
commander across the bridge and down a passage by the underground lake. Mainiac retrieved
from the water what he saw earlier and placed it in a large bag. Mainiac dodged two
Guardsman and made it to the surface even tho he was weighed down and made it to QE hills.
Once there he went to the spot he had gathered all Slammers kills and began to dig. It was
twilight when he completed his task, in the whole were the Bodies, meat, and pelts of the
animals Slammer killed and on top Slammers head. Mainiac said a prayer for the animals and
finsihed burying them. He then prayed to Tunare to grant him one request he removed the
lifeless form of a female wood Elf from the large sack. Mainiac prayed to Tunare to
restore her life and not let it have ended in such a dark and vile place. Tunare being
pleased with his actions for her breathed life into the wood Elf's form. Mainiac's heart
soared and he picked up the sleeping Wood Elf and thanked Tunare and with is remaining
strength carried her to SureGlade. Where he fell unconcious....TBC</font></p>
