<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malachi passed me the rabbit, which was finally
  cooked. The smell of it had been driving me absolutely mad. &quot;Here you are. Fit for a
  king!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fit or not, I&#146;m starving,&quot; I
  replied, grabbing the grisly meal from my friend.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had been traveling together for several months
  now, ever since my deathly experience at the hands (claws?) of the horrid gnoll. After
  recovering some of my strength, I had wandered aimlessly, contemplating life and death in
  the lands of Norrath. My new knowledge had changed me a bit, but I could not put a finger
  on how.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point during my travels, I was being
  assaulted by several large snakes and thinking that I would perish again, when along came
  a fellow ranger from behind a tree. He drew his weapon and began his effort to rescue me
  &#150; within a few moments we had beaten back the attackers, but not without wounds.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a half-elf, like myself, and appeared to
  be of stately upbringing. His common speech had more of an elvish lilt than did mine, and
  his words brought to my mind deep green forests and clear, fresh, wandering streams. After
  binding our wounds and recovering from the attack, we shared in a bit of food and drink,
  discussing our backgrounds and destinations. As it turned out, we had just missed each
  other in Surefall Glade &#150; Malachi had been taught by another ranger nearby, and knew
  of my master well. He had even studied with him for a short while after I moved on, and
  planned to one day be his student again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His life as a ranger had been much like mine, so
  far, and he had already been slain once or twice himself. As he discussed it I shuddered;
  thinking back on the episode evoked a chill that shook me to my bones. It was a wonderful
  thing that we had been brought back from the dead, but the whole process left much less
  than a pleasant feeling deep within my heart. It would be avoided at all costs, surely.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also knew the surrounding areas well, but
  longed to see more than Qeynos Hills. We talked of traveling far and wide, riding majestic
  ships across unseen oceans, and delving deep into the dungeons of hell to root out the
  devil himself. The latter of those adventures was usually discussed after a bit too much
  mead, for sure. Waking with aching heads, we would trudge on together; safety in Norrath
  truly did come in numbers. We had little fear in those days, as youths do, and slew many a
  creature that crossed our paths. Most of them would have destroyed each of us alone, but
  our combined might was too much for the simple creatures of the area.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here we sat with a good collection of fruits,
  vegetables, rabbit meat and some water to wash it down with. A warm fire crackled under
  the hazy moon, and we considered our plan of action. A little gold and silver jingled in
  our pockets as well, and we both thought out loud.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I wouldn&#146;t object to heading to the
  city to see what we can see,&quot; Malachi said, glancing at me across the fire.
  &quot;Some simple armor would be appreciated by my aching body!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye,&quot; I replied. &quot;I know exactly
  what you mean. My cloth tunic has served me well these past weeks.&quot; I had purchased
  the tunic about a month ago, with money I had earned from the sale of snake skin, bone
  chips and gnoll pup fur. It had been a busy few months. &quot;Takes the edge off of an axe
  blow, I&#146;ll say.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Doesn&#146;t take much of an edge off,
  I&#146;d wager,&quot; he said, grinning.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hrmm. Suppose not, but it&#146;s better
  than nothing. And not too expensive.&quot; I poked the fire with my walking stick and it
  roared back to life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rangers are able to wear certain types of armor,
  the best of which is chain mail; finely woven links of iron that offer excellent
  protection from blades and missiles. Because of the great amount of work to make such a
  mesh, the armor was prohibitively expensive for beginning adventurers such as the two of
  us. Cloth, or perhaps a piece of leather or two, was about the best we could hope for in
  this stage of our touring lives. Plate armor and the like was right out &#150; it
  interfered with the abilities of the ranger to track and move quietly in the woods, and it
  was astoundingly heavy. I remember holding a simple gauntlet of the stuff at one point in
  my life, and I was amazed that people would go about in suits of it. A fully armored
  knight, though, was a formidable opponent for anyone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed the subject some more and came to
  agreement; we would head to Qeynos in the morning and see what awaited us there. Malachi
  had been outside the city walls before, and that was closer than I had ever come in my
  lifetime. He had been told stories of large bazaars full of cheaply priced items, shops
  full of magical knickknacks, and more food and drink that either of us could shake our
  walking sticks at. After eating gamy rabbit for days on end, we looked forward to a
  comfortable inn and a well-cooked meal. Between us, we had just over 18 gold pieces &#150;
  more than a peasant might make in a lifetime, but that same peasant might not put his or
  her life on the line as we did every day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We put out our fire with some dirt and stretched
  out on our bedrolls. I took a draught of water from my skin, said goodnight to my friend,
  and drifted off to sleep with all the stars of Norrath above me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">***********************************************************</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning came in all its glory, with the bright
  sun rising above the hilltops. Malachi had been up hunting already, and had foraged some
  berries from nearby. &quot;About time you woke up,&quot; he said, smiling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Agh,&quot; I said, shaking the sleep from
  my head. &quot;A bit weary this morning for some reason. Ready for Qeynos?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye,&quot; he replied, and we packed up our
  belonging and headed South along the path.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few hours later, we came within site of the
  vast gray walls of the city, looming high above us. We shaded our eyes from the sun as we
  approached, and this made it much easier to see. Crowds of people, mostly adventurers,
  were gathered just outside the gates camping, talking and resting from their exploits in
  the nearby lands. As we had approached we had seen countless people slaying all sorts of
  creatures just off the road. Snakes, Klicnicks (a type of beetle), and an occasional gnoll
  pup were all milling about for the taking, but Malachi and I passed on by: our eyes and
  minds were focused on the massive, gray stone goal ahead of us: the city of Qeynos.</font></p>
