<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hail all, and well met!&nbsp; I am Valmor, Ranger of
  Surefall Glade and I have a tale or two to tell.&nbsp; Kick your feet up by the campfire,
  gaze up at the stars and share in a mug of this fine ale!&nbsp;&nbsp; For all concerned,
  I'd best start at the beginning of beginnings...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I was born and raised in the area surrounding Surefall Glade, in the
  West Karana plains, not far from the city of Qeynos.&nbsp; The half-elven product of a
  Human father and an Wood Elven mother, I would spend nearly every free moment roaming the
  countryside - not that I had a great deal of spare time. My family worked on a small farm,
  producing wheat shipped to the nearby cities for baking, and most of the my early days
  were spent laboring away, helping to keep my family fed and clothed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In my early teens the land began to call me; I knew that the farming
  life was not for me.&nbsp; I began to train in secret, fashioning a makeshift wooden sword
  from instruments found around the farm.&nbsp; I travelled slowly, examining the earth
  around me, learning how to follow the tracks of the local animals, as well as which plants
  and herbs were safe to eat.&nbsp; Before long I could forage for food and water, and I
  began to think that it would be possible to live off the land like the Rangers that I had
  looked up to for so long.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At sixteen years of age, my destiny was chosen for me.&nbsp; I woke
  in the night to horrible screams and cries, and as my eyes adjusted to the darkness I
  spied a horrible dog-faced creature walking towards me, sneering.&nbsp; It spoke in the
  common tongue with a raspy, hissing voice.&nbsp; &quot;You damned half-elves have spent
  too long on Blackburrow land!&nbsp; Now you will all die!&quot;&nbsp; It followed this
  comment with horrible howl and bark, and lunged at me.&nbsp; In a flash I had whipped my
  wooden sword out from under my cot and scored a lucky hit on the surprised creature,
  taking out its eye!&nbsp; It ran out of the house, yipping, screeching and clutching its
  face, and I scurried about in the darkness trying to find my family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I could see outside through the crude windows of the house, and in
  the moonlight I saw the pack of gnolls heading off into the distance.&nbsp; I realized
  then that the gnoll that was in my room was much smaller than all the others; luckily for
  me, it must have just been a small pup. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Running into my parent's room, I stopped in horror as I saw their
  bodies twisted in horrible, unnatural positions; they had been ruthlessly slaughtered in
  their beds.&nbsp; Lighting a lamp with trembling hands, I saw them bathed in their own
  blood with their blankets soaked in the deep red fluid. A quick look across the hall told
  me much of the same; my brother and sister had been murdered as well.&nbsp; I shot outside
  and saw others outside their homes, cradling dead and wounded family members - it seems
  that the gnolls had come in quite a force.&nbsp; All told, more than fifteen people had
  died and countless others were wounded before the monsters had been driven off.&nbsp; I
  went inside to see my family again, and saw that my father still grasped a bloodied, rusty
  short sword that had belonged to my uncle.&nbsp; It had done him little good, and I
  carefully removed the blade from his hand.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next days were spent grieving over my loved ones, and I buried
  them in the woods nearby the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not trust cemetaries, as they
  recently seemed to be running grounds for groups of the walking dead.&nbsp; The forest was
  as good as any resting place I could think of.&nbsp; I made up my mind - I would train as
  a Ranger in Surefall Glade, if they would have me, and I would exact my vengence upon the
  horrid, murderous gnolls of the Burrow. </font></p>
