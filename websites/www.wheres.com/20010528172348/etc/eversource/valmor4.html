<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gillarian Naelev patted
  me on the back. &quot;You couldn&#146;t quite stay here forever, you know.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had explored every nook
  and cranny of the caves of the glade and learned my basic skills beyond my expectations.
  Now it was time to go.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know, I know.
  It&#146;s simply hard to leave the simplicity of routine. My training seems far from over.
  Do you really think I have the skills I need to go?&quot; As I asked the question, I
  looked hard at my master&#146;s eyes, and found only kindness and caring there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He chuckled softly.
  &quot;Of course, Valmor. What would I gain by sending you away unprepared? You are one of
  my finest students, and I have confidence in you. You need to enhance your skills outside
  of this place now. It&#146;s much different out in the lands. Have confidence in <i>yourself</i>,
  now, son. And remember, you will always be protected.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glanced at him
  quizzically and asked, &quot;What do you mean, protected?&quot; He looked at me, but would
  discuss the question no further. I wondered what this meant for quite some time before it
  became clear to me, and it will become clear to you later in this tale.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood. &quot;Now off
  with you! Are your supplies packed and ready for travel?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye,&quot; I
  replied, glancing at my little bundle of goods. I had few items, but I really had few
  needs at this point. I picked up the canvas satchel, strapped my sword to my belt, and
  shook Gillarian&#146;s hand. &quot;I have to thank you for everything you&#146;ve done for
  me; taking me in, teaching me to love the land.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The love of the
  land was already in you, son, it just needed to be brought to the surface. As for the
  rest, we need more men like you to aid us in our quest, Valmor. The plague on the land is
  growing stronger, with monsters roaming the lands far and wide. It becomes unsafe for
  travelers to walk our roads, and something must be done. The dead walk, and the gnolls are
  an abomination.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not have to tell
  me about unsafe lands; of this I knew plenty. I had never shared the tale of my
  parent&#146;s death with my master, but I did now. I could see deep sadness for me in his
  eyes, and he shook my shoulder hard. &quot;Never forget them, son. They brought you into
  this world and made you what you are. For that, be forever thankful. You are a testament
  to their greatness.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at him, and my
  mind wandered to days past. &quot;Thank you again, my master. I will return soon!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know you will
  &#150; as you learn more on your own, you will return to learn more from me. The process
  never ends; we are always being taught as each day passes us by. Farewell! Farewell!&quot;
  I heard his calls echoing from the small shop in the center of the glade as I strode
  across the bridge over the small fishpond. Looking down I saw several of the creatures
  swimming through the clear, cold waters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hager Sureshot looked in
  my direction as I walked down the path toward the tunnel leading out of the glade.
  &quot;Heading out, Valmor? It&#146;s a wicked world out there, but there is good in the
  land, as well.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked over to the
  archery range where he could be found day after day, the finest marksman in these lands. I
  echoed my master&#146;s words. &quot;Couldn&#146;t stay here forever, could I now?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He chuckled.
  &quot;Sounding more and more like Gillarian every day. Good luck, son. Return to us
  soon!&quot; He drew back the massive bow and fired a perfect shot into the target. Hay and
  parchment flew as the center of the bulls-eye was torn away by the rocketing arrow.
  &quot;Ha! Good tidings for you &#150; a perfect shot!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at this ritual.
  As new rangers left the comparative safety of the glade, Hager shot an arrow for them to
  forecast their success in their new lives. I don&#146;t think any of the rangers took much
  heed of this because Hager never missed, but the gesture brought a smile to my face.
  &quot;Now I can leave with my heart high,&quot; I replied, and continued walking down the
  path, waving.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three minutes later, I
  was through the dimly lit tunnel and out into the Qeynos Hills. It had not been a long
  time that had passed, but it was not short either. My training in the ways of the ranger
  had taken me three years, and I proudly straightened my patchwork guild tunic that would
  let others in the world know of my vocation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun hit me full in
  the face, and I shaded my eyes with my hand. It was a glorious day to be alive. After a
  few deep breaths, I stepped through the entrance, waving a hand to the guards positioned
  by the entrance to the glade. These were some of the fiercest warriors in the land, with
  amazingly strong weapons and armor used to protect the citizens of Norrath. I had heard
  that they could be found, in one form or another, around every densely populated area of
  the lands. The thought was comforting. Their armor creaked and gleamed as they nodded
  their heads in acknowledgement of my passing. Gillarian had told me many times that if I
  ever found myself in a difficult predicament, to run for a guard tower or to one of the
  wandering guards. &quot;They will fight like crazed animals to protect you, Valmor,&quot;
  he said. &quot;They are a boon of the land, and do not be afraid to use them.&quot; I
  wonder if he expected me to use them as many times as I did!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small fire was burning
  near the entrance, and I watched as several adventurers cooked what looked like rabbit
  over the flames. It was good, I realized, to do this within sight of the guards. The smell
  of the cooking meat was sure to attract visitors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked south down the
  road, and was amazed at the large numbers of bats, snakes and rats that ran about
  unchecked over the land, and I remembered the words of my master. &quot;Remember Valmor,
  keeping the population of these beasts under control is also the work of the rangers.
  Unchecked, they would spread like fire over the lands and strip the green earth of all her
  color.&quot; There were a great number of rangers in the area, doing just that &#150;
  keeping the population of these beasts in check. Also, I remembered seeing various bits
  and pieces of these creatures for sale in shops in the glade; rat whiskers, bat wings,
  snake scales. &quot;No time like the present,&quot; I said to myself, and strode off the
  path.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn&#146;t take me
  long to find what I was seeking. A rat the size of a small dog charged out of the side of
  the hill towards me with rage in its eyes! I instinctively took a step backward as the
  murderous creature rushed me, and drew my blade from its worn leather sheath. My heart
  raced as the rat attacked me, and I had to quickly move my feet and legs for fear of
  getting bitten; but get bitten I did. The rat was much tougher than I had ever expected,
  and I was wounded several times before the last breath of life came out of the creature.
  But I had won, and was elated! I knew that rat whiskers were valuable for various types of
  fishing lures and useful for some magic, so I stripped them from the animal and then
  skinned it. My proficiency at skinning was never very high, and without a proper knife I
  made quite a mess of things very rapidly. I didn&#146;t know if rat meat was useful for
  anything, but figured it would do in a pinch, so I took what I could and discarded the
  rest. I was taught to always use everything I possibly could from a kill, and I had
  resolved early on to follow these teachings closely.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bat was my next quarry,
  which proved to be quite a bit more challenging with it flapping its disgusting, leathery
  wings in my face during the whole battle. Eventually it went the same way as the rat, with
  me taking the wings from the creature to see if they indeed did have some value to
  someone. There was a considerable amount of rest required between all of these battles;
  wounds were washed and bound to prevent disease, weapons cleaned, and garments repaired if
  they were terribly torn. That pesky rat had torn a decent sized hole in my cloth pants
  already; not that they were much to speak of to begin with. Luckily, I won&#146;t be
  attending any balls at the palace anytime soon, I chuckled softly to myself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how I carried on
  for days and weeks, slaying hosts of rats and bats, building up my skills with my blade
  against real enemies, rather than the weapons of my master. The style of fighting was
  totally different out in the wilderness, of course, and I learned a great deal in a short
  period of time. At night I sometimes wandered back to the relative security of the
  campfire outside the entrance to the glade, and other times I spent the night in the wild,
  sleeping in a tree for safety. Death came knocking at my door on more than one occasion,
  when groups of these creatures overwhelmed me. I would perhaps be attacking one rat with
  complete confidence in my success, when one or two more would come from around the trees
  to the aid of their wounded companion. Many times I ran away to escape, or was saved by
  other adventurers. I found the lands to be an extremely friendly place, where people help
  one another all the time. I have been magically healed countless times in the wild by
  wandering clerics and druids, who will just use their magic to help their fellow man, and
  require nothing in return. Also, if I am in dire straits with a particular creature, a
  shout for help will sometimes bring assistance. Finally, the guards are an excellent last
  resort. Hunting in areas in close proximity to a tower is an added bit of insurance when
  beginning one&#146;s travels.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wandering through
  the Qeynos Hills on one fine evening, looking for a suitable place to set up my camp for
  the night, when I heard a strange noise coming from around a small gathering of trees. I
  hadn&#146;t taken out a rat in quite some time, and looked forward to a small skirmish
  with anticipation. I sneaked up by the trees as quietly as possible, pressing up against a
  rather large one when I got close enough. Peering around the side of the large oak, my
  breath escaped in a small hiss as my mark was found. A gnoll pup stood munching on what
  appeared to be the remains of a small snake that it must have slain earlier. The creature
  whirled around, hearing my harsh breath and threw the snake to the ground harshly. Fury
  and rage came bellowing forth from me as I whipped my sword from my belt and screamed,
  &quot;For my family!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We charged at each other
  with the pup clawing and biting like that day from years gone by, but this time was
  different. I was armed with a real sword, and was a much better fighter than I was as a
  child. I slashed wickedly with my blade, nearly severing the monster&#146;s arm from its
  body. It howled in pain as thick, dark blood sprayed us both, and it redoubled its efforts
  to murder me. With a cunning jerk of its head, the gnoll bypassed my defenses and latched
  onto my right leg with its strong, powerful jaws. Resisting the urge to cry out, I brought
  the hilt of my sword down on the beast&#146;s skull, which shattered with a might crack.
  The gnoll&#146;s eyes rolled over in its head and it convulsed as it died, still latched
  onto my leg, which was now bleeding quite profusely.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detaching the monster was
  no simple task, and I ended up having to pry its jaws off of my leg with my short sword,
  causing me quite a bit more pain and making me see stars. Sweat poured down my face as a
  tried to clean the wound with a little water from my water-skin, and then I heard the snap
  of a twig behind me. Goose bumps sprang instantly all over my body and I whirled around,
  losing my balance slightly because of my wounded leg. I looked into the face of a huge
  adult gnoll, its teeth bared as it let out a low, menacing growl. Although I had seen them
  before, they were still terrifyingly bizarre to behold. It was almost as if a man and a
  wolf had been combined in some horrific experiment, but without a doubt the strangest part
  was the face. It wasn&#146;t as if a dog or wolf was looking at you, although it may have
  appeared that way from a distance. What stared at you was the intelligent gaze of a man. A
  man intent on ripping your head from your shoulders.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of its claw-like
  hands was a huge club with broken pieces of sword jammed through the wood to make a
  devastating weapon. I gasped as it ran towards me, and I drew my blade in defense. The
  battle was short; in my wounded state I could not even run from this menace, and it slew
  me horribly, cracking the club against my skull as I fell. The last thing I remember was
  seeing its horrid face and feeling its hot breath on my neck as it bent down to tear out
  my throat with its jaws, and then all was dark.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke in a dream-like
  state, feeling very weak. My master was there, smiling down at me. &quot;Where am I? What
  happened to the gnoll, master? Did you slay it and save my life?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, Valmor. You
  have been murdered by your enemies, and are in a kind of &#145;twilight&#146; area between
  life and death. I had told you that you would be protected, always. Do you remember?&quot;
  Gillarian placed a wet cloth on my head.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, I remember.
  But how can this be? I do not understand. Are my parents alive somewhere like this?&quot;
  I started to get up.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed me back down
  gently. &quot;No, child. Those that can be saved this way must have given their lives to a
  guild like that of the rangers. Part of this membership is that your life is in the hands
  of your guildmaster and the deities that watch over and protect us. We have a pact with
  the gods that allows us to save our children when they are slain, and restore their
  spirits to their bodies. In return, we do their bidding and further their cause in the
  lands of Norrath. You have been restored in this fashion, my son.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at him,
  open-mouthed. &quot;No death? How can this be?&quot; My mind raced. &quot;No consequences?
  We could sent hundreds of rangers after the poachers with no risk!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah, but there are
  consequences, besides abusing the gift of the gods. Forgetfulness, Valmor. Do you feel
  strange at all? Like you are only a part of what you once were?&quot; Gillarian looked at
  me intently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not really, master.
  I actually feel much like I did before being slain,&quot; I replied.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah, that is because
  you are young and inexperienced. As time goes on and you grow older, if you are slain you
  will forget part of your teachings and the experiences of life that you have had in the
  past. It will take time to restore that damage that is done by the shock of death,&quot;
  he said, grimacing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to stand.
  &quot;What happens now?&quot; I asked. I had no belongings left, and my uncle&#146;s sword
  was still in my dead hand, if the gnoll hadn&#146;t run off with it. My master read my
  thoughts in my face.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You can recover
  your items, Valmor, if you can reach your body. You do not have long to get back to it
  before it vanishes, so you must make haste! You are bound to the area of the Qeynos Hills,
  just outside the entrance to the glade.&quot; Gillarian stood up and backed away from me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bound? What do you
  mean?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It means that once
  your spirit has been recovered and you have seen me like this, you will be placed back
  into a body again, which is nothing more than a vessel for your spirit. You will then be
  transported to the spot where your spirit has been bound by the gods. For you, this is
  just outside the glade. Some workers of magic can change the place you have been bound to,
  if you so desire,&quot; he replied.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But&#133;&quot; I
  stammered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah ah, no more
  questions,&quot; he said. &quot;Off with you once again!&quot; He waved his hands, and my
  head swam causing me to lose consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came to, I was
  amazed at what I saw. I was standing right next to the fire outside of the entrance to
  Surefall Glade, just as my master said it would be. I felt like an apparition, but others
  hailed me just as if I had never died. I looked at my hands and feet, and pinched myself
  roughly. Sure enough, it was true &#150; I was reborn. Remembering Gillarian&#146;s words
  about haste, I rushed off towards the spot where the gnoll slew me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hours later, I was
  there by the little row of trees where I had met my demise. There was no sign of the
  gnoll, so I came around the corner and shuddered when my eyes found what they were looking
  for. I don&#146;t really know what I expected to see - my items sitting in a bloody heap
  on the ground? But there in full view was my former body, broken and torn, bleeding all
  over from the thrashing that the gnoll had dealt me. My throat was torn out, and the
  spiked club had done a massive amount of damage to the side of my head. I swallowed hard.
  It took me five minutes before I could even move towards the corpse, but finally I was
  able to bend down and remove my equipment from my lifeless body. When the last item had
  been taken, the corpse vanished! The gods had reclaimed it, I believe, and allowed me to
  carry on with my life. I got as far away from the spot as I could before exhaustion took
  me over, and I crashed to the ground and fell into a deep, deep sleep.</font></p>
