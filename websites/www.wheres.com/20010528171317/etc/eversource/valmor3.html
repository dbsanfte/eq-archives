<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">My early days in and around Surefall Glade were exactly
  what I needed at that time in my life. After making the appropriate queries in the small
  village, I discovered the information that I was seeking - whom to speak with to begin my
  training. The man I sought was the guildmaster for the Ranger clan in the area, and he was
  called Gillarian Naelev. I found him in a small shop in the center of the glade, and he
  was an imposing, inspiring figure. He was a tall man with dark hair and beard, dressed in
  a mail shirt and bracers, and he wielded a massive bow. We spoke for a time, sharing mead
  and a fire, and he told me of the ways of the Rangers and asked if that was the life I
  wanted to lead. I nodded quickly and told him that it was the life that I had been called
  for, and he accepted me into the fold right away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Gillarian knew that there was a trouble in the land, and that foul
  beasts walked the earth both in their own guise as well as in the visages of men. Even
  closer to home for him (and now, I) were the troubles of the glade itself; as there were a
  great number of poachers milling about in the caves of Surefall, wreaking havoc and death.
  Not all of the poachers were men, either. Gnolls from the evil pit Blackburrow would skulk
  about, trespassing in the bear caves, attempting to liberate a pelt or two from their
  rightful owners to make armor or sell on the black market for a few pieces of gold. But
  dealing with dangerous issues such as these were not for a young, fledgling Ranger, my
  master informed me. The poachers in the area were strong; too strong for anyone without
  much experience in the ways of battle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">All of my time was spent learning and building on the various skills
  that would serve me in the wilderness. I learned to fight with a variety of weapons;
  sword, axe, bardiche, and bow, as well as defend myself with armor and shield. Numerous
  were the days that I left Gillarian's training rooms cut and bruised from a particularly
  informative session of sparring with my weapons masters. My arms and shoulders would ache,
  sweat would pour down my face and into my nicks and cuts, and the training would continue
  when I couldn't bear the thought of raising my hand for another strike. But fight on I
  did.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Battle was a large part of my lessons, as a strong sword hand is a
  wonderful companion out in the wild, but it was not the only skill that was considered of
  import to these men and women of the glade. Foraging for food and water had always seemed
  like a simple thing to me, but my abilities were honed to a fine point in this area, and I
  could not believe the tricks I was shown for accomplishing this end. Once they were
  explained, they seemed to come naturally. I had, like most youngsters, already learned how
  to fish, and this turned from a humble pastime into a method of survival when faced with
  starvation in hostile lands. Fresh, healthy catches could also be sold for a few silver
  pieces if the need for some currency came to pass, and occasionally I would catch
  something unexpected!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">By far, though, one of the most important skills taught to the
  Ranger is the tracking of man and beast. In this I excelled, to the great pride of my
  instructors. I found the craft extremely interesting and challenging, and felt a great
  charge of excitement when the creature that I had been stalking for hours suddenly came
  into view over a hill of through a copse of trees. Every small clue had to be applied;
  faint prints in the dirt, snapped tree branches that had captured a tiny tuft of fur or
  feather, bent or broken grasses, droppings, or even wild, chilling calls in the night. It
  is told that very experienced Rangers could catch a faint smell of their quarry at amazing
  distances and track using only this sense and no other, but I have never seen that in
  practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Eventually, magic plays a small role in the life of every Ranger.
  The men and women of the glade learned these arts long ago from the Druids that also
  occupy the area. The Druids believed that they could further their cause in the protection
  of the land by teaching some of their beliefs to a group of select warriors, and thus the
  Rangers were born. Inexperienced Rangers do not speak often of magic, but after a time
  spells and cantrips are shown to us by those of our clan who have developed an affinity
  for the arcane. Most of the magic that we learn has something to do with our natural
  background, or travelling in the wild.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">It should be said now the lives of Rangers and Druids differ
  greatly. Forsooth, there are many similarities - love of the lands and beasts, a feeling
  of connection with nature, and skills in the wild that surpass that of an ordinary warrior
  or magician. However, there are great differences. Druids are at one with all of nature,
  and this includes both the flora and fauna - they gods to which they pray teach of
  protection of all on this earth. They are given great powers of magic, and control over
  the forces of nature to accomplish these ends.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Rangers, while respecting and believing in many of these ideals, are
  different. They love nature, and do their part to protect it as well, but they are at
  their core, hunters. They track their prey, and will slay animals and beasts where there
  is a need. Rangers will kill for food, clothing, and shelter; but woe be it to the vermin
  that kills the gracious animals of the land simply for sport, and leaves their rotting
  carcasses and pelts to the carrion birds, worms and flies. Many poachers have been slain
  by the Rangers and Druids of this land, simply for carrying pelts of bear through the
  wrong parts of the world, where such creatures are protected and revered. To this day, I
  have never laid hand on wolf or bear, and I never shall.</font></p>
