One day While On the Boat From Freeport to Felwithe, I took a stop on the Sisterhood Isle( the first stop the boat takes.) Then i ran around the island for a while and it was pretty boring. Then dead West i saw an island. I jumped in the nearest Paddleboat( stand on one, and Right Click it ), and I took off. Nearing the Island I saw an Ogre( Boog Mudtoe ) that conned red( i was a level 11 High Elf Magician ). I surpassed him and landed far off to the left of the island. Running around was a chic named Tregea Prendyn ( i think thats the spelling ) but I couldn't hail her because she kept running. I then ventured up to the middle of the Island and found a large stone structure with a High Elf Merchant inside. Esseryl..( or something ) and she sells some of the rare Magician spells. I left the structure, and scouted the rest of the island. Then once again, another island was straight west. So i paddled there. I landed and this place was swarming with Sea Fury Cyclopses( Huge! like Hill Giants, and can see invisible! ) I avoided them and walked around the island, then I saw a group of 4 unique NPC's. [Wittin Windmaker - Half Elf] [Tono BinLittle - Gnome] [Dixl Drool - Dark Elf] [Gornit - Cyclopes] they all conned red, and wanted to kill me. I don't know what they were there for, but one day I will return and find out!
<p><i>Allizewsaur</i> - submitted by <a href="mailto:RapidBurn@aol.com">RapidBurn@aol.com</a>
<br> 
Ok as a lvl 9 Dark Elf Wizard I would hav a LOT of trouble traveling from 
Freeport to ButcherBlock, resulting in multiple deaths between the 2 stops 
(I'm Killed on Sight by the NPCs in the Ocean Of Tears). I too have been to 
Gornit's Island, but I saw a Huge Giant with a VERY large sword who would run 
around and run OUT into the water! Considering I was in the water when he did 
this, it scared the %#^% outta me. But I also saw something 
else........Seeing an island into the distance I leapt off the boat and swam 
to it. I ran around the coast looking for a dock and avoiding th aqua 
goblins which conned red, even to my lvl 15 ranger. After circling the 
island twice and realizing there was no dock, I decided to think out my 
strategy. All of a sudden I saw a MONSTROUS lizard who walked on 2 feet 
(didn't really look like Godzilla by being green, but the basic form of Tokyo 
Mauler). It was an "Allizewsaur," a very mean mofo. So i started a lvl 1 
Dwarf Warrior and went to the island and followed him (the island has like a 
little rune on top that he guards) and finally he saw me and hit me for 176 
pts of dmg!!! If anyone knows anything about this insane creature please tell 
me 
<p><i>Teebor NPC</i> - Submitted by R.A.
<br>I encountered an NPC lvl 8 barbarian named Teebor in Blackburrow a few 
weeks ago. At first he seemed like a player but then i realized he was 
walking, not running, around the entire zone. While I was busy fighting 
a Gnoll Commander, he barged into the room with 3 gnoll regulars 
attacking him, he said "Help" and I proceeded to "help" the unlucky NPC. 
After dispatching the gnolls i went on my merry way but to my surprise 
I visited the place where Teebor was then I saw his corpse lying on the 
ground. I forgot the whole Teebor issue when I saw him walking in 
Highpass and made me smile a little, wondering what orc would get the 
chance to whupp him up real bad and me saving him all over again =)
