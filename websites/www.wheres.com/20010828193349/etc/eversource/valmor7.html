<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrance to the Qeynos aqueduct brought with it a
  certain amount of difficulty. Malachi and I were told by several &#147;reliable&#148;
  sources that we would be able to access the area by taking a quick dive in any of the
  various pools spread throughout the city. Swimming in these areas was not looked upon as a
  worthwhile activity by the guards, however, so we elected to make our first attempt under
  the cover of the Norrathian darkness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the pool nearby the Qeynos bank looked
  the most hospitable (which meant that it had the thinnest layer of green slime atop it),
  this was going to be our first target. We were equipped as lightly as possible to
  facilitate our ease in swimming, but we guessed that our weapons and the light pieces of
  armor we wore would make the going difficult. Arriving in the dank tunnels uninformed and
  unarmed, however, seemed a far worse alternative than a tough swim &#150; and that issue
  was a difficult one to debate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great stroke of luck for me that my
  companion carried a lesser lightstone; a small, round gem that cast a very useful glow
  when uncovered. The adventurers of Norrath used them everywhere, prying them from the
  corpses of slain willowisps all over the lands. We really had no idea how our infravision
  would operate in such a place, as we had very little information as to lighting sources
  below. It was good to have a viable backup in the stone. Also, the lightstone would prove
  irreplaceable while trying to navigate the dark waters into which we were about to plunge.
  We had only rumors of how long we needed to hold our breath before emerging in the tunnels
  below, and taking a wrong turn somewhere would prove fatal. We could only hope that the
  information we had been given was true.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Let me go ahead,&#148; I said. &#147;I can
  hold my breath for a decent period. I&#146;ll take a look at what&#146;s around, and then
  return and get you. There&#146;s no need for both of us to be flailing around down there
  the first time.&#148; My words were no more than whispers, and we spoke tucked in an
  alley, avoiding the moonlight.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Aye, if you wish,&#148; Malachi replied. He
  did not seem at all disappointed with my offer, and he handed me the covered lightstone
  carefully. We both glanced around as we exchanged the item, as if we were partaking in
  some illegal transaction. &#147;Godspeed, Valmor,&#148; my friend said seriously.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lowered myself into the dark water slowly, with
  nary a sound. Our daytime scouting of the pool had shown us that there was a passage that
  shot almost straight towards the center of the earth to one side of the wretched pool. The
  passage had looked very intimidating even in the daylight; that was one benefit of
  traveling by night, I supposed. The water was fairly cool, but not terribly so &#150; I
  believe the chill of my fear brought the temperature down a few degrees that night.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Wait,&#148; Malachi hissed softly.
  &#147;Guard!&#148; With nowhere else to hide, he slipped into the dark pool beside me and
  we did our very best to hide ourselves, keeping mostly submerged in the water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city guard came into view, the polished
  plates of his armor shining in the combination of the moonlight and rays cast by street
  lanterns. He seemed almost as an apparition as he strode slowly towards us, mail clinking
  and clanking with each approaching stride. I could not make out his face, but his helmet
  swung round in circles as he surveyed the area. My heart caught in my throat as his head
  stopped with him looking directly towards us, and a rippling shudder passed through me as
  his right hand slid down towards the blade at his belt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Halt! In the name of Antonius Bayle,&#148;
  he bellowed as he whipped the sword from its sheath with a schiiiiing. Without any
  hesitation, he began to move quickly towards us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind was reeling with possibilities on what we
  should do &#150; run? swim? surrender? I was trying to make up my mind as quickly as I
  could when Malachi shoved me back to my senses.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Go! Now!&#148; he said softly, but with
  considerable emphasis that the command should be carried out immediately and without
  perceivable delay. I took as deep a breath as my frightened lungs would let me, and
  submerged into the inky blackness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first prayer as I dove downwards was that the
  guard would not enter the pool with all of that plate armor on his back, but this thought
  passed from my mind as the terror of being underwater in the dark sank deeply into my
  psyche. I quickly uncovered the lightstone with quivering hands and was rewarded with a
  full view of the passage downwards. I was so relieved to have my vision back that the
  stone slipped from my hands carelessly. Cursing myself, I swam as quickly as I could after
  it, and managed to almost keep up as the stone hit the bottom of the tunnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So disoriented was I that I could not even think
  of what had happened to my friend, but I knew something was back there, as my feet were
  kicking something as I swam.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grabbed the lightstone from the bottom and we
  swam on and on, horizontally now as the passage had turned. I realized that I was now past
  the point of no return &#150; I would die before I could go back the way we came, and my
  body would rot within the watery tunnels of the city. This was one of the more pleasant
  thoughts that passed through my mind during this experience. As I began to lose hope, the
  passage angled gently upwards and my pace increased with the anticipation of fresh air
  greeting my lungs. Within a few seconds, I broke the surface, gasping and sucking in a
  welcome combination of water and air &#150; at this point any air was better than what
  could have been. Malachi arrived right behind my, and I could see him grinning broadly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Kill the light,&#148; he whispered.
  &#147;And don&#146;t kick me in the face any more.&#148; I took a quick look at my
  surroundings and covered the magical stone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a dim light being given off by some
  sort of mossy growth throughout the place, and it seemed to be present on most of the
  stone walls that we could see from our vantage point in the pool. All looked clear, so I
  pulled myself out of the water and helped Malachi do the same. We shook off as much water
  as we could and looked around carefully.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tunnels were all cut from the rock beneath
  the city, and were amazingly well preserved considering the amount of time they had been
  here. The walls were smooth and covered with both the mossy residue, as well as a slick
  layer of water and slime. We were in a large chamber, the entrance pool taking up a large
  portion of one corner of the room, and there were many passages leading outwards in a
  confusing choice of options. My spirits dropped as I considered the odds of keeping from
  getting lost.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Who&#146;s idea was this again?&#148;
  Malachi asked, fixing me with his dripping gaze.</font></p>
