<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We strode through the city gates, and I was
  amazed at the sheer number and variety of folk that wandered through the streets and lanes
  of Qeynos. I often found myself closing my gaping jaw when seeing someone (or something)
  particularly extraordinary. Malachi chuckled just as frequently, having a hard time
  understanding my wonder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Really, Valmor &#150; you must learn to
  close your mouth,&quot; he said with a smirk. &quot;It appears you&#146;re trying to catch
  flies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My jaw snapped shut. &quot;Aye,&quot; I replied.
  &quot;I just had no idea there were so many different types of people in the lands. Humans
  and half elves are all I&#146;ve ever seen &#150; I didn&#146;t have the upbringing you
  did.&quot; I stopped speaking as a particularly strange fellow passed me by.
  &quot;Malachi,&quot; I whispered. &quot;Do you see that man over there?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced in the direction I indicated with my
  chin. &quot;Aye,&quot; he said softly with a lingering hiss of breath. &quot;&#146;Tis a
  Drow, or dark elf, disguised very well. You see his image shimmering? It is some
  enchantment to hide his true form.&quot; Almost as if the dark one had heard us, his image
  changed completely and he blended into the crowd. We immediately lost sight of him.
  &quot;Blast,&quot; Malachi cursed. &quot;Watch your back, friend, or you might find a
  knife in it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;From where do such come,&quot; I asked,
  walking along briskly while looking over my shoulder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not far from here &#150; Neriak, to the
  north. I have never seen the city, but I hear it is a hive of villainy. Shadow knights,
  necromancers and dark clerics of the worst reputation inhabit the city, and some say the
  sun never rises within its walls.&quot; Malachi also glanced around carefully, his eyes
  narrow slits as he concentrated on each passerby. &quot;We would do well to stay far from
  such a place.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye, well spoken,&quot; I said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short distance inside the city, we came to a
  building labeled Crow&#146;s Pub and Casino. Fancying a drink and perhaps a meal, we
  stepped through the doors into the smoke filled interior of the place. &quot;An ale would
  hit the spot mightily,&quot; I said, although no such words needed to be spoken.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sat at an empty table close to the long, oaken
  bar and drank several of the warm, delicious beverages down, washing the road dust
  completely from our memories. It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn&#146;t long before we were feeling
  little pain, and we laughed, sang, and cheered with the crowd at the various gaming tables
  &#150; though neither of us partook in the games ourselves. We had no coin to spare, which
  didn&#146;t seem to stop some of the poorer looking folk from wagering all they could.
  Some fared better than others, but it always seemed that the casino fared best of all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hours passed quickly, and as we stumbled out
  of the place the sun had begun to set and the shadows lengthened. &quot;How long were we
  in there,&quot; I asked my teetering friend while rubbing my eyes with my fingers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Too long,&quot; he smiled toothily.
  &quot;Now we need an inn, or I shall surely fall asleep right here in the street!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After walking down the same alleys at least for
  or five times, we finally had to break down and ask a city guard where the nearest inn
  was. Qeynos is a very confusing city, to say the least, and getting lost became a bad (but
  frequent) habit for us. We headed southeast towards the docks as we had been directed, and
  it wasn&#146;t long before the Lion&#146;s Mane Inn and Tavern loomed before us. Lanterns
  were being lit on the outside of the inn, and the innkeeper hailed us with a smile as we
  entered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a warm and friendly place, with many
  people filling out the tavern tables and stools. The smell of warm bread freshly baked
  overwhelmed the senses; we realized that we hadn&#146;t eaten all day. Without ceremony,
  we devoured a large loaf and some roast chicken. My head started to ache with the sight of
  ale passing us by, so we paid for our meal and adjourned to the cheapest room we could
  rent in the place. We drew straws for the bed and the luck was with him; I got the hard
  floor that evening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ***********************************************************</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning came early, and we rose with clouded
  heads but happy memories. We were afforded a basin of brackish water with which to clean
  our hands and faces, and when we finished with it, it was passed to the next room for
  their use. After a quick breakfast of a bit of sausage and hard rolls, we continued our
  exploration of the massive city. It was a glorious morning, full of bright sunshine &#150;
  completely enjoyable once our heads cleared. And clear they did, with the first full
  breath of the fine salt air from the docks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah! Smell the sea, Valmor. Isn&#146;t it
  magnificent? Look! A ship approaches!&quot; Malachi walked quickly towards the docks and
  watched the vessel enter the harbor. I was amazed yet again, as I had never seen a ship
  before. &quot;Come! Perhaps we can set foot on her before she leaves.&quot; I shuddered,
  but followed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where does this ship go,&quot; I asked a
  deck hand as I strode majestically on board. Hopefully, no one would see my quaking legs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Erudin, sire. Isle of the mages,&quot; he
  replied while tying a firm knot in a frayed rope connected to something I was very sure
  was important. &quot;Have ye been?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. &quot;No, I have never traveled
  across the water.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah, yer missing a great trip, sire. You
  should venture out onboard one day,&quot; he said, waving his free hand across the deck.
  &quot;She&#146;s a fine vessel, eh?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Indeed. Perhaps I shall go someday, but not
  today, friend.&quot; I smiled at him and waved as we strode off. I was happy to place my
  feet on the firm land again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wandered for most of the day through the
  various marketplaces, looking for things that we could afford. Hucksters called from small
  canvas lean-tos, trying to get your business any way they could. Most shouted the types of
  items they were selling with an inflated price, while others cursed their competition
  outright: &quot;Why would you buy from Engert? He&#146;s without a doubt the WORST tailor
  I&#146;ve ever seen! This garment would suit you far better, at half the price!&quot; Most
  of it seemed harmless enough, but we were sure a bout of fisticuffs would break out at
  least once.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some serious bartering (or what we
  considered serious), we each bought a few pieces of patchwork armor, taking the time to
  get the fit just right; it wouldn&#146;t do to be wearing poorly fitted stuff for days on
  end. After our shopping spree was completed we were pretty well spent, in more than one
  sense. We had just enough coin left to feed and house ourselves for another night, and
  perhaps enough left over for another ale or two. Provisions would not a problem for us
  &#150; the land would provide what we needed once we left the city. We were just splurging
  now; tasting a bit of the good life before we hit the road again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We returned to the Lion&#146;s Mane and seated
  ourselves at the bar for a cheap dinner. The bartender approached us and took our order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is the word on the street,
  friend,&quot; Malachi asked of the tavern master while pushing a few coppers his way.
  &quot;Anything interesting happening here in Qeynos?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our new friend slid the coppers across the bar
  into his other open palm with a jingle. &quot;Aye, perhaps, perhaps.&quot; He paused for
  effect, while looking around carefully. &quot;Let me see to your dinners, and then
  we&#146;ll have a chat.&quot; With that, he strode off towards the kitchen.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were served a bit of lamb, blackened almost
  beyond recognition, and some potatoes that could use a few more minutes in the pot &#150;
  but we were satisfied. Our bellies full, we sighed happily and waited for our friend to
  return. Our patience was rewarded, as he finished with another customer and returned to
  us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have ye been into the aqueducts,&quot; he
  asked, polishing his bar casually.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nay, sir. What of them?&quot; I pricked up
  my ears and listened intently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;From what I hears from me sources,
  there&#146;s a lot of smuggling going on in the underbelly of the city. Illegal trade,
  possibly slaves as well. Constables don&#146;t seem to concerned with the whole thing, as
  well. Very strange.&quot; He took our empty glasses and refilled them without hesitation.
  I thought of stopping him, but didn&#146;t want to interrupt his speech.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye, rumor has it that there&#146;s some
  corruption in the upper ranks of the city guard, but I don&#146;t know nothin&#146;
  &#145;bout that. Guards have always been right kindly to this alehouse owner, that&#146;s
  fer sure. But I believe the bit about the ducts. Hear there&#146;s right odd monsters down
  there as well. Giant, living cubes of jelly. Alligators and sharks. Rats, snakes, and the
  occasional member of the walking dead! Agh, gives me the shivers just thinking about that
  place!&quot; He did visibly shake, and I could see a bead of sweat forming on his brow.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How does one gain passage to such a
  place,&quot; Malachi asked.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Just take a dip anywhere in the city, lads.
  Mind, I hopes ye can hold yer breath longer than this old man! I&#146;ve also heard of a
  secret entrance outside the city walls, but ye can&#146;t trust everything ye hears now,
  can ye? If ye enter within the walls, don&#146;t let the guards catch you at it &#150;
  they&#146;re right unpleasant about people entering. Perhaps because they are involved,
  somehow. That&#146;s all I can tell ye &#150; I&#146;ve said enough.&quot; With that, he
  strode off to serve another thirsty customer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Talkative man, eh?&quot; I looked at
  Malachi to see what he thought of the whole story. &quot;Do you believe him?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye. I have heard of other strange goings
  on here in the city recently. This rumor does much to confirm them. Perhaps we should pay
  a visit to the underbelly of this place, my friend.&quot; Malachi got up from his stool,
  which scraped across the wooden floorboards. &quot;But not until a good night&#146;s
  rest.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aye. And I get the bed this eve,&quot; I
  said with a grin.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fair enough,&quot; he replied, and we
  turned in.</font></p>
