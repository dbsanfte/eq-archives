<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"There was good news and bad news to the smell of the tunnels.  The good news was that it had a range of stench; the bad news was it ranged from bad to worse.  At times you cold almost get a breat of air that didn't make you gag, but most of the time we spent in the stagnant, subterranean caverns our bodies were subconsciously searching for good, clean air.

    <p>Early on, we occasionally encountered other adventurers who seemed to be in the same state of breathing distress as we were, but they told us that the air was somewhat better as you ventured deeper into the channels.  Rumors abounded, also, of dark and evil guilds that had their headquarters buried deep within the aquifers - those of the necromancers and the shadow knights.  Malachi and I had little experience with such folk, and we guessed that their secret guilds would not be the best places to introduce ourselves and get acquianted.  It was well known that such people surrounded themselves with ranks of the evil undead - such creatures brought a chill to our ranks with only the passing thought of them.  Necromancers would kill you on sight just to use your fresh corpse for their purposes, and the shadow knights were some of the most fearsome warriors in Norrath.

    <p>We continued through the passages, trying our best to gauge a sense of direction, moving along and seeing what there was to be seen.  There was some light combat as we passed through the early tunnels - we were assaulted by hosts of rats and bats at times, and we fought by the eerie glow of the moss light.  As we had become a bit more experienced in the ways of combat, these creatures posed no real threat to us, though there was always the chance of being overwhelmed by large groups of the hungry, bloodthirsty creatures.

    <p>What we had been told held true; as we moved futher inwards (or what seemed to be further inwards), the rank smells seemed to lessen, until we could finally get some deep breaths of cool, but stale, air.

    <p>We did fairly well with out progress, occasionally  crossing our own paths through the twisting, turning passages.  For the most part though, we travelled through new passages and did not get lost very often - it wasn't long before we had a decent feel for the area.  We passed seemingly clean pools of water that contained dark shapes swimming through them, and a fin would sometimes break the surface.  We shuddered to think that we had shared these same pools not long ago, swimming in the darkness will all sorts of creatures.  There were messages scratched in some of the cavern walls, and one message by a particular pool read only: "Sharks!".  That was surely all the warning we needed about that pool, whether it be true or not.

    <p>The passages grew steadily darker now as we moved further away from the thick, watery air.  Pools were rare to see, and it seemed that shining moss grew less and less without the humidity to sustain it.  At times we had to expose a bit of the magical lightstone in order to make out our way.  After hours of exploring and slaying all kinds of sewer vermin, including many spiders and snakes, we came across something we had not seen before in the tunnels: the unnatural glow of torchlight.

    <p>As half-elven rangers, we could move quite a bit more silently that most in the outdoors, and even in these unerground passages we had a bit of skill in stealth.  Keeping this in mind, Malachi and I crept slowly down the passage towards the source of the light, our concentration fixed on making nary a sound as we moved to the glowing opening.  We began to hear voices - they sounded like more than one human along with the gutteral sounds of a troll, all speaking in the common tongue.  At the first whisper, we quickly extinguished the lightstone.

    <p>"Three crowns, I tell ye, and not a copper more!  He's beat all to hell and may ne'er work again, Tungul!  Why d'ye have to beat them so badly before ye brings them to us, eh?" one of the humans asked with a dry chuckle.

    <p>"Dey travel betta when no move," came the grunting reply from what sounded like the troll.  "And it make more fun fer Tungul."  I could almost visualize the vicious grin as the humans cackled away at this attempt at humor.
    <p>"Aye, I can see ye take a great pleasure in yer delivery, ye beast.  Ah, well - take it a little easier next time and we'll pay more for 'em, to be sure."  This was a second human's voice, bringing our known total up to three so far.  Trolls were fearsome fighters, and three to two weren't great odds to begin with, even when you can see all of your enemies.  Malachi had just given me the signal to back off when one of the humans came out of the lit doorway with a lantern, turned in the opposite direction, and walked down the passage away from where we were crouched in the shadows.

    <p>We waited for the man to turn a corner, and then I whispered to my friend, "One less to contend with now, eh?  What say ye?"

    <p>"Aye," he responded.  "Fate is with us now - let us see what there is to see.  I catch a quick glimpse first if I can.  Be ready."  I nodded in response.

    <p>Malachi crawled along the floor to within inches of the opening and then peered in, head down low near the floor.  I waited with my hand on my blade for any signs of him being spotted, but there were none.  He pulled his head back quickly, making a shadow dance on the walls opposite the doorway, but that, too, seemed to go unnoticed.  He crawled silently back to me.

    <p>"Slavers, no doubt!  'Tis one troll and one man, with two shackled slaved.  Both man and troll are armed, though the man doesn't look like much to me.  It's the troll that worries me."  Malachi stroked his chin, deep in thought.

    <p>"Aye," I replied.  "Perhaps we can take the man out of the picture and concentrate our efforts on the beast.  I have an idea."  I signalled him to follow and I approached the door quietly.  I peered around into the room, gathered the information that I was after, and whispered some commands into Malachi's ear.  He nodded his agreement, and we sprang into action.

    <p>My friend and I whirled into opposite sides of the dimly lit room, taking in everything quickly as we moved.  There was a small table near the doorway at which the man and troll were seated, apparently playing at some dice game.  The table was littered with copper pieces and the bones of some creature that apparently served as a meal.  Thrown in the corner were two half-elven slaves, gagged and shackled - they appeared unconscious.  A couple of sacks were piled in the corner, and probably contained some provisions.
    <p>Because the table was near to the door, I was upon it with a few quick strides, swinging my faithful sword towards its intended target: the small hooded lantern on the table.  It shattered with a crash, while at the same time Malachi extinguished the torch hanging on the wall in the entryway.  Before either of our foes could utter even a curse, we had plunged the room into complete darkness.
    <p>It took a moment for our infravision to adjust to the change in lighting, and as it did we did our best to pounce upon the troll who had stood up quickly, drawning his massive club up from beside him on the floor.  He hissed, "More elves - and I'll get a fine piece 'o coin for these, I'll wager!"
