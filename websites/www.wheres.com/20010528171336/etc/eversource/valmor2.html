<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">My trip westward from the plains of Karana to Surefall Glade was not
  without incident; with each passing day there appear to be more and more creatures
  stalking each corner of Norrath. Several times I had to leave the road and run for the
  help of the guards by the watchtowers, so dire were my circumstances. A humble farmboy
  wielding an old, dull short sword is no match for even the weakest of creatures. I have
  grown used to the lions and lionesses roaming nearby throughout the course of my life, but
  the huge, disgusting spiders still cause a chill to run up my spine. I sighed as I
  remembered my father hustling me indoors the first time one of these nightmares walked
  near to our fields; generally they did not attack men, but we were taking no chances...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I trudged on through the mountain pass, receiving the occasional
  strange glance offered to a young man wandering alone in these troubled times. Some
  pleasant folk offered me food and drink, which I graciously accepted, so eager was I for
  company and a tale. I never shared my misfortunes with others, as I did not wish to burden
  their high spirits; for now my troubles are my own, and I take comfort in the levity of
  the journeymen. I fabricated a simple tale of visiting a relative in Surefall, and staying
  with them while I tried to join the clan of the Rangers; this seemed to be accepted
  without suspicion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The area surrounding the Qeynos Hills appears far more travelled
  than my homelands to me; I believe this is party due to the comparative safety of this
  place. No lions or spiders seem to roam here; but there are a great many snakes. Luckily,
  they seem to keep to themselves, as do the rats and bats. Twice though, I had to cower
  behind some trees as one of the walking dead passed by in the distance. I have heard many
  tales of necromancers walking the land, reviving the dead to be their evil servants; no
  desire had I to stumble across one of those! After a time, I rested my dusty feet next to
  a cottage near the side of the road and took a long pull on my waterskin. Many an
  adventurer passed by this place, and I reveled in their exciting tales of slaying evil
  monsters and recovering silver and gold. With all of these stories running around in my
  head, I could not contain my eagerness to begin my training any longer; I rose and
  continued northwards.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I began to hear passersby speaking of the nearby Blackburrow, and my
  heart sank with the weight of my sorrow. I had not realized that I would be passing so
  close to the accursed place in my short journey; but I decided to have a quick look. I
  crossed over small hills and valleys, and was transfixed when I saw the entrance to the
  gnoll's lair - it was shaped as the mouth of one of their own, and blood ran down the
  jagged teeth at the entrance. Many hardy warriors were just outside binding their wounds,
  sharpening their swords, and preparing to do battle with the vile beasts. I asked for the
  location of the Glade, and was pointed in the right direction by one well armored lord. I
  could not recount to you the number of times that I glanced back over my shoulder to be
  sure no gnolls were skulking along behind me in the shadows. I knew it would not be long
  before I returned, and I told the gnolls so under my breath.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As darkness began to fall on the trail, I glimpsed the torches
  outlining the entrance to Surefall Glade. Shadows played on the carved rock face, causing
  eerie images to jump and lurch in a strange, haunting dance. After relaxing for a moment
  beside a campfire, I entered the tunnel that would carry me into a safe, comfortable haven
  and with any luck, into the life of a Ranger.</font></p>
