<p><font face="Arial">It had been many days since Mainiac entered Sureglade he could tell
by the pain in his belly. All his muscles ached from the strains of the day in BB, but he
knew this too would pass. He sat up he relized he was in Hagaer Sureshots house and Hagaer
was sitting in a chair staring at him. Hagaer spoke &quot;Well young one you suprise me,
most Rangers would have run to me after the poacher entered BB but you got the poacher
yourself. Then instead of getting the reward you bury the slain animals with the poachers
head. Then on top of it bring a wood near death into the Glade and collapse. I hope you
can explain this!!!&quot; Mainiac spends 2 hours explain what happened to his elder. The
Elder sat Quietly and he then got up and left the room. Mainiac sat quietly when Hagaer
entered the room with a plate of food and a pitcher of ale. Mainiac ate like a rabid
animal until he relized Hagaer was watching him. Mainiac asked if his Elder was angery
with what he did. In response Hagaer moved to the door and without looking said &quot;no
not angry everything but&quot; and closed the door. Mainiac too hungry to think on this
further finished devouring his meal and ale. After 30 minutes of bliss he got up and got
the rest of his clothes on but his armor and gear were missing. He went to the next room
and Hagaer and 10 other Rangers were discussing Katarina the wood elf he saved. No one
from the table looked up when he walked in Mainiac took this to be a bad sign. Hagaer
paused then kept speaking &quot; Like I said she her, brother and father were dragged into
BB her father fought and was killed but her brother vanished into the caves before she was
hit in the head and blacked out. She says she still feels her brother is alive and she
wants to go get him he is just 6 seasons old and she feels he is hurt or starving.&quot;
The group mumbles amongst<br>
then a decision is met. Hagaer states &quot;Tommarrow we will venture into BB to find the
young one if he lives we will find him.&quot;<br>
Be ready before first light we will meet here then head out.&quot; As the group leaves all
give a nod to Mainiac for his deads the eldest stops. Tamor speaks &quot; Tunare must care
for you deeply to have given Katarina life even if you did full fill a blood quest in her
name. You are a very luck ranger to have survived in BB you have not even learned the
words of healing yet&quot; He then pats Mainiac on the head and leaves the house. Mainiac
finds out Katarina is in Holly's house and should be on her feet in 3 or 4 more days he
also finds out that his gear is in the closet. Hagaer informs him to leave it there, he
will not need it for a few days and hands him a fishing pole. Hagaer says &quot; go
fishing and relax..you have earned it.&quot; Hours later a runner comes into the Glade and
all the elders gather by the docks. The runner reports &quot;A small army of Dark Elves is
heading this way we must prepare for an attack&quot; After discussion it is agreed they
will dig in and wait for the Dark Elves to attack. Hagaer tells the Elders &quot; I will
inform Katarina the search for her brother will have to wait till the Dark Elves are
gone.&quot; The group disperses and the vendors make sure everyone is armed. Mainiac Tails
Hagaer to Holly's house and listens as he informs Katarina of what is happening. Hagaer
leaves as Katarina dies and tells Holly &quot;Tobuko will not live through tommarrow I
know it!!!!!!!&quot; and bursts into tears.<br>
Mainiac walks back to Hagaers house and opens the closet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The next morning a group of 20 Dark elves are camped outside
Sureglade taunting the Half elves to come out and die. Hagaer Approaches Tourgo and asks
&quot;Where have you placed Mainiac on the line we need to keep him out of this fight if
we can he is still weak.&quot; Tourgo Response &quot;But Elder Mainiac is not on the line,
I sent Luthan to find him at first light but he is no where to be, I thought he was with
you?&quot; Hagaer Respond's &quot;But all his gear is gone from the house!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!</font></p>
