The guild that I belong to, the Noble Lions, are a good guild, active in
Ultima Online (UO). Good in as much as we try to behave in a fashion that
benefits the majority of players. Also good in that we are fairly active in
opposing evil players and guilds. <BR><BR>

Being good in UO actually isn't that hard. There are a few tough moral
issues we have faced (the toughest was whether we allow guild members to
play evil characters in addition to their good characters, we said no, not
on the shard that we are active in). For most players, the basic test of
morality is: do you kill other players without cause? Those who kill
without cause are labeled PKers. Those who do not are called Non-PKers. In
general this has been a reasonable dividing line and it has come to
represent good vs. evil. However, the world of EverQuest (EQ) seems to
offer a much more complicated moral landscape than UO. The key element that
makes EQ more complex is the addition of true races. <BR><BR>

In the real world, it is now a widely accepted fact that the supposed races
of humanity (usually referred to by skin color such as white, black,
yellow, and red) are in-fact nothing more than skin color. The degree of
genetic variation between people of the same race is actually identical to
the genetic variation between people of different races. In other words,
genetically speaking, race as it is commonly understood today, has no basis
in fact. <BR><BR>

If we accept this genetic definition of race, then the idea that there
should be NO discrimination against humans with different skin colors seems
reasonable (to me at least). In a very real sense all humans are distant
cousins, appearently descendants of a common ancestor from about 100,000
years ago. <BR><BR>

What does this have to do with EverQuest (EQ)? 
In EQ, players are able to play a number of different races: Humans,
Erudites, Barbarians, Wood Elves, High Elves, Half Elves, Dark Elves,
Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings, Ogres, and Trolls. I am assuming that a number
of these races really are different races in a meaningful sense. The
obvious exceptions are: Humans-Erudites-Barbarians; Dwarves-Gnomes and Wood
Elves-Half Elves-High Elves-Dark Elves. In other words, it is not obvious
that the Humans and Erudites are different races, nor is it clear that Dark
Elves and High Elves are different races. For the purposes of this
discussion I will assume that all Humans are of the same race, Dwarves and
Gnomes are the same, and all Elves are of the same race. <BR><BR>

This leaves 6 playable races in the game: Humans, Elves, Dwarves,
Halflings, Ogres, and Trolls. <BR><BR>

What are the moral implications of harming members of another race? 
This issue has come up most often in science fiction, where many writers
have assumed that humans will come into contact with alien races. In the
Star Trek galaxy and the Babylon 5 galaxy, the assumption has been that all
life, especially thinking life, is morally at the same level. In effect the
people who created these galaxies (Gene Rodenberry & Joe Michael Straczinky
respectively) argue that different races all have the same rights, no race
is superior to another, no race is inferior. <BR><BR>

In other science fiction stories, notably in the novel Starship Troopers by
Heinline, there was a real sense that some races, due to their behavior,
occupied morally different planes. The bugs in Heinline's story were
suitable for nuclear annihilation, the reason being it was either them or
us. Heinline was neither the first nor the last science fiction writer to
suggest this idea, I'm merely using his example because, with the recent
movie, more people are likely to know what I'm talking about. <BR><BR>

Where does EQ fit into this range of possible attitudes? 
I argue that in a world with limited resources (and almost by definition,
all worlds have limited resources, exceptions being Ring Worlds or Dyson
Spheres), conflict between races which compete directly for land, food, or
goods is both reasonable and moral. The key here is that there are limited
resources which multiple races require for survival. <BR><BR>

War Between Ogres and Dwarves - A Hypthetical Example 
Let us assume that Ogres and Dwarves both eat the same food (sheep). Lets
assume that they both like to live in the same places (mountains). Lets
assume they both desire the same rare mineral (gold). Seeing as there are
limited quantities of sheep, mountains, and gold, neither the Dwarves nor
the Ogres are going to be happy about the inevitable competition between
the two races. They have two options open to them: conflict or compromise.
But what exactly do they have to compromise about? It is a zero sum game.
Whatever one side gains, the other side loses. (I am assuming that no
cooperative efforts on the part of the Dwarves and Ogres can result in
increasing the quantity of mountainous terrain, gold, or sheep). Do the
Dwarves and Ogres share a common language, culture, history, tradition, or
relations that would lead them to consider compromise? Compromise is hard
for humans, even when we share all these things. In the case of truly
different races, compromise is highly unlikely. <BR><BR>

What about morality? Why (for example) it is moral for the Dwarves to
attempt to destroy the Ogres? This comes from the concept of natural law. <BR><BR>

Natural Law - Survival <BR>
The bedrock principle of morality is based on survival. When you get to the
bottom of things you find that everyone agrees that life is preferable to
death. But all living things die. So survival must take on a deeper
meaning. It is not just personal survival that is important, but the
survival of one's family, and by extension, one's race. As a human, if I
was forced to choose between the survival of ANY OTHER species and the
human race, I would choose the human race. Even if another species somewhat
limited the possible expansion of the human race, I would strongly consider
elimination of the limiting species. <BR><BR>

Returning to Ogres and Dwarves example: because they are in direct
competition for the same resources and living space, the two races directly
impinge upon each other. A war of annihilation between them is certainly
reasonable. I argue that it is also moral because continued survival and
expansion by one race directly threatens the continued survival and
expansion of the other race. <BR><BR>

I am aware of the fact that the Nazi's (and other would-be genocidal
monsters) have used these same sorts of arguments. The problem is: they
were wrong! Humans are all the same. There was no racial difference between
the Germans and the German Jews. Nor is there any racial difference between
the Tutsis and the Hutus in Rwanda. Nor is there any racial difference
between the Bosnian Croats, the Bosniacs, and the Serbs. All humans are of
one race. <BR><BR>

Note that I am not saying genocide is the highest moral level. It is not
the best possible option. In an ideal world, the Ogres and Dwarves would be
able to live together in harmony by careful agreements, making sure neither
race expanded at the cost of the other race. This would require a very high
degree of communication and trust between the two races. Considering the
wars that have erupted in human communities that share a common language,
culture, skin-color, and generations of family ties, conflict between Ogres
and Dwarves, who have none of these commonalities, seems inevitable. Should
such wars be condemned as immoral? I do not think so. If true, is there any
behavior that would be immoral? Sadly, nothing occures to me. I'm not sure
that the word morality has any meaning in this context.... <BR><BR>

War is not necessary between all races 
All races need not fight wars of genocide. Take another hypothetical
example: Trolls and Wood Elves. Assume that Trolls like to live in swamps,
while Wood Elves only like to live in forests. Assume that Trolls only eat
snails, frogs, and other swamp dwelling creatures while Elves prefer to eat
deer, acorns, and fruits. Lastly, assume that Elves like nothing more than
to play songs and make up poems, while Trolls prefer to lie in mud baths
all day long, counting the number of flies they have eaten since breakfast.
There is no reason why these two races should ever come into conflict
(until the Elves decide they need to expand their favorite forest by
draining the near-by marsh). Put simply: Trolls and Wood Elves are not in
competition with each other over resources. Consequently they don't impinge
on each other and so conflict between them is pointless and irrational. <BR><BR>

In David Brin's science fiction, he has speculated on the existence of
Hydrogen-based life. He further suggested that the Oxygen breathing races
and Hydrogen breathing races could live in the same solar systems without
bothering one another. <BR><BR>

Historical Parallel <BR>
Archeology tells us that there was a time when both Humans and Neaderthals
lived in the same places. Neaderthals are considered a different, though
closely related species of Humans. Some recent genetic studies strongly
suggest that the Neaderthals died out utterly. The assumption is, given our
violent history, that humans fought a true race war of annihilation against
the Neaderthals, and won. Speaking as a human, I cannot argue that it was
immoral for us to have survived, even if it was at the expense of another
species. Again, it wasn't the best thing that could have happened, but it
was a lot better than the likely alternative (extinction for humans). <BR><BR>

Parallels in Literature <BR>
The concept of race war is rather obviously at the heart of all
Tolkien-inspired fantasy. In The Lord of the Rings, the Orcs, servants of
Sauron, are irredeemable. It is a good thing to kill Orcs whenever possible
and if all the Orcs were wiped out, none of the characters in the story
would be unhappy. The situation was painted in quite stark terms, either
the Orcs win, or the Free Peoples (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, & Hobbits) win.
Painting the situation in this black/white fashion is typical of the
hundreds of fantasy novels published since LotR. <BR><BR>

Conclusion<BR>
Based on these examples, it is clear to me that a good, moral guild can
choose an enemy race and declare their mission is the destruction of that
race. The simple world of UO (Player Killers vs. Non-Player Killers) is
completely obscured in the world of EQ. Two guilds with identical moral
codes of good behavior can easily be total enemies to each other just
because of their racial composition. <BR><BR>

Some Minor Issues in EQ <BR>
Q: Why Don't Elves Fight with Humans? <BR>
A: The easy answer to this question is that Elves and Humans really are one
race. The proof for this statement is the existence of Half Elves. The fact
that humans and elves can interbreed is almost as unlikely as Human-Vulcan
interbreeding (I refer to the oft stated fact that in the Star Trek
universe, Mr. Spook is half-Vulcan, half-human). However, given the
existence of Half Elves, it is easy to see why Humans and Elves are able to
live together without engaging in wars of genocide. Survival for the Humans
is, in effect, the same thing as survival for the Elves. These two races
are not actually separate races and so there is no rational competition
between them. Of course, you can say the same thing about humans, there is
no rational explanation for wars of genocide between humans, but it happens
with depressing regularity in the real world. <BR><BR>

Q: Why Don't Humans Fight with Halflings<BR>
A: Now this I can't answer. Assuming that Halflings are not just pigmy
humans but are a separate race, there is every reason to think that Humans
and Halflings are in conflict with one another over the same resources. <BR><BR>

Tolkien (who invented Hobbits, the obvious source for Halflings) invented a
very strange world. The key oddity to Middle Earth is that it is a world
with declining populations (with the exception of Orcs). The population of
Hobbits might be expanding slightly, but the numbers of men, elves, and
dwarves is declining and has been for several hundred years. This means
that far from competing with the other races for the same pool of shrinking
resources, the Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits must cooperate to destroy
the Orcs, before the Orcs over-run the land. <BR><BR>

Tolkien's world bears no relation to anything seen in human history. In the
real world, the total human population has been always been gradually
rising. Since the 1800s the Human population has skyrocketed. FYI: It is
estimated that over the last 100,000 years, some 25-30 billion humans have
lived. About one fifth of the total human population is alive today! <BR><BR>

For the record, I venture to guess that Hobbits (and by extension,
Halflings) are pigmy humans. In other words, they too are part of the large
human super-race. If I'm correct, this leaves EQ with just 4 races: the
Elf-Human-Halfling race, the Dwarves-Gnome race, the Ogres, and the Trolls. <BR><BR>

Disclaimer: Nothing in this article is ment to suggest that race wars or
racial discrimination in the real world is reasonable or moral. I'm talking
here about a game set in a virtual world with its own internal logic. This
is a thought experiment based on my understanding of the logic of this
virtual world. <BR><BR>
