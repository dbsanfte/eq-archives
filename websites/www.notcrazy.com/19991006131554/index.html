<B><I>New Ask Milo</I></B><BR>
<B><I>13:52:42 PST</I></B><BR>
Ahh, been awhile since we did an <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/AskMilo/">Ask Milo update</a>. In today's responses Milo answers questions about viewing model skins in EQ, and finally puts in an end(?) to this whole armour tinting thing. Also Brad McQuaid stops by to give a guest question response. <P>

 If you have been living under a rock for the last few months and still don't know what this is all about, Ask Milo is our column here on <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com">EverQuest NotCrazy</a> where Verants 3d character artist Milo D. Cooper takes in questions from you guys, grabs a bottle of Jack Daniels and has at it. Anyway, head on over to the <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/AskMilo/">Ask Milo page</a> for more details.

Brad (Don't get him drunk) McQuaid made two more posts on the news group today, one about the new upcoming planes (Hate & Sky) and Developer Overconfident Estimation Syndrome, sounds interesting you must say. Brad's stuff is in Bold:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Seems like Brad's been avoiding this NG recently, or just lurking. Easy to understand why too, most likely.  Maybe if we just compose a thread of questions (minus inflammatory opinions), we can bring him out of hiding.<P>

 How are the new planes/zones coming?  Any idea of a timeframe yet?<P>

<B>Plane of Hate soon, then Plane of Sky after that.  Plane of Hate just began combat testing in fact.</B><P>

Given all that, in my opinion, they've been doing an admirable job, although they do seem to suffer from Developer Overconfident Estimation Syndrome.<P>
 
<B>Guilty, but we're working on it :)<P>

If you can understand this guy talkin' you might be a <S>Redneck</S> Dwarf:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
I wes 'eaded to the docks fer Jeet ('e sent me un some Miner errund, sez it be importunt like). When un o them Dunfires be jumpin at me from the shadows. After slippin me dwarven blade in 'is rib a bit 'e laid down fer gud. Figurin I shoulds take a token, I gets ready to cut 'is tongue out with me trusty blade, but I could not! I figured it be best left to the crows and scarabs and pulled the body to some bushes. Hid it real well I dids. <P>

OOC I was fighting some of the Dwarven Bandits in Butcher and figured I'd loot em again. The game replied that I could not loot the item as I already had one of them in my inventory. I tried it a second time to see if it repeated and found the same message. So it appears it will not let you loot a lore item if you already have the same item. In the past you would loot but still only have one item in the inventory. I am not sure if this will work in a trade window (I would be surprised). <P>

Another side note - A friend told me the pouch from the Orc Runner is now no drop. He had one in the bank and pulled it to his inventory only to find he could not return it later.

<B><I>Report on EQ and DX 7.0</I></B><BR>
<B><I>13:28:10 PST</I></B><BR>
I so far have had no trouble what so ever with EQ and Direct X 7.0, everything works the same as when I was running 6.1. We have <a href="http://www.gamefan-network.com/notcrazy/files/DX70eng.exe">mirrored Direct X 7.0 here</a>. This is the email David Schattilly sent in:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">

DirectX 7 does work I confirmed it with Verant Tech Support line. When I installed it, it cleaned up the issue i had with it crashing out. Well it still does have frame rate problems but that is my system none the less it works great. It looks like they are going to add AGP acceleration DirectX. (Probally with Windows 2000) 
There is still a issue with it that SBLive cards if set in full acceleration will NOT do the ambient monster sounds. (Bat wings flapping monsters growling wolves howling) you still have to set it down to standard acceleration. The good news is in DXDIAG you can do that and you don't have to set it in multi-media anymore. There is also a few new features this version of DirectX has in DXDIAG. One is the AGP Support but cannot be used yet. Maybe my Voodoo III 2000 AGP card don't have it or it is going to be in place with the next o/s release. <P>

The next feature it has is more troubleshooting tools. Sound has been added. Besides the Msinfo Override and Troubleshoot. The next feature to be added is NETWORK tab. You can test all the registered services, Tcp/IP Direct play, Modem, Ipx and Serial connection. You can test it. <P>

Everquest was much smoother with this version of Direct X however, as with any DirectX there is no way to de-install it. However I had experienced a bug, when your in Faedark and you camp out it was still playing the music along with the charactor selection music. This only happend when I had my Sound Blaster Live on hardware acceleration. (Full acceleration.) This did not happen when i went back to the old setting i have to use to hear the ambient monster sounds. <P>

There is fixes for direct animation, there is also fixes for movie playing that use direct draw. And a fix for the task bar box staying on the task bar. You have to click to make it go away that was fixed. The clarity of the game is improved a little. And a lot of my frame rate issues were eliminated but still happen. Good luck and if you want to mail me feel free to mail me at <a href="mailto:keiichi@uswest.net">keiichi@uswest.net</a>. <P>

Eldrad gave us a copy of this email:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
I'd like to get some groups together, of people over level 35, for an assault on Kedge Keep!<P>

Planning to do it <B>Saturday, Oct 2</B>, at <B>9 PM EST</B>. We'll meet at the bottom of the hill/path that leads to Butcherblock (where the 2 pillars are, where it opens up into the cauldron area) in Dagnor's Cauldron.<P>

This is to be an event for people OVER level 35, as it gets pretty tough there. To come, you really should in some way be able to breathe under
water. Either have: the Enduring Breath spell and a backpack full of fish scales, a fishbone earing, one of those spears that casts Enduring Breath a couple times, or the water breathing bard song. Kedge Keep is 100% under water!<P>

We'd really like to have a few Bards, at least 1 in each group, since their little level 3 song that they thought they'd never use will really come in handy when we're all out of vigor from all the swimming.<P>

The Keep is guarded by 2 lancer swordfish up top, that are in the low to mid 30's in level (kinda like a cyclops). After they're taken care of, we'll swim down the hole, around, and into the Mermaid area. We will NOT be attacking mermaids. They are indifferent to pretty much everyone, and very tough. Better to leave them be, and keep it as a nice place to rest, etc. >From the Mermaid area, we will swim on to attack those pathetic seahorses, find our way to Phinegil Antroops (sp?) and harpoon him good!<P>

As with all the Assault events I'll be planning, this is not a loot or xp getting event. The whole purpose is to do stuff that not too many people
have tried before, and have a lot of fun! There are a few nice items in Kedge (serated bone dirk, I hear) but for the most part the zone is unitemized. We'll mostly be killing sharks and pirannas, until we come to the Seahorse area.. I don't know what's past there besides Phinegil. I'm
pretty sure Phinegil is a level 50 caster of some sort, so he will be tough!<P>

Interested in coming? email me at <a href="eldrad@timkline.com">eldrad@timkline.com</a> :)<P>

PS: Keep all the meat we get for me, and I'll cook us a feast after, I'm an almost master baker now :)

Zewt & Geig sent us in this info, thanks guys:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
After the patch last evening on Rathe, I was Charmed in Qeynos by the Wiz quild (I attacked a good guard), and did not die, and DID have the CHARM spell wear off and was able to escape to the aqueducts. So that message is wrong. <P>

But one strange thing that did happen, was in the process of being CHARMED, I attacked a ranger who also then became charmed. I only learned this later when she contacted me wanting to know why I attacked her/how I became charmed. Now this was in South Qeynos after 9pm PST.<P>

You might have noticed they took the servers down for a second time around 4:45pm PST. That was the Charm/Fear fix.

<B><I>Off Topic: Dear Mynx</I></B><BR>
<B><I>15:12:38 PST</I></B><BR>
The new dear mynx was released today, great issue which you <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/mynx/mynxsept2399.shtm">can read all about here</a>. Here's a quick rip from the page:
<P><Blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Hi Mynx. I've been playing Quake and reading your column for quite some time now, so when this, uhh, "situation" that I'm in arose, I knew I could count on you for quality advice. The situation goes like this: at the apartment-warming party that was thrown in my honor the day I moved in to my current pad, I got drunk and fooled around with a basically anonymous girl, after learning only her first name and giving her a back massage, no less. Now, this is nothing new to me, as I've been labeled as a "party-slut" for quite some time now. <P>

Anyway, I understandably didn't hear from this girl for about a week, although I did hear a few things about her in that time. I learned that she, too, was a "party-slut". I hate to say it, but the news didn't surprise me. What did surprise me, however, was her return to my apartment a week after our encounter to ask me to lunch. We've been seeing each other for about a month and a half, now, and we've been faithful to each other for the entirety of that period. The problem is, we each know the 
other's past, and neither of us are quite comfortable with it. How can we get past this stumbling block in our relationship? I swear I'm falling in love with her already. She's so special to me, it hurts to be without her. But when we're intimate, I just can't help but think of the other guys she's had one-nighters with, some of whom I even know, and of whom I strongly disapprove. And I know she's thinking exactly the same thing of me. I'm dying here, Mynx. Please help us.

Damn bugs, this from Pyat:

It looks like the new patch introduced more bugs then they thought. If you get charmed/feared, it is PERMANENT until you die. Death is the only way out of it. Also, it looks like Jboots have been turned into a quest, as my friend was camping Drez and she dropped a note that said cannot open something or other....
