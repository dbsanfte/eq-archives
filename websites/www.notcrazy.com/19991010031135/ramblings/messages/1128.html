Just curious, but what do you think I did with the Ring?  Just sit there and look at it?  Yes, I actually thought of to right click on it too.  Nothing works.  I even created a halfling char to try it on since I got it from a quest in Rivervale, but that didnt work either.  Thanks for the help though.
