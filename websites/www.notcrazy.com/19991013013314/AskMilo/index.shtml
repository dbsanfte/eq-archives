Hi Milo....<P>

I was just wondering if it would be possible to see a full skin for one of the EQ models....<P>

I have never seen how an EQ skin is put together and would love to see one. Also what size do you produce the skins?<P>

Many Thanks<P>

   We don't map our characters like Quake characters; we don't have
a single bitmap that's applied to an entire model (in most cases).
Rather, we have individual images for various sections of a character's
geometry (a map for the head, a map for the foot, a map for the
inside of the mouth, etc.).  This makes it easier for me to apply
mapping coordinates, and it also makes image swapping (e.g.
changing the face of a character during the character creation phase)
more efficient and more practical. The sizes of the bitmap images
varies greatly, depending on the size of the geometry that a bitmap
is meant to cover.  I am not allowed to publicize the images
themselves.

 I've read that the new models for the expansion pack will have a higher
 polygonal resolution and more moving parts.  Several of the zones in the
 game and anywhere with a large number of players suffer great lag already,
 forcing me to turn off anything and everything I am able in order to not
 lock up or lose link, which often happens regardless.  Has an increased
 potential arisen from more efficient model designs or streamlining of the
 graphics code?  Or can I expect even more lag in the future if I don't
 upgrade my 16 meg TnT?<P>

   "A 16 meg TnT is a pretty powerful card -- I'd suspect that your framerate

 thing...)  I think this at the minimum would allow just a bit of personalization. [...]<P>

 appearances. [...]<P>
 
 [...]If platemail is available in many different colors (i.e. bronze, steel,

The main question:  Will DX7 hardware accelerated transform and lighting
create a back-breaking workload for artists?<P>

One reason for using DX7 transform features would be to put more polygons
on the screen (in each frame) thus creating an even better looking scene.
That means higher level-of-detail in the models.  Are current "master"
models already being made with say 8 times more polys than are actually
used in a final game model?  Will artists be required to make even higher
LOD models for DX7 games, and more importantly do you think they can keep
up with the workload that might entail?  Or are today's models ready for
tommorow's games?<P>

Thanks,<BR>

   It's definitely going to make for a lot more work for us artists,
not only because we'll need to devote more time to geometric
details, but also because we'll have a much greater number of
moving parts to take into account as we construct the models.
It's the difference between the blocky shape that represents a
playable EQ character's fist, and the giant, disembodied hand
that lurks in some regions of the game.  There is more to the
construction of the latter than making it look much more like a
real hand; not only do the textures take more than twice as
long to apply, but all of the digits have to animate as well,
which means that they have to be built in such a way that they
move properly.  All of this is before skeletal information is
applied to the model, which process is significantly more difficult
and time-consuming thanks to the increases in both the number
of moving parts in a model and the number of its vertices
(sorting out which vertices move with which bones can be a
real pain with dense collections of vertices).  When things like
proportional vertex movement (e.g. skin over a ball-and-socket
joint like the shoulder) and vertex bulging (e.g. bicep flexing)
become more commonly implemented, things will become even
more complicated.  I foresee art teams becoming more like
they are at film-quality special effects studios, where
responsibilities in the art production process are more subject
subdivision than they are in the gaming industry.  As for the
feasibility of today's models, they're destined for the desktop
recycle bins.

Milo, I am really wanting to know the answer to this question but have not found anyone that has been able to give me a straight forward answer as of yet.  Are there any plans in the future for expanding the differrent looks, (faces, and/or bodies), for the different races in EQ?  I understand that this would have to be included in an expansion pack of sorts and not patched because of download times but I was just wondering anyway.  For instance I would LOVE to have a human wizard with a long grey or white beard, or maybe even a fat human merchant type character. <P>
 I think it would even be neat to play a fat, traveling bard...hehe. Anyway, thanks for your time and hope to hear an answer soon. (My question isn't exactly just for the "human" race in EQ, but actually for all the races in general.  Maybe even a Half elf with a full beard to show his human heritage's side.)  Thanks again.<P>

characters and environments.  The current roster of characters is
not likely to enjoy any enhancements.

Hello Milo! :o)<P>
 
My name is Noor and I am a druid of Tunare... and we have learned to survive with what nature gives us (forage). But sometimes that veggie or those berries can get purty boring... and what is better than a PIE? But for a pie one needs eggs... and strangely EverQuest doesn't have chickens... could it be so hard to draw one up (beautiful 3D an' all) and a beautiful 3D egg? I just find hunting snakes at level 33 a TAD degrading...<P>

hi there! i have been trying for some time to find out if there really is a sea serpent (not the giant shark!) in lake rathe. i have been swum down there numerous times, and seen nothing on the lake bottom that could be a sea serpent. i have also ventured into the tunnels with the goblins and still seen nothing. and there aren't any screen shots of it, so i assume nobody has seen it. is there really one? did u make a model for it and it isn't implemented yet? or is it just a super rare spawn? thanks for your time.

Hi Milo i just read sometime ago that you were a fan of street Fighters, so why the monk's move aren't a little more fantastic, like the dragon punch =] i would love to see a monk knocking down a Hill Giant=].  <P>

  Will refresh some of their move in the expension? Btw what will the new lizard race look like? I read that they will be able toperfom things with their tail, a double roundhouse perheaps?  and will the be small,med or large race?  Thx<P>

   Regarding the monks' moves, I create what is necessary for
animation, but I do not actually make the characters move.
That is someone else's responsibility.  Regarding the new playable
race, they look more humanoid than the lizard men in southern
Antonica, they are human-sized, and they will have tail attacks.

Throughout some of your answers you mention that you had a limit to the 
number of polygons you had for each character. I'm curious as to how this 
was determined?<P>

Why can you not swap the colors before it gets transformed to 16 bit color? 
I think all EQ players will agree we wish we had something like in UO where
we can dye our clothes and such to specific colors to make it more 'personalized'.
As it is now, say, for druids and monks, they eternally look like newbies with the exact same
colors for 50 levels straight. I know Flowing Black Robes should not be able to be changed
colors, but items such as leather and mesh should be able to. The game feels very
im-personal with everyone looking exactly the same. I know its possible, why not
add it in? Also, you mentioned the reference point for the shield was left out on Barbarians,
why hasn't it been added in? It truely amazes me that the simplest things can make
people happy, yet Verant seems to work on the tougher stuff all the time. :)<P>
 
Visuals are top priority from where I stand. At least, it makes a 10 hour long EQ day
seem a bit better. I would like to see guilds who dye their clothes all a certain color
and such. <P>

   I'm not a hardware guru, so I wouldn't bet my life on the accuracy
of this answer, but I'm pretty sure that swapping colors on a bitmap
before dropping it into the accelerator would defeat the efficiency
that makes palette swapping practical in the first place.  It would
result in a bunch of copies of the same texture, all with different
color schemes, all taking up precious memory at the cost of the rest
of the textures in the game (UO isn't a 3D-accelerated game, so
that program doesn't have this issue).  If there's a way for us to
palette swap automatically-organized 16-bit textures, I'm sure that
one or more of our programmers will come through.
   Whether the male barbarian shield problem will be rectified some
time is not my decision.  There's a chance that the fix will come
with the expansion pack, but it'll be up to Brad in the end.

Which do you think is going to have had more work put into it?  The art and
models for the expansion pack or the original game?<P>

I noticed you like to listen to Schonberg, do you honestly enjoy that type
of "music" and consider him to be a musician and not some sort of freaky
mathematician?<P>

-Avantais, Bard of Povar (With real musical taste =)

   (1) I can't speak for the rest of the art team, but the Ruins of
Kunark models are definitely a lot more work.  Their polygonal
resolution is higher, and they have a greater number of independently
moving parts.<P>

   (2) It's true that Schönberg was a largely technical and analytical
composer, but he did manage to write some extremely emotional
and touching scores.  I haven't heard half of the man's work, but I
would recommend _Five Pieces for Orchestra_ (opus 16) to any
genuine musical aficionado.  Schönberg was a master of orchestration
and timbre, and this work is a prime example of the composer at
full steam.  Enough of that, though -- I could talk about music
forever, but it wouldn't be germane to this web page.

<I>Heya Milo,<P>
 
One of my favorite characters is a cheerful little Gnome.  That is until I get to the character creation screen. Now he's a mildly shocked little Gnome.<P>
 
How is it that you guys failed to give any happy expressions to any of the Gnomes males?  In fact, come to think of it, the only smiling character faces that I can remember are a female Ogre and a female Troll (and we don't want to know why they are smiling).<P>

   Unlike something like Quake, the characters were bound to find
themselves in situations calling for a wide range of emotional reactions,
so it was necessary to give them neutral countenances.
