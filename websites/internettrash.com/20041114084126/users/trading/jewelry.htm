is probably the most difficult skill to increase and at the
beginning there is a high Failed Rate. So I recommend you to put
at least 10 Practice Points in this skill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">First
things to do is to buy a Jewelry Kit to be capable to make what
you want where you want.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most of Components are
stackable so you will need to pick one off the stack to do your
Jewelry. Just control-click on a stack to pick up one item.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The best way to increase
the Jewelry skill is to make large quantities of a simple Jewelry
Item and when you recieve a message that your skill is trivial,
move on to the next Gem/Metal combination. Begin with cheap Gems
and Silver Bars, then work up to the more expensive Gems.When
you've mastered Silver Jewelry, then move on to Electrum then to
Gold and then to Platinum Jewelry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget that you are
not obliged to make Magic Jewelry Items, you should make
Non-magical Jewelry Items when you train your skill and make
Magical Jewelry Items when you have an order.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">This is some Jewelry
examples to make.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To start, if you put 21
Practice Points in your Jewelry skill, I recommend to make Cat's
Eye Agate Silver Item : Combine 1 Silver Bar and 1 Cat's Eye
Agate in your Jewelry Kit. Cat's Eye Agate Silver Items beccomes
trivial at skill 22.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should make
Carnelian Silver Item : Combine 1 Silver Bar and 1 Carnelian in
your Jewelry Kit. Carnelian Silver Items becomes trivial at skill
31.</font></p>

Emerald Silver Item : Combine 1 Silver Bar and 1 Emerald in your
Jewelry Kit. Emerald Silver Items becomes trivial at skill 48.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">After Emerald Silver Items
is trivial you can move on to Electrum Items. So you should make
Malachite Electrum Item : Combine 1 Electrum Bar and 1 Malachite
in your Jewelry Kit. Malachite Electrum Items becomes trivial at
skill 74.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make
