nosave><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">here
are two way to increase your Research Skill, an easy one and a
hard one : You can raise your Research Skill by researching
Spells or you can raise it by making Practice Runes, you can also
put all your Practice Points in this Skill but it will become
very expensive and you will probably need your Practice Points
for other Skills.</font><br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#008080" size="4" face="Dahaut">- Making Practice
Runes</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Dahaut"> :</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">First
things to know is to not confond Pratcice Runes with Wizard
Runes, all Classes that can Research Spells can do Practice
Runes.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
need a Concorcance of Research. To get your Concordance of
Research you need to give a Greater Lightstone to the appropriate
NPC : For good aligned Races, Myrsila in the Gypsy Camp in
Northern Karana (head North from the spires, Loc -675, -150). For
evil aligned Races, Smith Tv'ysa in the camp in Southen Desert of
Ro (head South from the Oasis of Marr zone, Loc +100, +500). When
you give the Greater Lightstone, be ware to keep an Empty Slot in
your Inventory, if not you will not get the Concordance. The
Concordance is required to create the Practice Runes, it is a
Container used to combine the Components.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">You also
need, for each Practice Runes, a Quill and a Piece of Parchment,
you will get back the Quill but not the Piece of Parchment.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
Practice Runes is composed of two parts : the Azia part and the
Beza part for each level of Practice Runes. Your Research skill
will increase only when you will combine the two parts, not when
you create the two parts. There is no skill needed to create the
Azia and the Beza rune. When you created the two parts you need
to combine them in the appropriate Tome for your Class: the Tome
of Endless Enchantments for Enchanter, the Elemental Grimoire for
Magician, the Book of Dark Bindings for Necromancer and the
Lexicon for Wizard.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">First you
should make Practice Rune Azia&nbsp; : Combine 1 Lapis Lazuli, 1
Batwing and 1 Bone Chips in your Concordance of Research.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Practice Rune Beza : Combine 1 Turquoise, 1 Fire
Beelte Eye and 1 Rusty Slashing Weapon in your Concordance of
Research.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">When you've
made the Practice Rune Azia and the Practice Rune Beza, Combine
them in the appropriate Tome for your Class. The result is a
Complete Practice Rune that you can sell to a merchant for some
money. Complete Practice Runes becomes trivial at skill 21.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Apprentice Rune Azia and Beza. For them you need
a Pixie Wing and a Froglock Eye but it seems that nobody can't
yet find them.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Training Rune Azia and Beza. Complete Training Runes
becomes trivial at skill 62.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Journeyman Rune Azia and Beza. Complete Journeyman
Runes becomes trivial at skill 95.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#008080" size="4" face="Dahaut">-
Researching&nbsp; Spells :</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">First
things to do is to buy the appropriate Tome for your Class : the
Tome of Endless Enchantments for Enchanter, the Elemental
Grimoire for Magician, the Book of Dark Bindings for Necromancer
and the Lexicon for Wizard.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
have to know what components search : Pages for Enchanter, Words
for magician and Necromancer, but there are different Words for
both, and Runes for Wizard, but not Practice Runes.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">You can find
them only on NPC of the equivalent level to the researched Spell.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">After that
you should reserach Spells till they're become trivial. But this
way is very difficult because you will have a higher failed rate
than the Practice Runes way and the components are more difficult
to find.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
Research skill follow this formulae : (level - 15) x 5, so at
level 16, the level you get the skill, you will have 5 in your
Research skill.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">So at
level 36 you will become a MASTER RESEARCHER :)</font> </p>
