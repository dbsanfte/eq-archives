raise your Swimming Skill it is very easy, you just have to Swim
and the Skill will go up alone. You don't have to put any
Practice Point in this Skill. So Swim, Swim, Swim and you will
become Master Swimmer easily and soon you will Swim more faster
than the Boat and a lot of Creatures.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">And
remember Swimming is very useful for certain Zone like Kedge Keep
or Ocean of Tears.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Near the
Monk Guild and the Theatre of the Tranquil in Freeport is a small
pool area that when entered you will Swim without fear of
drowning. This can also be done in the water when you first enter
Grobb.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Your
Swimming Skill will go up following the formulae : (Level x 5) +
5.</font> </p>

level 20 you will become MASTER SWIMMER :)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The best
character to become a master Swimmer is an Iksar because they
begin at Level 1 with 100 in the Skill and at this level they can
anyway increase the Skill level.</font></p>
