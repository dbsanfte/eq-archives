is a Skill only for patient adventurer. But you need absolutely
nothing to raise this Skill. So you don't need to put any
Practice Point in this Skill and you don't need to buy anything
to Practice it, all you need is a NPC.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">When
you're Begging you will get only 1 Copper or when you will become
a good Beggar you will occasionaly get 1 Silver.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A good
method to increase your Begging Skill is to find a place to Beg
and Fish at the same time. Another one is during a Fight with an
Humanoid NPC, turn Attack off, Beg, and then Attack again, all in
rapid succession, it will helpful for Classes that don't have
Taunt Skill.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">But
remember that when you're Begging, to be ware of your Faction
because NPC will not like to be bored for Coppers, so Train this
Skill with a NPC that like you and regard you Aimably or Warmly
is the best.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not
sure but the Skill raise like the most of Skills, with this
formulae : (Level x 5) + 5.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">So at
level 20 you will become a MASTER BEGGAR :)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The best Character to
become a Master Beggar is an Enchanter, a Magician, a
Necromancer, a Shaman or a Druid because they can Beg to their
Pet.</font></p>
