nosave><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">ll Characters, except
Human, begin with at least 2 Languages, Common and its own
Language. For example, an Erudite begin with Erudite and Common.
But everybody can learn as many Languages he want.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">There are 2 methods to
learn a Language :</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">- You can put Practice
Points in the Language you want to learn at your Guild Trainer.
Additional Languages start to become available to you as you move
up in Levels. but it is the unrecommended method because Practice
Points will be more useful to other Skills.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">- You can ask to someone
else that speak, the Language you want to learn, to group with
you and to program a random sentence into a hot key and spam it
to you over and over. But you will not see the change in your
Skill until you zone. That is an easy and quick way to speak a
Language. So you don't need to put any Practice Points in this
Language.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">But remember that you can
become master only in your principal Language, because the max
for a non-principal Language is 100.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Speak different Languages
is useful if you do magical Research, to read Research Book and
learn formulae. Also, sometimes you can find Scrolls and Books
written in different Languages. And that is nice for roleplaying
aspects and to learn more about the history of Norrath.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">You are
already MASTER LINGUIST in your principal language :)</font> </p>
