is not an easy skill and it cost a lot of money, but you will
probably get a lot of money because they are a good demand for
your creations. So i recommend to put about 3 or 5 Practice
Points in this skill to start to train it.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">For this
skill you don't need to buy any container but it means that you
can make train your skill only in a town. The only things you
have to buy all the time, except components, is a Flask of Water,
don't use a Summoned Flask of Water neither a Foraged Flask of
Water, they do not work.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most of components are
stackable so you will need to pick one off the stack to do your
smithing. Just control-click on a stack to pick up one item.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The first step is to make
Metal Bits, that you should keep to make about all Smithing
Items. Combine 2 Small Bricks of Ore and 1 Flask of Water in a
Forge. Metal Bits are trivial at skill 21.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The second step is to make
Scaler : combine 1 Metal Bits, 1 Flask of Water and 1 Scaler Mold
in a Forge. Scaler becomes trivial at skill 41.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The third step is to make
Lantern : combine 1 Metal Bits, 1 Flask of Water, 1 Lantern
Casting Mold and 1 Bottle in a Forge. Lanterns becomes trivial at
skill 68.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The fourth step is to make
Skewers : combine 1 Metal Bits, 1 Skewers Mold and 1 Flask of
Water in a Forge. Skewers becomes trivial at skill 115.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER SMITH :)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make
Pot : combine 1 Metal Bits, 1 Flask of Water, 1 Pot Mold and 1
Standing Legs Mold in a Forge. Pots becomes trivial at skill 122.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make
Sewing Kit : combine 1 Metal Bits, 1 Flask of Water, 1 Needle
Mold and 1 Thimble Mold in a Forge. Sewing Kits becomes trivial
at 135.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you can make Banded
Cloak : combine 1 Flask of Water, 1 Cloak Mold and 2 Sheets of
Metal in a Forge. Now you will really make a lot of profits.
Banded Cloaks becomes trivial at 175.</font> </p>
