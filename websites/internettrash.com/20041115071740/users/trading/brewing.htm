decide to train your Brewing skill, you don't need a lot of money
and only a little time because it is a relative easy skill to
increase. So that is not necessary to put any Practice Point in
this skill.</font></p>

to do your Brewing. Just control-click on a stack to pick up one
item. But remember to put your food in a higher Inventory Slot
than your Foraged Brewing Items or you will eat all your
components.</font></p>
