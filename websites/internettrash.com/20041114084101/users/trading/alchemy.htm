is not an hard Skill but a little expensive. This Skill is
available only to Shaman who have reached the Level 25. So you
don't need to put any Practice Points in this Skill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Potions
will operate on the User as if they were Spells Cast by a Shaman
of the Level of the imbiber. Be ware of Potions are not Stackable
with each other, however, each seems to be Stackable with Shaman
Regular Buffs, and a few Potions do seem to interact with each
other provided Stats do not overlap. Drinking another identical
Potion will Cancel the Effects of the previous. You must be
standing still in order to Drink the Potion.&nbsp; Also, it
should be noted that Levitate, and Water Breathing Potions
require the same Components than the appropriate Spell to be
used. Potions have the same Limitations as the Spell (Shrink can
only be used in a Dungeon, SoW can only be used Outdoors, ...).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The First
things to do is to buy a Medicine Bag to be capable to do what
you want where you want.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most
of Components are Stackable so you will need to pick one off the
Stack to do your Alchemy. Just control-click on a Stack to pick
up one Item.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To Start I
recommend to make Lesser Stability : Combine 1 Lucern and 1 Sage
Leaf in your Medicine Bag. Lesser Stability becomes trivial at
skill 17.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Minor Aura of Cold : combine 1 Birthwart and 1
Allspice in your Medicine Bag. Minor Aura of Cold becomes trivial
at skill 27.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Minor Null : combine 1 Fenugreek and 1 Mandrake in
your Medicine Bag. Minor Null becomes trivial at skill 32.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The fourth
step is to make Unlife Awareness : combine 1 Elderberry and 1
Fennel in your Medicine Bag. Unlife Awareness becomes trivial at
skill 42.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Kithor's Disease Treatment : combine 1 Lady's Mantle
and 1 Echinacea in your Medicine Bag. Kithor's Disease Treatment
becomes trivial at skill 57.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Ant's Potion : combine 1 Sumbul and 1 Celandine
in your Medicine Bag. Ant's Potion becomes trivial at skill 70.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Potion of Heat : combine 1 Sage Leaf, 1 Benzoin and 1
Blue Vervain Bulb in your Medicine Bag. Potion of Heat becomes
trivial at skill 96.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Potion of Purity : combine </font><font size="2"
face="Comic Sans MS">1 Lucern, 1 Night Shade and 1 Blue Vervain
Bulb</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
in your Medicine Bag. Potion of Purity becomes trivial at skill
103.</font></p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER ALCHEMIST :)</font></p>
