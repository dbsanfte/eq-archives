<p><span lang="en-us"><img src="Images/bmaj.jpg" alt="B"
nosave width="90" height="70"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">aking is an easy and a
cheap skill. You don't need to put any Practice Point in this
skill but if you want you can put at least 1 Practice Point.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">First things to do is to
buy a portable Spit from Traders Holiday in East Freeport and a
Mixing Bowl. Like this you will be capable to do everything you
want where you want. </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Comic Sans MS">And remember to always use a bought Flask of
Water, not a Summoned one neither a Foraged one.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most of Components are
stackable so you will need to pick one off the stack to do your
Baking. Just control-click on a stack to pick up one item. But
remember to put your food in a higher inventory slot than your
baking items or you will eat all your components.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To start I recommend to
cook Edible Goo : just combine 1 Fire Beetle Eye and 1 Rat Ear in
your Spit what are easy to find in newbie areas. Edible Goos
becomes trivial at skill 21.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should cook some
Sandwiches : Bear, Mammoth, Rat or Wolf sandwich. Just combine 1
Piece of Bread and 1 Bear, Mammoth, Rat OR Wolf Meat in your
Spit.&nbsp; Rat Sandwiches becomes trivial at skill 26 and Bear,
Mammoth or Wolf Sandwiches becomes trivial at skill 31.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Next an easy way to
increase your skill is to cook Batwing Crunchies. Combine 1
Batwing with 1 Frosting in your Spit. Batwings can be found in
newbie areas. Batwing Crunchies becomes trivial at skill 46.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Next step is to cook Beer
Braised Meat : Bear, Gator, Lion, Mammoth, Rat or Wolf. Combine 1
Spices, 1 Short Beer, 1 Bear, Gator, Lion, Mammoth, Rat OR Wolf
Meat in your Spit. Beer Braised Meats becomes trivial at skill
68.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the next step is an
important step but not an expensive step : you will cook Fish
Fillet. Combine 1 Jug'O Sauce with 1 Fresh Fish in your Spit and
by a success you will obtain 2 Fish Fillets. Fishes can be fished
or bought, but with this one you will begin to accumulate some
profits. Fish Fillets becomes trivial at skill 82.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should cook Fish
Rolls : combine 1 Batwing with 1 Fresh Fish in your Spit. You
will make a lot of profit with this one. Fish Rolls becomes
trivial at skill 135.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER COOKER :)</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The best Character to
become a Master Cooker is a good Potter and a good B</font><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">lacksmith</font><font
size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">. A Wood Elf, a Ranger, a Druid or
a Bard would be nice because they can Forage Components needed to
cook a lot of Food.</font></span></p>
