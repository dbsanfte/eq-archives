Tailoring skill is a very difficult skill to raise but does not
cost a lot of money and the success rate is not so bad. So I
recommend to put between 1 and 5 Practice Points in this skill.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The first
things to do is to buy a Small (2 Slots), or Large (8 Slots)
Sewing Kit and to keep with you all the time.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most
components are not stackable so when you work on your Tailoring
skill you need to empty out all your Backpacks.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To start
this skill I recommend to make Silk Swatches. Go kill a lot of
Spiders and combine 2 Spider Silks in your Sewing Kit. Remember
to not use Spiderling Silks, Spider Silks are not stackable but
Silk Swatches yes. Silk Swatches becomes trivial at skill 15.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Next step
is to make Patchwork Mask : combine 1 Ruined Bear, Cat OR Wolf
Pelt and 1 Mask Pattern in your Sewing Kit. The Pelt depend of
the Mask Size : Bear Pelt for Large Mask, Cat Pelt for Medium
Mask and Wolf Pelt for Small Mask. Patchwork Mask becomes trivial
at skill 26.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The third
step is to make Raw Silk Mask, very nice Item for a Caster. Just
combine 1 Silk Swatch and 1 Mask Pattern in your Sewing Kit. Raw
Silk Mask becomes trivial at skill 39.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Studded Mask : combine 1 Medium Quality Bear, Cat or
Wolf Pelt (depend on the Mask Size), 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Stud in
your Sewing Kit. Be ware because there is a high failed rate for
this step and Medium Quality Pelts are hard to find. Studded Mask
becomes trivial at skill 56.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Cured Silk Mask, a nice Item for a Monk. Combine
1 Silk Swatch, 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Heady Kiola in your Sewing
Kit. Cured Silk Mask becomes trivial at skill 82.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make </font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Hand-Made
Backpack : combine 1 High Quality Bear Skin and 1 Backpack
Pattern in your Sewing Kit. With this step you will gain a lot of
money. Hand-Made Backpack becomes trivial at skill 88.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Once Cured
Silk Mask becomes trivial you need to make Reinforced Mask, a
good Item for Mid-Level Druid. Combine 1 High Quality Bear, Cat
Or Wolf Pelt (depend on the Mask Size), 1 Mask Pattern and 1
Steel Bone in your Sewing Kit. Reinforced Mask becomes trivial at
skill 122.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER TAILOR :)</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The best
character to become a Master Tailor is a good Blacksmith, a good
Brewer, and a good Potter. And a Wizard or a Druid is nice for
this because they can teleport themselves all over.</font> </p>
