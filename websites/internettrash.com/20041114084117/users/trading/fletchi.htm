<p><img src="Images/fmaj.jpg"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Comic Sans MS">letching shouldn't be an hard Skill, but you
will not make a lot of profits, due to the fact that only a few
Class are able to use Bows. So I recommend to put about 5
Practice Points.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The first
thing to do is to buy a Fletching Kit to be able to do what you
want when you want.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most
of Components are stackable so you will need to pick one off the
stack to do your Fletching. Just control-click on a stack to pick
up one item.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To start I
recommend to make Arrows till you have more in the Skill, because
Bows are more difficult to make. Start to make Class 1 Wood Point
Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1 Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled
Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Several Round Cut Fletching and 1 Large
Groove Nock in your Fletching Kit. Class 1 Wood Point Arrows
(Type 1) becomes trivial at skill 16.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The second
step is to make Class 1 Wood Point Arrow (Type 2) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Several
Round Cut Fletching and 1 Medium Groove Nock in your Fletching
Kit. Class 1 Wood Point Arrows (Type 2) becomes trivial at skill
36.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Class 2 Wood Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1 Field
Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Several
Parabolic Cut Fletching and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching
Kit. Class 2 Wood Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill
46.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The fourth
step is to make Class 1 Bone Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Bone Arrow Shaft, 1 Sevaral
Round Cut Fletching and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching
Kit. Class 1 Bone Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill
68.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Class 3 Wood Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Several
Shield Cut Fletching and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching
Kit. Class 3 Wood Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill
80.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then I
recommend to make Class 1 Bone Hooked Arrow (Type 2) : combine 1
Hooked Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Bone Arrow Shaft, 1 Several
Round Cut Fletching and 1 Medium Groove Nock in your Fletching
Kit. Class 1 Bone Hooked Arrows (Type 2) becomes trivial at skill
102.</font></p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER FLETCHER :)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Class 4 Wood Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Set of
Wooden Arrow Vane and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching Kit.
Class 4 Wood Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill 122.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you
should make Class 1 Ceramic Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Ceramic Arrow Shaft, 1 Several
Round Cut Fletch and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching Kit.
Class 1 Ceramic Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill
135.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
step is to make Class 5 Wood Point Arrow (Type 1) : combine 1
Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Set of
Bone Arrow Vane and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching Kit.
Class 5 Wood Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill 162.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you

Field Point Arrowhead, 1 Bundled Wooden Arrow Shaft, 1 Set of
Ceramic Arrow Vane and 1 Large Groove Nock in your Fletching Kit.
Class 6 Wood Point Arrows (Type 1) becomes trivial at skill above
200.</font></p>
