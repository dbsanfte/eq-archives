nosave><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">ake Poison is not an
hard neither an expensive Skill, but will not make a lot of
profits with this Skill, as there is only Rogue, who have reached
the Level 18, that can use Poisons. This skill is available only
to Rogue who have reached the Level 20, and you will be able to
increase in only at Level 24. So it will be good to put between 1
and 5 Practice Points in this Skill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Poisons can be use on
Weapons to add some extra Damages on creatures.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The First things to do is
to buy a Mortar and Pestle, a lot of Suspensions and Vials, that
you can be bought from a Potter, to be capable to do what you
want where you want.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The most of Components are
Stackable so you will need to pick one off the Stack to do your
Poisonery. Just control-click on a Stack to pick up one Item.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To start I recommend to
make Spider Venom : just combine 2 Spider Venom Sacs, 1
Suspension, 1 Poison Vial in your Mortar and Pestle. You get back
the Pestle. Spider Venoms becomes trivial at skill 20.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should make Spine
Break : combine 1 Lined Poison Vial, 1 Constrict Suspension, 1
Thorny Ergot, 1 Delphinium in your Mortar and Pestle. You get
back the Pestle. Spine Break becomes trivial at skill 32.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make

Biles in your Mortar and Pestle. You get back the Pestle. Putrid
Bane becomes trivial at skill 56.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The fourth step is to make

Embalming Dusts in your Mortar and Pestle. You get back the
Pestle. Lyxt Wing Dust becomes trivial at skill 84.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should make
Leprous Puss : combine&nbsp; 1 Lined Poison Vial, 1 Suspension, 1
Bundle of Wormwood, 1 Darkbone Marrow, 1 Grave Mold in your
Mortar and Pestle. You get back the Pestle. Leprous Puss becomes
trivial at skill 105.</font></p>

<p><font color="#B900FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now you
are a MASTER POISONER :)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make
Brain Freeze : combine 1 Sealed Poison Vial, 1 Constrict
Suspension, 2 Gelsemium Rootsin your Mortar and Pestle. You get
back the Pestle. Brain Freeze becomes trivial at skill 131.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then you should make
Xegonie's Curse : combine 1 Sealed Poison Vial, 1 Constrict
Suspension, 1 Ash Hornet Venom Sac, 1 Cinder Hornet Pollen in
your Mortar and Pestle. You get back the Pestle.&nbsp; Xegonie's
Curse becomes trivial at skill 162.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The next step is to make

Thorns in your Mortar and Pestle. You get back the Pestle.

Suspension, 3 Frosty Daturas in your Mortar and Pestle. You get
back the Pestle. Cranial Cryofreeze becomes trivial at skill 204.</font></p>
