**** OUTRAGE **** <br>
<br>
&quot;In general I'd agree druids need significant work.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are a support class, not second class. &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;When I started DAoC way back when it first came out (literally a week after) I spent much time deciding on which character I wanted. Now I'm spending my time question why I chose a druid... &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;A druid might make an ok pet.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have 319 points I haven't spent as a 49 druid. If that doesn't say anything about the lack of depth or distinction about the class, I don't know what does.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Im not a druid, and im soooooo glad.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Something. Anything. Give us an angle. Please.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druid??? OH! You mean a bard without songs!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Basically all our lines (and we've only got three) are gimped. We've got nothing to put points into!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids need some offense!!! I don't care what anymore but we need something.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Id trade in my Druid in a flash.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I mean im still trying to figure out what the advantage of being a druid is&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hibernia should massively /appeal druid love . No more waiting for devs/teamlead this BS has been going on to long!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, just give us SOMETHING we do better then other classes. And I do not mean a 14 point realm ability that removes all the things other people can do to us.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids are an unfinished class&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Please Mythic, let me use my Druid to buff my alt on the same account, so that it will be usefull for ME&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Making a druid is something I wouldn't even do drunk&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As it stands, all we really do is leech xp/rp off the rest of our friends in game.&quot; <br>
<br>
**** NATURE LINE **** <br>
<br>
&quot;The Druid's nature line is a joke. <br>
&quot;...your pet licks your nearest attacker...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Putting points into nature is just plain questionable.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Pet the archers? you mean let my pet run to them so the archers can pet the pet dont you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;first you've got to convince the druids to invest heavily in a broken pet line... &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hibernia has the most heal-specced and buff-specced healing class in the game. (no kidding... our 3rd line is the worst in the game, where else do we put our points...)&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Our damage shield is a joke! Spec'd at 32 nature, it does 15 damage to the opponent. It just breaks root.. and is conc down the drain.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Spec in Nature line? for WHAT?!?! DOT that does pitiful HP of damage a tick? Pet that is green to you and any even con mob to you is Purple to them? AE Root, the weakest form of CC in the game? Don't even get me started on damage shield...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;DOT : low damage , high cast time, low range (useless in RvsR and in PvsMob, except to pull mobs, which other classes can do with a simple arrow) &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Pet : too low level, pulls aggro (useless over level 35 in RvsR or in PvsMob because it can't hurt anyone or even pull aggro against anything you would probobly intentionally want to kill) &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Have you noticed that all the sweet spec bonuses on our armor really do nothing? I would rather have had say str/dex/qui/resists than Nature that does absolutly nothing... I mean why did they bother?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;send in their pets to keep guards busy&quot; - yah .. that works... &lt;sarcasm&gt;&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;so I cast my DOT at the 1200 hp troll .. which I guess couldn't catch me in 30 sec, he has now been damaged 150 hp .. fear me!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Casted AE root is not the same as shout para/stun.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone who thinks a DoT that does less damage than a level 5 tank per round at level 45 is part of &quot;pass the crack rock&quot; crowd.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I just though the Druid pets looked cool&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Man I thought it would be neat to have a big ol' pet tank for ya. Course the higher I leveled the more that faded&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids, the overpowered class! 1 spec point a lvl.....and only 2 real spec lines! NERF them!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How was I suppose to know the pet was just for show?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn, 5 trees in a row... more firewood&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why is my tree so big it blocks me from seeing?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have yet to see anyone kill a lynx or a wolf to summon a tree&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Really what it comes down to is that if you want to avoid nature (and who can blame you there) you do NOT have a good alternative.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We could get by with 0.5 point/lvl because the most effective druid template is like 20/25/0 at lvl 50. There's a lot of truth in that statement.&quot; <br>
<br>
**** RvR **** <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids just want to be as effective as healers or clerics in RvR....hell, i would settle for being anything but a leech!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I was hitting an even con for 15-11 + 25 last night? COME ON!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids suck in Rvr, damage is done too fast to get a heal off. They have no offense whatsoever to speak of.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Whenever someone compares a druid to another class, they compare a druid who is: Fully buffed, with pet, with both instas, with damage add. Rarely, in &quot;real world&quot; situations, do druids find them in the above situation.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I agree Druids are boring because we can't fight and it sucks to be helpless while somone beats on you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Please go play a druid to 40+ and try out RvR and then come back and report. You WILL change your toon, after you do.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Only thing a druid has in open field battles is instant heals, once those are gone he/she is a doorstop.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;coming from the enemy side, the bard is at least 40 times more feared than the druid. We joke about druids. &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;i play a 34 druid and unfortunatly have been turned down many a time for RvR or PvE cause they are waiting on a Bard... but they do ask for my buffs before i go, kinda rude of them, but thats the facts of life... &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druid absolutely essential to a raid? Ummmm. Resurruct is absolutely essntial to a raid, in which case, I would take both bard and warden over the druid. Bladeturn spell alone is the most underestimated spell in the game. &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;On the battle field I mainly heal / res. I do not feel a true participant in RvR but rather an observer&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids... i don't know any dru....Hey! You mean the RP cows with the funy little pets! Yeah, they are easy to kill&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;In PvP a druid is a tag-along. Everyone wants one NEAR their group, nobody wants one IN their group... even with group purge, a mandatory skill for us, most groups would prefer to get RP earning people, then to guard against the possiblity of a mez..... and they know druids get killed first anyway, easy pickings&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So i've decided to make a class that can actualy serve a purpose in RvR and still be a support class in PvE&quot; - Immur Abberant, a level 50 druid who's abandoning his druid and making a cleric. <br>
<br>
&quot;Keep battles are boring... Rez, Heal, Rez, Heal... run down the hill so the now aggroed archers stop shooting ya... sit. Rinse &amp; Repeat&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's just no fun anymore to /stick, and toss up a weak heal when someone gets blasted. I hate sitting for hours doing nothing in keep defense. If we get some work ...i'd play again, but as it is, i just can't bring myself to run around with the group anymore, not contributing at all. I hope they fix the class soon or it will be a dead class.&quot; <br>
<br>
****REGROWTH**** <br>
<br>
&quot;Why bother increasing your regrowth, it makes you able to heal LESS with the same amount of mana.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Having the big ress at 40 Regrowth is no advatage. The better advatage would be that the ress spell was a damage spell..so maybe less people would have died in the first place.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;in substance any heal over 300 pulls too much agro and rarely is needed.. at 46 I still have no need for a larger heal spell&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Reseruct spells: (the one you get at level 10 is as good as any that follow, higher ones have high cast time.. you can't use in RvsR.. you never have the conveniace of having mana and time to ress someone with a big ress..and even if you did ress somone in battle with 30% power and hp..what good would he/she be if they have ress sickness and are doing 50% of their normal damage)&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;There is no advantage to having level 40 rezz, people just rezz them first since it take so long to cast.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Want to play a real healer?.... try a Mentalist! -&gt; 2x as many heals, higher mana cap, mana regen, and a quickcast for starters!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;People getting buffed should realize that it would be better to have another tank next to them , than have an extra 100 strength. And have a Warden, Ment or Bard healing them.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Bottom line is that there is no reason for the Druids to suffer inferior spell efficiency in their Regrowth and suffer inferior RvR capabilities in their Nature.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I stopped my Regrowth at 26, thinking that the top pet and the 34 str/con would make me a Battle Druid. 3 months after hitting level 50, Im still stuck in the support role&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Healing in RVR is sort of like trying to reach out to 7 dogs you've just unleashed.&quot; <br>
<br>
****NURTURE AND BUFFS**** <br>
<br>
&quot;Caps and concentration make it a bad investment above the 20s&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Because of concentration shortages, we are forced to resort to using our lower buffs to dish out enough buffs to our group, so why in the world would anyone invest the spec points in nuture above the 20s.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Even if you get them &lt;the higher Nurture buffs&gt; and put up with only have very few to hand out, they exceed caps once you get into the higher 30s and 40s.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We end up under buffing ourselves and putting NO buffs on our pets. It is ASSUMED that we and our pets are buffed when as a class we get evaluated. This is in fact a FALSE assumption.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Buffs for yourself? Who can spare the ConC?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nurture Druids are nice Pets....that's a good Druid...the AFK one in the portal keep&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Buff well and you can't heal, heal well and you can't buff, train Nature and you can't buff or heal.&quot; <br>
<br>
****REALM SKILLS**** <br>
<br>
&quot;got my group purge and purge... next is serenity 2. All I need is 400k rlm points, NO PROBLEM! &lt;sarcasm&gt;&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Wild Minion- A percent chance for pet to critical hit. This will really help my GREEN pet do damage.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Just hoping this isn't the long awaited druid love. *prays*&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm pretty tired of having &quot;all things druid&quot; be either on a timer or temporary.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Introducing!!! The 2002 group purge/purge druid cookie cutter edition with paper pet, tickleshield, resisting dot, useless af buff, low emp cap, huge mana sucking heals and long time rezzes!!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not going to waste more points on timered crap. I already have 2 Insta Heals that I get to almost use on occasion every 15 and 20 minutes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have to admit, that after spending my only 14 realm ability points to get our defining ability 'group purge', I wish I had not. This was to me, pretty frustrating, for I have been frustrated in RvR in general, feeling more like a leech than actually helping slay the invaders. <br>
<br>
****PvP Druids?**** <br>
<br>
&quot;I think Mythic will be amazed to find on then New PvP server that there are NO Hibernians there. <br>
<br>
Make another druid? you HAVE to be kidding! &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of all the healing classes the druid is probably the least desirable. Both the cleric and the healer get so much more to do to benefit their group than a druid does. I would bet that when the RvR server comes out the druid would be the least played of the 3 healing types.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why would anyone choose to make a druid as a primary healer in the RvR server?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;OK, our new PvP guild needs some healers, who's gonna roll a Cleric or Healer?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Bard on the new server? Bwahahahaha!! Druid perhaps? Muhahahaha!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If I felt some extremely strange wild urge to actually run say a heal class rather than a stealth class there is no way in the world I would be anything but a cleric.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What does a druid do? Heal, buff and res. <br>
What does a cleric do? Heal, buff, res, smite and stun <br>
What does a healer do? Heal, buff, res, mez stun, and paralyze .......No wonder druids are pissed&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Combine Druids and Bards, Give us 1.5 spec points and Music, Nature, Nurture, and Regrowth to choose from. Top that off with Blades, Blunt, Scale, Small Shields, and Staves. Ironically, we still wouldnt be as powerfull as Clerics&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Druids......No. Be a cleric.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
**** CUSTOMER ATTENTION **** <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but as long as our druid community remains complacent about the issues facing our class, we will not be getting anything in the way of help from Mythic.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But again, not enough of us are willing to speak up and tell Mythic that just because there are still druids playing the game, doesn't mean the class is fine as is.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;All naturalists since they attract support oriented players tend to be the less aggressive and vocal types.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;As said by Mythic before, the realms are balanced against one another..the classes are not compared to each other for balance. However, if you have broken classes that aren't played..how can you have balanced realms &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Solution: Get rid of Druid Class.. it is the worst class in the game. If ya want to be nice, let current Druids pick a comparable other class or become Ments to not create a Hibbernia healers shortage. Take the buff spells and the Insta heals and pepper them to the other Hibb classes to leave that ability in Hibernia. It only serves to weaken Hibernia as a realm as avergare 1 in 8 Hibbs become Druids. &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Mythic better fix us already because we obviously never quit... hehehe&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't quite realize just how deeply and totally Hibernia got screwed in this sweet deal. Mythic, seriously, just close Hibernia, obviously it isn't getting any Dev attention and it would be more honest with the players.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever happened to the &quot;druid pets are getting looked into&quot; thing? Same as the &quot;we are looknig into Hibernia, the red-headed stepchild&quot; thing... ignored, deleted and forgoten...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's time Mythic to throw out your ignorance and your hatred of druids(hibernia in general) and bring us up to equal footing.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We have been waiting 6 months for our pets to be fixed and Healers waited one week for group heal... yeah that is about fair.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#110d03><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub49.ezboard.com/ucarydeconnla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cary de Connla</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#006400>(5/20/02 12:59:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub49.ezboard.com/fhiberniaonguiniverefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thank your local druid!</span><hr size=1> I'm not bitter, really.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some things in that post weren't true, but overall, yes - Druids are the red headed step children of Mythic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Druids are usually 'nice' and quiet instead of making a big &quot;My class is gimped&quot;  Protest.  Although.. that is changing.<br>

As the game matures and people try out other classes in other realms, the disparity between the Hibernian healing classes and those of the other realms has become better known. Consider the Friar, for example, which gets very little play in Albion because it's far overshadowed by the Cleric - and yet both heals and fights better than any of the three Naturalist classes. If it were a Hibernian class, I'd bet it'd be far more popular.<br>
<br>
As the quote noted, players attracted to the Naturalist classes tend to be support-oriented and less likely to raise a fuss. Instead, they just quietly leave for greener pastures. And that's the pattern we've seen on Guinevere - high level Naturalists are becoming less common rather than more. Given how interdependent the Hibernian classes are, this is a very troubling trend. <p>Gwyddno Maolan <BR>

Oh well, eventually there'll be so little of us left those very same people will whine about it.  I admire those of you who've pursued on with the class, but I guess I just grew tired of it after a while.  I hope they redeem DAoC druids soon. Good luck!<br>

Perhaps I just play differently or distributed my original points differently than the majority.<br>

It seems to me like Hibernia suffers from &quot;class of the week syndrome&quot; and if druids'll just hang on they'll be back in the limelight again someday soon.
