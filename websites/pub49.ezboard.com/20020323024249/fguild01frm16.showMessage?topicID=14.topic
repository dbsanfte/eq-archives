<br>
I actually like the word (is it even a word?) eh, eh?<br>
<br>
But that above mention word is linked forever in my mind with Tex-ass.  And I HATE Tex-ass.  They are a bunch of inbreading hicks with big hats and belt buckles who seem to have a very huge case of state envy.  And they are so proud of their state, and yet I do not know why.  The tallest mountian there is a bunny hill, the tumble weeds are almost interesting and they have one, yes 1, natural lake.  But hey, they got oil and are the biggest state in the US right!<br>
<br>
/shakes head<br>
DIE Y'ALL THX, EH?!<br>
<br>
PS: no offence to Texans, with the exeption of Tyanu who is really not from Texas but claims she is.  I don't mind some Texans, and just really dispise your state is all.  Not to mention last time I was there a cockroach the size of Rhode Island chased me! <p><center><img src="http://usv.spineoftheworld.com/images/ashbanner1.jpg"><br><font color=red> Asherea Lonewolf - 57 (ABOUT F00KIN TIME) Preserver </font><br><font color=blue> Naharet Darkhealer - 51 Vicar</font> <br> <font color=purple> <b>Officer of <a href="http://usv.spineoftheworld.com">  Una Salus Victus </a></font></b>
