I've looked around and this seems like a pretty good chat system to hold our meetings in and for just chatting.  The chat server will be up and running during the day today (11/2/2001) for testing.  It is freeware, with no ads or anything.  It also seems to be a clean installing program and it's uninstall routine (accessed via Windows' Add/Remove Programs) cleans everything out it looks like (although it may leave a <STRONG>C:\Program Files\HyperChat Client</STRONG> folder which can be manually removed).  According to them it works in Windows 9x, NT, and 2000.  It also has a log feature.  :)

	<LI><A HREF="download/HyperChatClient_Setup.exe">HyperChat Client Program</A>: Download And Install this program first.  Please install the program into the default directory.
	<P>
	<LI><A HREF="download/covchat.exe">Company of Valor Chat Customizer</A>: This is a self-extracting ZIP file containing the configuration file needed to connect to the CoV Chat Server.  Once downloaded, run it, click on <STRONG>unzip</STRONG>, and then close it.
	<P>
	<LI>If you get an error message that a DLL is missing or required to run the program, then download and install the <A HREF="download/HyperChatDLLs_Setup.exe">HyperChat Support DLL</A> files (MFC42.DLL and MSVCP50.DLL).
