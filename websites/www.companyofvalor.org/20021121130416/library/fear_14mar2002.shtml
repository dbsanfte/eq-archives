First I would like to thank everyone that went along, everyone did great there. Okay, well, my pulling on Saturday could have been better, but it was my first time in Fear so I was on a steep learning curve. I feel bad for those that may have died as a result of my inexperience and slowing things down for awhile there. But, it was exciting though and gave me a new appreciation for what goes on and the amount of work required to pull one of these things off and the sacrifices many have to go through sometimes. 
<P>
Juror complimented CoV on our actions and behaviour in Fear.. no complaining, did our jobs, and fit in well. I also want to compliment everyone. Anyway, I had alot of fun there.. which is a testament to the quality and teamwork of everyone there on the raid and I'm not just talking about the CoV members.
<P>
I'm not done with the write-up but I'm getting short on time today and wanted to put up what I had.
