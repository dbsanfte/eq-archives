This page has two parts.  Part 1 is a description of the duties of the Raid Secretary/Master Looter.  Part 2 are the rules themselves.  Granted they both somewhat overlap.  Any changes or modifications to these rules will be announced before the specific event in a discussion thread about that raid.
<H2>Raid Secretary/Master Looter</H2>
After our last raid, a new position was deemed necessary, that of Raid Secretary/Loot Master.  This person will not be grouped or take part in the actual combat of the raid itself or the watching over of the participants health.  Their job is to document people present at the raid, which group(s) fought in which area, drops, which group looter has what item, which person won said item, and whether the winner has received said item.  This will then allow later reporting on the website of what items dropped, and who won them.  They should turn logging on with /log on at the beginning of the raid.  This person shall hold a rank of Elite Knight or Greater Scholar within the guild.
<P>
Before a raid, the Raid Secretary will research the dropped items and if possible prepare a list of items ahead of time so that they can answer the inevitible questions of "What are its stats?" and "What classes can use it?".  Some places lists aren't readily available so this may not be possible.
<P>
During a raid, each group leader (looter), will tell them what was dropped, and will be documented if necessary.  The Loot Master will then announce in the designated communication method (/ooc, /shout, /auction), what is to be rolled on, its stats, and those elligible (melee types, casters, etc) and if it's no-drop.
<P>
After rolls are complete, each group leader will tell the Loot Master the highest roll they witnessed (whether or not the person is in their group as this will be quicker than trying to pick out those in their group).  The Loot Master will then announce who won the item and then document when that person received the item.
<P>
The reason this position was created is that it is generally too difficult to perform this duty while at the same time fighting mobs, watching group members, making sure not to get left behind because you're writing something down and so on and so forth.
<P>
All were unanimous in support of letting the Raid Secretary roll on dropped items and should not be punished for taking on this important administrative roll. If they can get to a no-drop item then they may roll on it; otherwise, probably restricted to normal loot.
<P>
Currently, <STRONG>Atana Wolfestar</STRONG> is the Raid Secretary/Loot Master unless otherwise noted at the raid by the Raid Leader.
<H2>Loot Rules</H2>
The following are a list of rules those attending CoV Sponsered Events should expect.  These are not hard and fast rules and may be modified by the Raid Leader at the time of the event given the situation.
<P>
<OL>
	<LI><STRONG>The Raid Leader or assigned Raid Secretary/Loot Master has full control over loot distribution.</STRONG>  It is the responsibility of the raid leader (or raid secretary) to announce how loot is to be handled before the event.  If disputes come up during the raid, it is up to the raid leader or secretary to decide how to handle them.  If major disputes arrise then another CoV officer or Guild Leader, Mysstie, may be contacted.  All disputes shall be handled within tells or within a group chat later on.
	<P>
	<LI><STRONG>Loot will be distributed to those who can and will use it.  Standard Need Before Greed policy here.</STRONG>  You cannot roll on an item simply to wear it long enough to sell it if there are others who will use it. You may not roll on an item for one of your twinks, alternate characters, or for a friend's character, unless no-one at the event can use it. (see below).  Only characters present at the raid can roll on items they will use.
	<P>
	<LI><STRONG>If no one will use an item, any who wish may roll.</STRONG>  This goes for any item, regardless of value.  Any item that drops that will not be used, can be rolled on by anyone interested in it.  This is also the case for gems and other cash items.
	<P>
	<LI><STRONG>Items will be rolled on as they drop during the raid.</STRONG>  This goes for both no-drop and regular loot items.  Regular loot items may be rolled for at a more convenient time if need be; however, items should be rolled for as soon as possible to prevent a backlog.
	<P>
	<LI><STRONG>No-Drop items will only be rolled on by those who can and will use the item and who can readily get to the mob's corpse to loot it.</STRONG>  <EM>(we do not want people running all over the place, creating possible trains to try and reach some dead mob's corpse that will probably be rotted by the time they got there)</EM>.
	<P>
	<LI><STRONG>It was determined there are to be 3 categories of items: 1 no-drop, non class specific, 2 class specific (no drop or otherwise), and 3 regular loot. If someone wins a roll on an item in one of the categories, they may not roll for another item in that category until all present at the raid have also won an item in that category; however, they are elligible to for items in the other categories.</STRONG>
<P>
So for a simple example let's say Me, Jinni, and another wizard are on the raid. A no drop item comes up that we can all roll on, and Jinni wins it. Later on a Wizard only item drops. Both Jinni and the other Wizard can roll on it. The other Wizard wins it (or Jinni may). The next wizard only item will go to the other Wizard who hasn't won a class specific item yet. Later on a regular loot item is dropped. All of us may roll for it (regardless how many No-Drop or Wizard only items Jinn may have won). Obviously, need before greed applies; however, the categories were decided upon in the case that say Jinn won a no-drop non class specific item and then a Wizard only item drops that he would really rather have. Since he can't hand back in the no-drop item, he's out of luck (what if he were the only Wizard?). In the spirit of Need Before Greed, if I won a druid specific item, I would probably pass on normal loot rolls; however, I wouldn't be required to.
<P>
	<LI><STRONG>Other than no-drop items that are not immediately reachable, all raid participants may roll on any items dropped anywhere.</STRONG>
<P>
One reason behind this is say for example in ToFS, there are a couple of 50+ groups on the top floors. Down below is a 30-40s group however they are lacking a good healer. Should a high level cleric be punished for staying down below to watch for the health of the lower levels by being not allowed to roll on items dropped up top. If so, no higher level clerics may offer or want to stay down stairs.
<P>
	<LI>At the end of raid, all monies that CoV members have earned (as direct PP or from the sale of Junk loot items to merchants) during the raid shall be transferred to the Guild Vault to help offset the expenditure of gems and other items used during the raid.
