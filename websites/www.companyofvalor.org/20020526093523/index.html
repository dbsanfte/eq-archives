	<DD>Hiyas everyone! :) Well, I am starting to get things caught up here on the website.  Today I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> with the latest donations (thanks to all those who have donated!).  I have also updated the <A HREF="calendar/may2002.shtml">May Calendar</A>; although, I think I need to do some more work on it.  I might be a bit premature in mentioning this, but I have made a <A HREF="members/index.php">members only area</A> of the website that requires you to login using a character name and password which matches your membership list one.  Only two things you can do there now: (1)use an <A HREF="members/filemgr.php">Image Viewer/File Manager</A> for pictures and things you may have uploaded and (2) to logout.  The way it's currently setup, you'll need to re-login to that area of the site once a day.
<P>
I've actually been spending some of my evenings working on some of this *behind the scenes* stuff as opposed to playing.  <STRONG>GASP</STRONG>.  Hehe.. actually I have many things on my mind to do with the website.
<P>
*HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Hiyas :).  Reminder tonight at 8pm Central is an Officer's Meeting.  Details in the officer's forum.  Also, have added a number of things to the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> in the past few days.  Thank you to all who have made donations!  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Wednesday, April 25, 2002</STRONG>
	<DD>I have a preliminary <A HREF="library/2ndanniv_20apr2002.shtml">2nd Anniversary Party</A> page up with all the pics I took. *sigh* I still missed alot of people that were there though.  I have also recently updated the <A HREF="calendar/apr2002.shtml">April</A> and <A HREF="calendar/may2002.shtml">May</A> calendars.  The Vault will be updated later on today or tomorrow as there are a few things I need to double-check first.

	<DD>I've made an update to the <A HREF="download/covchat.exe">CoV HyperChat Customizer</A> due to my ISP changing IP addresses around.  This is a self-extracting ZIP file containing the configuration file needed to connect to the CoV Chat Server. Once downloaded, run it, click on <STRONG>unzip</STRONG>, and then close it.  This will be the last time you should have to do this as now it will not matter if my IP address changes. *HUGS* Mysstie :)
	<P>

	<DD>Hope everyone had a great holiday weekend.  The <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> has been updated with some spells that you Clerics above level 52 might want to look at as they are Luclin drops.  Thanks to those who donated the spells and items.  The <A HREF="calendar/apr2002.shtml">April Calendar</A> has also been updated.  The Hyperchat Server is up, but down if that makes sense.  The IP address has changed again (I was not able to get my DSL to work Monday night until about 3am this morning, I was playing on my backup dial-up account which was also problematic for awhile).  As such I have decided to configure the HyperChat Server and Client such that the IP address changes will not matter anymore (using something called Dynamic IP Publishing where the client program gets the address of the server from a file stored on the net).  Tonight or tomorrow I'll have a new CoV Chat Customizer available for download.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD><IMG SRC="images/easter_basket.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="101" BORDER="0" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="easter basket"> I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Easter weekend. :)  Quite a few things going on this weekend..check the calendar.  As many of you know already I'll be out of town Friday evening through Monday morning to spend time with the folks and grandma for the holiday. :)  *HUGS*  Mysstie <BR CLEAR="all">

<P>I have also made updates to the <A HREF="calendar/mar2002.shtml">March</A> and <A HREF="calendar/apr2002.shtml">April</A> Calendars as well as posting a couple pics of <A HREF="library/vswedding_23mar2002.shtml">Viron and Selinaa's Wedding</A> during the Faydedar raid which unfortunately did not happen because a mob did not spawn two hours after it should have.  So, at least something good did come out of Saturday.  :)  Congratulations to the new couple!  *HUGS* - Mysstie

	<DD>EZBoard seems to be somewhat fubar'd.  Getting errors when replying or making new posts.  Doing this to me multiple EZBoards, including their help forum.  Many users reporting same problems.  So hopefully it will get fixed soon.  While it seems I can make replies, I can't make a new thread right now.  :/  - *HUGS*.. oh reminder, <A HREF="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fcrimsonsygilguildevents.showMessage?topicID=364.topic" TARGET="event" CLASS="fotp">CoM raid at 7:45pm Central</A> for those that signed up for it.

	<DD>Reminder, for those that were there, tonight Fear will be going on again from 7:00pm-Midnight Central time.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Hiyas everyone :).  Added a new Bard website link to the <A HREF="resources.shtml">Resources/Links page</A>.  Updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> again due to ditching some items, shuffling of items between Vaultress and Vaultette, and some new donations.  Reminder that tonight at 8:00pm Central or so is the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm45.showMessage?topicID=23.topic">Oldfart's Trakanon's Teeth Hunt</A>.

	<DD>I've made a page for <A HREF="library/xoctwedding_2mar2002.shtml">Xaos and Octavious's Wedding</A> with the log and all the pictures I've received from it so far.  May Tunare bless the Newlyweds!  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DT><STRONG>Friday, March 01, 2002</STRONG>
	<DD>Oh let's see.. updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">vault</A> again after making a delivery.  Also, added a <A HREF="raidsheet.shtml">Raid Group Organization sheet</A> that you can print out which Viron sent to me a few days ago which was designed by Thommas in Excel.  As such, I've added a link to the <A HREF="resources.shtml">Resources</A> page as well to it.  Thanks guys! *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
