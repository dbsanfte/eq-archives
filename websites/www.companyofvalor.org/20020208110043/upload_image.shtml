<H1 ALIGN="center">Upload Image</H1>
Before uploading an image, please convert the image to a <B>.jpg</B> or <B>.gif</B> before submitting it.  The EQXXXXX.BMP files that Everquest Saves are quite large.  Also, I would recommend renaming any file with your character name in the filename.  For example, I would name my files <B>mysstie_something.jpg</B> or <B>mysstie_thisthing.gif</B> and so on.
<P>
In order for you to upload an image, you must enter the first name of your character and your password.  Unfortunately, some have uploaded non-EQ related images and/or have attempted to store their images for their personal websites here and password protection had to be implimented.
<P>
After browsing and the pressing upload, please be patient.  It will take awhile for it to transfer.  It will tell you when it is done and display the image.  It will also tell you how to reference your image.  An email will also be sent to me notifying me of who uploaded what.  :)
