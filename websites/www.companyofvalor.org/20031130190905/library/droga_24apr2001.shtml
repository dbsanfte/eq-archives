<P>
I would like to thank everyone (I won't name names because I know I would leave someone out) from CoV and Healers United and some others who helped us out on our raid.  I think we had some 25-30 people in all at the beginning.  I would especially like to thank Dahlea of Healers United for all the rezes she did.  :/  
<P>
While it took us awhile to get everyone there and get going, once we did, I think most had a good time with the dungeon crawl, adventure and learning about a new place to hunt for many.  There were some lessons learned that we'll use for future raids to hopefully make things run smoother, get folks ready on time, etc.  :)
<P>
Through the course of the night, the only thing of note that dropped was a Drogan Obsidian Dagger: Warrior Only, Piercing, 5/25, WT 1.5, Effect: Obsidian Shatter.   We did fight five goblin warders if memory serves; however, none dropped the Shroud of Nature. :(  So far the raid has netted 340pp for the Guild Treasury. :D
<P>
Following are some pictures that I took.  If anyone else took any, be sure to share them!
