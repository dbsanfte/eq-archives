<P>
*sigh* My sis has been corrupted by a Rogue's love for her and has turned into a Hunter of Shadows.  (Mykie's surname is Shadowhunter).  Of course I still love her and what Mykie doesn't know is that we're secrectly trying to pull him from his darker ways hehe.  (oops, not a secret anymore).. *giggles*.
<P>
Thank you to everyone who came to witness their union.  May Tunare bless the newlyweds.  :)
