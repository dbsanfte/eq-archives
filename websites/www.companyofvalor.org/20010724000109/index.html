	<DD>Reminder, Language classes tonight at 8pm Central in Steamfont by the zone to LFay.  Also, I have re-enabled the image uploader.  I have added a member/password verification to it. *hugs* - Mysstie :)
	<DT><STRONG>Wednesday, July 18, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>The <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault/Treasury</A> has been updated.  The <A HREF="calendar/jul2001.shtml">Calendar</A> has been updated.  The <A HREF="hallofvalor.shtml">Hall of Valor</A> has been updated.  Please see <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm1.showMessage?topicID=304.topic">Atana's post</A> concerning this.  In the near future I will be adding a 3rd option for the primary/secondary setting in the membership list to indicate if a character in the guild is the main character in CoV, but not that person's primary character.  An example of this would be Juror whose main CoV character is Tonsure, but Juror is his primary.  I have temporarily disabled the Image Uploader as well. - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Reminder, guild wide meeting tonight at 8pm Central in EQ Chatroom <STRONG>Company of Valor</STRONG>.  Please enter the game and read the motd to get the password.  Also, I have been working on the membership list moving folks to MIA status who are rumored to no longer be active in Norrath, more on this later.. we're still going through the list.  :)  *hugs* - Mysstie
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Friday, July 13, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Hmmm, Friday the 13th whattya know hehe.  Okay, looks like I got the Primary/Secondary Character indicator for the <A HREF="members.shtml">membership</A> list working correctly (That <STRONG>P</STRONG> Column).  I would appreciate everyone edit their character information and make the appropriate change.  At the bottom of the list I've put summaries for the number of Primary, Secondary, and Unknowns (those that have not been edited or I've gotten a password to yet) in the guild.  This will help everyone know how many actual people are in the guild.   *hugs*  -  Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Monday, July 09, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault/Treasury</A> and <A HREF="calendar/current.shtml">Calendar</A>.  I would also like welcome Doel back home from her Basic Training, YAY!!  *gives Doel a huge hug*  Guess I should have done that sooner, huh?  hehe.  Anyway, I've decided to have an Official Welcome Home Doel and birthday party for Marizeka and Phenoix at least on Sunday the 22nd at 3pm in the arena.  Hopefully this is a good time for most to make it.  See the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=136.topic">message board</A> for more.  Some may have thought this was going to be tonight; however, work has decided to enterfere with it.  :(  Hopefully with the newly scheduled one more will be able to make it.  :) *hugs* - Mysstie

The zone to Paw is located in South Karanas.  <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/splitpaw.html" TARGET="new">Zone information and map</A>.

	<DT><STRONG>Friday, June 22, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Tonight, Friday at 7pm Central, Healers United is doing one of the MUSHs.  On Saturday at 2pm Central is a Kael raid being lead by Loral of Healers United.  I had planned on going on the Kael raid myself as I really need to work on those factions and getting an eroded tunic would be nice, but my RL sister is coming down to my folks for the weekend and I want to go visit them.  :) Good hunting and safe journies all!  *hugs*  - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, June 21, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder tonight at 7:00pm Central in <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/steamfont.html" TARGET="new">Steamfont</A> near the LFay Zone, Company of Valor's College of Linguistic Studies will once again be in session.  Who will become the next master linguist?  :)  *hugs* -  Mysstie
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Wednesday, June 20, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Okay you peoples, many of you have not been keeping your membership info uptodate (elbows Modim among others).  If you do not have a link on your name you can click yet (you don't have a password), send me an <A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">email</A> with your <STRONG>Character(s) names</STRONG> so I can give you one!  *hugs*  -  Mysstie
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, June 19, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder, today the Dalnir raid is still going on, please send tells to Wonfu.  Also, at 7pm Healers United is having a druid school.  Then at 9pm in Steamfont, Jinnikinic's little brother Dinikin is getting married to Machien.  Also, I have been playing around with the membership list and some errors are possible.  I have added a button that will let you display the members sorted by Level then name.  Other sorting options may follow.  May Tunare bless you!.  *hugs* - Mysstie  :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Wednesday, June 13, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>For those wishing to participate, Healers United is having a raid on <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/befallen.html" TARGET="new">Befallen</A> at 7pm Central tonight.  Please let Juror (maybe Tonsure) know if you wish to attend.  Level range of this zone is 7-25+.  Dungeon is geared to those in their teens and twenties. - *hugs* Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, June 05, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Well, I have completed (I think) making the membership list a lot more secure.  The names in the membership list that have a link to click are those I have assigned a password to and let the member know what the password is via email or tell in game.  With this new setup only you will be able to get at your character's information to view and change it.  This setup will also allow you to place your email address in and only you and I will be able to see it.  Over time I will be sending emails and finding folks in game to let them know what password I gave them.  You can of course change your password anytime and the passwords are stored in an encrypted format.  Now maybe my tailoring skill will keep its proper level of 29 instead of 290 that someone keeps changing it to.  I will be using EZBoard to send out alot of the emails, so you may want to check your email accounts that you used to register with EZBoard over the next few days.  :)  
<P>
I have also updated our <A HREF="calendar/jun2001.shtml">calender</A> to include the slew of Healers United events. - *hugs*  Mysstie  :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, May 29, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Been slowly working on <A HREF="calendar/jun2001.shtml">June's Calendar</A>.  Also, if anyone has any pics from the Mistmoore Raids, I'd appreciate it if you could send them to me.  I seem to have left my camera at home during that raid.  :(  *hugs* Mysstie
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Wednesday, May 23, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Jinnikinic has sent me some more pictures of the <A HREF="library/cazicthule_raid_15may2001.shtml">Cazic Thule</A> raid.  Also, a reminder that tonight at 7pm Central is Healers United's raid on Unrest lead by Juror.  <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/unrest.html" TARGET="new">Zone information and map</A>. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, May 22, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder, tonight at 8pm Central is our raid on Castle Mistmoore.  <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/mistmoore.html" TARGET="new">Zone information and map</A>  Please see the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=94.topic">message thread</A> for more information as well.  This is basically a member assistance raid where we are helping some members get items needed for quests and such.
<P>
Also, I am aware of problems with the website with the clock, counter, membership page and other things not working.  I have notified the web hosting company of these problems.  Numerous customers have been calling in similar problems and the system admins have been notified, so, hopefully they will be resolved soon. 
<P>
*hugs* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Okay, I've got the <A HREF="library/dalnir_raid_14may2001.shtml">Dalnir Raid on the 14th</A>, <A HREF="library/wargparty_14may2001.shtml">Wargurine's Going Away Party</A> just after it, and <A HREF="library/cazicthule_raid_15may2001.shtml">Cazic Thule Raid on the 15th</A> up now. - Mysstie :)

	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, May 17, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>The Guildwide Meeting for 8pm Central today has been cancelled due to possible work obligations which could make me late (I am working on a project deadline).  Right now, I think I may reschedule it to Thursday, May 31st. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Monday, May 14, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder that tonight is the Raid on Dalnir which starts at 7pm Central.  As the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=96.topic">message board</A> states, the raid leader for this is Oxxan.  The main objective for this raid is to get some crescent armor for our monks.  The zone entrance to Dalnir is kind of a pain to find and get to (I was attacked by two things on the way).. so if you are coming to the raid.. start your journey there well ahead of time.  It took me 20 minutes to get there from the Dreadlands, and that was with sow, levitate, camo, knowing how to get there, and only myself to worry about.  If you don't have them, go to <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET="new">www.eqatlas.com</A> and print off maps of all the pertinant zones you may be traveling through.  Since I will be late myself (by an hour or two), I have already camped near Dalnir.  Also, sometime/somehow during the raid, we'll have to throw a going away party for <STRONG>Wargurine</STRONG> as tonight will most likely be his last night in Norrath for many months as he's due to ship out for Navy Basic on Wednesday morning.  Sigh.. his strong sword will be missed by all.
	<P>
	I have also added a new link to an EQ music video of sorts in the <A HREF="library.shtml#downloads">Library</A>.  Throughout the day I will also be modifying the Calendar quite a bit.  It has some things on it that have been cancelled and some that aren't listed and some with the wrong times.  Once I've got everything corrected, will let you know here. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	Cont.. okay I have updated our <A HREF="calendar/current.shtml">Calendar</A>.  You will notice I have included links to Healers United's events with a nifty icon to distingush them.  Healers United has been very helpful in providing assitance on our raids and events.  Let's help them out too!.  As of late, the alliance has had the appearance of being somewhat lopsided.  Healers United members have helped us with many of ours and let's try and show like support.  This was of course unintentional, and some may have not even been aware that we were welcome at their events or that they even had anything going on.  I will do a better job in informing our members which events we are welcome to.  :)  I've spoken with Dahlea and made an apology to them; although, she said none was needed and that no wrong had been done.  For those interested, <A HREF="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fhealersunitedfrm13.showMessage?topicID=156.topic" TARGET="new">read this</A>.  For those in CoV that do not know.. HU and CoV have a long history together.  Many HU member's have their non-healing characters in CoV.  There are also many friendships between our guilds.  Also, if you've looked at mine and Soulduster's wedding pictures, you'll notice Healers United next to my name.  Anyway, here's to having fun together!  I need to kill more giants! hehe  *hugs* - Mysstie :)
<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, May 10, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Just a reminder that tonight are language classes.  They will last from 7pm to 8:40pm Central, afterwhich at 9pm Central, the Elite Knights and Greater Scholars have a meeting in an EQ Chatroom.  At least Oxxan and I will be there teaching.  Please make a list of the languages you are excellent in before hand so you can tell the group leader and they can decide who will teach what, also please either get to Felwithe on your own sufficiently ahead of time or be standing at a druid/wizard portal by 6:30pm so things can be started on time. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, May 08, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Added some snapshots from <A HREF="library/vpwedding_04may2001.shtml">Vixi and Pippon's marriage</A>, updating the <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A> in the process. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Friday, May 04, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder that tonight at 9pm Central in the Arena will be the wedding of Vixi and Pippon Rabidwolf! - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, May 01, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Added a few things to the <A HREF="library.shtml#download">Library</A> page.  I think you might enjoy them. - Mysstie :)
