I almost didn't make it in time for this one as I was in Kedge raid just before it.  Thanks to everyone who helped Kenderlin get this part of his Epic from General V'ghera in Kithicor Woods.

We had some pesky level 10 guy looking at the corpse just before this.  Ouze wanted me to clarify this picture.  Ouze behaved honorably during this raid.  :)  My apologies for possibly making him look like a ninja looter given the text in the picture.
