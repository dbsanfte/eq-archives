<EM>Yes, I stole some of the following from our <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=54.topic">message board</A>, being lazy right now LOL</EM>

Hello everyone,
<P>
We want to thank everyone that came out for the language fair/best of the best tournament tonight. We especially want to thank Maac, Drevon, Atana, Oxxan and Laldyen for their help.
<P>
Overall I think the event was a success. The language spots filled up quickly and I tried to teach some languages to as many as I could. This will be easier next time as their are a few people now capable of teaching a majority of the languages.
<P>
The tournament was also a success. It was a little rough at times to keep track of what was going on but for our first one I thought it went well.That being said everyone walk softly around the following people as they are the champions of the guild at their level

<UL>
	<LI>level 1 through 5 vacant</LI>
	<LI>level 6 through 10 Raren</LI>
	<LI>level 11 through 16 Khailee</LI>
	<LI>level 17 through 20 vacant</LI>
	<LI>level 21 through 25 Maac</LI>
	<LI>level 26 through 30 Hardywork</LI>
	<LI>level 31 through 35 Traxxle</LI>
	<LI>level 36 through 40 Oxxan</LI>
	<LI>level 41 through 45 Yabon</LI>
	<LI>level 45 through 50 vacant</LI>
	<LI>level 50+ Jinnikinic</LI>
</UL>
Congratulations guys enjoy your titles until the next tournament.
<P>
The FFA Battle Royale had to be canceled due to a meddling enchanter outside the guild
<P>
I hope everyone had fun and look forward to doing this again
