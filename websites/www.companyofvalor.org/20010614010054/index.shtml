	<DD>For those wishing to participate, Healers United is having a raid on <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/befallen.html" TARGET="new">Befallen</A> at 7pm Central tonight.  Please let Juror (maybe Tonsure) know if you wish to attend.  Level range of this zone is 7-25+.  Dungeon is geared to those in their teens and twenties. - *hugs* Mysstie :)

	<DD>Well, I have completed (I think) making the membership list a lot more secure.  The names in the membership list that have a link to click are those I have assigned a password to and let the member know what the password is via email or tell in game.  With this new setup only you will be able to get at your character's information to view and change it.  This setup will also allow you to place your email address in and only you and I will be able to see it.  Over time I will be sending emails and finding folks in game to let them know what password I gave them.  You can of course change your password anytime and the passwords are stored in an encrypted format.  Now maybe my tailoring skill will keep its proper level of 29 instead of 290 that someone keeps changing it to.  I will be using EZBoard to send out alot of the emails, so you may want to check your email accounts that you used to register with EZBoard over the next few days.  :)  
<P>
I have also updated our <A HREF="calendar/jun2001.shtml">calender</A> to include the slew of Healers United events. - *hugs*  Mysstie  :)

	<DD>Been slowly working on <A HREF="calendar/jun2001.shtml">June's Calendar</A>.  Also, if anyone has any pics from the Mistmoore Raids, I'd appreciate it if you could send them to me.  I seem to have left my camera at home during that raid.  :(  *hugs* Mysstie

	<DD>Jinnikinic has sent me some more pictures of the <A HREF="library/cazicthule_raid_15may2001.shtml">Cazic Thule</A> raid.  Also, a reminder that tonight at 7pm Central is Healers United's raid on Unrest lead by Juror.  <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/unrest.html" TARGET="new">Zone information and map</A>. - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Reminder, tonight at 8pm Central is our raid on Castle Mistmoore.  <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/mistmoore.html" TARGET="new">Zone information and map</A>  Please see the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=94.topic">message thread</A> for more information as well.  This is basically a member assistance raid where we are helping some members get items needed for quests and such.
<P>
Also, I am aware of problems with the website with the clock, counter, membership page and other things not working.  I have notified the web hosting company of these problems.  Numerous customers have been calling in similar problems and the system admins have been notified, so, hopefully they will be resolved soon. 
<P>
*hugs* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Okay, I've got the <A HREF="library/dalnir_raid_14may2001.shtml">Dalnir Raid on the 14th</A>, <A HREF="library/wargparty_14may2001.shtml">Wargurine's Going Away Party</A> just after it, and <A HREF="library/cazicthule_raid_15may2001.shtml">Cazic Thule Raid on the 15th</A> up now. - Mysstie :)

	<DD>The Guildwide Meeting for 8pm Central today has been cancelled due to possible work obligations which could make me late (I am working on a project deadline).  Right now, I think I may reschedule it to Thursday, May 31st. - Mysstie :)

	<DT><STRONG>Monday, May 14, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder that tonight is the Raid on Dalnir which starts at 7pm Central.  As the <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=96.topic">message board</A> states, the raid leader for this is Oxxan.  The main objective for this raid is to get some crescent armor for our monks.  The zone entrance to Dalnir is kind of a pain to find and get to (I was attacked by two things on the way).. so if you are coming to the raid.. start your journey there well ahead of time.  It took me 20 minutes to get there from the Dreadlands, and that was with sow, levitate, camo, knowing how to get there, and only myself to worry about.  If you don't have them, go to <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET="new">www.eqatlas.com</A> and print off maps of all the pertinant zones you may be traveling through.  Since I will be late myself (by an hour or two), I have already camped near Dalnir.  Also, sometime/somehow during the raid, we'll have to throw a going away party for <STRONG>Wargurine</STRONG> as tonight will most likely be his last night in Norrath for many months as he's due to ship out for Navy Basic on Wednesday morning.  Sigh.. his strong sword will be missed by all.
	<P>
	I have also added a new link to an EQ music video of sorts in the <A HREF="library.shtml#downloads">Library</A>.  Throughout the day I will also be modifying the Calendar quite a bit.  It has some things on it that have been cancelled and some that aren't listed and some with the wrong times.  Once I've got everything corrected, will let you know here. - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	Cont.. okay I have updated our <A HREF="calendar/current.shtml">Calendar</A>.  You will notice I have included links to Healers United's events with a nifty icon to distingush them.  Healers United has been very helpful in providing assitance on our raids and events.  Let's help them out too!.  As of late, the alliance has had the appearance of being somewhat lopsided.  Healers United members have helped us with many of ours and let's try and show like support.  This was of course unintentional, and some may have not even been aware that we were welcome at their events or that they even had anything going on.  I will do a better job in informing our members which events we are welcome to.  :)  I've spoken with Dahlea and made an apology to them; although, she said none was needed and that no wrong had been done.  For those interested, <A HREF="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fhealersunitedfrm13.showMessage?topicID=156.topic" TARGET="new">read this</A>.  For those in CoV that do not know.. HU and CoV have a long history together.  Many HU member's have their non-healing characters in CoV.  There are also many friendships between our guilds.  Also, if you've looked at mine and Soulduster's wedding pictures, you'll notice Healers United next to my name.  Anyway, here's to having fun together!  I need to kill more giants! hehe  *hugs* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Just a reminder that tonight are language classes.  They will last from 7pm to 8:40pm Central, afterwhich at 9pm Central, the Elite Knights and Greater Scholars have a meeting in an EQ Chatroom.  At least Oxxan and I will be there teaching.  Please make a list of the languages you are excellent in before hand so you can tell the group leader and they can decide who will teach what, also please either get to Felwithe on your own sufficiently ahead of time or be standing at a druid/wizard portal by 6:30pm so things can be started on time. - Mysstie :)
