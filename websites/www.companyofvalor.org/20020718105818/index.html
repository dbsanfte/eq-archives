	<DD>Okay.. the <A HREF="members/editmember.php">Character Editor</A> has had some modification done to it.  It will now let you associate alternate characters with your main one.  Basically, login to the site as your main character and go to the Character Editor.  Then, you will see a new form with its own background color.  At first the only character in the drop-down list will be your main character.  Below is a link to add alternates.  Once you've added your alternates you can go back to the character editor and be able to choose which character you want to modify the information on.  This way, you can just stay logged into the site with your main character.  At this moment you do still have to login with the specific character to change it's password.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Hey.. it's the longest day of the year!  Well, seems we got a lot of pictures in for the wedding between Kuadine and Chebby hehe.  Go have a look at all of them <A HREF="library/kuawedding_19jun2002.shtml">here</A>.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, June 13, 2002 2:13:00 PM</STRONG>
	<DD>I have disabled the Character/Member Editor for the moment as I am changing how the date joined field is stored.  At some point I'll be working on the Membership list as a result so that page might generate an error if you happen to look at it while I am working with it.  Lots of stuff going on tonight.  :)  *HUGS* - Mysstie
	<P>
	Follow-up... well, it seems as if the date strings I've saved over time are in a couple different formats and as such will take a bit more work for me to convert them all into a standard numerical format that will allow for sorting and so on.  So it will be later tonight or tomorrow sometime before it's working again.  As a reminder, look to your right for stuff going on today.  :)

	<DD>Hiyas :) I've finally made a page for <A HREF="library/kdwedding_06may2002.shtml">Kenlaien and Darlea's Wedding</A>.  In the process of doing this I discovered something that has caused me to disable the Image Uploader while I fix something with it.  Has to do with filenames that have spaces in them and the differences between Windows, UNIX, and forms in how they handle them.  In some places it substitutes "%20" in place of a "space" which confuses things at times.  I've noticed EZBoard doing this and sometimes it thinks it can't find the image.  "%20" is the Hexidecimal value of the "space" character.  Yes, I know, this is as clear as mud to many of you, but I know what I'm doing... usually.. hehe.  What I will probably do is have it convert any spaces in the filename to underscores before it saves it on my end.  This will also make it easier when posting them to EZboard.  *HUGS* - Mysstie  :)
	<P>
	30 minutes later.. okay, it's back up LOL.
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, June 11, 2002 1:07:52 PM</STRONG>
	<DD>Whew.. hehe.  Okay, I have updated the <A HREF="calendar/jun2002.shtml">June</A> and <A HREF="calendar/jul2002.shtml">July</A> calendars with the plethora of events that found their way into our <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3">Events</A> forum.  I have also updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> with many new items with many older, duplicate items succumbing to the wrath of our spring cleaning.  Thank you to all those who donated items!  :) *HUGS* - Mysstie
	<P>
	Reminder.. tonight at 6:30pm Central is both the ORQ Kael raid for those doing that and <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm3.showMessage?topicID=415.topic" TARGET="event">Eclat's one night Hate Raid</A>.

	<DD>Well in case you're blind hehe, the site now says when the CoV Hyperchat Server is <FONT COLOR="#008000"><STRONG>Online</STRONG></FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><STRONG>Offline</STRONG></FONT>.  I should probably put that on the Online Chat page as well huh?  I'll do that next. :)  Lot's of work still going on with the website in various places and in some places you might see an error or two but I generally fix them pretty quick cause it's usually something I did that caused it hehe.  Well, back to work.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Hiyas :).  Well I think the <A HREF="members/sendmail.php">Send Member Email</A> and <A HREF="members/editmember.php">Character/Membership Editor</A> features are working ok again so I have re-enabled them.  Everyone should set their email preferences.  Currently, the only members who can be sent an email using it is me hehe.  Hopefully this will change as you all set your preferences.  Now to a programming task for work.  Never ends hehe.  If you have any comments about it, <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm38.showMessage?topicID=23.topic">post a reply here</A>. - *HUGS* Mysstie :)

	<DD>Hiyas :).  I am going to be working on various aspects of the website today and as such some areas may become temporarily disabled.  The Image Uploader had been disabled but is now back up. The <A HREF="members/sendmail.php">Send Member Email</A> function is currently down and might be for a day or so. - Mysstie :)

	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, May 30, 2002</STRONG>
	<DD>Hiyas everyone :).  Several things of note.  <STRONG>First</STRONG>, new membership into the guild has been temporarily suspended while we review/work on some procedures.  <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1152.topic">Read this</A> for more information.  <STRONG>Second</STRONG>, I have moved the <A HREF="members/upload_image.php">Image/Screenshot Uploader</A> into the <A HREF="members/index.php">Members Only</A> area of the site and changed navigational links accordingly.  The upside to doing this is that once you login you do not have to supply a name and password for every image you send in.  <STRONG>Third</STRONG>, I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> with some spells that were donated.  All for now. *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, May 23, 2002</STRONG>
	<DD>Hiyas everyone! :) Well, I am starting to get things caught up here on the website.  Today I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> with the latest donations (thanks to all those who have donated!).  I have also updated the <A HREF="calendar/may2002.shtml">May Calendar</A>; although, I think I need to do some more work on it.  I might be a bit premature in mentioning this, but I have made a <A HREF="members/index.php">members only area</A> of the website that requires you to login using a character name and password which matches your membership list one.  Only two things you can do there now: (1)use an <A HREF="members/filemgr.php">Image Viewer/File Manager</A> for pictures and things you may have uploaded and (2) to logout.  The way it's currently setup, you'll need to re-login to that area of the site once a day.
<P>
I've actually been spending some of my evenings working on some of this *behind the scenes* stuff as opposed to playing.  <STRONG>GASP</STRONG>.  Hehe.. actually I have many things on my mind to do with the website.
<P>
*HUGS* - Mysstie :)
