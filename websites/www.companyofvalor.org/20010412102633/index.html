	<DD>Because of their deeds, actions, character, time within the guild, and other factors, Yabon has been promoted to Greater Scholar and Drevon to Elite Knight!  Posted several messages in the message board, please read them.  :).  I am looking at some other calendar options.. one possibility would let others besides just me add things to it.  We'll see. - Mysstie

	<dd>Well.. can't connect to message board so I will put this here.  Last night I slipped on the ice and wound up getting a hairline fracture in my left elbow (just got back from doc).  Needless to say, doing things with just my right arm is kinda tough as I need to keep my left one in a sling for now.  Be going to a bone doc tomorrow and also calling back to confirm xray readings.  Until I can use my left arm effectively, I really can't do much on EQ except logon and just chat. :/  Geez typing one handed is slow lol.  Blah... - Mysstie </dd>

(See the message thread in Guild Events for more info).  Starting time is somewhere between 8pm-9pm Central.  Probably closer to 9pm Central when Doel can get on.  By the way, 9pm Central is 10pm Eastern, 8pm Mountain, 7pm Western. - Cya there! *hugs* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Added the result of our <A HREF="library/dalnir_raid_23jan2001.shtml">raid on Dalnir's</A> with some pics.  Thanks to Wargurine for sending in his pics of the pile of corpses :).  If anyone else has any pics, just email them to me and attach them.  I can convert them if you wish.  Updated the <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A> page accordingly. -  Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><B>Tuesday, January 23, 2001</B>
	<DD>Okay everyone, tonight is the raid on Dalnir's.  We will zone into Dalnir's at <B>8pm Central</B>.  For those not already in Kunark, we will meet at the <B>docks in Oasis at 7pm Central</B> to board the raft and then boat to Overthere.  Yes, this is the route that evil races take; however, good races can also, you just have to be clever. ;)  Even though I will be there, I will go ahead and outline what you need to do:
<OL>
	<LI>After boarding the raft at the docks in Oasis, it will take you to an island.  Hop off at the island and walk across to the otherside where another doc is.  The large boat that goes to overthere stops at this doc.
	<LI>Once the boat arrives, walk to the other side of the boat that faces the water, turn right and go towards the end of the boat and face the water.  Then, just stand and wait.  It will go past some sunken ships.  This is just before the zone to Overthere (at some point you go through Timorous Deep).
	<LI>As soon as the boat zones into <B>Overthere</B>, jump off, and swim to shore, which you will be facing.  You will notice a city wall off to your right.  Keep the wall to your right and swim to shore next to it. Do not wait for the boat to doc as the guards will probably rip you a new one. :)
	<LI>Wait for everyone to get to shore.  Once everyone is there, swim around the wall, keeping the wall on your left.  Eventually you will get back to shore on the otherside.  Stay near the wall and shore line.  Here you can bind yourself and others.  Once everyone is bound, swim back around the wall to where you were before.
	<LI>At this point, run along the shore going East, then turn South.  The zone to Warslike Woods is on the Eastern Edge of Overthere near the middle.  Check <A HREF="htttp://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET="new">EQAtlas</A> for maps and what not.  Once in Warslike Woods, we'll go on to Dalnir's.
</OL>

	<DT><B>Monday, January 22, 2001</B>
	<DD>The <A HREF="charter.shtml">charter</A> has been amended with information concerning Guild Organization and Officers.  As no comments were made in the message forum concerning the proposed amendments for the past week, I am guessing everyone is okay with them.  -Mysstie  :)
<P>
	I am still working on these scripts as I am thinking of adding an image description field to the form and have automatically update a gallery type webpage.  Anyway, as it stands it will let you upload images for use in the message board and what not.  Try to it out, go to the <A HREF="upload_image.shtml">image uploader</A>.
<P>
	<DT><B>Wednesday, January 17, 2001</B>
	<DD>I have added <A HREF="library/wargurine.shtml">Wargurine's story</A> to the <A HREF="library.shtml">library</A>!  Several new members have joined recently as well.  If you are not on the membership list, please send me an email or post a message in the New Members forum of the message board.  I would prefer the later as it will introduce you to everyone else as well.  :)  I moved the older news items to the message board archives.
<P>
Also, as a reminder, our <B>Raid on Dalnir</B> will be <B>Tuesday, January 23rd, at 8pm CST</B>.  Please see the message board for more information!  :)

	<DD><A HREF="library/najena_raid.shtml">Added screen shots from our Najena Raid!</A>  Thanks Doel for the picture of Najena before we got her hehe.  Updated the <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A> accordingly.  :)
<P>
	<DT><B>Thursday, January 04, 2001</B>
	<DD><B>Najena Raid today!  8pm CST!</B>  Let's try and start this one on time.  Get to your nearest druid/wizard portal at least 30 mins ahead of time, maybe even an hour.  We'll then bind in West Freeport for those that need it.  Then head on to Najena.
<P>
	<DT><B>Wednesday, January 03, 2001</B>
	<DD>I have added <A HREF="library/doel_bio.shtml">Doel's Bio</A> to our <A HREF="library.shtml">library</A>!  Have also added several new members over the last several days to the <A HREF="members.shtml">membership page</A>.  Remember to update your information when it changes.. like your level. - Mysstie  :)

	<DD>Happy New Year!!  I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season!!  I really missed everyone while I was away with my real-life family. *hugs*.  Just a reminder that this Thursday is our raid on Najena!  Check the Guild Events forum on the message board for more information!  Greater Scholars and Elite Knights (that would be officers hehe), check the forum for information about our next meeting(s) as well.. many important topics for discussion.  
<P>
	We will also have a guild wide meeting soon as well.  This particular one will be held out-of-game in an EQ Chatroom on the chat server.  There <B>could be</B> alot of discussion and chit chat at this one and I think it will qo quicker out-of-game.  Sometimes, in-game, does not lend itself well to chatting.  We will talk about some things discussed in the officer's meetings (guild structure, recruitment, officership, etc.) as I value everyone's input as do the other officers and members.  The difficulty I am facing is some things will be added to the charter that were not there before and as such, I want to make sure it is okay with everyone who is currently a member.  
<P>
I still want to schedule a face-to-face in game one as well.  :)
<P>
	I am proud to be a member of Company of Valor and deeply honored and privaledged to be the leader of such a fine band of noble adventurers.  I and the rest of Company of Valor are honored to have you, whoever is reading this, as a member as well.  If you ever have any questions, thoughts, ideas, concerns, feel free to let me/us know.  I think Company of Valor is great!  Many great, nice, honorable people are in it.  Together we can make Company of Valor one of the best guilds in Norrath. :)  Like any journey, there will be a few lavapits along the way, but together, as a team, we will go around, levitate over, or heal our wounds on the other side and continue on, being stronger, for having experienced it.
<P>
*hugs* - Mysstie :)
