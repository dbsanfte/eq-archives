<DIV ALIGN="center">Date: May 4, 2001</DIV>
<P>
Following are some snapshots from the beautiful wedding between Vixi and Pippon Rapidwolf.  Pippon's surname was Rabidwolf, but Vixi's love cured him and he is now Rapidwolf.  Before the ceremony, while waiting on guest to arrive, the Guide entertained us with his story of how the Halfling hop came to be.  I have his tale logged and will post that as well soon.
