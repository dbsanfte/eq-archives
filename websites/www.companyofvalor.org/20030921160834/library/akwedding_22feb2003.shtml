 I ventured inside this ancient tomb with some friends, and oh! The horrors we encountered!.  I barely made it out alive, 

but I did manage to pick up some [weapons to trade].'

this tomb in hopes of getting a sword I could use, maybe a warhammer.. Humm, yeah a hammer woulda been good also..  

Anyhow, I was unlucky in finding those, but I did manage to get a couple weapons... Sadly,  they're really more suited to 

a [Monk] or a [Knight], not really much use to a warrior like myself at all.'

Well, in any case, I picked up some velium hand wraps inside the Tomb here, quite nice.. Yes indeed.  I guess I would 

trade them to ya if you were to give me a warhammer for em.  I gotta say, I'm not picky.  I'd accept either a priceless or 

a primal warhammer, and give you these wraps in a straight trade.  Heck, I'd take one of each and give you both these hand 

wraps.'

they're all knights to me.  Well, look here, I got two swords from inside the tomb, but I'll be damned if either of em was 

suited for a warrior.  Clearly a knight's blade, what bad luck for me.  I was hopin for a good warsword.  That's why I`m 

standin out here ya know?  I was hopin I could find someone who might swap me either a primal or priceless warsword, and 

take one of these knightly swords in trade.'
