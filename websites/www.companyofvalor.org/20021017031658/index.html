	<DD>Hiyas! :).  Well, it seems as if EZBoard is down.. they had a hardware failure on at least the server that our board was on and maybe even the main EZBoard server itself.  I'm sure you've seen their message if you've tried to go there recently.  <EM>We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. We expect to be back up Thursday evening (8 PM Oct 3, 2002 PDT).</EM>  That would be, 10:00pm Central.
<P>
One thing.. I don't know if everyone was aware, but the multi-colored upcoming events there on the right and on the Calendar itself are actual links you can click on to go the Sign-Up/Information thread for that event on whatever message board it may be on.  When you click on the link it will spawn a new webpage.
<P>
The <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> has had some fall cleaning performed on it to make some room.  I would like to thank Viron and others (Viron gave them to me, I know he wasn't the only one at that raid) for the recent spell additions to the vault.  :)
<P>
Right now I am deciding the fate of the CoV HyperChat Server.  The main reason for me getting HyperChat in the first place was to have a logging feature for meetings.  At the time you could not log the EQ Chatrooms.  Well, now you can and any future meetings will probably be held in an EQ Chatroom.  Also, some folks have problems running HyperChat.  The only time I usually start the server now is when I know EQ is down for a patch or something.. and maybe that is reason enough to keep it around.  
<P>
One last thing, <STRONG>Brubell</STRONG> and <STRONG>Necratis Elderwolf</STRONG> have been in the guild exactly one month (both joined around September 3rd) and have been promoted to full membership!  :) - *HUGS* Mysstie

	<DD>The <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> has been updated yet again.  Actually, Xren donated most of the items that appeared around the 30th, thanks Xren!  This update is all spells that were from the Undead Bard/Trak raids to help Viron out.  Quite a few that the vault has never held before!  Congrats to both Viron and Wulfgyr in obtaining their epics over the weekend and thank you to all who helped out! *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

	<DD>Once again I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A>.  Thanks to Cyaan for donating several items and the many others who donate items to the guild.  :)  Hmmm.. looking at the daily snapshot over there on the right.  It doesn't change very often does it?  Yeah.. I noticed that too.  I've had thoughts of what to do differently with that space because if the image isn't going to change but once a month or longer, then there really isn't any need for that to be there.  Might put a list of links there.  I've also thought of making some kind of random image/snapshot display.  /ponder *HUGS* - Mysstie  :)

	<DD>Ahhh.. a clean frontpage again.  :)  Other than the normal <A HREF="calendar/aug2002.shtml">Calendar</A> and <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> updates, the biggest thing I've done recently is make the upcoming events over on the right look for events within the next 7 days and places appropriate links to sign-up threads.  I can make it any number of days but a week's notice seemed reasonable.  With the release of EQ's new user interface, I'll be making a section for it on the <A HREF="resources.shtml">Resources/Links</A> page soon.  Somewhere I'll be putting my own UI as well as I've done my own personal customizing to other's customizations LOL.  Been kind of taking what I like from here and there and starting to figure out how it all works.  Just wish there was a better way to check changes than needing to log in and out of the game repeatedly.  *HUGS* - Mysstie  :)
