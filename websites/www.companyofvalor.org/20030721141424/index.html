	<DD>Well.. got to fiddling around with the main page here to try something out.  To view any of the older news items, click on the link below and it will expand out to reveal the information.  As you can tell on the right side, several pages of the website have been changed.  The <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> should accurately reflect any donations made up until around 3:00am.  Thanks to all those who have donated!  :)
	<P>
	I have been working on a <A HREF="testcal/cov_calendar.php">new Calendar system</A> also.  This is a single script that generates the calendar on the fly (hence it will always be the correct month) instead of individual files for each month.  It's still in the development process, but you can view what's there so far.  Appearance wise it will look overall the same as the current one; however, the current day will be highlighted with a different color to make it standout.  The actual events are stored in a database which means once it's all done, officers and/or other designated persons will be able to add/modify/remove events from the calender.  Also, they'll be able to setup re-occuring events (such as the BGM event that is currently there).  It will be awhile before it's all done but once it is it will be cool.  :)  *HUGS*  Mysstie

	<SPAN id="march15" style="display:none;"><DD>Whew.. been busy today.  Doing alot of work on here.  First off, the website is back up! YAY!!!! <IMG SRC="images/ez/banana.gif" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="35" ALT="banana" BORDER="0"> Well, let's get to the changes.  First, due to the fact that a couple members have left EQ and a few recent raids and other donations, our <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A> basically doubled in its contents.  I have also put up some pictures I took during our first <A HREF="library/big_mondays.shtml">Big Game Monday in Umbral Plains</A>.  One thing I have added to the three latest events/gallery pages is the ability for folks to make comments about the raid or whatever and have them appear on the page.  
If you are logged into the website, it will automatically use your main character's name as the poster.  Works kinda similar to ezboard in that it has some <STRONG>bold</STRONG>, <EM>italics</EM>, and <U>underline</U> buttons and the ability to use some ezboard style emoticons.  Once you add a comment, it's there.  It can't be edited or deleted.  Really didn't have the desire to design a whole message board system lol.  I have also added some Legacy of Ykesha Spell Research information to the <A HREF="resources.shtml#loy">Resources/Links</A> page.  Also, I have added a separate <STRONG>Timezone</STRONG> information field to the <A HREF="members/editmember.php">User/Character Manager</A>.  It would be really cool if everyone would go set that.  I'll be incorporating the timezone information into the membership page.  While you're there make sure all your other information is correct.  Hmm, probably time to go check if there is anything I need to add on to the calendar.  :)  *HUGS*  Mysstie

	<DT><a class="dt" href="#" onclick="toggle('march10');return false;" title="click to toggle news">Monday, March 10, 2003 2:08:33 PM</a>
	<SPAN id="march10" style="display:none;"><DD>Well, I discovered a few problems accessing the site from work.  I was getting some funky script errors on the main page where it says "Welcome whoever".  Anyway, I corrected that problem.  Also it seems as if the domain name companyofvalor.org expired on February 23, 2003.  Apparently their previous email notification never made it to me or it got deleted amongst the other spam I got some day (argh).  Anyway, March 27th is the absolute deadline before it's deleted from the registry and I've renewed the name for two more years.
<P>
	Also, congrats to Eclipsse, Moonstarre, and Kaeran for completing their epics over the last week.  Woohoo!!! :)  - Mysstie *hugs*

	<SPAN id="march8" style="display:none;"><DD>Lordy I'm tired.  Think after I get done typing this I am going to bed LOL.  Okay... lot of changes to the website backend.  Pretty much everyone will have to <A HREF="members/index.php">re-login</A> to the website.  From now on you only have one login or user name.  For everyone this should be the first name of your main character which pretty much everyone used anyway.  Everyone's passwords are the same they have been.  If you have forgotten your password, <A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">let me know</A> and I will give you a new one.
<P>
Pretty much everything is working again, including the <A HREF="members/sendmail.php">Send Email</A> and <A HREF="members/editmember.php">User/Character Editor</A>.  When you go there now, it should allow you to make changes to any of your characters by either clicking on the quick <STRONG>Ding!</STRONG> button for that character or selecting the character to edit any of its information.  Now then, <STRONG><A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">if you notice that one of your characters is missing, let me know PLEASE</A></STRONG> as the website roster is like 60 characters shy of matching the in-game list.  Additionally, everyone please make sure your email address there is accurate.
<P>
  One other thing, all images or snapshots you upload will go into a directory based on your username, much like it did before.  However, I did have to move some images around.  For example, I moved images in Darlea's directory to Aubi's since Aubi is the username for her now.  Also, I moved things from Reaperkojon's directory to Kojon's since Kojon is his main character and thus username now.  I still have some things to tweak and work on here and there but everything you guys can do should be ok now.  Sorry about being pretty much non-existant in the game this week because of all this.  I am trying my best to get it all done by the end of the weekend in time for <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm38.showMessage?topicID=193.topic" TARGET="event" CLASS="cov">Monday Night Mobball</A> or whatever yah wanna call it LOL.  If you notice anything wrong or see a screen of errors or debug information, let me know!  *HUGS* - Mysstie :).
	<P></span>
	<DT><a class="dt" href="#" onclick="toggle('march5');return false;" title="click to toggle news">Wednesday, March 05, 2003 1:04:13 PM</a>
	<SPAN id="march5" style="display:none;"><DD>Finally added the spells we got from the Juggs raid to the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Guild Vault</A>.  Got a few new spells we didn't have before!  We had a great showing there.  I took several pics and looks like Wayland also sent some in.  Sometime this week should have a gallery/library page made for the event.  
	<P>I am doing a lot of work with the website's database and various scripts.  During the next few days you might experience odd behavior, see funky debugging information in some places possibly, or just simply not be allowed to do certain things such as editing your character information. *HUGS*  Mysstie <IMG SRC="images/smile.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALT="smile" BORDER="0">
