<H1 ALIGN="center">Hole Raid</H1>
<DIV ALIGN="center">Date: August 18, 2001</DIV>
<P>
This was a multi-guild raid lead by Kumasho of Fellowship of the Phenoix.  While we did not achieve our goals completely, everyone worked well together and we had a great time.  A quote from Kumasho about the raid results: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"I would say that the raid was both a success and a failure.
We failed because our objectives were not met. But even though no ratman guards were found and killed. The mimics drove us out and we came nowhere near the undead tower, we still advanced into the Hole with very few deaths."</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We had about four things drop during the raid that was worth rolling on:
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>Mudman Enforcer</STRONG> won by Ketch</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>A Smoldering Brand</STRONG> won by Kevra for Kenderlin who was in the middle of doing a CR for Bareldi</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>2 Elemental Binders</STRONG> won by Skythe and Kaaelin</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>Loam Encrusted Sash</STRONG> won by Domm</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Congradulations to the Winners and thanks go out to Juror for helping out Kumasho with the Loot Master roll.  :)
