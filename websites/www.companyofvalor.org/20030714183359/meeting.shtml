<H1 ALIGN="center">CoV Meeting Agenda - 8/9/2001</H1>
Since I type slow, I am preparing this ahead of time... please print this out for the meeting for reference.
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 1</U></STRONG><BR><BR>
After our last raid, a new position was deemed necessary, that of Raid Secretary/Loot Master.  This person will not be grouped or take part in the actual combat of the raid itself or the watching over of the participants health.  Their job is to document people present at the raid, which group(s) fought in which area, drops, which group looter has what item, which person won said item, and whether the winner has received said item.  This will then allow later reporting on the website of what items dropped, and who won them.  They should turn logging on with /log on at the beginning of the raid.  This person shall hold a rank of Elite Knight or Greater Scholar within the guild.
<P>
Before a raid, the Raid Secretary will research the dropped items and if possible prepare a list of items ahead of time so that they can answer the inevitible questions of "What are its stats?" and "What classes can use it?".  Some places lists aren't readily available so this may not be possible.
<P>
During a raid, each group leader (looter), will tell them what was dropped, and will be documented if necessary.  The Loot Master will then announce in the designated communication method (/ooc, /shout, /auction), what is to be rolled on and those elligible (melee types, casters, etc) and if it's no-drop.
<P>
After roles are complete, each group leader will tell the Loot Master the highest roll they witnessed.  The Loot Master will then announce who won the item and then document when that person received the item.
<P>
The reason this position was created is that it is generally too difficult to perform this duty while at the same time fighting mobs, watching group members, making sure not to get left behind because you're writing something down and so on and so forth.
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 2 / Vote 1</U></STRONG><BR>
With the creation of the Raid Secretary, should this person be allowed a chance to roll for items (not counting no-drop items as more than likely they would not be able to reach the mob's corpse).  My thought is that they should be given a chance to win something and not punished for taking on this administrative role.  The vote on this will have an impact on another vote concerning loot distribution.
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 3</U></STRONG><BR>
The following is the proposed change to our Raid Loot Distibution Rules:
<P>
The following are a list of rules those attending CoV Sponsered Events should expect.  These are not hard and fast rules and may be modified by the Raid Leader at the time of the event given the situation.
<P>
1. <STRONG>The Raid Leader or assigned Raid Secretary/Loot Master has full control over loot distribution.</STRONG>  It is the responsibility of the raid leader (or raid secretary) to announce how loot is to be handled before the event.  If disputes come up during the raid, it is up to the raid leader or secretary to decide how to handle them.  If major disputes arrise then another CoV officer or Guild Leader, Mysstie, may be contacted.  All disputes shall be handled within tells or within a group chat later on.
<P>
2. <STRONG>Loot will be distributed to those who can and will use it.  Standard Need Before Greed policy here.</STRONG>  You cannot roll on an item simply to wear it long enough to sell it if there are others who will use it. You may not roll on an item for one of your twinks, alternate characters, or for a friend's character, unless no-one at the event can use it. (see below).  Only characters present at the raid can roll on items they will use.
<P>
3. <STRONG>If no one will use an item, any who wish may roll.</STRONG>  This goes for any item, regardless of value.  Any item that drops that will not be used, can be rolled on by anyone interested in it.  This is also the case for gems and other cash items.
<P>
4. <STRONG>Items will be rolled on as they drop during the raid.</STRONG>  This goes for both no-drop and regular loot items.  Regular loot items may be rolled for at a more convenient time if need be; however, items should be rolled for as soon as possible to prevent a backlog.
<P>
5. <STRONG>No-Drop items will only be rolled on by those who can and will use the item and who can readily get to the mob's corpse to loot it.</STRONG>  <EM>(we do not want people running all over the place, creating possible trains to try and reach some dead mob's corpse that will probably be rotted by the time they got there)</EM>.
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 3a / Vote 2</U></STRONG><BR>
We need to decide on one of the following options:
<P>
6a.  <STRONG>You may win only one item until everyone else on the raid has acquired one as well.</STRONG>  You may roll on a better item that your prefer if you hand in your old item to be re-rolled on.  The raid secretary will keep track of this.  However, if you loot a no-drop item, you may not roll on another item until everyone else has won something, so think hard on this one.
<P>
6b.  <STRONG>Once you have won an item, you may continue to roll for additional items provided they are not the same one you already have.</STRONG>  Thus, if someone walks out with 5 items, well they were just lucky that night.  <EM>(If this option is chosen, <STRONG>Vote 2b</STRONG>: if a person has already won an item should they roll with an assessd penalty?)</EM>
<P>
<EM>(Something to think about: If 6b is voted on, are you gonna be mad if John Doe walks away with alot of wins and you got nothing?)</EM>
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 3b / Vote 3</U></STRONG><BR>
We need to decide on one of the following options:
<P>
7a.  Loot can be rolled on only by those who assisted in the killing of the mob that dropped it.  Thus, if all groups work towards the killing of a certain uber mob or wiping out all the mobs in a certain area, everyone may roll on the dropped items.  If, however, two groups are in different areas of a dungeon fighting different mobs, they can only roll on the items that their mob dropped.  For example, in Unrest, if one group is camping the ghost and another group is camping the knight, only the group which is camping the ghost may roll on DWBs.  This hold for both no-drop and normal loot items.
<P>
7b.  Other than no-drop items that are not immediately reachable, all raid participants may roll on any items dropped anywhere.
<P>
<EM>(I can see pros and cons to both of these.  The con to 7a is that it may cause some people refuse to join a particular assigned group if they find out they will not be fighting the mob(s) they want or have a lot of people wanting to swap groups in the middle of a raid to get chances at different items.  A potential big mess depending on the zone.  The pro to 7a, those that put forth the effort to kill a difficult mob (esp in a multi-level dugeon), might get upset if a lower level character won the item it dropped that they didn't participate in killing.)</EM>
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 4</U></STRONG><BR>
Discussion about Hate Raid and whether we should try to continue find an experienced raid leader/pull group or cancel and postpone the raid or possible try to get in on a Hate Raid that another guild with experience is doing so that we may learn.
<P>
<STRONG><U>Topic 5</U></STRONG><BR>
Discussion of other upcoming events and possible future ones.
<P>
