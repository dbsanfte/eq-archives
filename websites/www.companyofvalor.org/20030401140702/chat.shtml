Use our EZBoard chat: <a href="javascript:;" onClick="window.open('http://pub106.ezboard.com/bcompanyofvalor.communityChat','popup','status=toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,resizable=yes,width=450,height=350')"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/chat.gif" border="0"> <STRONG>Join Live Chat!</STRONG></a> 
<P>
Currently, we are no longer using HyperChat.  My initial reason for using it in the first place was for having meetings and being able to log them.  Since I can log stuff in EQ Chatrooms now, that is where meetings will be held.  I'll still keep HyperChat in case of emergencies.. like the EQ Chat Server goes down or something.  For general online chatting, use the chatroom that we have available with EZBoard.  <a href="javascript:;" onClick="window.open('http://pub106.ezboard.com/bcompanyofvalor.communityChat','popup','status=toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,resizable=yes,width=450,height=350')"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/chat.gif" border="0"> Join Live Chat!</a>

I've looked around and this seems like a pretty good chat system to hold our meetings in and for just chatting.  It is freeware, with no ads or anything.  It also seems to be a clean installing program and it's uninstall routine (accessed via Windows' Add/Remove Programs) cleans everything out it looks like (although it may leave a <STRONG>C:\Program Files\HyperChat Client</STRONG> folder which can be manually removed).  According to them it works in Windows 9x, NT, and 2000.  It also has a log feature.  :)
