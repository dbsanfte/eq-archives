	<DD>I've moved my website to a new hosting company which has caused all kinds of things to break again LOL.  I am slowly getting everything working again.  Please be patient.  :)
	<P>
	<DT>Tuesday, March 01, 2005 12:10:07 AM
	<DD>The <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A> has been rebuilt with all the old content now available.  Feel free to stroll down memory lane :).  Removed links to the Guild Vault since it's now empty.  Much of it went into Healers United's Guild Bank.  :)
	<P>
	<DT>Friday, February 25, 2005 7:15:13 AM
	<DD>The EQTypes for the additional buffs slots have been assigned.  I have modified both <STRONG>EQUI_BuffWindow.xml</STRONG> and <STRONG>EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml</STRONG> in my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> so that the text labels now work.  Due to the verticle length of the Window I am contemplating trying out a two column format buff window.  Hmmmm..  :)  I have also added some more past events back into the <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A>.
	<P>
	I am killing the Everlore newsfeed.  It hasn't seen a new news article since May of 2004.
	<P>
	<DT>Wednesday, February 16, 2005 8:20:12 AM
	<DD>With the release of Dragons of Norrath, the Buff windows were changed to allow for more buffs.  As such, I have modified my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> accordingly.  I have also gone away from using the <STRONG>EQUI_Animations.xml</STRONG> file since that one tends to get changed more than most and usually is the main cause for the UI blowings chunks after patches LOL.  Both the <STRONG>EQUI_BuffWindow.xml</STRONG> and <STRONG>EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml</STRONG> have been modified.  The EQTypes for these additional buffs have not been assigned yet so the corresponding labels (text) will not work.  As soon as they are, I'll make the modifications.  My buff window is getting long now LOL.  I may also play with the blue background graphics by customization the CS_Buttons.bmp directly which will give similar results as the Animations file modification.
	<P>
	<DT>Saturday, February 12, 2005 11:34:19 PM
	<DD>Well, it seems as if the <STRONG>EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml</STRONG> was modified to allow for 5 more buffs.  I have modified my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> to include the changes made.  I also changed it so that window is sizeable.  I also recently found out that my available webspace has been increased from 250 Mb to 5 Gigs!  As such, I will be putting up all the old snapshots and events pages.  :)  I will probably go ahead and change the <A HREF="library.shtml">Library</A> page to only have links to items that exist.  Why I didn't do that long ago I have no idea.  LOL.

	<DD>Logged on to EQ today, well yesterday, and noticed that the <STRONG>EQUI_Animations.xml</STRONG> and <STRONG>EQUI_BuffWindow.xml</STRONG> files had been changed to allow for 5 extra buffs as part of the Omens of War expansion.  As such, I have modified my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> to be compatible with this change.  As a result, the buff window had to be made longer.
	<P>
	<DT>Friday, July 16, 2004 2:07:46 AM
	<DD>I've updated my custom UI.  Seeing as they added the current/max Mana amount to the Inventory window, I decided to add the same to my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#group">Player/Group/Target/Casting Window</A>.  I have also included an image of how the new window appears below.  Haven't decided if that's the final placement of it but it's good enough for now.  The file modified was <STRONG>EQUI_GroupWindow.xml</STRONG>. :)  Enjoy!
	<P>
	<DT>Wednesday, May 19, 2004 12:37:05 AM
	<DD>Well, it looks like they undid whatever they did with the Buff window animation so I had to unflip the <STRONG>buff.bmp</STRONG> my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> uses.  Goobers... :)

	<SPAN ID="april2004" STYLE="display:none">Friday, April 23, 2004 12:45:06 AM
	<DD>One of the latest patches changed how the Buff window animation works.  It caused custom UIs to show a red line under spells with no color behind the text.  The solution was to horizontally flip the buff.bmp file my custom UI uses.  So, I have updated my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> with the flipped graphic.  The only file changed was <STRONG>buff.bmp</STRONG>.
	<P>
	<DT>Wednesday, April 07, 2004 10:14:51 PM
	<DD>I have once again manipulated my internet universe.  I have created <A HREF="http://www.mysstiewolfestar.com">www.mysstiewolfestar.com</A> <IMG SRC="images/ez/banana.gif" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="35" ALT="" BORDER="0"> which right now deposits you right here, the same as <A HREF="http://www.companyofvalor.org">www.companyofvalor.org</A>  <IMG SRC="images/smile.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE" ALT="">.  As such, this will slowly turn into Mysstie's website with a slightly different organization and references to Company of Valor of course.
<P>
I am aware that many of the old links within the Library and such do not work.  I am deciding what's warranted to re-post.  Most if not all of the reference materials should be intact.  If you find something that doesn't work that you would like to work, let me know.  You can send me email by a variety of means.  Both mysstie@companyofvalor.org and mysstie@mysstiewolfestar.com will work fine.  *hugs* - Mysstie 
	<P>
	<DT>Friday, April 02, 2004 4:10:22 AM
	<DD>Just wanted to mention that <STRONG>mysstie@companyofvalor.org</STRONG> is working again.  <IMG SRC="images/smile.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE" ALT="">  I have also updated my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#group">Player/Group/Target/Casting Window</A> to include the new animations in the Player and Target windows.  You still don't see the windows like before; however, this does stop the UIerrors.txt file from registering errors about the missing animations.  The files modified were <STRONG>EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml</STRONG> and <STRONG>EQUI_TargetWindow.xml</STRONG>.

	<DD>Okay.. things are starting to work again.  The Member's login is working and you can upload/delete images.  Currently, only Brubell, Wyndsinger, Minethos, and Eclippse's signatures/images are available since they appear to be the only ones that have done anything with it in the last couple months.  I've been looking on various message boards to see if anyone's signatures are missing that might have been stored here.  If you had something here that needs to be made available, let me know.  <SPAN CLASS="warning"><STRONG>Since my email address of mysstie@companyofvalor.org is not working at the moment</STRONG></SPAN>, please send any email to mysstie@markheadrick.com :)

	<DD>Well, companyofvalor.org is now pointing to my new site and uhm.. things are kinda jacked-up at the moment LOL.  Some things are acting strange.. lot of broken things.  Stay tuned.  :)
	<P>
	<DT>Tuesday, March 16, 2004 11:28:30 PM
	<DD>Now that the guild has been disbanded I will not be putting much effort directly towards this site.. not that I really have as of late.  It's amazing how much less the site has been accessed after August 2003.  I will actually be moving the contents of this site over to my new personal website at <A HREF="http://www.markheadrick.com">www.markheadrick.com</A> and this will slowly morph into Mark's Everquest page or some such thing.  www.companyofvalor.org will be changed to point to the new area over there at some point within the next month (so I'm not paying for two web hostings).  The companyofvalor.org domain name will remain valid for about another year.  (I got a free year's extension when I moved the registration from Melbourne IT to Network Solutions).
	<P>
	<DT>Saturday, March 06, 2004 3:37:39 AM
	<DD>Well, many knew it was coming, but on March 5, 2004, I disbanded CoV :(.  The website will be around for awhile and I'll still host signatures and such.  I have several ideas for the webspace.  Also, I noticed that some recent patches kind of busted my custom UI which I have now fixed.  Please visit my <A HREF="equi/mysstie_ui.shtml">Custom UI</A> page to download the latest files.  The only file that really needed modification was the <STRONG>EQUI_Animations.xml</STRONG> file in my custom Buff/Spell Effects window.  I did try to incorporate the new animation that happens when you're in auto attack mode into my combo Group window; however, it only seems to work within the Player window.  So, if you want to keep seeing that animation in the player window, then do not use the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file that is part of my custom Group window. My UI should now work fine with Gates of Discord.

	Hehe.. anyway, some changes have occured to the website.  Most notably, the <A HREF="members/vault.php">Guild Vault</A> has been moved to an area that only members have access to.  Really something that should have been done a long time ago.  If you are a guild member, you must be logged into the website with your username and password to gain entry (I am not talking about your EZBoard account). <SPAN CLASS="singing">I say whip it! Whip it good!</SPAN>  Oh sorry, it's that 80's music I am listening to hehe.  If you have forgotten your username and password, send me an <A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">email</A> with your character's name.  <SPAN CLASS="singing">If you wanna ride, don't ride the white horse.</SPAN>
<P>Also, the member's only forums have been reset.  Everyone that hasn't already will need to <A HREF="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2366.topic">post here</A> to regain access to the forums.  <SPAN CLASS="singing">If you wanna be rich, you got to be a ... If you wanna ride, ride the white pony.</SPAN>
<P>Ok.. sorry to put you all through my singing hehe.  Hmmm... (looks at the daily.. er semi-annual picture).. think that needs to be changed.  LOL.  Actually I do have one from Droga last night where I was with Laeoan, Enchantinone, Akuji, Kojon, and Kingbeast.. enjoyed myself.  <SPAN CLASS="singing">Rock.. steady, steady rocking all night long.</SPAN>  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
