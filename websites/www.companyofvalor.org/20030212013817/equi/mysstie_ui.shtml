<DT>Tuesday, February 04, 2003 2:58:08 PM
<DD>The patch this morning patched <STRONG>EQUI_Animations.XML</STRONG> which affected my Buff Window customization.  I have located the modifications and updated my <A HREF="#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> accordingly.  If you have been using my Buff Window, you must re-download and place the updated files in your Custom UI folder.
<P>
<DT>Saturday, January 11, 2003 1:32:07 AM
<DD>I have customized the Short Duration or song window (EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml) to match my main buff window.  I have included it in my <A HREF="#buff">Buff Window Customization</A>. 
<P>
<DT>Thursday, January 09, 2003 5:34:21 PM
<DD>I have modified my <A HREF="#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> to be compatible with the EQUI_Animations.xml file which was patched today.  If you have been using my Buff Window, you must re-download and install it.
<P>
<DT>Monday, October 21, 2002 9:53:41 PM
<DD>I have modified my <A HREF="#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> to be compatible with the EQUI_Animations.xml which was patched sometime over the weekend.
<P>
<DT>Wednesday, October 16, 2002 9:20:08 PM
<DD>I have modified my <A HREF="#buff">Buff Window Customization</A> to work with the new EQUI_Animations.xml file.  I have also modified the <A HREF="#group">Player/Group/Target/Casting Window</A> to use <STRONG>H M S L</STRONG> and <STRONG>A</STRONG> labels instead of the percent sign.  They stand for <STRONG>H</STRONG>ealth, <STRONG>M</STRONG>ana, <STRONG>S</STRONG>tamina, <STRONG>L</STRONG>evel XP, and <STRONG>A</STRONG>AXP.  Thought this might help some.
<P>
<DT>Wednesday, September 11, 2002 6:05:32 AM
<DD>I have modified the <A HREF="#group">Player/Group/Target/Casting Window</A> to include function key labels next to the group member names.  This was again an inspiration from an update that Loral made to his.  The second image shows and example of the new window's appearance.  <STRONG>EQUI_GroupWindow.xml</STRONG> is the only file modified from my previous version.  :)
<P>
<DT>Wednesday, September 04, 2002 3:34:23 PM
<DD>I modified the <A HREF="#install">How to Install</A> portion of the page.

<H2 CLASS="ezboard"><A NAME="complete">Mysstie's Complete UI</A></H2>

At the moment I am working on an interface that will work with all my characters, both Melee and Caster and at any level.  This interface should work with any patches made before the date above.  If there is a patch which modifies the default user interface I will be sure to test/modify mine as soon as possible.
<P>
I have provided individual parts of the interface I use with each part containing the files it needs to work so you can decide which parts you want to try.  If you want everything, then <A HREF="mysstie_equi.zip">Download Mysstie's Complete User Interface</A> (<A HREF="mysstie_equi.exe">Self-Extracting Version</A>).  This contains all the files listed below within the individual parts.  To see what my complete interface looks like in one screen shot (I run at 1280x1024 at the moment):  <A HREF="mysstie_ui_screenshot.jpg">Complete Screenshot</A>.

<H2 CLASS="ezboard"><A NAME="group">Player/Group/Target/Casting Window</A></H2>
This is my adaptation from the combined Player/Group/Target/Casting Window that Loral made.  His skin is available at <A HREF="http://loralciriclight.com/ui.html">Loral's Custom User Interface</A>.  My changes were to include the Stamina and Level Experience bars which caused the Window to be a bit taller (there are some other things I will add on here so I left myself room).    The bars are in this order:
<OL>
	<LI>MOB/Target's Name and Health with Percentage</LI>
	<LI>Your name and Current/Max Hit Points</LI>
	<LI>Your Health and Percentage</LI>
	<LI>Your Mana and Percentage</LI>
	<LI>Your Stamina and Percentage (the way it works it shows the percent of stamina you have consumed)</LI>
	<LI>Your Level Experience and Percentage</LI>
	<LI>Your Alternate Advancement Experience and Percentage</LI>
	<LI>Your Casting Time (it only shows during casting of spells)</LI>
	<LI>Group Member's Names and Health with Percentage's with Pet's Health as well</LI>
</OL>

Files changed:
<OL>
	<LI><STRONG>EQUI_CastingWindow.xml</STRONG>: Changed so it does not appear when casting since it's integrated in the group window.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>EQUI_GroupWindow.xml</STRONG>: This is the window that has all the modifications shown below.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>EQUI_PlayerWindow</STRONG>: Changed so it does not appear.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>EQUI_TargetWindow</STRONG>: Changed so it does not appear.</LI>

Following are some examples of it's appearance:

</TABLE>
<P>
<EM>There are some player window modifications out there that cause things such as the Player Name and Hit Point values to not appear in the Inventory Screen.  This one does not cause that to happen and I think I know why.  It has to do with having unique item and ScreenID variable names within the code.  The EQType number is the part that identifies what the actual information is to be displayed.  Anyway, I'll probably make a separate area for information dealing with actual coding hints.</EM>

<H2 CLASS="ezboard"><A NAME="buff">Buff/Spell Effects Window(s)</A></H2>
This is a combination of <A HREF="http://loralciriclight.com/ui.html">Loral's Custom User Interface</A> and <A HREF="http://members.cox.net/radhazzone/">RedBarsh's EQ UI Skins</A>.  It is a specifically sized window to show the current spell effects/buffs on you vertically with a small spell icon/gem on the left with a text description to the right.  Some custom buff windows seem to leave an "Unkown Spell" in the text area when the spell wears off.  This does not.  Beneficial Spells (buffs) will have a blue background.  Bad spells (DoTs, Poison, Diseases, etc.) will have a red background.  The spells also flash on/off when they are about to run out like normally happens.  While the window might be a bit wide depending on your resolution you can just move it off to the right and only let as much of the text description show that you want.  I also set it to faded value of 5% so the window is hardly visible (this is not hard coded, it will use whatever you have yours set to.)
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/newbut.gif" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=20 ALT="New" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"> <STRONG>Saturday, January 11, 2003</STRONG>: I have customized the new Short Duration or Song Buff window to be similar to my Main Buff window.  I left the title of <STRONG>Songs</STRONG> on it so you know which one you might be dragging around.  It will look the same otherwise.  Oh, it is shorter, enough for the six effects that can appear.
<P>
Files changed/added:
<OL>
	<LI><STRONG>buff.bmp</STRONG>: Contains the Blue/Red backgrounds, this is a new file</LI>

<H2 CLASS="ezboard"><A NAME="spell_gems">Spell Gems/Icons</A></H2>
This one is all mine.  I was playing Tracey and I didn't like the fact that the Feet Like Cat and Root spell gems/icons looked so much like.  So.. I changed the graphic to include "Root" in the graphic.  The change will appear in both the Spell Book and Spells Memorized Windows.  I have more spell icons I want to change.

<H2 CLASS="ezboard"><A NAME="inventory_graphics">Inventory Slot Graphics</A></H2>
I modified the file that has the Inventory Slot graphics so that it has the name of slot.  Some of the background graphics could be confusing and the less I have to think the better.  :)  I was inspired by <A HREF="http://members.cox.net/radhazzone/">RedBarsh's EQ UI Skins</A>.
<P>
<EM>One word of caution for anyone working with this file, it contains a mask channel and you need to make sure you save your new file with the Mask Channel present.  The first time I didn't do this and it caused my spell gem icons to not show through (just solid black where the icon would be).  This file happens to contain those oval shapes used in the memorized spell window.</EM>

<OL>
	<LI>Go to the <STRONG>uifiles</STRONG> directory in your Everquest folder, typically by clicking on "My Computer", "Local Disk C:", "Program Files", "Everquest"
	<LI>Within the <STRONG>uifiles</STRONG> folder, you should see at least a <STRONG>default</STRONG> folder.  We need to create a new folder within <STRONG>uifiles</STRONG> to contain the customized UI files.  Either <STRONG>Right-Click</STRONG> and select <STRONG>New</STRONG> -&gt; <STRONG>Folder</STRONG> or click on <STRONG>File</STRONG> -&gt; <STRONG>New</STRONG> -&gt; <STRONG>Folder</STRONG> via the menu and then name the new folder something short like "<STRONG>mysstie</STRONG>".  The complete path would be something like <STRONG>C:\Program Files\Everquest\uifiles\mysstie</STRONG>.
	<LI>Download the file(s) above you want and un-zip them.  If you downloaded the self-extracting versions, they have a default unzip directory of <STRONG>C:\mysstie</STRONG></LI>
	<LI>If you did not un-zip the files directly into the "mysstie" uifiles folder, copy all the items in your un-zipped file folder into your newly created uifiles folder (you just named a short name, such as "mysstie"). If it asks you "do you want to copy over...." select "YES TO ALL" to overwrite the files.  <SPAN CLASS="warning">Make sure you <STRONG>DO NOT</STRONG> copy these files into the <STRONG>uifiles\default</STRONG> folder.</SPAN></LI>
	<LI>Log into Everquest</LI>
	<LI>If you named the new folder "<STRONG>mysstie</STRONG>" use <STRONG>/loadskin mysstie 1</STRONG> to load the new interface<br>
	The "1" at the end makes it keep all your old window locations.  Thanks to Loral for discovering this one.  You may have to redo your Window Fade Settings.
	</LI>
	<LI>At this point some of your Hotkeys may have changed to numbers instead of text.  All you should have to do is zone to correct that.  To make sure everything is working ok, you may need to relog into Everquest after changing a skin.
