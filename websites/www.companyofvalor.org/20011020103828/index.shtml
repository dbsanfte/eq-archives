	<DD>Well, let's see now.. what I have I done today?  I have updated the <A HREF="inventory.shtml">Inventory</A> with some items from Banluyen (Thank you! *hugs*), adjusted the <A HREF="members.shtml">membership</A> page, made a new <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm36.showMessage?topicID=39.topic">daily snapshot</A>, and updated the <A HREF="calendar/oct2001.shtml">October Calendar</A> so far hehe.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :) 
	<P>
   <DT><STRONG>Tuesday, October 09, 2001</STRONG>
   <DD>Remind that tonight for those interested are language classes from 8pm-10pm in Steamfont near the LFay zone.  Also, I have posted a <A HREF="class_races.shtml">Class/Races List</A> that shows which Class can be which race.  Thanks Atana for providing the information.  :)  As such, I have also added a link to this on the <A HREF="resources.shtml">resources</A> page.  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)
   <P>
   <DT><STRONG>Friday, October 05, 2001</STRONG>
   <DD>Reminder for everyone going.  This weekend is the joint Hate Raid which starts at <STRONG>7am</STRONG> Saturday Morning.  (That's 8am Eastern, 6am Mountain, 5am Pacific).  Please see the event link off to the right for information about Hate.  Also, please be sure to follow the threads on FoP's message board for the latest information, groupings, and what not.  Check both the <A HREF="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fcrimsonsygilguildevents.showMessage?topicID=219.topic">Sign-Up</A> and <A HREF="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fcrimsonsygilguildevents.showMessage?topicID=220.topic">Rules</A> threads.  As things have turned out, I will be in Norrath over the weekend (I had thought I would be gone, but it turns out my parents are going on a vacation); however, 7am is awefully early for me and I have a tendency to sleep through alarms LOL.  (I've already done that a couple times this week.. I am soo not a morning person, unless I stayed up from the night before but then I'd be so tired and not functioning too well).  So I may have to pass.
<P>
In case you've been asleep, I have posted some pics from <A HREF="library/sswedding_30sep2001.shtml">Skythe and Sesie's Wedding</A> hehe.
<P>
*HUGS* Mysstie :)

   <DD>As of 1:40pm Central, I am aware that the Clock, Counter, and Membership page does not work.  I will be contacting the website hosting company later today to correct it.  *kicks the website*. Hehe *hugs* - Mysstie :)
   <P>
	<DT><STRONG>Saturday, September 29, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Reminder that tomorrow, Sunday September 30th at 6pm Central is the Wedding of Skythe and Sesie to be held at the Arena!  :)  If you are going to possibly <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DUEL</FONT></STRONG> after the reception, <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">PLEASE GET YOURSELF BOUND THERE</FONT></STRONG>.  Hmmm wonder how long before this blinking thing annoys me LOL.  See everyone there!  *HUGS* - Mysstie :)

   <DD>I have added an ability to <A HREF="cgi-bin/addmember.pl?members_email">send email</A> to individual members.  It is currently in a development/debugging phase; however, it works as it stands currently.  Be patient as the page displays.  Make any comments concerning it <A HREF="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fcompanyofvalorfrm1.showMessage?topicID=400.topic">here</A> or send me an <A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">email</A>.  I have also put up a couple MP3 files for your enjoyment in the <A HREF="library.shtml#downloads">Library</A> section.  *hugs* - Mysstie :)  
   <P>
   <DT><STRONG>Tuesday, September 11, 2001</STRONG>
   <DD>Due to events in New York, I am cancelling Language Classes tonight.  My thoughts and prayers for those in that area and for those who may have friends, family, or loved ones there. *hugs* - Mysstie
   <P>
   <DT><STRONG>Monday, September 10, 2001</STRONG>
   <DD>Hope everyone had a great weekend!  Atana compiled a list of classes and the different title changes that occur as they gain levels in the 51-60 range.  <A HREF="class_titles.shtml">Check it out!</A>  As such, added to the <A HREF="resources.shtml">Resources/Links</A> page.  - *hugs* Mysstie :)
   <P>
	<DT><STRONG>Thursday, September 06, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Added a link to Viron's EQ website in the <A HREF="library.shtml">library</A>.  Not sure if his and Galiana's really fit there or the links page.  Anyway, it's there for now LOL.  I also took the liberty of adding the Bard links Viron had to our <A HREF="resources.shtml">Resources/Links</A> page hehe.  In case I don't put something here tomorrow, just wanted to let everyone know that I would be gone over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and not in Norrath.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!  *hugs* :)

	<DD>Greetings!  :)  Recently I have updated the <A HREF="http://www.companyofvalor.org/inventory.shtml">Guild Inventory</A> to include some items that Oxxan donated.  Thanks Oxxan!  I have also cleaned up the <A HREF="http://www.companyofvalor.org/resources.shtml">Resources/Links</A> page by getting rid of some dead links and then added the link to the Epic Quest info site that Galiana posted about.  Also updated the <A HREF="http://www.companyofvalor.org/members.shtml">membership</A> page a little.  It talked about needed email addresses for an email discussion list.  Well, we used to have a listbot thing a long time ago.  The message board replaced it.  Eventually, I will do some work on the membership scripts to allow folks to email others.  At the moment only you and the Guild Leader can view the email addresses and I do not give them out to anyone.
<P>
	Hopefully this evening around 5:30pm Central we will help take down Naggy.  Please send a tell to <STRONG>Juror</STRONG> of Healers United in game for the latest information concerning the raid.  It looks like work will keep me too late to participate so I wish everyone good luck that tries.  Hmmm this is 4 hours away.. lol many probably wont see this until after it's all over anyway lol. - *hugs* Mysstie :)
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Tuesday, September 04, 2001</STRONG>
	<DD>Hope everyone had a Great Labor Day weekend! Anyone who is missing a character on the membership list or can not click on the name, please send me an email to <A HREF="mailto:mysstie@companyofvalor.org">mysstie@companyofvalor.org</A> so I can take care of it! :) *hugs* - Mysstie. :)
