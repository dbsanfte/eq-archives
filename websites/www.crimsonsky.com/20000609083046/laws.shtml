        <p><b>CRIMSON SKY EMPIRE CHARTER:</b></p>
        <p><img src="images/shield.gif" width="55" height="79" align="right">The 
          Crimson Sky Empire is a guild devoted to fair play within the gaming 
          worlds we inhabit. We ensure the maximum enjoyment within those games, 
          not only for ourselves, but also for the &quot;good&quot; aligned players 
          that we co-exist with. We are a guild firmly set on a path of upholding 
          the virtues of Honor, Loyalty, Truth, and Justice. We do not condone 
          mindless player killing, bug-exploiting, or any other aspects of play 
          that are detrimental to the experience of other players and not in the 
          spirit of the game design. Our members are aligned to that of noble 
          warriors, fighting for our ideals, and in the name of CSE, however there 
          is no requirement of members to participate in combative activities. 
          The Crimson Sky Empire is seen as a large family, where all members 
          are actively encouraged to assist each other whenever possible within 
          constrains of the game and our policies.</p>
        <p><b>Building Policies:</b></p>
        <p>The Crimson Sky Empire and it's respective Factions will always build 
          and maintain a least one structure unique to the game and faction for 
          the use of all members as a meeting place and staging point. The upkeep 
          of these buildings will be the responsibility of the Faction High Lord. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Guild Equipment:</b></p>
        <p>All members of the Guild are encouraged to donate surplus equipment 
          to their faction. This surplus equipment will be inventoried and overseen 
          by the Faction High Lord or Faction Officer given the responsibility 
          for distribution of this equipment to Guild members who require it. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Trust-Tax: </b></p>
        <p>Aye, a necessary evil that we must ask for to support such a large 
          organization. However it truly is of scale that all members directly 
          benefit. Funds gained through taxation go directly toward in-game goals 
          such as structures, Castles, Keeps, Houses, etc.</p>
        <p>We believe that the only way our guild will be able to achieve such 
          a is if we ALL participate in giving money to a trust fund - managed 
          by your Faction High Lord. I want to call this our &quot;Trust Tax&quot; 
          because we will NOT set a percentage or a limitation. We ask that you 
          GIVE as much as you can, knowing that it is for a good cause... Survival. 
          If we notice that you NEVER give to our Trust Fund... eventually, this 
          will creep up on you... </p>
        <p>Awards and trophies for those of you who donate large amounts of goods/money 
          for the guild will be given. We may even NAME a structure after the 
          member or UNIT that came up with the most money.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Responsibilities of the Faction Treasurers:</p>
        <p>Record all transactions. <br>
          Provide notes regarding purchases, loans, etc. <br>
          Storage of all monies. </p>
        <p><b>RULES OF CONDUCT &amp; ENGAGEMENT:</b></p>
        <p><b>Policy on Player Killing and Murderers:</b></p>
        <p>The unjustified killing of other players by members of the Guild is 
          and will not be tolerated by the Guild, and conversely the Guild will 
          not tolerate any other players who engage in this activity. While we 
          believe that such crimes should not go unpunished, we as a Guild do 
          not see ourselves as the Judge, Jury, nor Executioners in such matters. 
          Because of this we do not enforce it upon our members to hunt player 
          killers, and neither do we condemn those members who choose to do so. 
          We see this matter as one of personal or group choice, and will do all 
          within our power to see that the hunting of player killers remains so. 
          However the right to chose whether or not to actively engage in PvP, 
          in no way relieves members of the codes they have sworn upon to uphold 
          which includes defending their fellow brothers and sisters with their 
          own life. </p>
        <p><b>Policy on Looting:</b></p>
        <p>It is simply asked that you exercise good judgement when looting fallen 
          foes, player or computer controlled during a combined effort on the 
          behalf of you and fellow members, or that of a apparent abandoned corpse. 
          It is good practice to give whatever you can to help your fellow brethren, 
          or those in need, this is a great sign of compassion and charity, and 
          is highly valued in our ranks.</p>
        <p>During Campaigns, designated 'looters' will be assigned. If you join 
          an organized group, you must abide by these rules. You are *not* to 
          loot during this time. When you all return safely to our compound, the 
          entire horde of treasure *will be* shared by all those who attending 
          the mission. Excess equipment *should be* donated to the Faction Quartermaster, 
          or to a less fortunate member of the faction. Looting is a thin line, 
          and must be walked carefully less it risks the welfare of others in 
          an individuals pursuit of greed.</p>
        <p>This Empire is rich in resources, the key to our success is sharing 
          and making sure that everyone is taken care of. Thank you for adhering 
          to this policy. <br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Leaving Our Guild: </b></p>
        <p>If at any time you wish to be removed from our guild, simply email 
          Seira or your Faction Leader. This however is not to be taken lightly, 
          and members who so quickly renounce their membership, only to wish to 
          rejoin again may be disciplined. By leaving you will be giving up all 
          rank, status, access, and privileges within the guild. If you ever wish 
          to rejoin us you must do so as an initiate, providing your leave was 
          on good terms. We will not give you a hard time about leaving - things 
          come up and we will respect your wishes.</p>
        <p><b>Negative Guild Actions:</b></p>
        <p>Personally insulting fellow members of the CSE. <br>
          Disrespect of the Leaders and Founding Fathers of this Guild. <br>
          Give information to other Guilds regarding the CSE or its tactics and 
          strategies. <br>
          Cause harm to guild members or diplomats within the game. <br>
          Grant anyone access to privledged member areas unless instructed to 
          do so from a High Council member. <br>
          Rude statements and/or foul language around people who do not appreciate 
          it, or are of age. <br>
          Disregard for Guild Policies. <br>
          Inactivity. </p>
        <p> <b>Operational Behavior while in the CSE (During Missions Only!):</b></p>
        <p>o In any operation there should be one or two leaders who will issue 
          orders and speak for the group. This includes any unplanned impromptu 
          situations that may arise, some individual MUST take command in a moment's 
          notice and everyone must recognize that person as the leader. People 
          should be aware at all times, even if only standing around outside the 
          house, what the chain of command is. In any sort of emergency situation, 
          that individual must be deferred to. </p>
        <p>o Everyone should remain quiet and pay attention to the operation leaders 
          unconditionally.</p>
        <p>o If you MUST say something msg it to the leader in IRC/ICQ. Do not 
          be vocal in game it looks bad and confuses the situation. </p>
        <p>o If you have problems accessing the private IRC channels fix it yourself. 
          It is your responsibility to know how to deal with IRC. If you cannot 
          enter the private channel and will not be able to due to networking 
          problems (frequent disconnection's, DALnet services not responding, 
          etc.) you should separate yourself from the operation. Orders and intel 
          will be conveyed through this channel and without access you would be 
          without the information needed to participate. This isn't meant to alienate 
          any individual, just a fact of life, you should respect the commanding 
          officer if he/she asks you to detach from the operation. Additionally, 
          if you have questions as to how to do an operation on DALnet, feel free 
          to ask any ops questions, just don't do it during a &quot;situation&quot; 
          or operation. </p>
        <p>o Do not convey any operational intelligence to non-CSE unless it is 
          an explicit joint operation, in which case a private channel will be 
          arranged for all participants. </p>
        <p>o There WILL BE respect for leaders. This includes any of the High 
          Council, any Team Leaders, any Operational Leaders and anyone who assumes 
          leadership position when no one else is of higher rank or able to assume 
          leadership. </p>
        <p>o Respect is demanded from ALL members, at all times, despite rank 
          or current leadership position. </p>
        <p>o A character's POWER does not make him/her a leader. Actions, respect 
          and trust are what promotions and leadership positions are based on. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Interaction with Other Guilds:</b></p>
        <p>Any interaction with another guild in regards to forming an alliance 
          or a joint operation should first be referred to the CSE's diplomatic 
          officers, or, if that is not feasible should be referred to all available 
          members of the High Council. At no stage should a member of the Guild 
          make any promises to assist another guild or form an alliance without 
          approval from one of those 2 sources.</p>
        <p><b>Rule and Policy Violations:</b></p>
        <p>Any member found to be in violation of guild policy and/or rules will 
          be first issued a warning. Upon the second violation the individual 
          will stand in judgement before the High Council. The strongest penalty 
          is banishment.</p>
