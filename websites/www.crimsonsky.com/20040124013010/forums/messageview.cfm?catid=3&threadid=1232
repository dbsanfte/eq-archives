								Do not continue reading this if you dont want to know about the 3rd movie coming out in 2 weeks.<BR><BR><BR>http://todaytonight.com.au///media/642789.html<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Movie opens with the green code, Warner Bros. and the logo, The Matrix Revolutions. The code dissapears and we see a flash as the movie picks up exactly where the last one did, with Bane and Neo on the tables, knocked out. Trinity is slowly whispering to Neo to wake up, then talks to the nurse. The nurse explains that it seems that Neo is jacked into the Matrix. Trinity questions how this is possible and relays the message to Morpheus. Morpheus gives her the news that Niobi's ship has crashed and she is stranded with Ghost. Morpheus says that shes got important information in regards to Neo. Trinity says to hurry up and go.<BR><BR>They fly the Hammer into a crater and find the crashed Logos. Morpheus and his crew go into the ship to discover that the power is out. With a bit of repairs, the ship will work again. During this time, Bain awakens, but notices that he is another room and not in Neo's place. Also during this time, Niobi explains to Trinity that the Oracle has loads of information as to the whereabouts of Neo and how to save him, and that only Trin can save him. Link finishes the repairs on the ship by giving some of the Hammer's power to it and it is ready to set out. Morpheus and Trinity ask for the Logos so that they can go into broadcast depth, as well as they explain that there is a survivor on the Hammer which needed to be taken to Zion (they dont know Bane is on the Logos). Niobi and Ghost take the Hammer and head back to Zion while Morph, Link, Trin, and the unconscious Neo head into broadcast depth. Trinity looks at Neo, pleading for him to awaken and we get a nice fade into Mobil Ave.<BR><BR>Neo sees three power-lines in the desert of the real inside of his head. Neo awakens in Mobil Ave with a headache. He checks his body for injuries (including his belly-button), and gets up and sees a little girl there. <BR><BR>She smiles at him, and he tells her to wait. He looks around and sees that he is in some sort of abandoned subway station. He reads "Mobil Ave." on the walls. The little girl (the child) walks up to him and says "welcome to limbo.. i am Sati". Neo asks her what happened, where Trinity is, where he is, etc. Sati says that he is in a place between the Matrix and the Machine World. Neo gets up, confused, and tries to walk away, with Sati following. She says that the body cannot live without the mind, but the mind can live without the body, and not to worry because help is coming. A subway train whizzes by... stops... then keeps going. Neo notices the "LOOP" at the front and back of the Train. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, Trinity and Morpheus arrive at the Oracle's apartment, and are greeted by Seraph. He explains that they must defeat him in battle before meeting with the Oracle, but suddenly Smith bursts through the door. Three Smith Clones comes in, and Morpheus and Trin try to battle it out with them, but are beat. Seraph steps in and beats the Smiths and kicks them through the door. Trinity and Morpheus wonder how Seraph could possibly be so powerful, and he simply says "You dont believe in angels?"<BR><BR>Seraph takes Trinity and Morpheus to see the Oracle. The Oracle welcomes them, and Trin wastes no time in asking about Neo. The Oracle says he is being held captive by the Merovingian, and that he is in a place between the Matrix and the machine world. Morpheus asks about her appearance, and she explains that she was given up the Merovingian by two programs which hatched a child within the Matrix which is vital to the future. She says she had to change appearance to escape the Merovingian. The Oracle tells them that Neo needs their help and that the only way to break him out is to go see the Merovingian, who controls the time within the Matrix, in Club Hell. Trinity and Morpheus are set to go, but Seraph decides to go with them to help out.<BR><BR>We see a couple of scenes with Smith taking over people within the Matrix, laughing more and more and becoming more and more human.<BR><BR>Back In Mobil Ave, Neo decides to sit at the bench and the child explains the nature of the Matrix. She tells him that the machines simply want love, and that she is the first to achieve that. Neo takes a closer look and sees that her code is bizarre, with a heart, pumping blood, human-like. She says she is the first program to be born within the Matrix out of love, and that evolution can only happen if both humans and machines team-up. Suddenly, a subway train opens and Rama Chandra steps out. Sati is happy to see him and they embrace, along with the mother. <BR><BR>Neo meets with them and Rama Chandra explains to Neo that he is trapped within the Matrix and the Real World. Rama recognizes him as the Systemic Anomaly who did not return to the Source. He says that The Matrix is crashing slowly due to that, and that soon all the minds inside will be killed and awakened inside of their pods. Rama Chandra explains that his daughter is the only means of survival and the key to unlocking an evolution. Neo asks what this place is, and Rama explains that Mobil Ave is a construct created between The Matrix and the Machine World for all of those Anomalys who touched the Source. He explains after leaving the Architect's room, that Neo's mind did not properly go to where the anomaly's code was programs. Mobil Ave is a subway leading through the Matrix so that the Anomaly can choose the 16 females and 7 males neccessary to rebuild Zion. However, since Neo did not touch the source, the code in his mind corrupted, and his mind was still in the construct inside of the Machine World. However, due to an abrupt hexadecimal in which the only way to access the Architect's room is with the special key, Neo was sent immediately to Mobil Ave as if he was there to choose the new Zionists. Neo finally understands. He asks how he can leave, and Rama Chandra explains that it is impossible for him to leave unless the Trainman allows him passage into the Matrix again. Neo sits down, waiting for escape. <BR><BR>In Zion, Niobi makes preparations to cut the Sentinels off before they reach the backwalls. Niobi and Ghost head-off on a new ship to try to drop an EMP directly underneath the digging site, to buy the Zionists some time to prepare. Her and Ghost start to plot out exactly how to cut off the Sentinels. The Zionists, specially Locke, are well aware of the situation that Neo is not the One, and now must plot to survive. Locke points out that Morpheus is a twit, and Niobi gets a pretty angry look on her face because of it.<BR><BR>Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph break into the coat room of Club Hell and are greeted by unwelcoming guests. There is a huge battle in the Coat Room reminiscent of the first Matrix lobby fight. Guns go off and such and Seraph, Morpheus, and Trinity truly show off their skills in this one, including the super-strong Seraph. After the huge fight, they arm themselves and walk down to the lower levels of Club Hell, guns drawn, asking for the Merovingian. They are taken by Persephone who is there, to see the Merovingian. <BR><BR>Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph go see the Merovingian. After a small speech explaining his existence, as well as Persephone's, he asks for the Eyes of the Oracle. Only after he gets those can Trinity gain access to Mobil Ave. to save Neo. Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph ask The Merovingian what the "Eyes of the Oracle" are, and he explains that he needs the "angelic one", that being Seraph. Seraph offers himself, and is surrounded by Mero's men, but Trinity pulls a gun away and puts it to Merovingian's head. After some dialogue, Merovingian gives it up. <BR><BR>The Trainman sneaks out of the back and goes through to find a train, he heads to Mobil Ave. The Merovingian allows passage and Trinity, Seraph, and Morpheus are slowly taken to the door leading to Mobil Ave, but the Trainman is already there. The Twins appear, sent by the Merovingian, and Trin, Morph and Seraph have to fight the Twins off. Back at Mobil Ave, The Trainman hurries Rama Chandra and the Child so that they can be safe. Neo tries to get out through the train and gets punched for his troubles.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, Trin, Seraph, and Morph have their hands full with the Twins. Suddenly, The Train bursts through the door with Rama, the child, and the mother. The Twins attack them, but Seraph jumps in the way saving them. Seraph and Morph volunteer to hold the Twins back while Trinity goes to save Neo in Mobil Ave. In the subway car, The Trainman explains only she can tap into Neo's mind because she is the one who he loves and the reason he made the choice for her instead of saving Zion at the Source. She says she only cares for his safely. They make it to Mobil Ave and Neo and Trinity hug. <BR><BR>Neo asks the Trainman why he didn't let Neo go through to the Matrix, and the Trainman explains that he cannot be brought into the Matrix without a guide (Trin) or else his mind will be powerless sort of like how it was in Mobil Ave. They all hop on the Train and head back. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, Seraph and Morph are getting pounded by the Twins. Neo and Trinity return, and Neo takes on one Twin, beating him up rather quickly, even damaging him during the phasing. They return to the core of Club Hell where the Merovingian watches. He orders the Twins to destroy Neo and the child. They arm themselves with rotating blades and attack Neo. The fight is spectacular, but a tad bit short (only about 8 minutes). Neo makes short work of one twin by punching right through his code, and the other attacks the child, but Seraph runs in the way and takes the slash, dying at the feet of the Twin. The child cries, and Rama and the mother carry her away. Trinity and Morpheus lead them out while Neo kicks a hole in the other Twin's stomach, killing him. The Merovingian, angry as ever, reveals that the place is wired to explode in seconds. <BR><BR>Neo, Trin, Morph, Sati, Rama, Sati's mother all escape seconds before it escapes due to Neo's flight. Afterwards, Neo thanks Morpheus and tells Rama and family to hide out from Smith, who is coming in his direction. He reveals that he can sense Smith and that Smith can sense him. Neo wonders how he is going to be able to jack out, and Trinity tells him to see the Oracle. Morph and Trin jack out via telephone and Neo flies to the Oracle's apartment. Minutes later, Smith arrives at their location, but there is no Neo to be found. He takes over more humans.<BR><BR>In the real world, Morph and Trin await for Neo to return to the real world in the Logos. Bain is hiding in the back, deciding not to do anything yet. <BR><BR>Neo arrives at the Oracle's apartment, and she greets him as usual. Neo quickly asks what he can do and if Zion can be saved, and she says that teamwork is the only way to the future. Neo explains his dream about the three power-lines and she says it is the road to the Machine City. She says that he must travel to 01 and meet with Deus Ex Machina, the Machine Ruler, to make a truce. She explains that Smith is taking over the Matrix and that by this time tommorow, The Matrix would crash and Smith would awaken in thousands of bodies in the real world. She says that the future lies in his hand and that only he can save them. He wonders about their connection, and she explains that when Neo jumped into his body, he overwrote Smith's own code with his own human code. This explains Smith's rise in power, his ability to clone himself, and his uncanny human characteristics. She says that while Neo is becoming more machine-like due to having some of Smith's code, that Smith is becoming more human and that they will soon be at equal power. Neo asks if he can stop him, and The Oracle says that he must have hope. Neo wonders how it is possible for him to return to the real world, and she gives him a red pill. She says he will have to go into replication. Neo takes the pill and bids farewell to the Oracle. His code dissapears and his eyes open in the real world.<BR><BR>Trinity grabs him and Morpheus welcomes him back. Neo gets up and says he knows what he has to do now. Link arrives and asks for objectives. Neo says that they must head to the machine city. Morpheus, who has practically given up hope, refuses and says that Zion must be saved and that they have to go back and help. Neo says there is no other choice, but Trinity supports him. So basically, they decide to drop Morpheus off back at Zion and continue. The journey to Zion starts.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, in the Matrix, Smith bursts into The Oracle's apartment. Smith looks for Neo but realizes that he is gone. After some talk about her willingness to help the humans, Smith says that he is the only future of both worlds, and not humans nor machines. The Oracle says that this is futile and that Neo will stop him, and Smith says that he is beyond "Mr. Anderson". Smith says that he will take her knowledge, but she self-deletes before he can do so.<BR><BR>Smith gives an angry smirk on his face, which soon turns to laughter. He walks outside and notices that it has started to rain. He smiles again and keeps taking more people... <BR><BR><BR>The Matrix Revolutions Part 2 of 3<BR><BR><BR>The Logos returns to Zion and a council meeting is set. Information about the machines and their tunnelling is revealed, as well as Niobi gives out her plan, which Lock is strickly against. Meanwhile, Bane sneaks onto Zion, watching Neo, following him. The Kid meets with Neo once again, and annoys him, but they wish each other good luck. Neo has a strange feeling inside of him, that they are being followed in a hallway, and The Kid has the same feeling, but both simultaneously shrug it off.<BR><BR>After some rest, Neo and Trinity have a conversation about what is coming, and Neo talks about fear. Both once again do the "lovey dubey" stuff, and Morpheus and Link come in. Trinity says that she will not stand around for Neo to die and that she'll be with him. The scene is very admirable. Neo and Morpheus hug and say their goodbyes, as well as Trin and Link. Morpheus still wants to believe, and Niobi comes in, wishing Neo luck. Morpheus and Niobi have a short conversation about believing in The One and in the prophecy, which Niobi denounces, but admits that Neo has grown on her and that he is indeed unbelievable. <BR><BR>Bane sneaks aboard the Logos behind Neo and Trinity.<BR><BR>We see scenes of the Zionists preparing, including Mifune. They are accounting all of the APUs and weaponry and preparing for the showdown. We see another scene of the Sentinels digging deeper and deeper. <BR><BR>Neo and Trinity board the Logos and undock, heading out of Zion for the surface. Neo decides to go down below to rest and prepare, but is attacked by Bane. Neo and Bane wrestle around, and Neo starts to pound him. Bane reveals his true identity as Smith, but Neo doesn't believe. Bane grabs the electro-blaster and shoots it at Neo, blinding him. Neo can't see, but focuses and soon sees in a weird orange light glow (sort of like in Daredevil). He realizes Bane is Smith and knows that it is impossible. After more fighting, Neo grabs the electro-blaster and fires it at him multiple times, killing Bane/Smith. <BR><BR>Trinity runs in and Neo reveals that Smith can now hack into real people using the hardline if he takes their RSI from the Matrix. Neo says that Smith could take over every human plugged into the Matrix in the real world when it crashes, and that now Neo can actually see and feel them. He says he learned that they are linked now, and that when each one grows in power, the other feels it and such. They return to the cock-pit where they head out over a huge mountain to the surface and the desert of the real. Neo senses the three power lines from his dream and tells Trinity to follow them. <BR><BR>In the Matrix, Smith fights some Agents which attack him and assimilates them easily... laughing, saying that he has evolved from their kind. The raindrops begin to fall more and more and the city is seemingly overtaken by nothing but Smiths, who all laugh at once. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, in Zion, Morpheus and Niobi head out in the Hammer to drop the Super EMP. They fly right underneath of the tunnels outside of Zion, being backed by Ghost and the crew of his ship. After a spectacular, yet kinda short, chase sequence where Sentinels discover and chase the Hammer, Ghost's ship takes care of the Sentinels with an EMP. Morpheus and Niobi fly together, looking at each other, Morpheus revealing that he still cares for her, and Niobi says she cares for all in Zion. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, The Logos is attacked by weird, Sentinel-like machines and shrimp bombs, in which Neo takes care of quite easily with his new abilities. Trinity is still befuddled as to how he is able to stop the machines in the real world, and Neo says its something he took from Smith. The scene is pretty long, but nothing dramatic happens except some cool moves by Trin and Neo's amazing ability to kill Sentinels. <BR><BR>They (Morph, etc) arrive directly over the Sentinels, dropping the super EMP, buying Neo and the Zionists some time. Ghost, Niobi, and Morpheus head back to Zion to help them prepare for the remaining Sentinels at the backwalls. <BR><BR>Neo and Trinity fly above the clouds and notice that the sky is indeed blue and not scorched. Neo can feel it, and Trinity gasps because of the fact that it makes no sense. Suddenly, a machine hits the ship and the Logos comes crashing down right into the outer walls of 01. Trinity is left there, unconscious, and Neo tries to wake her up, but he cannot. Neo sees 01, and heads inside of a small door, bigger than a human. He steps through it, noticing some bizarre blue liquid around him, submerged.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, back in Zion, the Sentinels have at last broken the dock and head inside. The APUs led by Mifune attack them with a fury of bullets, and many Sentinels are taken out, but the battle begins. Some humans use rocket launchers to nail the sentinels. The Sentinels make it inside of Zion and the battle fully begins. Ships are blown up, bodies are exploded, all hell breaks loose. Zee is trapped within the inner walls of the depths of Zion, and with the help of a rocket-launching friend, dashes through and makes it inside of Zion to Link. They embrace as they watch the Sentinels and the humans basically destroy each other, showing a true movie struggle which has not been seen in a sci-fi film since the battle of Endor on Return of the Jedi. <BR><BR>At this point, Neo is in a place which looks sort of like a docking bay. He looks up with his vision, seeing all sorts of machines all over the place. The Machine City of 01 is beautiful, orchestrated as if it were submerged underwater. Neo can sense machines all over the place, some even looking VERY humanoid. In fact, he even sees a machine with plugs on its body which looks unbelievably human. This puzzles Neo as he continues to venture deeper into 01. A door opens in front of him, leading him into a bizarre blue chamber, which quickly turns to a deep orange color. Suddenly he is hit with a bizarre orange blast which lifts him up in the air, paralyzing him, then bringing him down (sort of like an EMP, only this looked like a Sentinel). His body becomes limp and some machines pick him up and drag him somewhere unexpected...<BR><BR>The Kid watches this battle and watches the people of Zion get slaughtered by the incoming Sentinels. At the same time, Morpheus and Niobi arrive in Zion, after escaping some Sentinels. Ghost saves them both at the cost of his own life as we see him get virtually mutilated by the machines (pretty sad, i liked Ghost). More death and destruction is seen and The Kid has had enough and goes up on a mountain in Zion, screaming at the Zionists. He screams about humanity, and that the struggle with continue unless they stop it now. The Kid gives an amazing speech about survival. All of the Zionists get their weapons and throw them at the incoming Sentinels, which are basically making minsemeat out of the inner walled Zionists. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Niobi and Morpheus arrive in the Hammer and drop the EMP, saving them both. They go pick up The Kid who was about to get attacked by a Sentinel, and he is welcomed on the ship. <BR><BR>Outside, on the walls, the struggle continues. The Zionists use some last-ditch bombs, sort of like napalm, to eliminate more machines, but it seemingly does nothing as they just keep coming and keep coming. Many Zionists are in tears due to the fact that the Machines are digging deeper within the walls of Zion, destroying whatever they can get their hands on. Morpheus asks Neo to hurry.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, at 01, Neo awakens and gets up, walking towards a huge, sort of peak. There, Deus Ex Machina speaks with Neo. Neo places down his bargain about saving Zion from Smith. Deus Ex Machina asks the purpose, since all humans have tried to do is to destroy them since their birth. Neo bargains that it is the other way around, and Deus Ex Machina explains the story of the birth of the machines and how their true purpose was simply to love. Deus Ex Machina explains about evolution, and that humanity always had something the machines valued more, and that was emotion. Neo says that soon neither one of them will exist because Smith will destroy them both, as he only cares about his own selfish ways. Deus Ex Machine says that that is only because Smith is becoming human, thanks to Neo. Neo says that now he himself is becoming more machine, thanks to Smith, and that he can virtually feel them. <BR><BR>Back at Zion, the war is continuing and the humans are losing. As newer Sentinels and some other types of Machines dash inside and start to rip things up. The Hammer crash lands into a huge pot of squiddies, killing most of them. Morpheus and Niobi get out of the cockpit and into the lower halls, (but the Kid stays to watch), and mourn the loss of the precious Zion. Morpheus goes back to believing in Neo. Locke arrives onto the Hammer, telling Morpheus, Niobi, and The Kid to escape Zion with their lives, but Morpheus refuses, saying he will fight for his city. Niobi takes his side, saying that that "all will be lost no matter what". Locke's jealousy arises (specially since Niobi and Morph spent so much time together), and he attacks Morpheus. Morpheus and Locke fight for a while, and Morph gets the upper hand. Niobi tries to break it up, but there is no such thing. Locke grabs the electro-gun and shoots at Morpheus, knocking him for a whirl. Locke screams at Morph about his foolish beliefs in Neo and the prophecy of the One, and such, calling him names. Niobi has had enough, revealing she loves Morph, and grabs the gun and blasts Locke three times, killing him. Morph and Niobi have a short conversation about love, and they embrace. <BR><BR>Deus Ex Machina drops the revelation that all of those born into bondage have that ability, due to the fact that all humans are relatively part machines. Neo is shocked to learn this, and Deus Ex Machina explains that the purpose of the One is to help the machines themselves discover love. He says that there is no truth without lies and that they needed to fool the humans into believing several things (the skies, the One, that they are fully human, that Zion can survive), and its all a part of control to become human, which was the Machines true purpose, shocking as it is. Neo partially believes Deus Ex Machina, due to the fact that he can sense truth due to his machine senses. Deus Ex says that now that Neo has been the first human/machine anomaly to feel the emotion of love, they need him to touch the source (implanting the code of emotion and love to all machines) and end the struggle once and for all. Neo thinks harshly, realizing that if he had touched the Source, that perhaps the war could be over, but Neo also realizes that he can't fully trust Deus Ex. Neo strikes a bargain, saying that if he Deus Ex Machina spares Zion and his people, as well as bringing Trinity back, that he will rid the Matrix of Smith and touch the Source for them. <BR><BR>Deus Ex, skeptical at first, agrees and Neo is jacked in.<BR><BR>The signal from 01 of the Matrix is sent into Zion. All of the Sentinels stop their attack suddenly, and all of the humans watch the Matrix on the monitor, preparing for the Superbrawl... <BR><BR>The Matrix Revolutions Part 3 of 3<BR><BR><BR><BR>The signal from 01 of the Matrix is sent into Zion. All of the Sentinels stop their attack suddenly, and all of the humans watch the Matrix on the monitor, preparing for the Superbrawl. Trinity's limp body shakes suddenly. Niobi, Morph, and the rest of Zion watches the Matrix, seeing only Smith until...<BR><BR>Neo appears in the Matrix, off the same phonebooth that he spoke on from the first Matrix, seeing tons of Smiths all over the Matrix. He looks around, all of them growl and snarl at him. He walks down the street path, and one single Smith steps out of the croud and stares him down (like in the trailers). Then, of course, as you may know, this happens (with new dialogue, i practically memorized this part... cause confrontational speeches are SOOO Cool, specially this one, but its NOT perfect):<BR><BR><BR>"Mr. Anderson Welcome Back... We Missed You..."<BR><BR>"It ends tonight..."<BR><BR>"Do You like what ive done with the place...? It is even more sublime than before..."<BR><BR>"Im here to put an end to your reign of terror... as well as your clones..."<BR><BR>"Oh them... well you don't have to worry about them. I have grown in power beyond anything that this primitive system can conjure up... including you Mr. Anderson. Thats why the rest of "me" is just going to enjoy the show, because i think we all know that i'm the one... that beats you..."<BR><BR>Both Neo and Smith run at each other at a rapid speed and start some Kung-Fu action at the center of the street. They both get some hits in on each other and it is relatively even with neither gaining an advantage. Bullet-time is utilyzed on a few of the hits and it goes back and forth. They both punch each other at the same time, fly back, land on their feet, and fly back towards each other, causing a huge explosion ripple. A lot of the glass on the buildings are crushed and we can see tons of Smiths watching the fight. They start to fight and fly simultaneously up into the air, then Neo knocks Smith down, destroying a piece of the sidewalk. Both of them fly up the air simultaneously, doing another energy ripple, bouncing off each other with an unbelievable force. They go plowing through the skies and under buildings until finally they fly above the skyscrapers. There is a humongous aerial battle that takes place here, in various altitudes, as they rip each other up through buildings and whatnot. The battle goes into high in the air as they pound each other down furiously, as Smith taunts Neo about his power. <BR><BR>In Zion, everyone is watching the fight in disbelief. Niobi and Morph watch with their jaws dropped at the epic battle. The Kid and everyone are rooting for Neo, and it seemingly feels as if the Kid is twitching with every blow. We see a nice montague of everyone in Zion, from Morpheus and Niobi, as well as the council, the ship captains, Zee, Link, everybody watches, rooting for Neo to destroy Smith.<BR><BR>Neo and Smith continue their battle bashing each other through several building and whatnot. The blows are vicious and it is a beautiful mix between martial arts and street fighting. The two entities wrestle around in the air over the city, until they crash into the Metacortex building not far. They stare each other down in the very same computer room that Neo worked in. They begin to throw around the objects with thier power, causing huge convulsions of energy. Neo starts to get the upper hand, slamming Smith through several walls into a room with tons of TVs which all show Smith's face. Neo kicks him out of the building, and Smith comes back and pounds him some more.<BR><BR>They both fly out of the building wrestling around into yet another building right next to Metacortex, and then down into the ground into the chinese teashop (of the Seraph battle), flying all over the place in the Matrix. They go into a building. Neo and Smith face each other again and pause, and Smith gloats about his increase in power. Smith says that now he is far stronger than Neo, and that "no prophecy, no act of god, or no force of nature can possibly put an end to his takeover. He says it is inevitable." Neo comes back with something along the lines of "humanity will survive, machines will survive, programs will survive, but i'll make sure you dont" and Smith snaps back with "Why in the hell would you be helping machines?" and Neo says "Because i choose to". Smith says: "perhaps my old self would've already been compelled to do the same, but i am reborn... ressurected... and thirsty for everything," and Neo says "I won't let it happen". They start fighting furiously again. <BR><BR>They fight all over, destroying each other until they wind up on the roof of the Metacortex building. Smith begins to gain the upper hand, pounding on Neo hard. Neo tries to attack, but Smith shows his speed, pounding Neo into the ground. Smith starts to throw Neo around like a ragdoll, doing all sorts of punches, kicks, grabs, and even a headbutt. Neo is pounded, but tries to fight back. As he is getting slaughtered, he is bounced around the city until he utters the words "Trinity...". Smith goes and kicks Neo while he is down, laughing at him. Smith says that he wanted to be human... to be a virus, and now he has it. Soon he will be free, and Mr. Anderson will be dead.<BR><BR>In the real world, Trinity's limp body is carried to Deus Ex Machina.<BR><BR>As Neo is getting pounded, all of the sudden, Trinity appears. Trinity says that this ends now. Trinity attacks Smith and gets a few blows in until she is pounded down. Neo gets up angrily, attacking Smith with a punch sending him flying into a building. Neo and Trinity look at each other, and are both shocked to see each other. Trinity says that the future is dependent on both of them to continue civilation, and humanity. Smith flies back and they keep fighting. Trinity interviens, but is soon knocked away by Smith, who also knocks Neo away. Smith sticks his hand inside of Trinity, turning her into a clone. Neo screams in pain, crying. He gets up with a furious face and begins to attack Smith furiously. <BR><BR>Neo sends Smith down the building all the way down as they crash the entire city, forming a humongous crater. Neo goes into the crater to find Smith missing. He looks up to see all of the other Smith clones stare him down, and he cant pick which one is the "super smith". Suddenly, from behind, Smith attacks pounding Neo. Neo comes back and says its "for Trinity", and he jumps inside of Smith's body, ripping out of it with Trinity in his arms. Smiths code is bounced around like at the end of the first Matrix. Smith apparently dies.<BR><BR>All seems well as they hold each other, but suddenly, the other Smiths start laughing. Neo tells Trinity to run as Smith puts his code back together. Smith laughs again, saying that he cannot lose. Neo and Smith fight once again in a furious battle where this time Neo gains the upper hand. After a few blows, Neo powers up his fist and punches Smith in the face, forcing his face to bounce inside of itself and explode in a huge flurry of code which Neo absorbs into himself. He looks at the camera and his eyes open. At last, Smith is dead. Neo looks at the other Smiths and fires a unique green code at them, and they all transform back into confused humans, which suddenly fall limp. <BR><BR>Zion throws a humongous celebration as Neo at last has saved humanity and the machines from the terror of Smith. Neo gets up in the middle of street, holding Trinity, kissing her. In the real world, both Neo and Trinity's bodies are limp, as if they were dead. Suddenly, the Architect appears. The Architect says that the path of the One ends now, with Neo touching the source, reloading the Matrix. The Architect hands Neo a key which can only be opened from a door in the Metacortex building, which is the backway into the source. Neo goes up to the Architect and says "i warned you... i did not want to meet again" and sticks his fist into the Architect, blowing him up, basically deleting him. Neo says "at last... there is no more control."<BR><BR>Suddenly, Sati, Rama Chandra, and her mother appear on the streets. Sati embraces Neo and welcomes a new era, where the mind can live on without the body in the newly reloaded and rebuilt Matrix. Sati explains that love is the key to everlasting happiness and immortality, and that now all can feel love. Neo sends a signal to the Kid (through the cybernetic mind) telling him to watch over everything while he is gone, and the Kid guarantees that it will happen. Niobi says "Neo...". Neo gives a speech about the future, cooperation, and that we are all human and machines, and that the mind and the body don't neccessarily have to be one, and that now he understands exactly what the Matrix is... and thats "Immortality". Neo says that the body can indeed live without the mind, in the afterlife, in the Matrix, as long as there is choice. From now on, Neo says that he will ensure that there is choice and that there will always be choice, and now... humanity will control everything. Neo bids farewell to his friends, and welcomes a new era.<BR><BR>The Zionists rejoice and the Machines start to help rebuild Zion and remove the skies.<BR><BR>Neo grabs Trinity and they fly to the Metacortex building, and open the mysterious door. Once again, we are in the TV room... this time... no Architect. Instead, the chair is empty with the white pen. Neo picks up the pen and pushes the button and all of the TV screens show bar code. He says "Now thats more like it". Neo and Trinity look at each other and Trinity asks "which door?". Neo says "Choice is an illusion... but everything begins with it. We have the power to lay the foundation for the future... both doors." Neo and Trinity simultaneously open both doors (touching the Source, reloading the Matrix, and inserting his code of love into the machines). Suddenly, the screen turns white and shows space once again.<BR><BR>We cut to a scene of the real world where the skies are being repaired. Morpheus and Niobi are together, and everybody is throwing a huge party at Zion. For once, the humans can see the surface. The Kid is at 01 with a few others, trying to create a perfect economy in a room with humans, machines, and human/machine influences. The Kid quickly says "be right back". The Kid steps outside and closes his eyes, suddenly we see his eyes open in the Matrix as he is surrounded by people. He grabs the payphone, dials a number, and Neo says hello. The Kid says "You told them how it was going to end... and remember... everything that has an end, has a new beginning. You were always the One." On the other side of the line, we see Neo sitting in the Architect's chair with Trinity standing in front of him. He says "Everything begins with more than just choice... it begins with love... and ends with power... love is power... and evolution is re-evolution...". Suddenly, The Kid returns to the real world, telling the council everything is good in the Matrix. Neo hangs up the phone and smiles. <BR><BR>There is a huge scene of the Matrix with humans interacting, showing love, along with programs. <BR><BR>We see a scene of a gravestone that says "Here lies Thomas Anderson...

								Hehe, yeah I bitched about that to Luc after we saw Kill Bill. I didn't even know that was a 2 part movie so I felt ripped off when the movie was over and you're left hanging.  Good movie and all, just sucks to have to hit the theatre again to pay your $8 plus $6+ for soda/popcorn if you want the moviegoing experience.<BR><BR>If it's a quality movie and a true full length sequel I'm not that against it, but lately I have the nagging feeling they're just trying to milk these for the extra cash. Say for instance they hire Arnold on for Terminator 4 for $30 million which will be a 2 part movie 3 hrs total of play time. Are they really going to pay him $60 million since it'll be shown as two movies which they charge $8 for at the theatre? I highly doubt it. Seems to me like they're making some damn good profit off these 2nd part movies.<BR><BR>You can't even call them sequels because they're really just extended parts of the original which couldn't make the hour to two hour cut to show in the theatre. I have a feeling will be seeing quite a few of these two and three part movies in the future.

								Only $14?  You've got it cheap. At the megaplex here it costs $24 for movie, pop, popcorn. I've been to a few movies in the past that were 2.5 - 3 hours long. They never bothered breaking those up into 2 seperate movies. I guess they figured they can double their cash for the same expenses this way.<BR><BR>I could always just get it from the newsgroups for free too  <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0">

								Yeah, that's what I found funny too. There's been a number of 2-3hr movies that were shown in theatres and they never made two movies out of those and seemed to do just fine. Whats next? They start making all the TV episode DVD's only have a single show per DVD so you have to pay $9.95 per episode. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-tongue.gif" border="0">

								Haven't seen a movie without the wife in years.  All prices instantly double.  However, the student cinema shows a free movie once a week.  28 Days shows tomorrow night.  And on "free" cable, saw Army of Darkness on AMC last night.  I am so ready to kill some zombies.<BR><BR>Rommal

								This spoiler has many of the elements of the movie, and in many cases actually makes a bit more sense than the movie, but has a lot of differences.  Saw the 2 hour flick on the Imax.  Well worth it for the action, but the philosophy angle falls apart pretty bad.<BR><BR>Rommal<BR>

								Hrm, I watched the Matrix movie last night and there is a few things in that spoiler that did not happen in the movie.  The deal with the One is different as it is mainly Neo stating that he wants peace between humans and machines, in return Neo will defeat Agent Smith but the last paragraph is the real divergent plot as it is completely different for none of it is present within the movie.  The ending I will not divulge but Neo and Trinity are not a part of it.<BR><BR><BR>Trelak
