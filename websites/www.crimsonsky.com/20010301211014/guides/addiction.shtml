          ADDICTION</b></font></p>
        <p><b>Typical thoughts from an addicted player:</b><br>
          &quot;When I first started playing online games over 5 years ago, over 
          the internet, I was introducted to an environment which I quickly found 
          to be extremely compelling. The ease of interacting in such an intensely 
          social environment and having the ability to exploit talents I normally 
          wouldn't be able to in real life. This also took place during a time 
          when I had moved out on my own, and had also moved to a new city for 
          college, and had only a couple friends. My facination with the games 
          grew, from the point of just playing, to activity taking part in the 
          building/programming, regardless of other responsibilities or obligations 
          I had. Eventually after a couple solid years of constant playing, I 
          started realizing how this behavoir was hurting myself, and how it shut 
          me out from reality. My problem was not that I really enjoyed the game; 
          it was that I wanted to completely substitute it for reality. Eventually 
          I grew tired, my enthuisiasm turned mostly to nostalgia for the &quot;old 
          days&quot;, and I turned back to other more &quot;real&quot; hobbies, 
          yet while still gaming abiet somewhat more responsibly. This wasn't 
          before I had learned some hard lessons.&quot;</p>
        <p>If you've been gaming for any significant amount of time, you've no 
          doubt heard your friends or other players joke about being &quot;addicted&quot; 
          to the game. While it's probably true in most cases, the most extreme 
          of which are extremely harmfull.<br>
          <br>
          Here are some things to watch for which may clue you in to a potential 
          gaming &quot;addiction&quot;: </p>
        <p>Do you find you become anxious, irritable or angry if you are unable 
          to play, for any reason? <br>
          Do you find that events which take place in-game seem more important 
          than those in your real life? <br>
          Do you spend six hours or more every day playing? <br>
          Do you find that you continue to play, even when you are upset or frustrated 
          with the game and not really enjoying it? <br>
          Do you often rearrange plans in your real life (such as cancelling meetings 
          with friends, etc) so that you will have more time to play? <br>
          Do you often find yourself short of time to do important things, such 
          as schoolwork, because you've spent a lot of time playing?</p>
        <p> <b>If these statements tend to be true for you, then the amount of 
          time you spend playing may be affecting your life in a negative way. 
          Here are a few steps you can take to prevent a potential gaming addiction 
          from having a negative effect on your life: </b><br>
        </p>
        <p>Set a time limit for the amount of time you will spend playing each 
          day and stick to it, *regardless of what is happening in-game*. <br>
          If you have work or studying to do, finish it first before you start 
          playing. <br>
          Avoid telling your friends, &quot;I just need to take a quick break 
          to do my (eating, laundry etc).&quot; If you tell your friends you will 
          be back soon, you will be rushing to finish whatever you need to do 
          because you'll feel guilty if you can't rejoin them. <br>
          When you have an important task to accomplish, log off from the game 
          completely instead of going &quot;AFK&quot;. This way you will not be 
          tempted to return to the game before your work is done. <br>
          Try to divide up your &quot;social&quot; time between your friends online 
          and your friends in real life. <br>
          If you have to choose between spending time with people online and spending 
          time with people in your real life, spend it with people in your real 
          life.</p>
        <p> Set aside a day when you have few responsibilities (e.g. Saturday 
          or Sunday) and try to do most of your playing on that day. <br>
          Even if you do have a lot of free time, don't spent it all playing online. 
          Divide up your time between playing and reading, exercising, hobbies, 
          etc. Remember that variety is key and that spending too much time at 
          any one thing -regardless of what thing it might be- is usually harmful, 
          and most likely will just burn out your enthusiasm that much quicker.

        <div align="center"> <b>Only play when you really feel like it, and when

        <p>Only play when you really feel like it, and when you get frustrated 
          or stop having fun, quit playing and come back another day. <br>
          Online games can be an extremely fun way to pass spare time during the 
          day, but remember that it is meant to be a form of entertainment, and 
          not a substitute for any part of your real life. For your health, and 
          that of our gaming guild I hope you take this serious. As much as the 
          guild prospers from active members who can put that extra bit of effort 
          in that others can't, it just isn't worth it in the long run to lose 
          them shortly down the road.</p>
