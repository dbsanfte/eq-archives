    <TD valign=top>Growing up on the outskirts of Tristram, Soltrea had hopes and dreams of joining the ranks of the vaunted Amazons.  Long legged and of muscular build she began on her goals training vigorously in the hopes of being chosen.  But for her, at the age of 16, fate would choose differently.  The sun came up and Soltrea packed her gear together for her weekly hunting trip.  Packing both her bow and some rations she started off down the trails near her homestead.  She knew the paths well and of where the flocks of birds would be found feeding.  With ease she settled into a small grove and awaited for some prey.  A deer came into view shortly after and Soltrea readied her bow.  An easy target, she said to herself as she aimed for the kill.  But today would be different...As she pulled back to shoot a sharp pain entered her mind. Her shot went wide and the deer ran off.  Her bow went flying as Soltrea grabbed her head and writhed on the ground.  For a few minutes the pain continued as Soltrea huddled in pain.  Soon the pain subsided and she raised her weary head.  Weary, she tried to stand up and slipped.  Cursing she looked down and stared in bewilderment.  Where once there was grass, there was a sheet of ice.  She stared at it in fear and amazement, wondering where or what created it.  As she watched a small pool of water formed near her and she continued to watch.  She bent to look some more at this strange occurence when she jumped back in fear.  Shaking unsteadily, she slowly peered back into the pool that was forming and was scared of what she saw within.  Upon her birth she had inherited the brown eyes of her parents but now they were dark blue and clear as crystal.  Afraid and befuddled she ran back towards home wondering what was happening to her.  Her parents were taken back by her at first, but they were consoling but afraid of what this turn of events might mean for their daughter.  That night a rain began to fall but it soon turned to hail.  Soltrea huddled in her bed wondering why she felt more aware of the air around her and more so, why she felt so cold.... <P>
A week later there was a knock at the door.  Soltrea's mother opened it and 3 women were standing outside.  They explained that they were of the Zann Esu and that they had felt a new ripple in the elemental plane of magic.  A small ripple, but enough to make notice to those mages who could sense such things.  Soltrea came slowly to the door and looked at the women.  They wore strange garbs of silk and one carried a staff.  Soon all three turned and looked at her.  Soltrea looked back in fear, yet filled with wonder of who these people were.  "Soltrea,"  said her mother, "These women are here to help you.  I do not fully understand everything that they are saying but they believe you are an important piece to solving the dark days that are coming.  Dark days...it has been peaceful for a long time since the Wanderer came to Tristram.  They wish to help you to control your gifts and I am going to give them permission to do so."  Soltrea held back some tears as she realized what her mother wasy saying.  The woman with the staff spoke softly, "Collect that which you need Soltrea, for we have a long journey ahead."  With help from her mother Soltrea packed up her few possessions and after some final goodbyes she began walking down the trail with the three women.  Soltrea took one final look back at her mother, tears falling down her face.  She gave one final wave of farewell and walked behind the three women, with her tears continuing to flow down her face and some solidifying into ice. <P>
For the next 10 years Soltrea was trained in attuning her powers of in regards to the elemental planes.  Quickly she grew in power and stature in the training school, outdoing most with ease.  With a final approval of the Mage Council she was given the full rights  of the Zann Esu.  At the age of 25 she is at the prime of her life.  Standing at 5'7, she has kept her muscular build from her youth and focussed her mind on shaping the elements to her mind's need.  With the blessings of the Mage Council she has left the Clan holdings in search of news and answers to the dark tidings that are being brought to the Clan.  Most specifically on the rumours of the Three Prime Evils being awake again in the realm of Sanctuary. <P></TD>
