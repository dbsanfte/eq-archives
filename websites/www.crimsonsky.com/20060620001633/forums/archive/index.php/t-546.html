Someone messaged me asking who the leader was, i can't remember his name, but i told him to contact you and gave him bzar and moomoney.<br />

for others on dunemaul<br />
Tdayen, blackcheetah and myself will be joining onibatsu clan in the near future.  They are going to work to get us into MC and BWL raids.  Outside of fighting onyxia that one time, its a part of the game that I want to see and possibly try to enjoy.  Blackcheetah was in onibatsu on this server and one of our RL friends was the a leader of the guild, he recently stepped down for someone else.  <br />
<br />
I am not even sure how their DKP system is setup, but I don't care I know most of them already have their l33t gear so I am sure I will get some stuff.  If i do it and we don't get any drops, then i can go back to doing pvp.</div></div><hr />
