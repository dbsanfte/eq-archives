<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cailid</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found this on blizzards forums. Supposedly it's a translation from the Taiwan forums.<br />
<br />
I would like to see someone who works for Blizzard to please confirm or deny that this is the patch notes for 1.10 (or close to it due to translation). I guess someone translated them from the Taiwan WOW Forums and they ended up on the North American WoW forums. In addition, if it is true, why did they get the information and we were left out in the dark? I am sure that there are thousands of others that would also like some confirmation. Thanks. <br />
<br />
Here is the information I am talking about: <br />
<br />
Translations from the various Taiwan WoW Patch Announcements: <br />
<br />
Warrior: <br />

<br />
1. Execute - Execute will work with Sweeping Strikes again. If the target of the Sweeping strikes proc has less than 20% health then they will take full execute damage. If they are above 20% they will take a normal swing of your weapon in damage. <br />
<br />
2. Whirlwind - When used with Sweeping Strikes, it will only hit one extra person (on top of the 4 from whirlwind) This will only use up a single Sweeping Strikes Charge. <br />
<br />
3. Flurry - Fixed a bug where all ranks of this talent were not properly being triggered. <br />
<br />
4. Retaliation - Fixed a bug where this skill was not functioning correctly as a melee attack. <br />
<br />
5. Intimidating Shout - When it is resisted by the main target, it will no longer apply its fear. The fear is now limited to 5 targets. <br />
<br />
6. Flurry - The speed improvement from Flurry will only be applicable for the next 3 swings. <br />
<br />
7. Sweeping strikes - The damage from the extra attacks generated by Sweeping Strikes will now take into consideration the armor of the target being hit with the extra attack rather than the armor of the person you are swinging at. (Ie: No more swinging at mages to do massive damage to plate wearers) <br />
<br />
Rogue <br />

<br />
Translation: <br />
<br />
1. Slice and Dice: If you attempt to use this skill when your target is dead, you will get an error message. This skill cannot be dodged, parried or missed. <br />
<br />
2. Sap: When sap is resisted, Lightning Shield will not break stealth. <br />
<br />
3. Remorseless Attacks: This talent will not trigger when you kill a monster that does not yield experience, or a player that does not yield honor points. <br />
<br />
4. Distract: this skill will no longer trigger Lightning Shield from Shamans. <br />
<br />
5. Blade Flurry: The damages of the extra attacks will now be determined by the armor rating of the secondary target. <br />
<br />
6. Blind: Blind is no longer considered a melee attack, and cannot be parried or dodged. <br />
<br />
Hunter <br />
http://forum.wowtaiwan.com.tw/twow_forums_page3.asp?topic_id=22719&amp;forum_id=3&amp;GoPage=1&amp;lis= <br />
<br />
1. Multishot - The attack power of this skill has been normalized. All ranged weapons will now use 2.8 as the standard multiplier. Weapons that are slower than 2.8 will see their damages reduced slightly, and weapons that are faster than 2.8 will see their damages increased slightly. <br />
<br />
2. Aimed shot - (Same as above) <br />
<br />
3. Improved Aspect of the Hawk - the duration has been increased from 8 seconds to 12 seconds. The speed improvement will not start until the second shot has landed. This was changed to fix a delay problem in the talent. <br />
<br />
4. Hunter's Mark - (this is where I couldn't really understand what it said...something about the caster will not be listed under the mob's &quot;threat list&quot;, and something about a debuff...) <br />
<br />
5. Claw and Bite - pets using these skills will now gain appropriate amounts of threat depending on the rank of the skill. Previously, only rank 7 and 8 were causing the right amount of threat. <br />
<br />
6. Beastial Wrath - will not generate any threat for the caster. <br />
<br />
7. There will be new wild boars showing up in EPL with Rank 6 Charge. <br />
<br />
Shaman <br />
http://forum.wowtaiwan.com.tw/twow_forums_page3.asp?topic_id=22725&amp;forum_id=9&amp;GoPage=1&amp;lis= <br />
<br />
1. Lightning shield - Environmental Damaging effects (campfires) will no longer eat charges of Lightning shield. <br />
<br />
2. Grounding Totem - this totem will no longer absorb the following effects: Frostguard, Hammer of Titans, Annihilator, The Chief's Enforcer, The Judge's Gavel, Blacklade of Shahram, and Bonereaver's Edge. <br />
<br />
3. Flurry - the speed bonus will only exist for the next 3 attacks. <br />
<br />
4. Healing Wave - mana cost reduced by 9%. <br />
<br />
5. Shamans will now be able to use equipped items in ghostwolf form. <br />
<br />

My translation with others feedback. (updated up to Moirain's post on page 2) <br />
<br />
=-=-=-=-=1.10 Priest Change posted on WoW Taiwan offical forum=-=-=-=-= <br />

<br />
5. Mind Soothe is now an instant spell. <br />
<br />
6. Shadowform: reduce physical and ranged damage. See talent trees for more info. <br />
<br />
7. Feedback (Human): See Eyonix's post for details. When using Feedback, the human priest will surround himself with anti-magical energy. Any successful spell cast against the priest will burn mana from the attacker and deal Shadow damage. <br />
<br />
8. Elune's Grace (Night Elf): The ranged damage reduction from Elune's Grace will be increased, both its duration and mana cost will decrease, and the spell will also increases the priest's chance to dodge. This spell now has a cooldown. <br />
<br />
9. Shadow Guard (troll): will become an instant cast ability. The tooltip will also be updated to reflect that damage caused by the spell causes no threat. Such is already the case, however, is not currently documented. <br />
<br />
10. Inner Fire: (see Eyonix's post) Inner Fire will provide more armor than before. The duration will also be increased to 10 minutes but now the effect will be removed when the caster endures twenty successful damaging melee or ranged hits. mana cost is increased. <br />
<br />
(11-14, see Eyonix's post) <br />
11. Desperate Prayer (Human and Dwarf): Reduce cooldown time. <br />
<br />
12. Touch of Weakness (Forsaken): will become a 10 minute self buff which is triggered when the caster become struck by a melee attack. The effect will otherwise remain the same. mana cost greatly reduced. <br />
<br />
13. Hex of Weakness (Troll): will apply a -20% healing modifier in addition to its normal effect. The healing debuff does not stack with the warrior's Mortal Strike ability, although the damage penalty will stack with either Touch or Curse of Weakness. mana cost greatly reduced <br />
<br />
14. Star Shard (Night Elf): Starshards has been redesigned to work similar to Curse of Agony, dealing lower initial damage which increases as the duration continues. The mana cost will drop substantially for all ranks, approximately 30%. and the spell damage will be increased aproximately 17%. All ranks of this spell will have a 6 second channeling duration. <br />
15. Lesser Heal: mana cost reduced by ~9%. <br />
<br />
16. Heal - Rank 2, 3, and 4 reduce casting time to 3 seconds and more (see notes by Moirain and Jediah). <br />
<br />
17. Greater Heal: reduce casting time to 3 seconds. (see notes by Moirain and Jediah) <br />
<br />
=-=-=-special note by Jediah=-=-=-= <br />
#16 and 17 both include a part about them being reduced in mana cost by 10%, and also, since the cast time has been reduced, they won't benefit with +healing or +dmg/healing gear as before. <br />
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= <br />
<br />
=-=-=-=-special note by Moirain=-=-=-= <br />
the translation about &quot;heal&quot; seem to be saying about mana/heal efficiancy increase and also that Greater heal, since cast time is lower than 3.5 seconds , no longer receives the entire +healing effect from gear. :( <br />
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= <br />
<br />
18. Vampiric Embrace: traget resisted the damage will not have healing effect. (nothing new) <br />
<br />
19. Power Word: Shield: &quot;now getting 10% of dmg/heal gear.&quot; (Thanks to Kallistae) <br />
<br />
20. Holy Nova: increase mana cost and no cooldown time. <br />
<br />
Mage <br />
