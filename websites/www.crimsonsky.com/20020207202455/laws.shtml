        <p><b>CRIMSON SKY EMPIRE CHARTER:</b></p>
        <p><img src="images/shield.gif" width="55" height="79" align="right">The 
          Crimson Sky Empire is a guild devoted to fair play within the gaming 
          worlds we inhabit. We ensure the maximum enjoyment within those games, 
          not only for ourselves, but also for the honorable players we coexist 
          with. We are a guild firmly set on a path of upholding the virtues of 
          Honor, Loyalty, and Justice. We do not condone mindless player killing, 
          bug-exploiting, or any other aspects of play that are detrimental to 
          the experience of other players and not in the spirit of the game design. 
          Our members are aligned to that of warriors, fighting for our ideals, 
          and in the name of CSE. The Crimson Sky Empire is a large tight knit 
          family, one where death is honorable, and living only gives oneself 
          the chance to meet such an honorable fate for our cause. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Building Policies:</b></p>
        <p>The Crimson Sky Empire and it's respective Factions will always build 
          and maintain a least one structure unique to the game and faction for 
          the use of all members as a meeting place and staging point. If a guild 
          owned building is not feasible due to game restraints, a public building 
          or location must be chosen for meetings and gatherings. </p>
        <p><b>Trust Tax: </b></p>
        <p>Regardless of which game or which combination of games you play, there 
          will come a time when you have amassed more equipment and wealth then 
          necessary. It is request that any items, materials, etc that you may 
          acquire in excess you donate to the guild. We do not enforce a weekly 
          or monthly tax nor do we expect everyone to be able to give. It is suggested 
          however that you help when possible. Your donations help new members, 
          allow the guild to grow, and acquire communal property for the benefit 
          of all.</p>
        <p>We call this our &quot;Trust Tax&quot; because there is no set amount 
          or a limitation. We ask that you donate as much as you can, knowing 
          that it is for a good cause. If we notice that you never give to our 
          Trust Fund... eventually, this will creep up on you.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities of Faction Treasurers/Quartermasters:</p>
        <p>Record all transactions. <br>
          Provide notes regarding purchases, loans, etc. <br>
          Storage of all monies. <br>
          Recommend awards/trophies for exceptional member donations</p>
        <p><b>RULES OF CONDUCT:</b></p>
        <p><b>Policy on Player Killing and Murderers:</b></p>
        <p>The unjustified killing of other players by members of the Guild will 
          not be tolerated by the leadership, and conversely the Guild will not 
          tolerate any other players who engage in this activity. While we believe 
          that such crimes should not go unpunished, we do not enforce it upon 
          our members to hunt player killers, and neither do we condemn those 
          members who choose to do so. We see this matter as one of personal or 
          group choice, and will do all within our power to see that the hunting 
          of player killers remains so. However the right to chose whether or 
          not to actively engage in PvP, in no way relieves members of the codes 
          they have sworn upon to uphold when they joined the guild which includes 
          defending their fellow brothers and sisters with their own life. </p>
        <p><b>Policy on Looting:</b></p>
        <p>It is simply asked that you exercise good judgment when looting fallen 
          foes, player or computer controlled during a combined effort on the 
          behalf of you and fellow members, or that of a apparent abandoned corpse. 
          It is good practice to give whatever you can to help your fellow members, 
          or those in true need, this is a great sign of compassion and charity, 
          and is highly valued in our ranks.</p>
        <p>This Empire is rich in resources, the key to our success is sharing 
          and making sure that everyone is taken care of.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Participation:</b></p>
        <p>The Crimson Sky Empire's reputation is well known to the online gaming 
          world. We wish to keep this so. The only way to accomplish this task 
          is by member participation. We expect that all members will be active 
          participants not only in within the guild but within the community. 
          This does not mean we expect to see you logged in to your specific game 
          thirty-five hours a week. On the contrary, we realize that real life 
          often throws each of us a curve from time to time. If you cannot be 
          active on an in-game basis, we expect for you to at least remain active 
          via the message board, the mailing list, or in some other of guild approved 
          involvement. It is requested that if you require some time away from 
          the online world in general you inform your High Lord of your hiatus 
          personally. During this time, you will be placed into an inactive status 
          until you once again return to your online family. Again, we shall never 
          penalize anyone for issues that occur in real life. As a family, we 
          expect you to take care of the issues that arise and while doing so 
          know that we remain here always, ready to aid you in any way we can. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Leaving Our Guild: </b></p>
        <p>If at any time you wish to be removed from our guild, simply email 
          your Faction Leader, or Guildmaster as listed in &quot;Contact Us&quot;. 
          This however is not to be taken lightly, and members who so quickly 
          renounce their membership, only to wish to rejoin again may be disciplined. 
          By leaving you will be giving up all rank, status, access, and privileges 
          within the guild. If you ever wish to rejoin us you must do so as an 
          initiate, providing your leave was on good terms. We will not give you 
          a hard time about leaving - things come up and we will respect your 
          wishes.</p>
        <p><b>Negative Guild Actions:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Disrespect of the leaders, officers, and founding members of the 
            guild.</li>
          <li>Personally insulting or slandering of guild members. </li>
          <li>Lying, falsifying evidence, to leaders or officers of the guild.</li>
          <li>Accepting or giving of gifts for personal gain in status or favors.</li>
          <li>Giving information to other Guilds regarding the CSE or its tactics 
            and strategies. </li>
          <li>Intentionally causing harm to guild members or diplomats. </li>
          <li>Granting anyone access to restricted member areas unless instructed 
            to do so by the Guild Master. </li>
          <li>Rude statements, foul language, childish vernacular, around people 
            who do not appreciate it, or are of age. </li>
          <li>Improper use or abuse of ingame guild resources (i.e. Housing, Guildstones, 
            Ingame chat, etc.) or out of game resources (i.e. Intranet, mailing 
            lists, forums, etc.) </li>
          <li>Disregard or ignorance of guild policies. </li>
          <li>Inactivity. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>The above actions should be considered guidelines for unacceptable 
          behavior that can result in banishment from the guild. It is the responsibility 
          of the Guildmaster and Faction High Lord to interpret member actions 
          when making judgment.</i></p>
        <p><b>Interaction with Other Guilds:</b></p>
        <p>Any interaction with another guild in regards to forming an alliance 
          or a joint operation should first be referred to the Factions High Lord, 
          2nd in command, or diplomatic advisors. At no stage should a member 
          of the Guild make any promises to assist another guild or form an alliance 
          without approval from one of those sources.</p>
        <p><b>Rule and Policy Violations:</b></p>
        <p>Any member found to be in violation of guild policy and/or rules will 
          be first issued a warning. Upon the second violation the individual 
          will stand in judgment before the High Council. The strongest penalty 
          is banishment from the guild.</p>
        <p><b>Rule and Policy Additions:</b></p>
        <p>Each faction of CSE may have additional policies/rules based on the 
          game mechanics of that world. It is encouraged you to read over this 
          policy page, then visit the faction in which you seek to join or are 
          already a member. Review the specific faction policies in depth. If 
          you have any questions about the policies whatsoever, please contact 
          Seira@crimsonsky.com, or the respective faction High Lord.</p>
