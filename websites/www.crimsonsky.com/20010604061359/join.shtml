        <p><b>Becoming an Initiate of the Empire:</b></p>
        <p>Before you become an Initiate of this Guild, many things must first 
          take place. We need you to fill out the Application Form for our review. 
          After that, we ask that you meet with several of our members either 
          in game or in ICQ/IRC. We want to meet you in that chat room, and see 
          what your personality is like. Based on that, we will meet up with you 
          IN game, and see how you behave/act when in different situations. This 
          step can take days or weeks, that depends on the impression you make 
          with our members.</p>
        <p>We look for several characteristics in a person AND his online persona. 
          To name just a few, we seek those who are loyal, dedicated, honorable, 
          responsible, professional, caring, brave, honest, giving, and this list 
          goes on and on. If you believe in these things, you are one step ahead 
          of becoming a member to our Empire.</p>
        <p>The Pre-Initiation Phase takes as long as needed. It is really up to 
          you. If you are IN game alot, and follow the policies, and strive to 
          better the entire guild, you will find that the rewards are sweeter 
          than you could have ever imagined. By giving your time and loyalty to 
          the CSE, you will find that our members will always be there for you, 
          through thick and thin. If you do not put forth a strong effort to participate, 
          we will drop you from the Initiate Phase, and say goodbye to you. The 
          key to this stage is getting to know our members, and striving to show 
          them that you are a team player. Also, make sure that you ask them to 
          report your actions and deeds to the High Council - this helps us keep 
          track of your good faith and participation.</p>
        <p>The only way to become an Initiate of a faction is to be vouched for 
          by other members. People have been known to get vouched for in 3 days, 
          others have taken 3 weeks. This method is one that we believe in, and 
          it helps filter out people who are not responsible enough to wear the 
          title of the Crimson Sky Empire. Please, do not think that we are a 
          conceited guild, I know that it may sound that way. Our members love 
          the fact that they belong to a guild that takes pride in every aspect 
          of the game and our following. When you enter our ranks, you will see 
          that THIS guild is very different from the others. </p>
        <p>During the Initiate Phase, you will be treated as an equal. You are 
          considered a member of our Empire, but still need to polish up on Guild 
          Training and your activeness within our family. Simply attend meetings, 
          missions and constantly display the characteristics expected of our 
          members. Within days, you will be assigned the Level One rank, and be 
          removed from Initiate Status.</p>
        <p>I wish you good luck, friend! Maybe in time, you too will wear the 
          title of the Crimson Sky Empire. Until that day, I fare thee well.</p>
        <p>Seira Black</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After you are accepted:</p>
        <p>Once you are accepted into our family, many things will take place. 
          You will be granted higher privileges in our guild, added to our mailing 
          list, added to our Roster Pages, have the option for creating a character 
          biography, and the private guild structures will be open to you. </p>
        <p>If you are interested in learning more about the CSE rank structure 
          and levels - check out our Ranks Page. (coming soon)</p>
        <p>Guild Uniform: </p>
        <p>Our guild uniform is flexible to meet the needs of many. Our primary 
          colors are: Crimson Red and Black. Uniforms and colors may also vary 
          based on Faction, House, and Rank.</p>
        <p>Wearing a uniform is mandatory for all members and prospective members. 
          If on your own time, away from the guild, you wish to wear your own 
          colors, that is fine. Wearing the guild colors is thought to be an honor 
          and should be cherished and worn whenever possible.</p>
        <p><br>
          Participation is Key: </p>
        <p>The most important aspect of our guild and our survival, is Participation. 
          We have created several methods for you to participate such as: IRC, 
          ICQ, Guild Mailing List, Guild Events, Recuiting, Advertising, etc. 
          If you make an attempt to meet others, IN and OUT of game, and show 
          the Guild that you truly care - you will do just fine. </p>
        <p>We realize that each person has there own amount of time that can be 
          given towards our guild. Some can play for one hour per week, others 
          have given four hours per day! You simply give what you can, and we 
          will respect you for this. </p>
        <p>Out of Game Participation:</p>
        <p>Advertising via Newsgroups, chat rooms, ultima pages, newspapers, etc. 
          <br>
          Meetings in IRC. <br>
          ICQ messages to members and allies.. <br>
          Mailing List Participation. <br>
          Stories, Poems, Songs about our Guild, Members and Adventures. </p>
        <p>Guild Mailing List: </p>
        <p>Announcements are sent to a mailing list that contains all the members 
          of the CSE. We use this list to inform our members of meetings, new 
          Initiates, promotions, missions, changes, etc. This mailing list is 
          PRIVATE and cannot be joined without going through the List Owners.</p>
        <p>When sending mail to this list, if it pertains to a certain faction 
          only, make the subject line appear in this format: &lt;Faction&gt; : 
          Topic</p>
        <p>CSE-INIT Mailing List:</p>
        <p>The LOA now has a mailing list for our Commoner and Initiate members 
          of the Order. This list is for those candidates to use for anything 
          they wish. To organize events, to share tips, to ask questions to the 
          High Council, etc. It is a tool to help you understand the LOA and to 
          learn our culture.</p>
        <p>Using ICQ: </p>
        <p>The majority of our Guild members have ICQ. We ask that when you become 
          a member, you add your Unit members to your contact list, as well as 
          the High Council members. This way, we can all communicate with each 
          other and have a better chance of knowing who is online from our Guild. 
          ICQ can be found at http://www.mirabilis.com and is currently a free 
          program and service.</p>
        <p>We ask that as you add each member to your list, that you rename the 
          entry to reflect the CSE suffix. (i.e. Rasmon should read: Rasmon_CSE). 
          This process will help you to identify a guild member much faster in 
          the case of an emergency.</p>
        <p>Biography: </p>
        <p>Biographies and Photos are sent to Seira Black. All members are allowed 
          to have their very own biography page. This helps form your character 
          history and identity with our guild and in our various factions. This 
          is not a mandatory feature. Thank you. (As of 9/15/99 Biography's are 
          not currently being accepted)</p>
        <p>Meetings: </p>
        <p>Meetings are to be held at least every month by Factions, any Faction 
          with more than one house or over 60 members will be expected to have 
          at least two meetings a month. The Faction High Lord will set meeting 
          dates and times. If you cannot attend a meeting, try to notify your 
          Faction Leader. You will receive a copy of the meeting log via the faction 
          mailing list. </p>
        <p>If you have topics or ideas that you would like to see discussed in 
          our meetings, send them to your Faction Leader. Your topics will be 
          included in our Meeting Notes and Reminder.</p>
        <p>When a Faction leader is unavailable to perform their duties at a meeting, 
          the senior member of each meeting will be required to HOST that meeting 
          to the best of their ability.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>RECRUITMENT</b></p>
        <p>We recruit only the best members we can find for the Empire and houses 
          within it. Building the ground up with high standards we hope to maintain 
          the strength built from every previous member before. Such high standards 
          are necessary to protect the Empire from those who would like to harm 
          it.</p>
        <p> Prospective recruits must be submitted to a House Master for approval 
          by a current CSE/House member. The very act of submitting a outsider 
          by a member binds them by their honor and position within the CSE that 
          the recruit upholds the laws and code of the Empire.<br>
          The House Master will screen and or test the recruit. House Masters 
          can have the member that recruited or a member quest the applicant(s) 
          or process the applicant by any means the Master sees fit to insure 
          the safety of the Clan... You must ask yourself what it takes to make 
          such a strong guild? It takes only accepting the best of people.</p>
        <p> Failure by a recruit aka Unproven to uphold the laws and code of the 
          CSE will result in their termination within the Empire and appropriate 
          action against the member who sponsored them. Such actions may include 
          demotion in rank, or in the very dire of circumstances status as Disavowed 
          and termination from the Empire.</p>
