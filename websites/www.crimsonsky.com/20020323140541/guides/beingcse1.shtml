          IT MEAN TO BELONG TO THE CRIMSON SKY EMPIRE?</b></font><b></b><br>
          <font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>By Xammer99 of 
          the CSE/EQ Faction</b></font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What does it mean to belong to the Crimson Sky Empire?</p>
        <p>Our Motto is &quot;Warrior to Warrior, yours in life and death&quot;. 
          We stand together, and stand for honor, bravery, and loyalty. Further 
          our honor and loyalty extend beyond our brothers and sisters within 
          this corps, it extends to the community around us. Our duty is to provide 
          a shining example of dignity and honor to the world, and for the world 
          to know that when they see the name Crimson Sky, they know that the 
          person bearing it is worthy of their trust.</p>
        <p>Belonging to CSE means standing for something bigger than yourself.</p>
        <p>It means showing respect &amp; honor towards every person they meet 
          and encounter. Be polite.</p>
        <p>It means holding yourself above the greedy &amp; petty people in the 
          world, and do their best to set a better example.</p>
        <p>It means showing restraint in times of anger, so as to maintain poise, 
          dignity, and honor. If you are angered, think before you speak, for 
          harsh words leave a deep impression. Speak and act with honor. This 
          is especially true when communicating via guild means (tells, guild 
          chat, message board, or e-mail)</p>
        <p>It means showing faith and loyalty to their brothers and sisters in 
          the empire. Do not seek to profit off of them, but do not beggar yourself 
          either.</p>
        <p>We should strive be self-sufficient, however there are times when aid 
          is needed. Do not hesitate to ask if the need is there, but do not become 
          selfish in your demands upon the group. We are here to help each other, 
          but our goal is fun for everyone, not fun for one.</p>
        <p>We adhere to both the spirit and letter of the laws of Everquest. Kill 
          stealing, ninja-looting, harassment of any sort, and other such offenses 
          will not be tolerated from our members.</p>
        <p>We should do the utmost to enjoy themselves, but never at the expense 
          of others.</p>
        <p>Only sponsor those they truly think would be worthy of bearing our 
          name and would bring honor too it. Do not sponsor those to whom you 
          have doubts. Further if you are sponsoring someone, be prepared to answer 
          in detail to the guilding officer exactly why it is you wish to sponsor 
          them.</p>
        <p>----</p>
        <p>That is what I expect from each and every member of this guild. Last 
          night I was VERY proud to hear of what was being done with two class 
          specific items. That made me feel a great deal of pride in my guildmates 
          and knowing that tough choices in the past were indeed the right ones.</p>
        <p>I'm filled with pride over the trouble and work guild members are goin 
          through to help each other out, and if they got something another guildmate 
          can and will use, letting them have it. That is great, and I'm a huge 
          fan of taking care of our brothers and sisters. When I see a someone 
          giving a spell (probably the most highly prized thing there is) that 
          someone needs to a guildmate, again I'm filled with pride. Its this 
          honor, generosity, and integrity that makes me proud to be in this guild. 
          That is what I expect from each and every one of you.</p>
        <p>When you wear the name &quot;Crimson Sky&quot; you don't just represent 
          yourself, you represent all of us. Bring honor to our name, and make 
          sure that people understand that when they see the guild tag &quot;Crimson 
          Sky&quot; they know that that person is a good person, someone who will 
          go to bat for the team, someone who will follow through, someone who 
          will give their best regardless of the reward. The greatest reward of 
          any deed is the satisfaction of knowing that you made someone else happy. 
        </p>
        <p>I know no one can always be the way I expect people to act, however 
          I demand that everyone make every attempt to try their best to live 
          up to those expectations.</p>
        <p>Warrior To Warrior, Yours In life And Death.</p>
