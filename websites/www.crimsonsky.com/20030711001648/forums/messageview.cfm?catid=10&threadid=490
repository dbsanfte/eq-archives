								gaute - Zagadka: will shadowlands have time to ship to all markets (europe, australia, etc) before the servers go live with it? <BR>gaute - We have worked hard to improve the shipping cooperation with our distributors, so that is certainly a goal. <BR>gaute - They tell us it is duable. We shall go gold in mid / late june. THat should give us enoug time. <BR>gaute - cairnz: when will there be screenshots of the new ui (as seen on the perk windows in 15.0.0.6) ? <BR>gaute - Ooh. Well, yes we are working on new GUI. It is not directly linked to Shadowlands though. We would like to include as much as we can, but since it is not "defined" as part of the package (everyone will get it) some will come in the SL, and some later. <BR>gaute - That is why we are not broadcasting any screens so far. I guess we will have to wait for this autumn for most of it to come. <BR><BR>blackmane - Susano-oh: im an nt whos been eagerly awaiting the so called cyberdeck, what can you tell the nt community about it, what does it look like, what will it give to the nt, what will those new nukes be like, (are we still getting this), will it be available in shops, boss loot, quest, will it be available as part of a public free sl patch or will it only be available for people who buy sl? <BR>blackmane - The 'cyberdeck' will be appearing in the Shadowlands for the NT. For the NT to be able to use the new nukes they will be getting for their specialization nanos, they will need to be using the cyberdeck. <BR>blackmane - Basically, the deck gives the NT access to new and very powerful nukes, and will only be available to the buyers of SL (because it is part of the specialization in SL). <BR>blackmane - At the top end, the level 220 nuke, as an example, will be dealing 4826-8950 damage at 60% resist at a capped speed of 2/1 (after inits are taken into account). <BR>blackmane - The deck will require matcrea to wield, as that is the 'attack' skill of the NT. As for how to get it, that isn't up to me. <BR><BR>gaute - Jerrikk: you have said in the past that the shades will not use implants, and instead draw spirits. im just wondering if this also applies to the other professions, will they also have the option to draw these spirits as a replacement for implants? <BR>gaute - No, they will be Shade only. There will be a new type of implants available for everyone else. Those are called "Symbiants", and are a pure ancient Spirit-Tech production. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - alienchild: will sl items be transferable to rk? is the rumor about most sl items being nodrop true? will rolv wesenlund make a guest appearance as a fat supa-leet? <BR>JimSalabim - Many SL items will be restricted by requiring you to own the expansion to use. Not that many will be NoDrop. We have been in contact with Rolv Wesenlund, but we can't afford using him at the moment. <BR><BR>Adrazar - Stychie: will token boards be receiving a revamp in sl? <BR>Adrazar - Yes. We will both have some items that benefit people that have gathered various amounts of tokens over 1k, but also upgrades to the existing ones that come with the new faction system. <BR><BR>gaute - Mattie: conceal has been broken or not functioning in some way since the game was released. will shadowlands finally fix the many issues with conceal? inquiring agents want to know! <BR>gaute - Concealment has been changed and improved several times since launch. There are some remaining issues, like Line of Sight outdoors and PvP use of concealment, to mention 2. There will not be any major overhaul of Concealment as part of Shadowlands. <BR>gaute - There will not be any major overhaul of Concealment as part of Shadowlands. There will be several bug-fixes going in, but I cant promise any changes to Concealment will be part of that. We shall continue to improve all the skills. <BR><BR>blackmane - Ront: you told us that the keeper would have the roll of a tank in a team, but u also told tha the enf would be more tank then now. were do we stay at? : <BR>blackmane - The keeper is, at best a secondary or tertiary tank. The enforcer has the best (by a long way) hit points, and the best (by a long way) taunts. <BR>blackmane - The keeper is the tank you use when you don't have an enforcer, or possibly a soldier. <BR>blackmane - The enforcer will not be the main tank because of the damage they do - they will be the main tank because noone else will be able to hold aggro like they do, and no one will have the huge HP they they do. <BR><BR>Marius - Shadowzar: well met. we of the mp communitty will get right to the point. being that shadowlands is a metaphysical realm what advantages will mps have there ? what will be our roles ? <BR>Marius - marius: MPs will not get any exclusives in the SL even though its a metaphysical realm. The thing is that its all new for all professions so just like everyone else the MPs will need to learn the workings of the SL from the start. <BR>Marius - please let me know if I did not answer the question like you hoped me to =) <BR><BR>Cz - Karrd: when did sl beta start and how do you get into it. is it toolate to get in? will more people be added later? <BR>Cz - The beta started a few weeks ago, and is currently invitation only, and a very limited invitation list too. <BR>Cz - We will continue with invitations only for a while more, then open up for applications. <BR>Cz - No set date for this just yet, but it's certainly not too late to get into the beta test. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - Lheann: what changes if any will be made with dimach in requard to mas? this has been a long standing issue with it getting parried so often and taking 30 minutes to recycle. <BR>gaute - We have changed and improved the Special Attack system for Shadowlands. All "specials" (not the item attacks!) have been changed and improved. The MA will be one of the Profs the benefit the most from this, with higher max cap and different interaction. There are still balancing going on, and I cant promise now that the resist will be drastically changed, but then again your skill cap will increase to over 2000, so I guess that will help too... <BR>gaute - (repost) <BR>gaute - There are still balancing going on, and I cant promise now that the resist will be drastically changed, but then again your skill cap will increase to over 2000, so I guess that will help too... <BR><BR>blackmane - CerebriX: whats in store for the engineer in shadowlands? what changes, new bots, armor, and tradeskills can we look forward to? <BR>blackmane - The engineer will get some more powerful main bots (slayerdroid versions). The final level 220 bot is an all-new mesh. <BR>blackmane - Additionally, they will get a secondary combat pet, the mechdog. This won't be anywhere near as powerful as the main combat pet, but will be a nice addition damage-wise. Also, it will have a mild snare proc. <BR>blackmane - All the new pets (for all the professions) will have some innate resistance to the CC nano, so won't be as 'useless' in pvp situations. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Mattie: agents have been dying for info on what they can expect to see in shadowlands. namely how will our damage and and core skills be improved on? <BR>JimSalabim - Agents will have reason to be very happy with their damage output in the Shadowlands - they will be on top when it comes to Damage Per Minute. Skills in general will be possible to improve quite a bit, also Agent core skills. <BR><BR>Adrazar - Wisewise: there seems to be a lot of confusion on this subjects, so could you just confirm wether or not omni-tek employees can be redeemed and clanners can be unredeemed? <BR>Adrazar - First of all, what players do is to align themselves on the Redeemed or Unredeemed side. Becoming one of those godly beings is impossible as far as we know : ) <BR>Adrazar - The Redeemed and Unredeemed factioned NPC's that players meet in the Shadowlands are rather picky when it comes to choosing company and it is not advicable for an Omni Tek employee to try to make friends with somone on the Redeemed side for example....Unless that player makes the concious choice to change sides. <BR><BR>Marius - Berk: weve heard a lot about the perk system that will be opening up in shadowlands, but can you tell us anything about how this system will funciotn? will this be a collection of passive skills unique to a profession, or some sort of new nanoline? <BR>Marius - marius: Some Perks are for all professions but other perks are general and cant be obtained by every profession. The way it works is that you get a perk point each 10 level, you can use that to invest in a perk line. When you have selected your line in the perk GUI you can train that perk. The perk will give you skill modififers, and if you are really lucky you will also get a new special attack of some kind. Some of the perks be special attacks in additio <BR><BR>gaute - Destractor: q: there are a lot of people wondering how neutral will cope in sl, can we get to 220 without being pushed into a side? <BR>gaute - yes.You can. Let me explain how this is CURRENTLY implemented. Once you reach 201, you can NO LONGER change sides. If you are a neutral at that time, you gain no more chances to swap. Now, the Shadowknowledge is a a form of experience that is coupled with your faction! The higher the faction, the more experience. <BR>gaute - Neutrals can not (with the current implementation) get as high a faction in ALL the factions as an OT or clan. This will make the narrow path, even harder. There are factions (namely that of Ergo, the controller of Shadowlands) that are open all the way for neutrals. <BR>gaute - It just gives them a more limited range of monsters to battle. There will be more than enough, though, only fewer choices. <BR><BR>Marius - .... my last sentence was supposed to be: tacks in addition to be permanent stat buffs if you missed it =) <BR><BR>gaute - Daquis: is the land control in sl separated from the nw so that even if you have 5 bases on rk you can have more on sl? on a related question, estimate how long it takes to come back to rk from sl if you are attacked? <BR>gaute - No. It is the same. Depends where you are bound. You will have to go to Jobe to access the Grid. It will be 3-4 hops through teleporters more than today. Some additional minutes, not hours - no waiting for ships etc <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>blackmane - Salmak: since someone stated that fp will no longer be continued, could you give us some sort of an idea as to what your new vision for the agent profession is? <BR>blackmane - Damage, damage and more damage. The agent will be at the top of the damage range after SL. <BR>blackmane - No other ranged profession will come close, and only the MA will come anywhere close to it (and only when using fists). <BR>blackmane - The NT will be on the same level as the agent when using nukes (slightly above because they can't sustain it for long periods of time), but the agent is all about damage in SL. <BR><BR>Marius - Fatcontroller: will taunt nanos ever be useful <BR>Marius - marius: Yes in the shadowlands they will be very useful unless you plan to get your group killed a lot .. =) <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Cheesecrunch: hi, will you guys replace the non usable items (grid armor,yalms) with the sl verision for people who already have it? or will we have to reearn it? <BR>JimSalabim - We haven't got the whole Grid Armor procedure nailed yet, so I'm sorry I can't answer you on that at the moment :/ When it comes to Yalms: No flying is possible in the Shadowlands. <BR><BR>blackmane - Fatcontroller: will hots ever have level limits on them! (i mean for the target not the caster) <BR>blackmane - If I can get away with that nerf, then I personally have no objections to putting level requirements on the HoTs. But of course, whether I can do such a nerf with our players is another thing. <BR><BR>gaute - MORB: an upside of ao is that its designed to allow for short duration play sessions. problem is, at the current time, the only activity that fit such a short session are missions. will there be other viable alternative to get reasonable exp when we have only a couple hours to play ? <BR>gaute - n <BR>gaute - eh <BR>gaute - First of all, there will be a lot of roaming monsters, tiny camps and areas to explore in Shadowlands. Secondly, there will be hundreds (!) of mission dungeons, that will also instansiate (additional dungeons will be spawn if the previous one was too crowded). These <BR>gaute - there <BR>gaute - will contain bosses, chests, everything you know from a missions (except the reward). You can log out outside the dungeon, and stay there as long as you want! (No need to go back for an additional mission, like today). I dont think Shadowlands will be less friendly for solo players or shorter duration play sessions. It will simply be better for teams and large groups (20+)... <BR>gaute - I dont think Shadowlands will be less friendly for solo players or shorter duration play sessions. It will simply be better for teams and large groups (20+)... <BR>gaute - repost - sorry <BR><BR>Adrazar - Jerrikk: will there be shops in the shadowlands, and if so, any new kinds? <BR>Adrazar - Yes, there will be shops and yes, they will be different. But in most places they will be few and far apart. <BR>Adrazar - The Redeemed and Unredeemed sides will provide travellers with some basic shops, but the most interesting marketplaces are in the Yuttos settlements. There one can get hold of various instruments and raw materials that are otherwise hard to find. <BR><BR>blackmane - Schop: you stated that agents will have the highest damage per minute. where does this leave mas, being that the 2 ma advantages (highest damage over time, and best evades) are nowhere near met? <BR>blackmane - As I said with the agent question, MAs using their fists will be at, or around, the same level as the agent in terms of damage-per-minute. <BR><BR>gaute - additional mission, like today). I dont think Shadowlands will be less <BR>gaute - Ghand: will shadowlands recruit new accounts, i quit a long time ago but i am wondering, would it be possible to reroll , even thogh you would have no money and items <BR>gaute - dopey copy paste ;p <BR>gaute - Yes, you can start all over with Shadowlands. If you mean, can you reactivate your account and continue playing with Shadowlands, the answer to that is also yes. <BR>gaute - Madexar: is the new faction system going gamewide, or is it just in sl? <BR>gaute - It is only for Shadowlands for now. We have the system for going gamewide, but we have not added factions to the existing monsters. The major reason for this, is that we will want to see how the Factions evens out before we change the world. A one step at a time approach, in other words <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>Marius - Lheann: will the changes to the special attack system be available to non sl players? or will a player have to have sl to get the improved special attacks? <BR>Marius - marius: You will need to buy SL to be all you can be =) <BR><BR>blackmane - Cabal: qt : we have heard that the ma will be a major damager in sl ,which is nice, but in pvp we suffer badly from roots will there be any additional help with combatting them ?? <BR>blackmane - Yes. There are a couple of perk lines specifically desiged to counter roots and snares. These perk lines give you innate resistance against roots and snares. <BR>blackmane - Additionally, they provide some special abilities that can instantly remove and root or snare from you (although those abilities can only be used infrequently). <BR>blackmane - From a brief look at my spreadsheets, a MA could possibly get 70% innate resistance from perks if they decided to put their perk points in that direction. <BR>blackmane - But that, is of course, subject to change right now. <BR><BR>Marius - Zagadka: how will the doctors healing capabiltiies be expanded? we are currently limited to using one heal nano for most of the game - will there be new types of heals, or just more powerful ones? <BR>Marius - marius: There will be new and there will be more powerful ones. With the perks doctors can also be more nano efficient when using heals. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Octo: jim salabim mainly: last devchat it was said that special notum could be extracted from the towers and used in tradeskills processes. this can introduce an shift in the economy as one side can get the best towers and thus control the flow of those special tradeskill items, effectively blocking out others, and then mainly low level players who cant defend against a huge enemy with a strong benefactor. have you thought about this scenario and what ste <BR>JimSalabim - Your question is cut, but I'll try answering: There should be towers enough to prevent that to happen ...often. Also the allowed difference in QL on combine items should be genereous enough to prevent it. ...And the resource is tradeable I believe. <BR>JimSalabim - Hope that wasn't too fuzzy... <BR><BR>gaute - fusioncon: 02with the improved look of the game in shadowlands, is anything also being done to optimize the engine, such as quicker texture loading and better caching? <BR>gaute - Hm. There are several upgrades to the engine with Shadowlands. Most of them are focused on the look and ambience that our engine can deliver. Most players will find the Shadowlands playfield on an average a bit tougher to run (systemwise) than Rubi-Ka today. I am unsure of to which degree we shall try to optimize this, but normally that is one of the last aspects of the engine improvement in an upgrade cycle. <BR><BR>blackmane - Shadowzar: ok mps want to know what our roles will be. will we as mps have a specific role in sl ? what will we offer to a team besides mochams ? will our creation weapons be revamp ? will we recieve a more powerful pet ? will we finally get a useful weapon to use ? we of mps want to know, where is our profession going ? <BR>blackmane - The MP will get some new pets in SL at the higher end that are a lot more powerful. <BR>blackmane - The damage-debuffing aspect of the MP is being heavilly augmented in SL - that will become one of your major roles. Being able to reduce the damage being taken by over 700 points per hit is a major bonus to any team. <BR>blackmane - But, players will still want MPs for the Mochams - after all, who wouldn't want an 8 hour combo mochams that has all 6 mochams in one? <BR>blackmane - I do not think the creation weapons will get a revamp before SL is out, but I would like to be able to take another look at them sometime in the future. <BR><BR>Marius - Jerrikk: can you please give us more information on the shadowbreeds. will they be like a special ability you can morph into? and how will you obtain them? not many people know what to expect. <BR>Marius - marius: Shadowbreeds is a state you can briefly experience when you are post level 200. In short it is a new, very powerful, almost god-like special attack you can execute. When performing this special attack you may experience weird shape changing effects on your character as you are drawing powers from the unknown realm of the Shadowlands. <BR>Marius - To obtain the Shadowbreeds you will need to show yourself worthy and solve some problems or issues some NPCs might need a hand with <BR>Marius - some problems they may have .. <BR><BR>gaute - Mattie: there have been worries of the new city jobe becomming incredibly laggy. it will no doubt turn into the new center for the game. people idling, and being able to sell items to both sides will no doubt turn the city into a combination of nl/tir/and omni1, is there any steps being taken to fix what could be a large problem? <BR>gaute - First off! Let me underline, we are worried about this too! Having been worried we have done several things. We have done several things to make this less likely: <BR>gaute - 1. The 3 islands segregates on level. Highest levels have access to all 3, lowest only 1 etc. <BR>gaute - 2. All "embarkment areas" will be instansiated (exist in several versions). <BR>gaute - 3. If need be, each island will become a separate playfield. And we shall do more, if necessary. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - darthbobo76: i was wondering if you could tell me about some of the new items/weaspons for the crat proff <BR>JimSalabim - The crat will get a Profession Spesific Suit like all other professions. He will get some weapon of his own, and there will be a few other gadgets, weapons and armor spread around as well. There will also be stuff you'll share access to with other, selected professions. I don't think I will go into more detail than that, really <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>Adrazar - Ront: how is dieing handeled in sl? reclaims?! in rk we have the insurance... in sl we have..... ? <BR>Adrazar - Well, no one has died there yet, so it has to be seen. But rumor has it that it is take care of by the same ancient technology as is used to spawn some of the more illusive beings in the shadowlands and was described in the Peek of the Week on IGN last Wednesday. <BR>Adrazar - But my advice is to be careful when you are in the Shadowlands and dont die <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - Cheesecrunch: will the jobe aprts finly have bed and chairs ect? <BR>gaute - Depends on which you are refering to. We have 2 jobe apartments. They are each looking very much better than the existing one. (All appartments will be upgraded to hold more "items", btw. Even the old one.) Let me brag about the "prepaid apprt" (Big surprise ;p) <BR>gaute - It has 3-4 rooms. <BR>gaute - A balcony overlooking the city! <BR>gaute - A luxurius bath, japanese style living room and an EXCELLENT view of the city through windows! It has shelves, carpets and the lot. <BR>gaute - Hmmmmmm..... <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - Eh, that was preorder appartment, naturally <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>blackmane - Jalla: any plans on extending the humidity extractor nano line and nano crunch line for nts? i would guess the new powerfull nukes uses more nano. <BR>blackmane - No, but that isn't to say that the NT won't have more nano refreshing abilities through the perk system. <BR>blackmane - As an example, the Notum Siphon perk line provides you with a permanent, innate nanopoint HoT - at the full 10 perks in the line, it is refreshing 417NP every 5 seconds. <BR>blackmane - Or you could go with the Channeling of Notum perk line, which provides a permanent innate, team-based nanopoint HoT, although much weaker than the Notum Siphon. <BR>blackmane - Then their are the special abilities which will give you back nano points. <BR>blackmane - So, don't fear, there are a lot of new ways to get back nano points for the NT. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Randle: will tradeskills play a more important role in the creation of powerful weapons in sl? or will tradeskills (like weapon crafting, armoursmithing) still be relatively useless? <BR>JimSalabim - I think I've answered it before, but yes; you will really need tradeskills in the Shadowlands, weapon smithing and "armor crafting" definetly being among them <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - Ghand: will there be any way for solo players to play, without having to be buffed constinatly <BR>gaute - Yes. But! There will never be any way for you to be AS effective as when you get buffed. That would make no sense, I think (personally). That would make all professions a solo-machine, and that would take the enjoyment out of the team effort. <BR>gaute - Lets face it, AO is MORE enjoyable in a team, but it should still be good fun going solo! This is still our goal, and I think we have delivered on this so far in the game... <BR><BR>blackmane - techblast: have you decided who will get transport nanos? will engies keep the bw nano line or something similar? <BR>blackmane - I assume you are talking about the Shadowlands playfields? <BR>blackmane - No, beacon warp will not be available in the SL playfields because we don't want you to be able to bypass the playfields. <BR>blackmane - The fixer will get some evacs nanos specific to the SL playfields, so they can get themselves and their teams out of tight spots. But that will only move you to a different part of the playfield, not to the grid like the current evacs. <BR><BR>gaute - Zane0: can we buy ql 125-ql2 200 nano kits and treatment kits in chadolands? <BR>gaute - you will be able to buy higher level equipment in Shadowlands (including treatment kits). I think the current cap is 150, but we might tweak this more... <BR>gaute - As stated before, the Treatment kits that work in Shadowlands will not work on Rubi-Ka. They have slightly higher heal-per-second, but requires you to sit "enmeshed" in the Source while you use it. You shall see, they work differently... <BR>gaute - CerebriX: will there be any better system than just a chat channel for players that want to sell items to other players? <BR>gaute - There are no current plans for that in the Shadowlands. I can't promise you this, but it fits better with the next booster pack, titled "Towns of Rubi-Ka" as it will focus on social interaction. <BR><BR>blackmane - Susano-oh: can you tell us the damage hierarchy - ie who are supposed to be the top damage dealers. <BR>blackmane - Bet this results in some nice flames, but... <BR>blackmane - It goes roughly in this order: NT (nukes), agent, MA (fist), shade, adventuer/soldier, keeper <BR>blackmane - The Shade will be relying on the special attacks they get from the perks to be dealing out a lot of their damage, and a MA using only weapons will be way down the damage-dealing food chain. <BR>blackmane - Those are the main damage-dealing professions, or at least those at the top. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Chronita: the knife or sharp object throwing skill is currently useless in ao - what kind (if any) implimentation will we see for it in sl? <BR>JimSalabim - It should be possible to find some use for it, but I'm not certain what we've agreed on there - I'd have to check on it. It is probably among the last minute priorities if it's there... <BR>JimSalabim - Sorry I can't be more spesific :/ <BR><BR>blackmane - Fixere: as the grid armor is going away in sl, will there be any other options for non-armor fixers rather than normal armor? <BR>blackmane - To put it simply, no. You will need to be wearing armor, like everyone else. <BR><BR>Marius - Hannobal: will players get manuals of perk lines or do we have to guess in which line to invest? <BR>Marius - marius: There will be help texts associated with the perks =) <BR><BR>gaute - Karrd: will there be a way to select which gs you zone into, or more specificly will there be an automated zone into the gs your team is in fuction? (ie: if someone dies in your team at to3w, everyone has to runout and reenter) <BR>gaute - We are working on the team-zoning thing, yes.It has high priority, but it is a technically challenging thing as it requires lot of intra-server-communication, so I am not 100% certain it will make it in. <BR>gaute - I think it is better to say, "im not sure" than to disappoint you all if it doesnt make it. You cant expect all of them to make it, but you should not expect none of them to make it either. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Viro: will there be weapon sheathing in the possible future? or something where you can still have your weapon equipped but you can hold drinks & such at the same time? heh <BR>JimSalabim - It's indeed a nice feature, but it won't be part of the Shadowlands I'm afraid. Maybe in the next expansion - it would fit with the theme there. <BR><BR>Marius - Twicer: marius: will there be perks for tradeskills? <BR>Marius - marius: Engineer and Trader gets some perks that will help with their tradeskill process. <BR><BR>blackmane - Blasterx: what kind of new things the adv get, being that our top morph is practicly useless, what will we see in new morphs in sl? <BR>blackmane - There will be new, much nicer, versions of the wolf, sabretooth, and pit lizards coming. <BR>blackmane - Additionally, there will be an all-new polymoph that will enhance the healing abilities of the adventurer under certain circumstances. <BR>blackmane - One of the perk lines for the adventurer enables some new special attacks that can only be used in the polymorphed form (an example is the Devour attack which is a lifetap that can only be used when you are a wolf). <BR>blackmane - There are also rumors of a possible shadowy-enhancement to the leet line, but, shhhh on that <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - iged: in regards to faction standing , what benifits will it provide and what are some examples of how it is gained ? <BR>gaute - The faction standing is easily summed up as a gameplay mechanism for the Non Player Characters and Monsters in the game to decide HOW to react to you. They include: <BR>gaute - ) should I attack on long range (superaggro), b) should I attack on normal range (aggro), c) should I aid a friend being attacked, d) should I laugh at your death ;p, e) should I ignore you, f) should I trade with you and g) should I give you a "quest" or "static mission". <BR>gaute - e future? or something where you can still have your weapon equipped but you <BR>gaute - You shall be able to see by examining the NPC its standing with you. <BR>gaute - There is also a new Faction GUI... <BR><BR>blackmane - Twicer: adrazar: the keeper in shadowlands are supposed to be a tank-class although not as good at it as the enforcer, what makes the keeper unique (as opposed to just being a slightly toned down enf)? <BR>blackmane - The Keeper is a team-augmenting profession. Yes, they can be a tank if needed, but won't be as good as an enforcer or soldier. Yes, they do inflict good damage, but not at the top. <BR>blackmane - But the Keeper can have up to 3 different auras running at once, so they will be a benefit to any team with them. <BR>blackmane - The Keeper is based heavily on augmenting teams with their presence, not being a super tank. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Triffid: qt: will the doc prof have any new items/nanos in sl. their ability and role have been static for a long time now <BR>JimSalabim - Yes, the Doctor will get armors, nanos and weapons in the Shadowlands - like other professions. Her role will still be that of the major healer - not sure what other direction you'd think it natural that she'd take... <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>blackmane - Doctors will be getting a third DoT line in SL. New DoTs will become available, much better than before, so the doctor won't be a healer and nothing else type of profession. <BR><BR>Adrazar - breezer: when i started playing anarchy online, one of the things i liked the most was that noone really knew what the world looked like and there were new discoveries made every day, that has changed alot since launch and today with most players knowing exact spawntimes of most uniques and even the content of the next patch the exploration part has dissapeared almost entirely. do you plan to bring any of this more back to life in shadowlands? <BR>Adrazar - Exploration has been one of the keywords throughout the making of the Shadowlands. <BR>Adrazar - Some very basic things contribute to making exploration a larger element of the playing experience, like for example that you can not fly in there, maps need to be put together and made before they are uploaded, resources can be found and items foraged in obscure parts of the world, monsters will have more varied behavior and at the same time can be manipulated in more ways than today. <BR>Adrazar - But the biggest "thing" here is that static content will be so much more abundant than it is today and even though it is static, it is not necessarily always predictable. <BR>Adrazar - All in all: The one who keeps his eyes open and wits about him on his journey through the Shadowlands, he will succeed better than others. And leave no stone unturned, you never know if there will be something that saves your skin in your next encounter. <BR><BR>gaute - Nexxium: will there be lvl caps to attack mobs on rk? or will lvl 220s be able take it all <BR>gaute - There will most likely be 1 or both of the following systems in place: 1. A "teleport away" system for high level characters in the area on the monsters hate-list. 2. A "level-restricted" loot code. <BR>gaute - It means that for SOME boss monsters, for some of their loot, it will disappear if the player did not receive experience for it. <BR>gaute - The alternative will be that lower level characters will never be able to gain "their own" treasure, as most normal monsters will be "walks in the park" for the highest levels. It is yet to be determined to which degree we put this in place... <BR><BR>Marius - Hannobal: when i asked about perk manuals i did mean that ie. when taking 1st perk of line, do players get to know what will be the last perk in that line? <BR>Marius - marius: oohh, sorry, misunderstood you =) Yes! you will be able to see all info related to the perks you can at some time use. <BR><BR>gaute - Lheann: with respect to title caps. we have heard that the skill budget is getting changed. will the title cap levels of today be gone when sl comes? <BR>gaute - No, that is not true. But! You will gain additional skill from perks as well. This will mean that your skill (disregarding new items or nanos) will be higher than today. The title cap ABOVE level 200 will be substansially higher, for both skills and abiliteis. I was refering to below 200 characters. <BR><BR>blackmane - Chronita: are there any plans to augment or add to the ma healing lines in sl? <BR>blackmane - Not directly. But the Disharmony perk line provides the MA with a permanent, innate lifetap that will affect the MA's attacks. <BR>blackmane - So the lifetap will help the MA heal himself, but the MA won't become a better healer of others, no. <BR><BR>Adrazar - MORB: dungeons all over the place sounds nice, but wont it draw interest too much away from outdoor areas, that are usually more varied and pleasing visually, like it is currently ? <BR>Adrazar - No, not really. The dungeons in the Shadowlands have a specific mission and there you can get hold of specific items and resources. But most of what yo NEED to do, hapens in the outdoor playfields, there is no way around that. <BR><BR>gaute - Mattie: its quite obvious that the game can not handle more than 40 or so people in the same area at once, as evidence in the tramendous lag at tower battles. how will this problem be fixed in shadowlands when so many people try and explore everything new? <BR>gaute - First of all, I think that if you have problems with around 40 people on your screen, please refer to technical FAQ's on how to reduce the rendering settings on your machine. <BR>gaute - Secondly, yes, there will be problems at the very outset, I am quite sure - and we expect it and are working with several methods to reduce the impact!! <BR>gaute - Still, our servers actually handle more than 60% more people in one area than one year ago, and more than 100% more people in one area than at launch. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Berk: has there been any consideration in increasing the amount of variety in armor designs for higher end equipment? right now a large amount of armor available in the game at the high end is just a recolor or recycle of lower level armors. <BR>JimSalabim - Question Header <BR><BR>gaute - There will be several entrance points to the Shadowlands, spread over many playfields. You can get into it at 4-5 different places. We shall also add more, to spread people out, if necessary. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - We would like some variation between top and bottom level.. there will be some, but our resources are limited... and much work has gone into the profession spesific suits... I hope it will be enough to satisfy you... <BR><BR>gaute - eh, sorry <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>danielp - Zane0: any consideration of another ipr, or a quest to get more ipr points? <BR>danielp - There will to my knowledge not be any ip reset points offered within the Shadowlands expansion. <BR><BR>blackmane - Tyborg: when enforcers isent on the top of the damage dealing ladder, will they get any new way of taunting? <BR>blackmane - Yes. The Enforcer will get a lot of new ways to taunt. <BR>blackmane - There will be improved single-target taunts (up to 10k taunt per cast). <BR>blackmane - There will be perk special abilities for taunting. <BR>blackmane - There will be a taunt proc buff. <BR>blackmane - So, the enforcer will be able to deal out a huge amount of taunt to get and maintain aggro, never fear. <BR><BR>Adrazar - Lheann: concerning shops. with sl will we see items above ql125 available in shops on the rk side? <BR>Adrazar - As it is, only some selected shops in the Shadowlands carry items over level 125. <BR>Wolfgang - I would like to thank everyone for attending tonights Anarchy Online House of Commons Chat. The logs of the chat will be found over at http://ao.stratics.com later tonight. <BR>Wolfgang - Thanks again all! <BR><BR>gaute - Ok, thank you very much for turning up. Hope you had a good time, I did. Cya all in the Shadow… <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Lands <BR>* Marius waves * <BR><BR>gaute - Shadow… <BR><BR>Belith - box <BR><BR>
