          It seems as if our patience will finally be rewarded to rebuild Crimson 
          Sky as several long awaited games are finally just months away from 
          release. While it isn't a massively multiplayer game, I do have high 
          hopes for <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com" target="_blank">Neverwinter 
          Nights</a> as it's being released 30 days from now, up to 64 players 
          per server, built and run by players - not too shabby. Plus both <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com" target="_blank">Shadowbane</a> 
          and <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/" target="_blank">Star 
          Wars Galaxies</a> are both expected to be released in November and December

          <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 2nd edition of 
          Mayhem night is to be held in the lost world setting of Trakanon's Teeth. 
          This is a bit higher zone than perma, so I would advise only lvls 26 
          or 27 and up hunt here. This should be a fairly safe zone though, as 
          the zoneline for emerald jungle or either swamp of no hope is about 
          10 feet from where you pull to. Lots of froglocks here of all types. 
          Also be ready for raptors, Sabretooth Tigres, Carnivorous plants and 
          there are also some spectres in some ruins right near the zone. So Grab 
          your spellbooks, oil your armor, and sharpen your blades, for Trakanon 
          Teeth wont know what hit it by the time CSE is done with it for the 
          2nd edition of Wednesday Night Mayhem. Hunt time will commence at 8:30

          Sometime between March 19th, and 20th, the SQL server that had been 
          hosting the CSE database had it's main hard drive crash rendering the 
          server unbootable. As of yet I have not been able to get it functioning 
          at it's remote co-location, and it is en-route for me to work on in 
          Seattle. I'm expecting that it will not be back up at least for 2 days, 
          and even if it does go back up there may be up to a 7 day &quot;timewarp&quot; 
          between the last backup and the most current posting/database change. 
          <br>
          <i>Update: The hard drive crash wasn't as serious as expected, took 
          some simple repair steps, and I replaced the faulty drive with a matching 
          UW2 SCSI drive I had packed away in storage. Case closed, Database back 
          up 100%.</i></font>

The ID-75 layout software will allow you to create custom layouts for each and every game you will ever play on your PC giving you the ultimate control and reduced complexity. And with reduced complexity you will enjoy the gaming experience more as well as giving you the competitive edge needed to win!<p>Something like this is just perfect for old gamers like myself who keep forgetting hotkeys. Oh, before you get too excited the device is expected to sell for $199.00.<p>Source: <a href="http://www.massworks.com/id75.asp">Massworks ID-75</a>

Players that primarily play non PvP chars are invited to start a PvP ready newbie with us. We hope to train you to be able to defend yourself, and your Guildmates with skill and confidence.<p>Once a Player has reached the rank of Knight on the CSE UO Mainstone, you are then extended the option of adding a 2nd character to the Faction. You may even add this character to the Tradestone, The Crimson Sky Entrepreneurs [C$E].<p>For those that wish to carry on with the proud warrior Tradition of CSE UO, the soon to be activated Warstone, The Church of Crusaders [SKY] - may be for you.<p>All members will be accepted on a trial basis and given the rank of 'Initiate'. Aside from the requirement for sponsorship by an existing CSE UO Knight, recruits will only be asked to comply with the most basic skill requirements.<p>Your primary character will be required to have the necessary magery skill to cast recall without a scroll. If you are not able to recall as of now but wish to amend this, a member will be available for escort to have a npc train you.
