They will be held in a organized fashion - all topic items must be emailed to myself or Riva ahead of time. We will then add them to the agenda and an apointed moderator will give each person the "floor" to bring up their issue. Once all topics have been settled we will open up the floor and allow each member a chance to talk about anything not covered.

The date/time however is not set in stone, if we have a full plate of items to discuss, and can arrange for all members to meet in IRC we can hold them early. More info to come on this later...

<p><b>The CSE/UO Faction has been disbanded until further notice.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><b>Chain of command:</b></em></p>
        <p><b>Initiate</b>-This is an entry level position into the guild, a position 
          within the guild that represents that the individual has taken the path 
          of learning the virtues of being &quot;Sky&quot;. During this time all 
          initiates will follow the training guidelines to bring their new characters 
          up to a level worthy of being in the Guild.</p>
        <p><b>Squire</b>-This position is for those that have attained the goals 
          given to them during the initiate process. This position will also be 
          used for new recruits that have established characters already within 
          UO and conduct themselves in a manner that reflects those beliefs of 
          the &quot;Sky&quot;. </p>
        <p><b>Drake</b>-This position is for those that have proven themselves 
          as a valued member of the Guild. During their Squireship they have carried 
          out the orders given to them and have proven themselves to their Leadership. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Knight</b>-This position is for those that have proven themselves 
          to be both exemplary in following orders and helping their brothers 
          and sisters at all times. </p>
        <p><b>Lord\Lady Drake</b>-This possession is for those that have again, 
          proven themselves to be a valued member of the Guild. They have displayed 
          leadership qualities and they are now on the path to using their leadership 
          qualities towards the betterment the Guild.</p>
        <p><b>Lord\Lady Knight</b>-This position is for those that have displayed 
          the desire to lead and to teach all under their leadership what it truly 
          means to be &quot;Sky&quot;.</p>
        <p><b>Regent</b>-This position is for those that have displayed the desire 
          and passion for the betterment of the Guild and the well being of their 
          brothers and sisters. A regent's role is to carry out all orders and 
          policies handed down to them by the Highlord. Also to take any concerns 
          given to them to the Highlord for resolution. This is one of the most 
          celebrated positions within the Guild, and those that have attained 
          this title have proven themselves to know exactly what it takes to make 
          decisions correctly as it pertains to the well being of the Guild. </p>
        <p><b>Enforcer</b>-This position is equal to the status of a Regent title. 
          The Enforcer's job is to act out the laws and code of ethics set forth 
          by the Highlord. The Enforcer answers directly to the Highlord and must 
          understand that an order given to them must be carried out at all costs.</p>
        <p><b>Elder</b>-This position is for those that have been with the Sky 
          for a very long time. Though the days of leading or making decisions 
          might be over for the Elder, please understand that an Elder will be 
          treated with the utmost respect. For their honor has be attained already 
          and they remain in the guild to offer advice when asked, and to act 
          as a role model for all to look up to.</p>
        <p>All orders issued from the top will be sent down through the chain 
          of command. All grievances and issues will be sent up through the chain 
          of command. I have selected 2 current members to take their place as 
          Regents of the Guild. They are as follows,</p>
        <p>Over the next couple of days the three of us will be sitting down and 
          figuring out who fits where within the Guild today, and what responsibilities 
          and title that individual will be granted. Please take the time to congratulate 
          Riva and Spacial for their promotions next time you see them. For they 
          both have worked very hard over the past few months and both deserve 
          this promotion.</p>
        <p><b>Recruitment policy:</b></p>
        <p>All new members will be given the title of Initiate and then be asked 
          to complete an extensive training program. One that will take a bit 
          of time, but one I also feel will allow both the member to see what 
          being a member of the &quot;Sky&quot; is all about and allow the leadership 
          of the guild to see if that initiate is worthy of being a member of 
          the &quot;Sky&quot;. It has always been my belief in the past that we 
          must focus on quality and not quantity. The integrity and reputation 
          that Guild has made for themselves on the Pacific shard would be upheld 
          if this was the case. The brief outline of this training process is 
          as follows.</p>
        <p>An effective member of the Crimson Sky needs ALL 700 skill points that 
          has been allotted to his or her char. Yet there is no need to be draconian 
          about producing assembly line formula made members. I will however insist 
          that they clear define themselves as MAGE, FIGHTER or ARCHER. The only 
          exception will be the RANGERS, which primarily focus on animal taming. 
          This character class is highly specialized though, so it does not figure 
          into batch recruitment and training. Makes more sense to just enlist 
          the services of a current Grandmaster Ranger, of which they are a good 
          number of notable one through out the lands. I tend to feel that, if 
          you are going to take up a skill - do it till GM. </p>
        
<p><b>Operational Behavior while in the CSE/UO (During Missions Only!):</b></p>
<p>o In any operation there should be one or two leaders who will issue orders 
  and speak for the group. This includes any unplanned impromptu situations that 
  may arise, some individual MUST take command in a moment's notice and everyone 
  must recognize that person as the leader. People should be aware at all times, 
  even if only standing around outside the house, what the chain of command is. 
  In any sort of emergency situation, that individual must be deferred to. </p>
<p>o Everyone should remain quiet and pay attention to the operation leaders unconditionally.</p>
<p>o If you MUST say something msg it to the leader in IRC/ICQ. Do not be vocal 
  in game it looks bad and confuses the situation. </p>
<p>o If you have problems accessing the private IRC channels fix it yourself. 
  It is your responsibility to know how to deal with IRC. If you cannot enter 
  the private channel and will not be able to due to networking problems (frequent 
  disconnection's, DALnet services not responding, etc.) you should separate yourself 
  from the operation. Orders and intel will be conveyed through this channel and 
  without access you would be without the information needed to participate. This 
  isn't meant to alienate any individual, just a fact of life, you should respect 
  the commanding officer if he/she asks you to detach from the operation. Additionally, 
  if you have questions as to how to do an operation on DALnet, feel free to ask 
  any ops questions, just don't do it during a &quot;situation&quot; or operation. 
</p>
<p>o Do not convey any operational intelligence to non-CSE unless it is an explicit 
  joint operation, in which case a private channel will be arranged for all participants. 
</p>
<p>o There WILL BE respect for leaders. This includes any of the High Council, 
  any Team Leaders, any Operational Leaders and anyone who assumes leadership 
  position when no one else is of higher rank or able to assume leadership. </p>
<p>o Respect is demanded from ALL members, at all times, despite rank or current 
  leadership position. </p>
<p>o A character's POWER does not make him/her a leader. Actions, respect and 
  trust are what promotions and leadership positions are based on. </p>
