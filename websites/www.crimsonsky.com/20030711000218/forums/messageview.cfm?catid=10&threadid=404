								Wolfgang - Greetings and thank you for attending tonight's Anarchy Online House of Commons Chats. <BR>Wolfgang - Tonight's chat is focusing on "The road to Shadowlands: tradeskills, puzzles, quests" <BR>Wolfgang - I will be our moderator for this evening. <BR>Wolfgang - In order to submit questions please /msg or /query [QT]Devchat. Please /msg different question-takers at different times, in order to balance the load and speed this process up. Do not msg anyone from Dev. Team or myself. These questions will be ignored. <BR>Wolfgang - Remember that the Dev. Team may not have the opportunity to answer all of your questions. In addition, some questions may not be answered if the Dev Team feel that it is not appropriate or that it has been better answered through some other question. <BR>Wolfgang - The log of this chat will later be posted on http://ao.stratics.com so be sure to tell your friends if they missed it. <BR>Wolfgang - We'll start with a quick introduction from everyone, we'll then begin accepting questions. <BR><BR>gaute - Hello Everyone. <BR>gaute - My name is Gaute Godager, and I am the Game Director of Anarchy-Online. <BR>gaute - Thank you all for joining us on this devchat. The beta of Shadowlands is coming up soon, and todays topic is, as known, Toys and Puzzles. We hope you all have a good time. <BR><BR>Belith - Hello everyone and nice to see so many familiar faces. My name is Johan Karlsson and I am the lead designer of AO. You wont see me talk that much today as I will be working behind the scenes so you can get as many questions answered as possible. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Good Evening - my name is Trond, also known as Jim Salabim. I make most of the armors, weapons and other odd items in AO. I don't make nano's, but I do make tradeskill processes. <BR><BR>danielp - Hi everyone and welcome! My name is Daniel Persson, also known as longshot, and I work with Game Design. At the moment I am putting most of my focus on quests in Shadowlands. I hope I can answer some of your questions. =) <BR><BR>Lucien - Hi everyone <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> I'm Lucien and I'm the Customer Service Coordinator / ARK Manager. I probably won't be answering much today as its not my area but [QT]Devchat is my little question taking leet <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>Cz - Hi everybody. I'm Thomas Johnsen, Funcom Community Manager. I'm the evuhl chief moderator on the main forums, and your channel to the devs through e-mails, among other things. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - Ok, first question <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - akodoreign: will we be able to make ql 201+ shiny jobe implants 1300+ requirments are hard to get <BR>gaute - Yes, with the Shadowlands most of you will be able to do that. The skill budget is roughly doubled from 200 to 220. Around 2000 in treatment might be attainable.. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Techblast: the endless amount of tradeskill items that drop in missions, will they ever be useful? <BR>JimSalabim - Not sure what items you refer to, but I assume it's mostly the weapon tradeskill things. Yes, we do want to make them more useful with time - as we get time to use on it <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - ButWalrus: you guys dropped a bombshell on the fixer profession at the last devchat with grid armor(or the grid) not working at all in sl. can you give us some more detals on the new ga-like back-armor and any other new toys fixers will recieve? <BR>gaute - Ok, I will. I will say first that a lot of technology will change, not only affecting the fixer. We are working on replacement nanos for the fixers. Most likely they will not be as good on the evasive side as the GA, but might be comparable with other armor. The beta will answer this. <BR><BR>Adrazar - dkuneo: will we be able to raid uniques, as we are doing now, in sl? (like smug etc.) <BR>Adrazar - jont: Not only "like now", but to a much greater extent. The Shadowlands are full of unique monsters and NPC's. <BR><BR>danielp - jelloblimp: are there going to be new proffession specific quests or general ones that are the same to all players? <BR>danielp - There are going to be both general quests and profession specific ones. But we will focus on general quests that all have access to. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - nafchub: any plans on implementing alternate tradeskills? example being a campfire item created by the adventuring skill, which would increase healing and nano regeneration when dropped <BR>JimSalabim - Heh, we actually had a campfire item in beta, as you may know of. There were various reasons we had to kill that, but yes, we will be adding more and more variety to tradeskills, and skills like Adventuring will get more use soon <BR><BR>gaute - Otvillian: question: will one be able to earn experience points from trade skills to a bigger degree then one do now? <BR>gaute - There are no current plans of changing this. We are trying to balance this off as we see how things progress. The main reason for doing tradeskills are the creation of items. Just like with B&E the experience is just an added bonus. <BR><BR>danielp - Zxcs: will there be some more challenging quests? e.g team or even org quests? <BR>danielp - We will have quests both for loners and teams, some easy and some very very hard. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - umbrood: hia there, seeing as we now are able to preorder sl, i wanna know one thing, will we be able to just purchase it online, without the need for a box and stuff. i kinda like how the original release was available fast that way, why not follow up on that good idea? <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0">) <BR>gaute - Marketing is still discussing distribution details. We will have to get back to you on that, sorry. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - asjim: will we see more of trade skill oriented armor sets and other items in the future, and will these items differ alot from the uber non-tradeskill items in terms of performance? <BR>JimSalabim - You mean armors buffing the tradeskills I assume. Yes, you will get more of those, and they will give bonuses along the lines of other armors. Some of them will be versatile sets, some will be useful for tradeskills only <BR><BR>Adrazar - Thekkeht-JOL: will new good armor will be easier to get in sl (i mean for exemple by a sooable quest, not by taking half serveur on a unique mobs and to get a piece of armor). <BR>Adrazar - jont: A lot of different armor can be had in the Shadowlands and there will be several different ways of getting it. It is our wish that people should be able to solo for most armor in the game, but it is not thereby said that it is going to be easy. It is going to be time consuming and hard. The easiest way will to have friends to help you <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - Dhurdahl: any thoughts about upping the max 3 concurrents missions with sl? esp with a larger selection of quests this would otherwise be a problem <BR>gaute - Yes, there are plans for doing that. I cant say exactly what the number will be. <BR>gaute - Jorloja: hopefully falling under the toys catagory, will there be new social emotes? (not combat moves, emotes like /greet, etc) <BR>gaute - We are working on some new player animations. Most of them are in the areas of new special moves for the Perks and special attacks. We also have some time towards the end of production to look at social animations, but I can not promise anything there. It is still too early to say... <BR><BR>danielp - Muencha: will there be singleplayer quests in sl focusing on non-combat, quests where you dont have to camp mob x or bring 20 friends to kill mob y. <BR>danielp - Yes, there will be non-combat quests and non-combat parts in harder quests that focus on telling the player a part of the story or setting him/her up for a bigger battle. They will not require you to fight directly. <BR><BR>gaute - raja1: question: when will funcom address the lack of things for high level players to do ? and with the xp bug last weekend even more high levels now with the exception of a few camps such as mercs there is nothing for a lvl 200 player to do besides reroll will higher lvl content be added soon? <BR>gaute - It was my hope that we should get a bigger crowd of High Levels towards the launch of the Shadowlands. With the Inner Sanctium Update (14.9) the new dungeon, Inner Sanctium (obviously) will launch. It is styled towards high levels. <BR>gaute - That should give you something to chew on, hopefully <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Techblast: do you have any plans to make tradeskills viable at lower(&lt;130) leves. due to the limited market and few low-level useful items, it is no point in spending ip before the tl4 cap <BR>JimSalabim - We tried doing that in 14.8 - and I have the impression stuff like e.g. Junkmetal armor, the Eyemutant stuff and the Rollerrat helmet are popular also at low levels. <BR><BR>danielp - asdfasdfas: will there be more of an emphasis on quests? <BR>danielp - The quests in Shadowlands are serving many purposes, none of which is to take away the mindblowing adventure that is experiencing all parts put together. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>Adrazar - Dhurdahl: how will the camping of the uniqes be handled with sl? 18h spawn or triggers? <BR>Adrazar - jont: I dont want to spoil much here. I think I can safely say that there will be no 18 hour spawns, and also that there will be many different ways players can get to uniques. Triggers, scripts, quests, linked spawns, chained spawns.... even spawns that players can decide exactly when and where they get and engage. In other words, we have much you people will need to discover before you have seen it all. <BR><BR>gaute - umbrood: seeing as ga are going this way, can you give us an aproximation on how much of our current technologu will be rendered obsolete within sl, and i dont only mean yals <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - Ok, first let me state something! <BR>gaute - ALL of these changes will ONLY be inside the Shadowlands themselves. Nothing, NOTHING will change in Rubi-Ka!!! <BR>gaute - People have misunderstood this before... <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - 1. All treatment and nano recharge equipment will be obsolete. It will be exchanged with other, just as effective, equipment based on Spirit-Tech instead. <BR>gaute - 2. All flying equipment and nanos will be obsolete. So will all other cars. (I guess fixer-runspeed buffs will grow somewhat in popularity). <BR>gaute - (This includes also flying effects from Adv. Polymorphs). <BR>gaute - (but there will be new / other polys for the Advs <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - 3. All grid-in nanos, summon team member nanos, evacs etc, and teleport to location (NT) nanos will be obsolete. They will be replaced by something, but we havent decided which of the (3) alternatives we shall go with yet. <BR>gaute - 4. GA will not work as today. We hope to have a spirit-tech version of it ready for launch. It can most likely be gained through a quest. It will not work in the same way, but will still make the fixer very distinct. <BR>gaute - 5. Some nanos will work differently. The shadowland beasts are less affected by some nanos than others... This is a more detailed consideration, that we do ongoing... More details later... <BR><BR>JimSalabim - sadisto: with the last several patches, we have seen the introduction of several very difficult to obtain similiar (similar in stats) armor. can we expect most profession specific armor in sl? (please give me augmented dragon armor, ma only <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-happy.gif" border="0">) <BR>JimSalabim - Yes, most good armors in SL's will be either profession specific, or for a limited group of professions. MA's will get their specific stuff for sure - I guarantee that you'll be able to spot who are the MA's <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>Adrazar - Larza: will there be more omni-only and/or clan-only stuff ? <BR>Adrazar - jont: A great deal more, yes. <BR><BR>danielp - Twicer: will the xp-rewards for completing quests be substantially raised as opposed to just going out and killing mobs? <BR>danielp - Quests should reward the player with more experience than usual mob encounters do. This is something we will be working on in Shadowlands. <BR><BR>gaute - onehit: are there any plans for new, alternative methods of travel? for example new watercrafts, and will swimming ever become an important travel skill (seeing as it is not used except for a novelty at the moment and is usually laughed at)? <BR>gaute - There are new methods of travel planned. Especially getting back to the "gardens "inside each playfield will be relatively easy. <BR>gaute - Ionicdude: will the computer hardware requirements be higher for the shadowlands? if so what will they be? (im planning on upgrading my computer soon) <BR>gaute - They will be higher. We have not decided on the details yet. Sorry. I could recomend something for you though. What is your budget? <BR>gaute - AH, ok, not here... ;p <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Techblast: weve seen som cool new profession suits in the pics. will all professions get suits like this? <BR>JimSalabim - am afraid I have to inform you that the question to that answer is not no. <BR><BR>danielp - Psyonis: on average how long will the quests on the shadowlands take to complete? will they be similar to the quests currently on rubi-ka? <BR>danielp - There will be diffrent length on quests. Some will take you 10 minutes to complete some will take you several weeks. <BR><BR>gaute - corruptdr: are they any planned changes for the pvp system in sl? <BR>gaute - corruptdr: are they any planned changes for the pvp system in sl? <BR>gaute - Not the core system. There will be some rebalancing done due to the upped power of the EP1 professions... <BR>gaute - hehe. a small spasm there ... ;p <BR>gaute - Larza: i heard some rumors that you were making org houses will this happen ? <BR>gaute - Not for the Shadowlands. Yes they are in the making. The most likely target for those are the "Towns of Rubi-Ka" or the next EP... <BR>gaute - Kaghelion: about the mission interface in shadowlands: will you be able to get some control of the mission reward? ie the fixer wont be happy to get an adv-only sword for example. or will there be new tradeskill processes to make the items you need? <BR>gaute - There are no mission rewards in the regular sense of the word in the shadowlands mission dungeons. Come to think of it, calling them Mission dungeons, is wrong in itself. <BR>gaute - They are dynamic "team-mission-like" area dungeons. They will have static loot, in the sense, that all special drops will always be the same in all dynamic dungeons. <BR>gaute - when you go to a special entrance, enter it, the area will be created. It is a static-dynamic dungeon. The layout will be the same. The bosses and mini-bosses will be different, and so will their loot, but they will be picked from a preset range of monsters and loot. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Kitao: in the shadowlands movie released a while ago there were four renders of armor and weapons, can you tell us what makes these items stand apart from what we currently have on rubi-ka ? <BR>JimSalabim - Mainly their look, but also more damage, AC, buffs and all that - the whole budget has increased quite a bit with Shadowlands. Profession specific armor will be levelling items, so you will want those at least for that. I think. <BR><BR>Adrazar - Madgadget: has the development team thought of maybe increasing the size and scope of dungeons and indoor-complexes to allow for more variable groups and a larger sense of adventure in shadowlands instead of just adding more loot? exploration is always something that perks interest and imagination... will the inner sanctum be larger than the current temple of three winds or will it be around the same size and do you have plans for similar dungeons i <BR>Adrazar - Question Header <BR>Adrazar - Level: 1 Status: Open <BR>Adrazar - jont: There are several different types of indoor playfields planned for the Shadowlands. Some ment for questing, others for soloing and yet others for large scale raiding. <BR>Adrazar - Dungeons will usually have different roles. Yes, place to get items, but also see NPC's and dig up information <BR><BR>gaute - Wonkie: is it possible to you get one or two more slots for characters if you buy sl? i hardly cant fit with all my chars ;d <BR>gaute - hehe. I am investigating it. I see the need, but I dont know (yet) how technically difficult it is. I guess it is 50/50. If, and I underline -IF-, it is possible, I shall add 4 new slots... <BR>gaute - The chance is 50/50 <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>danielp - Twicer: question: will quests require people to use their heads instead of their fists? right now, what every quest boils down to is just killing a mob (regardless of what the quest is really) <BR>danielp - We will try to avoid camping, but we can't predict all bottlenecks. And the quests difficulty raises with the intended target level for the quest in question. <BR><BR>gaute - CLU: since the topic of bringing teams into missions keep coming up... are there any plans for new interface features to make finding teams easier? <BR>gaute - We are planning to do something with the GUI towards this summer / autumn. I dont know how much will get into the Shadowlands, so we dont announce anything untill we know. A match-making gui has been designed, and is fairly high on the priority list... <BR>gaute - No ETA yet <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> Sorry... <BR><BR>danielp - Kingfrat: will there be under water quests where you will have to swim/dive to reach the entrance? <BR>danielp - We are looking into it, so there *might* be =) <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Dooley: one of the problems with tradeskills today is that most of the items a tradeskiller can make from scratch can also be found im missions or purchased in stores. are there plans to allow weaponsmitsh (in particular) to create some unique items? <BR>JimSalabim - I'm not sure I agree that "most" can be found in missions as well, but yes; Weapon Tradeskills are possibly the worst off among the tradeskills right now. That will improve with Shadowlands - weaponsmith services WILL be in demand by everyone there. <BR><BR>gaute - Demi: what is the planned ratio of item bonuses vs natural skills in shadowland. rather how is the skill distributon from respectively items, towers, perks, specializations in relation to the overall skill budget? <BR>gaute - The skill bonuses from items / skills will more or less keep the same ratio. But there will be a new component in town: Perks it will add rougly the same as the other 2 components, but much more profession specific. <BR>gaute - Amis: can you please tell us more about sprit-tech? <BR>gaute - Spirit-Tech is just a coin for some of the ancient technology that is being redescovered in the Shadowlands. For instance the Shadow will not use implant, but harvest Spirits that he will intergrate into himself... <BR><BR>danielp - Twicer: jimsalabim - will there be breed-quests as well as profession-quests? many items in the database have yet to reach the game, such as the i am the .. rings <BR>danielp - Well, partly. At least some part of quests may be customized depending on your breed. <BR><BR>Adrazar - Frankt: ok since flying is going away...how do you plan to get away from the eq style of haing to walk for days to get to mobs.... <BR>Adrazar - jont: There will be some different ways of getting around. It will be vital for people to use the help that the sides offer for travelling i.e. garden portals etc. Gaining control over Notum Veins will also make it easier to get around. Some professions will get nanos that can transport themselves and others inside playfields and there are other methods as well that we are not going to tell you what are <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-tongue.gif" border="0"> We want to have some surprises here as well <BR><BR>gaute - Phione: if nothing changes in rubi-ka, does this also mean the new armor or other equipment we acquire in sl wont work on rubi-ka ? <BR>gaute - It will work for you, but will most of the time not be tradable to non-shadowland owning players. We will rebalance some of the bosses in RK. Most likely put a level cap on some of them, so that they can be enjoyed by the appropriate levels, and not get too much own by the lvl 220s... <BR>gaute - (owned) <BR>gaute - <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Madgadget: are most of these new toys and items going to be for higher level characters only, or will you be catering to the lower level class of folks who play. some of us do much more than level every day and could you explain to what extent the different title levels of players will be catered to? <BR>JimSalabim - There will be something for all levels and title levels, with a little more for mid and high levels, as that is where most our players are. <BR>JimSalabim - Enough for all I hope. <BR><BR>gaute - corruptdr: so sl is going to be a new server? or place we can get to from rubi-ka. do we have to start a new character and new acount on the sl server? <BR>gaute - Same servers. It is indeed a place. You can go there with your existing characters. (Message from the Nasties in SL<img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> "In fact, we hope you do. Whouahahaa". You can also make a new character. All character professions can begin in the Shadowlands... <BR><BR>JimSalabim - zemar: will you try to avoid the scenario we have today with 1 armorset (azure) that are really superior to everything else and dont offer much variation among the top players? <BR>JimSalabim - Yes, because each profession will get their own set - each will get their own "Azure" in a way <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0"> <BR>JimSalabim - That's a little more variation at least... <BR><BR>gaute - jelloblimp: the new proffession shade cant use implants, will there be skills/items that balance this? <BR>gaute - As I said, they will get spirits that do the same function. They will not be created using tradeskills, though. They will be better in some areas, and worse in others... They will be more than enough for the Shade to shine, eh, fade away.. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - alex1: also will shadowland improve on the ao engine ie better graphics bigger mission areas <BR>gaute - Yes to both. We will add quite a lot of more graphics, effects (like better water ie. Actually, very nice water!) and texture resolution. As you most likely have seen from the Screenshots posted around, it is looking very nice. <BR>gaute - A brand new Mission style has been created (Weve coined the style "techno-Moria" (sorry Tolkien <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0">, and it is looking great. The rooms can and will be around 4x current room max... <BR>gaute - (Huuuge!) <BR>* danielp smiles * <BR><BR>danielp - indeed <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Hi, Dhurdhal <BR>JimSalabim - Dhurdahl: are we going to see more step wise building/upgrading of items, like the eng tinker gun? <BR>JimSalabim - I hope so, but I'm not sure you will see this first thing in the Shadowlands. There will be some step wise processes, but not that many upgrade processes. I hope I can get time after SL's to put in more upgrades to existing stuff that needs a boost. <BR><BR>gaute - Madgadget: what will become of the role of independant people (currently called neutrals) in shadowlands? it seems as if we are being totally cast aside in the shadowlands and have not gotten any attention. could you explain what is happening to the role of neutrals in shadowlands (and in ao for that matter) and if we will be getting any independant-only benefits? (i hate the term neutral...i am on my own side, not omni or clan, thus i am not undecid <BR>gaute - Yes, i can... All entering the Shadowlands (as new characters) will do so without any alligience. It is only when you go to Rubi-Ka you must chose sides. <BR>gaute - A "neutral" player will gain factions and Shadowbreed abilities from both sides in the shadowlands. If you are good at being indipendent, i hope you are good at balancing. <BR>gaute - You can balance, owing alligience to both sides, but it wont be easy. The Faction system is created to make leaving neutrality to happen ONLY by choice, and not coincidence. <BR>gaute - You can stay neutral still, but again, your role, as in Rubi-Ka, will be that of a "balance-tipper" more than a "doer". <BR><BR>Adrazar - Quivex: so, when you create a new player, do you choose what city you start in (ie a shadowlands city or rk city) <BR>Adrazar - jont: If you decide to start in the Shadowlands, you will be born in a research facility inside the Shadowlands themselves, run by the Jobe scientists. You will however be able to create a character the same way as is done today. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - Lsnake: when talking about tradeskills, have you been thinking of being able to modify your own equipment/armor even weapons? there are a lot of good ideas about weapons that would need fixing, will players themselves be able to modify already finished weapons(to a certain degree)? <BR>JimSalabim - Upgrading existing weapons/armors is something I'd defineatly like to do sometimes instead of just pumping out more new stuff, but this is not something you'll see as part of the Shadowlands - (although you will get something related). <BR><BR>gaute - umbrood: oh oh, heres one more, are you guys sticking to the 4 year time span??? will ao end? <BR>gaute - can say as much as we are behind schedule <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0">. We shall see how you, the players are taking our escalation, if you go with the ball so to say. The next EP is already on the drawing board, with another turn of the Story Ark. Ask me again in 1 year, ok? <BR>gaute - (escalation of the story) <BR>gaute - Meister: what about crats? no word about us yet, so let us hear what crats will be good for in the shadowlands, besides saying crowd control. <BR>gaute - The crat will get: <BR>gaute - 1. More on the Pet front <BR>gaute - 2. More on the Charm side (this is where your MAIN source of damage will come from in the SL! Longer lasting, better charms) <BR>gaute - 3. Better (somewhat) nukes. <BR>Meister - <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-happy.gif" border="0"> <BR><BR>gaute - 4. Sorry to say so, but you will RULE in the crowd control area... ;p <BR><BR>Adrazar - Twicer: adrazar - its been said that pvp will play a much larger role in shadowlands than in plain vanilla ao - will non-pvpers still be able to get the side-bonuses ? <BR>Adrazar - jont: PvP will be a matter of choice and you will be able to get where ever you like and gain anything that is avaliable without it. You will just do things a bit differently. However, if one chooses to PvP, it will always be for a cause, for a special reason. <BR><BR>danielp - Kaghelion: will there be team-quests? quests that rewards team-play and that you can do together? (not just having your buddies coming along to outdamage everyone else but not getting any quest reward) <BR>danielp - Good question. I am looking into this at the moment. But the amount will be limited - if they make it into Shadowlands EP at all. <BR><BR>JimSalabim - MORB: you say often this or this profession will get special stuff and will be recognizable - will there be several equipment alternatives for each profession, or whall we fear that every membe of a given profession will somewhat all look almost the same ? <BR>JimSalabim - I am not sure whether all of one profession will look the same. There will be alternatives to wear, but whether people will choose to wear it or not only time will tell. I will at least do my best to make sure the various sets offer different stuff - enough for most situations and playing styles. <BR><BR>gaute - maddiganed: in previous dev chat, you have talked about beginning of beta end of april, beginning of may... now we are beginning of may and i still havent seen news about it.. is it delayed? <BR>gaute - We are very close now! Expect announcements about it to go out very soon. The date will be put out then... <BR>gaute - (Close to announcing the exact method and such). <BR>gaute - We are on time (right now) for launch end of July <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - Ok, that was the last question <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> <BR>gaute - THank you from us, the dev team... <BR>
