    </font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3">Walking through the streets of Qeynos, I am
    somewhat distracted by my thoughts. These last few weeks the Lady Siniana has continued to
    visit me in my dreams and I cannot go half a day without thinking of her. I can&#146;t
    help but wonder what&#146;s wrong with me; I am acting like a lovesick child. I, the great
    Temyez, conqueror of women, ruler of hearts! &quot;Bah&quot;, the thought brings a smile
    to my lips and a slight spring to my step. <br>
    As I round a corner, I am thrown against a wall by a robed figure, I can feel the tip of a
    dagger pressing against my gut from underneath the robes. He puts his face directly in
    front of mine, I can smell his rancid breath as he quietly whispers &quot;Ahhhhh, Temyez,
    my old friend, how have you been all these years?&quot; I am completely stunned, caught by
    surprise unable to answer. I quickly look over the face in front of me, slightly haggard
    and unshaven, one eye covered with a patch the other bloodshot and staring wildly, the eye
    of a madman. My eyes keep returning to the eye patch that covers his left eye, it has the
    design of a skull on it. I try to wiggle free of his grip but the tip of the dagger slides
    in a tiny bit, piercing me a little, holding me more solidly than any chain might. Quickly
    looking past my assailant I see two guards standing aways off, they both have noticed what
    is happening and are staring at us waiting to see if there might be trouble. &quot;Would
    you bring the guards down on yourself?&quot; I say, glancing in their direction. He turns
    his head slightly and upon seeing the guards relaxes his grip significantly, moving back
    slightly he assumes a friendlier posture towards me although the dagger stays where it is.
    &quot;Who are you? What do you want?&quot; I say to him, he glares at me for a moment.
    &quot;You don&#146;t remember me?&quot; he says, he looks completely amazed, &quot;You
    took my eye.&quot; I look at him while digging through the depths of my memories trying to
    put a name to this face, trying to make sense of what he is saying, &quot;perhaps you have
    me confused with someone else&quot;, I offer. &quot;You are Temyez, drunkard and
    braggart&quot; he states plainly. &quot;Yes, &#133;&#133;. I mean no, &#133;&#133;..
    argggg,I mean yes, I am Temyez, but I am no drunkard and I do not brag&quot;. Lifting the
    eye patch he reveals the wound that has left him blind, a large gash starts just under the
    eye and goes upwards to the mangled eye socket, &quot;you did this!&quot; he hisses,
    replacing the patch over his eye. Still trying to remember who this man is I shake my head
    &quot;no, this is a mistake. You have me confused with someone else.&quot; He lowers the
    dagger and backs away &quot;You don&#146;t even remember those you have hurt. There is no
    mistake, you took my eye, you embarrassed and shamed me, you took the only thing I ever
    loved, and for that you will die.&quot; He stares at me coldly &quot;We will meet in the
    arena tonight and I will have my revenge.&quot; &quot;I don&#146;t think so&quot; I say,
    &quot;I do not wish to harm you and I will not fight you.&quot; His cold stare becomes one
    of dark rage, &quot;You will meet me in the arena at sunset or I will kill all your
    friends. I will hunt them down and kill them one by one. Klymeth, Conwen, Haemish,
    Siniana, oh yes, I know all of them, and unless you fight me tonight I will find them, and
    I will cut their throats.&quot; Images of my friends being attacked by this man flashed
    through my mind, images of him sneaking up while they slept or jumping them in a dark
    alley, images I could not stand. He stops while walking away and turns toward me,
    &quot;Tonight at sunset in the arena.&quot; He smiles coldly and walks away. I am left
    shaking my head, confused, not knowing what to do next. &quot;Why?&quot; I ask myself,
    What is this about? I cannot remember this man, nor do I recall any of the things he
    claims I have done. I don&#146;t know what to do, yet there are only a few hours until
    sunset. &quot;I will meet this man for my friends sake. I will find out what he is talking
    about and I will calm him down, but I will not fight him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Time waits for no man, and before I know it the hours have passed by. I find myself
    entering the arena shortly after sunset; it is empty at this hour, all the battles and
    games of the day have long been over. Storm clouds have gathered in the night sky,
    lightning flashes overhead and thunder booms in the distance. My self appointed opponent
    is sitting in the middle of the battlefield, waiting for me. As soon as I enter he
    addresses me, &quot;I am so glad you came Temyez&quot; he yells &quot; Here I am free to
    kill you without worry of retribution from the guards.&quot; Even from this distance I can
    see the wicked smile that comes across his face. Rain starts falling, I yell back to him,
    &quot;What is this about? I don&#146;t even know why I am here.&quot; I am determined not
    to fight, to somehow talk my way out of this, I move closer to him so we don&#146;t have
    to yell. &quot;I don&#146;t even know your name, I will not fight until I know what this
    is about.&quot; He smiles even wider, &quot;I care not if you fight, only that you
    die&quot; he pauses, glaring at me, &quot;but, if it is an explanation you seek, then
    perhaps this will do.&quot; His smile disappears, &quot;My name is Anean and many seasons
    ago, you came into an Inn one evening, an Inn that I was at with my beloved. You drank and
    boasted of your travels and adventures. As the night progressed you became drunker and
    louder, you began arguing with another traveler. As we stood to leave you threw a glass at
    the person you were arguing with, in your drunkenness the glass flew wide and crashed into
    my eye, shattering and blinding me. A fight broke out through the entire Inn, I was
    knocked unconscious and unable to protect my love. She was accidentally killed during the
    fight, when I awoke days later, I had lost her, I had lost my life&quot; he looks up to
    the sky and screams, &quot;ARGGGHHHHH, YOU TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME, YOU DESTROYED MY
    LIFE!&quot; He stands up quickly, before I can even speak he begins chanting and suddenly
    I am thrown back and slammed onto the ground, something is choking me, I can&#146;t
    breath, I can hardly see. The rain comes down in buckets, I feel like the life is being
    drained out of me, crawling to my knees I look across to Anean. The lightning flashes and
    I can see him smiling, &quot;Ahhhhh, I feel much better now&quot;, I can hear him say. He
    walks towards me still chanting and I am bathed in darkness, I can feel the darkness on me
    suffocating me and in the background Anean laughing. My mind is racing with thoughts about
    what he has said, it is true I used to be a drunk, but that was long ago, it seems almost
    a lifetime ago. Anean is shrieking, &quot;YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT TEMYEZ!&quot; he continues
    chanting and a powerful wave of nausea sweeps over me, I roll over onto my back, I
    can&#146;t see anything everything is completely black but I can hear him chanting. I can
    feel my blood begin to boil, my God the pain, it feels as though I may explode. I can hear
    him yelling at me, &quot;YOU WILL DIE HERE, THEN YOUR FRIENDS WILL DIE,
    HAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot; Even through the pain my mind grabs hold of this last statement,
    &quot;My friends will die?&quot; What is this? He is killing me and then he will kill my
    friends? He is yelling uncontrollably now calling upon his God, laughing and shrieking
    obscenities at me, ranting and raving to the night. How did I get into this? He is killing
    me and then he means to kill my friends. What can I do? I pull myself up onto my knees and
    whisper, &quot;Tunare, please help me, give me strength, I need you now.&quot; The
    darkness starts to fade and I can see him standing not far in front of me, the nausea
    dissipates and my blood cools. Anean looks coldly at me and says, &quot; Now, it is time
    to die.&quot; Suddenly a lightning bolt shoots out of the sky and blasts the stone
    embankment near us, the stone explodes and Anean turns. The distraction is a gift from
    Tunare and it is all I need, I pull my dirk from its sheath and with the last bit of
    strength I have, I let it fly. The throw is true, and when Anean turns back to me the dirk
    finds its mark and lands with a thunk in the base of his neck. The sharp blade cuts
    cleanly and the dirk sinks all the way to the hilt. His one eye opens wide and there is a
    look of shock on his face, he falls to his knees just a few feet from me. I can see him
    mouthing words trying to speak, but no sounds come forth, only blood. He sits on his knees
    for a few moments longer then falls over. I look up to the sky as the rain falls and say a
    silent &quot;Thank you&quot; to Tunare. I try to stand but the fatigue and exhaustion of
    the battle overtake me, everything starts to spin and I fall, passing out. When I awake
    the rain has stopped and it is almost dawn, I drag myself up, pain shoots through my body
    and I almost pass out again, but I stop and wait for the weakness to pass. Anean&#146;s
    body is laying not far from me on the arena floor, I slowly walk over and pull my dirk
    from his neck, his one eye stares up blankly. As I half limp, half walk from the arena I
    see a drunk walking down the street, he sways and blubbers to himself as he goes along,
    his life a waste of whiskey and forgotten memories. I lower my head and as I stagger down
    the road towards an Inn and help, I begin to cry.</font></td>
