    clarification on the following Journal entries. These are excerps from a large RP that
    will leave Temyez's life changed. Most of it has been going on for a while and has been
    posted on our Guild's Message board. You will be able to understand what is happening from
    reading these journals, but try to remember that these are mostly from Temyez's viewpoint.
    All during the RP there have been other people writing and different aspects of the story.
    These writings are basically how things will affect Temyez. I felt that I should post them
    here because, first of all, I have spent a large amount of time writing them and it has
    kept me from writing any Journals here, and secondly, ...... well things have changed and
    I wanted to update you all. Thanks for coming back and reading and good luck to you all!

    face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">The day we had spent together at the Lake of Ill Omen was
    wonderful, as is all the time I get to spend with Lady Siniana. Our Lovemaking had been
    strong and exhaustive but also very refreshing. It had been far too long since we had seen
    each other and the short time we spent that day had gone by far too fast. The next morning
    I had to return to the mainland on Guild business, Siniana had accompanied me back to ease
    the long boat ride. We spoke of many things during that ride, the Love we shared, our
    future together, but mostly I remember just being with her. Watching her face light up
    when she smiled, her little mannerisms as she spoke, I had not realized how deeply I had
    fallen for her until just then, I couldn&#146;t imagine life without her. At the
    Butcherblock docks we had said our goodbye&#146;s and planned to meet up later that
    evening in the Faydark Forest, at a special spot we had once shared a picnic at very early
    in our relationship. I had told her that I would arrive by dusk and if she could have a
    camp set-up perhaps we could spend some more &quot;Quality&quot; time together, she had
    smiled and laughed when I had said that. We had kissed before parting and she tasted so
    sweet that I barely had the resolve to leave. Sensing that I may be hesitating, she gave
    me a small kick in the rear to get me going &quot;Now you hurry along&quot; she had said
    smiling, &quot;I will be waiting for you tonight.&quot; With a smile and a wink I had
    turned to run for the city of Kaladim, already thinking about my evening ahead with
    Siniana. The business I had in Kaladim was long and boring, and many were my thoughts of
    my Lady that day. Finally the business was finished and I began the run to the Faydark. An
    hour or so later as I approached the meeting place I could see no light from a campfire.
    As I entered the small clearing I could tell that someone had been here for a short time,
    but had left some time ago and not returned. It did not look like there had been a
    struggle, but I could not be certain. I looked around for signs as to what happened, but
    found nothing out of the ordinary. I started to fan out searching for something, anything
    that might indicate where the Lady was or why she had not come back. As I searched, the
    sun faded over the horizon and my chances of finding anything were quickly diminishing.
    Just as I thought it was hopeless I saw the light from a small campfire, moving towards
    the light I made my way through the brush quietly. As I approached I could see a lone
    figure sitting by the fire, he had on dark cloak with a hood so I couldn&#146;t see much
    of him, but I could see enough. He was a darkie I could see that, and the colored piping
    around the edges of his cloak indicated that he was a Templar. Thoughts rushed through my
    head, what was a dark elf Templar doing here, out in the middle of the lesser fay? And
    where was Siniana? This was too much of a coincidence, I figured there was a good chance
    that he had something to do with her disappearance. Moving around behind him I jumped from
    the bushes and ran towards him, hoping that I had enough surprise on my side to reach him
    before he could take action. He must have heard me coming for he was ready, he stood
    quickly turning towards me, a short sword in his hand. I could see the white of his teeth
    from the light of the fire as he faced me, I expected him to cast a spell or two right
    then but he held off. Perhaps he thought I was just a lowly thief or robber and did not
    wish to waste his mana on me, whatever the reason I am thankful for it. I closed the
    distance between us and he lunged at me with his sword. I had been receiving training in
    the Ancient arts of Combat for some time now and instantly my training took over. I
    stepped to the side, off the line of his attack and grabbed his wrists with both of my
    hands. Lifting his arm, I stepped under and through, twisting his wrist back towards him,
    I could see the look of surprise on his face as I moved. I needed information from him, so
    I did not wish to harm him, at least not yet, I put him into a wristlock and forced the
    sword out of his hand. I heard him begin to mutter an incantation under his breath,
    quickly pulling my dirk from its sheath, I slid the blade up under his chin and pressed it
    to his throat, &quot;Quiet Templar&quot;, I said, &quot;One more word from you and I will
    take off your head.&quot; I drew the blade across his neck slightly to let him know I
    wasn&#146;t kidding, his chanting stopped. &quot;Lay down on the ground&quot; I said, he
    laid down slowly and I put my knee into his back to keep him from moving around.
    &quot;Now, I need some information from you Templar, so I am going to ask a question and
    if you respond with anything other than an answer you are going to offend me, and I am in
    no mood to be offended right now.&quot; I said calmly, while watching him carefully. I
    took my dirk and set the tip of the blade right at the base of the back of his neck,
    &quot;And If you try and cast on me I am going to clean my blade with your brains, you
    understand?&quot; he nodded slightly to indicate his understanding. &quot;I am looking for
    a friend of mine, a paladin, a Lady paladin.&quot; I said dryly, not wanting him to know
    what my feelings for her might be. &quot;She was to be in this area to meet me tonight,
    yet I cannot find her, and I think you might know where she is.&quot; He wiggled slightly
    and I stuck my knife tip into his neck enough to draw blood, &quot;Don&#146;t play games
    with me Templar, think carefully on your answer.&quot; He hissed back at me, &quot;I know
    nothing about it, you fool, don&#146;t you know who I am?&quot; &quot;You are nothing more
    than a dead man if I do not get the answers I seek.&quot; I replied coldly. Grabbing the
    back of his hair with my free hand I pulled back his head and moved the point of my dagger
    to the opening of his right ear. &quot;Now, I will ask you once more Templar, and if you
    lie I swear by all that&#146;s Holy I will kill you, where is the paladin?&quot; He
    shouted back, &quot;I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about.&quot; Damn, I
    thought, this is getting me nowhere fast and the Lady may need me. &quot;You have no idea
    who I am do you?&quot; The dark elf half shouted from underneath me. &quot;My friends are
    very powerful, they will kill you&#133;&#133;..I will kill you when you let me up.&quot;
    He was ranting but I was barely listening to him anymore, grabbing a nearby rock I smashed
    him in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious and relieving myself from having to
    listen to anymore of his nonsense. Rolling off the darkie I sat thinking about the
    situation. Where was the Lady Siniana? And what, if anything, did this dark elf Templar
    have to do with her disappearance? I searched through the Templars belongings, looking for
    some indication as to whether he had anything to do with what was going on. Finding
    nothing, I sat down, still unsure if he had been involved. Looking over at the limp form
    of the Templar I realized I wasn&#146;t getting any answers here, involved or not I cannot
    waste anymore time. I thought to myself, what do my instincts say? My instincts told me
    she wasn&#146;t here, not in this forest, not even on this continent, and I have learned
    to trust my instincts. So, leaving the Templar to his fate, I circled back to the meeting
    place just to make sure I hadn&#146;t missed anything. Giving the place one more quick
    search, I headed off running towards the docks, listening to the sounds of the night, and
    praying that my Lady was alright. </font></td>
