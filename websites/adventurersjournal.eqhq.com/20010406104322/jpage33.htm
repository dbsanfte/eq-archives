    </font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">The chill ran deep. It ran right through my
    bones, it ran so deep. I couldn&#146;t seem to be rid of it, I just couldn&#146;t seem to
    warm up, no matter how I tried. The cold from Velious had settled into my flesh and now it
    felt as if ice was running through my veins. I had spent so much time in the snow and cold
    it had become a part of me, numbing me somewhat. It fit me perfectly though, like some
    old, comfortable shirt. &#147;I have become a walking snowman,&#148; I thought to myself,
    a smile playing on my lips &#147;The iceman cometh,&#148; <br>
    <br>
    I rolled unto my side and looked at the back of the woman lying beside me. Her long dark
    hair lay in pools around her lightly tanned skin. The moonlight dancing through the clouds
    made it look as if she were glowing in a soft, dull light. I reached up with my hand and
    lightly ran my fingers down the flesh of her back, half expecting her to recoil from my
    touch, shocked by the bitter cold of it. She only stirred slightly and made a soft cooing
    sound. My hand embraced her shoulder as I leaned forward and kissed the back of her neck,
    &#147;I am so cold&#148; I whispered. She slowly rolled towards me onto her back and
    looked at me with a smile. The light blue of her eyes looking almost gray in the weak
    moonlight, <br>
    <br>
    &#147;Then let me warm you,&#148; she whispered back.<br>
    <br>
    We began the dance of Lovemaking once again, the warmth of her body temporarily subduing
    the cold of mine. The heat generated from our Love briefly melting the ice that had found
    its way into my soul. Our passions rising together like some ravenous tidal wave, our
    breathing becoming short and labored as our bodies worked to find a perfect rhythm.<br>
    <br>
    Hours later just as the first hint of the sun began to rise over the Eastern horizon I was
    up and getting ready to move. As I prepared my things, I moved quietly, cautiously, not
    wanting to wake her if it could be avoided. We had met only yesterday, and it had felt as
    though there was an instant connection. Her great beauty had almost hypnotized me and when
    I had looked into her eyes I felt almost like I could disappear there, swallowed by the
    openness of her soul. This had been a diversion, as much for her as for me. Two hearts
    passing close to one another, needing to be consoled, needing to have the pain taken away,
    if only for a short time. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;Where are you off too this fine morning Temyez?&#148; <br>
    <br>
    My body relaxes as soon as I hear her voice, no more need to be sneaking around quietly. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;I have to be going, Treiria&#148; I reply, as I continue to collect my gear, this
    time not worrying about the noise.<br>
    <br>
    I stop for a moment when I see her sitting up, her hair falling down over her shoulders,
    slightly covering her bare breasts, the pelts pulled up around her waist. Her eyes are a
    lovely sky blue staring at me, unashamed, almost innocent. &#147;Will I see you
    again?&#148; she pouts, the tremble of her lips almost imperceptible. She is beautiful.<br>
    <br>
    I walk to her and kneel down, taking her hand in mine, &#147;I am of the guild Natural
    Selection M&#146;lady, if you wish to find me, that is where I can be found.&#148; I reach
    up to brush the hair out of her face and she grabs my hand in hers, her fingers wrapping
    tightly around mine as she presses my hand to her cheek. Her pain is obvious, almost as
    bad as the pain I carry. Memories, oh how wonderful, and deadly. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;I must go now, take care of yourself M&#146;lady.&#148; <br>
    <br>
    Releasing her hand, I stand up and throw on my cloak. Almost instantly the feathers begin
    to glow and within moments I am floating above the ground. With one last look at the
    lovely woman below me I disappear into the forest.<br>
    <br>
    The sun has already moved midway into the sky as I approach my new home, the guild house
    of Natural Selection. The first thing I noticed, even from a distance, was the huge oak
    tree that grew up and over the building itself, it was easily the biggest tree that I had
    ever seen. As I drew closer, I entered a beautiful glade filled with many large oaks. As
    soon as I entered the glade I could feel a living presence emanating from all around me.
    Oh, I have felt it before many times as I have traveled throughout Norrath, but here in
    this glade, it was almost overpowering, almost palpable, as if the glade itself was a
    living being. The trees seemed to have eyes, watching me as I passed, like some ancient
    guardians posted here to protect an immeasurable treasure.<br>
    <br>
    And the giant oak, it stood guard over it all, a giant protector towering over the entire
    glade, reaching towards the heavens. The force projected from this one tree was so
    awe-inspiring it took my breath away. I could feel the power of the Gods as I stood there
    looking up into the branches of this immense life-giving tree and it rocked me to my very
    soul. I almost expected the tree to come to life and begin speaking to me. Telling me
    stories of ages past, tales of the things that it has seen since it has stood here. In a
    sense, as I stood there staring, it was speaking to me and I was answering, becoming part
    of its story, part of its history.<br>
    <br>
    I approached the Guildhall itself located directly underneath the huge oak, situated in
    such a way that perhaps, at some points inside the building, the oak itself became the
    walls, lending itself to the building, intertwining together, perhaps becoming one. I
    walked through the ornately trimmed front doors still stunned by what I felt here, the
    power, the serenity, and the acceptance. I felt very welcome here, very safe and secure, a
    haven from the outside world. <br>
    <br>
    The first thing I saw upon entering was a large table set near the front door. On it was a
    small pile of letters and what appeared to be paper hearts. A smile crossed my lips as I
    stepped closer to the table, then my heart sinks as I recognize the writing on some of the
    letters and hearts. Slight pain shoots through my chest as I see MY name on one of the
    letters.<br>
    <br>
    All thoughts leave my mind, as I stand there unable to move, the pain of longing once
    again has returned and it hurts me so. Time itself seems to slow as I step forward and
    grab the letter addressed to me, holding it up to read my name in a writing that is very
    familiar to me. A single, solitary tear rolls down my face as my mind is filled with
    memories, images of my past flooding in.<br>
    <br>
    I can&#146;t think. I only react.<br>
    <br>
    Running from the building, I leave the glade behind, the power and serenity forgotten as I
    run faster. The branches of the oaks reaching out like arms to console me. Perhaps they
    too feel my pain, perhaps they understand. I do not know I only wish to get away. To run
    as fast and as far as I can, too outrun the memories and the pain.<br>
    <br>
    Much later, after I have run as far as I can, I fall exhausted on the shore of the great
    ocean. The exhaustion has released me from the memories and the pain, but it is only
    temporary, it will return soon enough. Sitting down I look out over the ocean, the sun
    shining down on the water creates blazing pools of fire on the surface. The waves crashing
    into the beach beating a soothing melody, the wind carrying whispers from far away lands.<br>
    <br>
    I hold the letter in my hands for a long time, staring at it as if it were some kind of
    hideous monstrosity, some abomination of nature. The memories have returned, bringing with
    them the pain of what might have been, the unseen weight of these memories crushing my
    chest, threatening to squeeze the life out of me. After what seems like ages, I lift the
    letter into the air above my head, the wind whipping against it, threatening to tear it
    open for the entire world to see. My fingers open and the wind carries it high up into the
    air out over the water, the lace ribbon tied around it flapping wildly, like some insane
    seagull trying to gain altitude.<br>
    <br>
    For a moment I think I should have opened it, just for a second, my mind thinks that
    perhaps I should have read it, but then the thought passes and I realize that it probably
    would have only brought more pain, more questions, more what-ifs. As I watch the letter
    float away with the wind, my pain seems to become more distant and I feel as though I am
    becoming numb once more.<br>
    <br>
    My mother always used to say that whatever doesn&#146;t kill me, will only make me
    stronger, I can almost hear her saying it right now. What she never said though, was that
    you would carry it with you for the rest of your life, that it would become a part of you,
    that it may even change you, if you&#146;re not careful.<br>
    <br>
    I know that now.</font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><br>
