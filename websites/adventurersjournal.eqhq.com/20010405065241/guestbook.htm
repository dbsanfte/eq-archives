I must let Tunare guide my heart to the right answer. =) I pray that she does soon, for I care deeply for him.

Hooked on Games Online 

LA times link 

http://www.latimes.com/print/20000512/t000044865.html

For the better part of nine months, Dan Gilbert of Red Lion, Pa., lost his wife, Lori, to an Internet game called &quot;EverQuest.&quot; 
     Each day Lori, 35, retreated to her computer in the basement and dove into the online sword-and-sorcery world, surfacing only to sleep and grab a quick bite to eat. Her computer log showed she played an average of 65 hours a week, eclipsing every activity in her life, including sleep.

Hmm, Laqueash, I do believe that you are mistaken. I know that Temyez is very true to me and that I have come to realize my love for him also. I believe that you and I need to discuss your advances towards him. I will be sending you a scroll here soon so that we may talk. I know that we don't actually exist on the same realm at this point, but nevertheless, this is unacceptable. Temyez is mine, and I challenge any that shall say differently. I believe that he would vouch for that also. Until then, please keep your hands off of him, and maybe you can learn how to spell also. =)

I was thinking of doing one of these my self.  I love your sight. I have a question when i hit 20 and get double attack will it be better to go with a strong 2hs or with some fast yet strong duel wield?  One more Question I have a friend who says that rangers have trouble finding groups at later lvls and that it makes it tough to lvl past 25.  Have you heard that or have you experienced that? Ive spent alot of time annd money on my ranger and love him but if i cant get into groups at later lvls that is a problem.

Ahh, I see you have finally given us a picture of your
lovely woman. She is truly beautiful, I have met her during
visits to Unrest, and I have never met a paladin who battles
as well as she does. I believe she is more beautiful when she
is fighting than when she is waiting for the battle to begin.
You truly are a lucky man, Temyez, and I wish you the best with
the Lady.

i like my guy he is prety cool, the olny prob
is that my guy is hated by all other races
(iksars).i should have gotten a higher 
lv guy and then picked an iksar.
this way i can travel and not starve to death
or something.
plus id have more money.
better weopon.
and more places to travel.
i still like him though.
but its defenently harder with an iksar if u dont
have another higher lv character.


P,S if anyone has a weopon for sale im in feild of 
bone on kunark.



   
 he is pretty cool

After reading your journals, I feel saddened. I do hope that Tunare will grant you the ability to be with your love again.
Your stories were so wonderful...this is awful news to read.
Tunare shall be by your side, my friend, I am sure.

very nice site :)  I enjoyed the poetry:)
Here is mine for my shadow knight &lt;br&gt;
The Cleric and the Knight

How could you stand the dragons fury
His mighty breath of flame
Did the light in your soul
Protect you this night&lt;BR&gt;

How could you stand the heat 
His wings raised from the
Hard baked cruel land
In which we found ourselves&lt;BR&gt;

My Knight in shining armour
You stood in front taking the brunt
Of the harsh battle
While I prayed to our gods &lt;br&gt;

Your life in my hands
I prayed for the strength
To replace what the dragon stole
His fiery breath shattering every spell&lt;br&gt;

Your hope was renewed, by the life you felt
From Gods answer, flowing from me to you
Your sword a flash of light 
In the gathering darkness, brought by the drake&lt;BR&gt;


With a last despairing cry, the dragon  fell
From the majesty of the sky 
To lay at our feet, slain, 
By the knight with his cleric at his side&lt;BR&gt;

A fallen angel comes to Temyez and wraps her in his arms, 
gently rocking him to sleep. 
She wishes she could heal his heart, make things wonderful again, 
but she cannot. All she can do is just hold him and keep him safe from 
harm again.

Your site gets better every day, m'lord. May Tunare keep

I currently have a level 43 Gnome Wizard and a level 26 Troll Shadow Knight on the Terris-Thule server. Both my wizard and shadowknight have awesome Wizard, Shadowknight, and Rogue items. I have about 4k total, currently; plus the items worn on both characters, and the accumulated loot I have. All of this I am willing to trade with anyone on the Zebuxoruk, for equal items or money. Mind you, I also will be willing to sell this account if need be. Again, these characters and the things I am selling are on the Terris-Thule server. If you are on either server and wish to trade with or buy from me; send an e-mail to MSILVA1@satx.rr.com. The name of characters on Terris-Thule are: Nori (Wizard), and Norinca (ShadowKnight). Sincere thanks!
