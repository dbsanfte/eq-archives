    <font size="4"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">It has been days since he has seen another
    human. Since he left the outpost of Fironia Vie he has seen neither man nor woman. He
    noticed tracks from travelers long since passed, but has seen no signs of recent travel.
    He has been searching the area for his Love, the Lady Siniana, but so far, with the
    exception of the wildlife, he has found nothing. Now, up ahead in the distance he could
    see a small plume of smoke rising into the air. The smoke looked like it was from a fire
    of some sort and he decided to head in that direction to check it out.</font><p><font
    face="Tempus Sans ITC">A few miles later, from a ridge that overlooked a small valley he
    could see the small shack. It sat alone in the middle of small clearing. Normally he
    probably wouldn&#146;t have looked twice at it, but out of the chimney came a steady
    stream of black smoke, which meant someone was home. And whoever was home might be able to
    help him. Heading down the ridge he moved cautiously closer, he still had a ways to go,
    but better to be safe than sorry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Inside the little shack, the dark witch stirred her brew,
    the smoke from the fire she had made billowed up and around the kettle, then out through
    the chimney. She had seen him coming in one of her crystals and had been preparing ever
    since, making up a spell that would be needed soon. The witch had lived most of her life
    here on the green, alone, just the way she liked it. But recently she had been thinking
    about her life and where it was going. You see, the dark magic that she worked had taken
    its toll on her body and left it mangled, and somewhat twisted. Although she was only
    twenty-five seasons old, she looked to be fifty or more. She knew she would not live
    forever, as a matter of fact, at the rate she was abusing her body she expected to live no
    more than another twenty seasons or so. So recently, she had been thinking about a child,
    someone to pass along the secrets of the arcane that she had learned in her life. Someone
    who could carry on her name and memories, and more importantly someone she could teach to
    be a being of pure evil and hatred. She had considered hiking into town and stealing a
    young child, one young enough to not have many memories, but that was risky business that
    could get a person killed, even a person as skilled in the dark arts as her. Recently she
    realized that she was carrying a seed of her own, If only she could get a man to help her
    conceive the child out of the seed that she carried then that would be better. Then, out
    of the blue came this man who now approached her shack, &quot;what a stroke of luck&quot;
    she thought, &quot;Luck nothing, it is a gift from the dark Gods themselves&quot; she
    smiles at the thought of it. She could see through the crystal that this man was a half
    breed and probably wouldn&#146;t have anything to do with a dark elf such as herself, so a
    spell was needed to change her appearance to something a little more pleasurable to his
    eyes. She continued stirring the brew while she checked the crystal to keep an eye on his
    progress. &quot;Yes&quot; she said, &quot;keep coming my handsome stranger, I have a
    little surprise for you, Haaaahaaaahaaahaahahahaha&quot; The spell that she cooked was
    almost done now, just a few more minutes and she could use it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Approaching the shack, the ranger stops next to a tree
    just to watch for a few minutes. There are no signs of life at all, except for the smoke
    coming from the chimney. His instincts are sharp and he cannot detect anything wrong here,
    all seems relatively safe. He decides to wait for a bit and just watch from the trees,
    perhaps someone will come out and he can get a look at who might be living here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The witch watches him from her crystal, he has stopped and
    seems to be just looking at the place for now. &quot;Cautious one, eh?&quot; she says to
    herself, &quot;That is no matter&quot; She smiles and takes a scoop of the brew she has
    been cooking and pours it into a powered mixture in a mug on the table. The mug hisses and
    smokes when the brew hits it and a puff of thick white smoke rises from it. Saying an
    incantation over the mug, she takes it and drinks it down quickly. As soon as she drinks
    it, she feels the change in her body and smiles while walking towards the door.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Suddenly the door opens and the ranger sees a beautiful
    half-elf woman standing in it. She is young and strong, very well built. Her blonde hair
    flows down around her body to her waist. She walks out the door and begins walking towards
    the stack of wood that is near the shack. After seeing her, Temyez begins walking towards
    the shack, before he has a chance to say anything the woman looks up at him and cries out
    &quot;Oh no! please don&#146;t hurt me, no, please!&quot; dropping the wood the she
    cringes away from him in terror. Lifting his hands, Temyez tries to smile, &quot;Its ok, I
    won&#146;t hurt you. Please don&#146;t be afraid.&quot; He says to the girl, &quot;My name
    is Temyez D&#146;argos, I am looking for a friend of mine, please don&#146;t be afraid.
    Let me help you&quot; He walks slowly up to her and kneels to pick up the wood that she
    has dropped. The woman watches him carefully, still afraid. Standing up with the wood he
    steps back and looks at her, the woman just sits there unmoving, staring at him with wide
    eyes. &quot;M&#146;lady, I would stand here all day if it made you more comfortable, but
    this wood is kind of heavy.&quot; He says to her with a smile and a wink. &quot;I assure
    you M&#146;lady I mean you no harm.&quot; The witch stands up slowly and stares at him
    &quot;M&#146;lady, If I was going to harm you I would have done so already. Now please, I
    only wish to help you and then perhaps ask some questions. Then I will be on my way.&quot;
    The witch looks at him for a few more moments then smiles slightly &quot;Ok&quot; she says
    softly, walking back towards the shack. Temyez follows her through the door with the load
    of wood he carries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The interior of the shack came as somewhat of surprise to
    him, dead scorpions and lizards hung upside down near a window to the right. A huge
    cooking pot hung over the fire with some unknown brew bubbling inside of it. A shelf near
    the back was lined with skulls of various animals, and jars filled with many different
    substances all labeled for future use. On the table there were more jars and vials filled
    with powders and substances, knives and utensils sat in disarray next to a mixing bowl
    with something half made in it. A cloth blanket hung in a doorway separating this room
    from another back room, probably a place to sleep. The place was dank and dark and
    instantly reminded him of any one of the many dungeons he had visited in his lifetime. He
    set the wood down near the cooking fire and stood up looking around &quot;You live
    here?&quot; he asked somewhat surprised. &quot;Oh yes&quot; she replied, looking at him
    and seeing his expression she went on &quot;Oh, I am sorry about all this, I lived here
    with my old mother, all of these things were hers&#133;&#133;.but she&#146;s gone now, and
    I haven&#146;t really had time to clean out all of this junk yet&quot; she lowered her
    head, while her finger traced designs in some powder that was spilled on the table.
    &quot;I am sorry for your loss&quot; he replied. &quot;Its ok, it was some time ago.
    Besides I don&#146;t want to talk about her anyways, I want to talk about you.&quot; She
    raised her head and looked directly at him, her demeanor seemed to instantly change from a
    scared, shy little girl, to a confident woman who knows exactly what she wants. She went
    directly to him now, not afraid at all, her finger softly traced a design on his chest
    plate while she looked up into his eyes &quot;I have never been with a real man
    before&quot; she said with a sly smile. Her small body rubbed against him provocatively as
    she smiled at him. This caught him completely off guard, one minute she had been afraid to
    even be near him, now she wanted to be on him, he tried to say something &quot;I &#133;..
    Uh &#133;.. what&quot; She smiled even larger now, her leg rubbing into his groin, her
    tongue darting out to lick her lips &quot;You can have me now, I want you&quot; she
    purred, while her hands grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to pull him down so she
    might kiss him. &quot;No&quot; Temyez cried out, pushing her back away from him &quot;That
    is not why I am here&quot; She looked at him with a surprised, sad look &quot;But
    don&#146;t you want me, don&#146;t you find me attractive?&quot; He crossed the room to
    the other side of the table &quot;No, my heart belongs to another and while she lives I
    WILL not Love anyone else&quot; The witch shrugged her shoulders, surprised that any man
    might turn down the opportunity to be with a beautiful woman, &quot;<i>we shall see&quot;</i>,
    she thought to herself. The witch began to cry, lifting her hand to her face &quot;Oh I am
    sorry&quot;, she cried &quot;I have just been so afraid, so lonely&quot; tears rolled down
    her cheeks. With her other hand she scooped up some of the powder in one of the piles on
    the table. Temyez was shaken by her sudden changes in emotion, he didn&#146;t know what to
    make of it, he slowly moved towards her wanting both to comfort her and keep his distance.
    Quickly she raised her hand and blew the powder into his face. He pulled back and turned
    instinctively but not before getting a lungful and faceful of the powder &quot;What?
    &#133;. &quot; he sputtered out between gasping and coughing, his hands flew up to wipe
    the dust from his eyes. When he turned back he suddenly felt sleepy, he fell to his knees,
    and for a moment he thought he saw an old woman standing where the beautiful girl used to
    be. &quot;<i>That&#146;s funny</i>&quot; he thought, then everything went black and he
    fell to the floor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The old witch cackled and laughed, as she danced around
    the shack &quot;Won&#146;t have a young girl will you. Hahahahahaha Never Love another,
    eh? Hahahaha &#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.. We shall see, Hahahaha&#133;. We shall
    see&#133;&#133;&#133;..&quot; Picking him up off the floor she threw him onto the table
    &quot;If you won&#146;t give me what I want voluntarily, then I&#146;ll take what I need
    forcefully&quot; she said, and went about her dark work. Hours later when she had taken
    what she needed from him, she held up a vial filled with the life giving liquid that would
    nourish her seed &quot;Yes, you will bring my child to life&quot; Putting the vial
    carefully into a jar of liquid, she turns back toward the ranger laying on her table.
    &quot;And for making me take what I needed the hard way and denying me any fun you will be
    punished&quot; She thought about what he had said before she knocked him out, &quot;<i>I
    will never Love another</i>&quot; he had said &quot;Well now, my handsome young ranger,
    you will never Love at all&quot; she smiled evilly as she decided upon his punishment
    &quot;I will take your heart and soul, my ranger friend, and you will never Love again,
    Hahahahahahahahahahaha&quot; She proceeded to work over him casting spells and saying
    incantations. When she was finished she smiled wickedly and put him into a cart. She
    wheeled him away and took him to the west for some distance. She found another old
    abandoned shack some distance from hers and dumped him inside. &quot;When you awake my
    heartless friend you will remember nothing about our meeting, nor will you remember
    anything about why you are here, you will only want to return home&quot; she quickly wrote
    a note and pinned it to him. She grinned as she looked at him for the last time, rubbing
    her belly she said &quot;Stay well, young <i>father,</i> Perhaps someday you will meet
    your son or daughter&quot; She started laughing as she walked away, and you could hear the
    laughing continue as she faded into the distance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Days later, when he awoke, he felt somewhat disoriented
    and couldn&#146;t remember where he was or what he was doing here. He looked around at the
    abandoned shack that he was in, but couldn&#146;t remember anything. He felt funny inside,
    he couldn&#146;t quite describe it but it was different. He looked down and saw a note
    pinned to his shirt, he pulled it off and read &quot;South to civilization, south to
    Fironia Vie&quot; He stood shakily and felt very thirsty. Looking around he saw his pack
    and dug out some water drinking it down greedily. This was a very strange feeling he had
    inside, almost like he was empty, like he had been hollowed out somehow. He shrugged it
    of, after all it didn&#146;t mean anything, he was alive and seemed healthy, that was all
    that mattered anyways. For a moment he considered why he was here, and what had brought
    him here, Bah, it didn&#146;t really matter anyway. Standing up and collecting his things
    he stepped out into the cool night air. Looking up into the sky, he saw the moon and stars
    glowing like gems in the blackness, normally he might have thought of how beautiful it all
    was or how he missed someone or something, but tonight he thought of nothing when he
    looked into that lovely sky, only which way is south. As he began to walk into the night,
    there was no whistling or singing as was his custom, nothing but his quiet footsteps and
    the sounds of the night.</font></font></td>
