Hybrids have always been at the top of the pvp ladder at the upper levels, I'm sure this is something you *should* know if you looked into the matter a bit more.<br>
<br>
I hate to say this, but dueling, not pvp, is the true test of class balance (not skill, not tactics, but what two classes can do to each other when both are ready to fight). It seems you are merely forming your opinion on Rangers based on some of the complaints, while ignoring what the class truly can do. <br>
<br>
I don't know if you are doing this to merely defend your own stance on the issue or you honestly believe it is the case, but allow me to assure you, and anyone skilled in pvp would agree, that ANY melee/hybrid class with double attack, 2h weapon skill of any type, a few almost unresistable dots, DS, and self healing most certainly does NOT suck in pvp.<br>
<br>
Claiming the opinion of a pvp ranger saying their class sucks is more valid than mine is understanble, if illogical when you bother to look at the abilities of the class. Of course you wouldn't know my personal pvp experiences, but at least you *should* know what makes a class dangerous in PvP. As someone who played a level 60 of every single class in existance except beastlord and participate in duels regularly, I can assure you the Ranger class is dangerous, even WITHOUT AM3 and EQ. <br>
<br>
Now, you can argue that I have not delt with the intricacies of PvP, and I would have to agree. I am not constantly alert. However, in the end pvp comes down to two people going head to head trying to kill the other person by any means availible be it insta-clicks, potions, charged items, etc. You cannot deny the actual fighting experiences of someone from a blue server simply because they only prepare for a fight when challenged to a duel.<br>
<br>
I see you've given up on defending your position on justifying an unbalanced skill in pvp with possible future expansions and hypothetical improvements over gear for one class. I am dissapointed that you are unable to concede that it was most illogical, and a mistake, to assume the stance in the first place, but I suppose it is up to you. <p><BR>

<br>
Now, I think we all agree that the vast majority of people who play on blue servers has no idea how pvp works in EQ. However, I also think we agree that there ARE indeed people who play on blue servers who are quite knowledgable about PvP.<br>
<br>
The only difference between us is that we on the blue servers almost always only pvp in duels (and not before raids, during CR, but actually setting aside a time and place with the proper preperations), which means both parties are ready and prepared, and most likely far better equipped. I think we can all agree that the best way to see how viable a class is for pvp, assuming skilled player, is when both sides are equally ready and committed to the fight.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we have superior skill, or superior tactics, or superior experiences on blue servers, I'm saying there exist some of us who play on blue servers who *are* knowledgable about pvp. <p><BR>

It's slightly different.<br>
<br>
As for rangers, they did suck in the old days.  You think they give great haste and a slow proc on their epics cuz they were really good?  Rangers don't even good greater healing until 57 or something.  Before Kunark, rangers got a whopping 90pt heal.  Or is it the stinging swarm they got pre-kunark that made them rock pvp?  Before Luclin rangers didn't suck, but they sure as hell did before Kunark.  Yea I know that was a long time ago but it still holds.  Rangers used to suck ass.  <br>

p.s. don't bitch about pvp until ur a cleric.  Phear my nukes and cleric melee.<br>

On Rallos, item-gankers don't give a @#%$ about dying, there was a great quote from Fossa saying I don't care how many times you kill me, because the one time I kill you and I loot that fungi tunic, I win (not verbatim).<br>
<br>
As long as Xbena or whichever burn ganker can just kill people on 75-85% health, and loot an item they won't care about a silence spell.  Xbena will just kill whoever, loot, then die, log off, and cr 24 hours later or whenever it is convenient.  I think I understand your point of view about MB/LB lady D, and I totally 100% agree with what you are saying on a non item loot server, but you need to understand that naked/no-drop item gankers couldn't care less about dying, as long as Xbena manages to loot that fungi tunic, dying is un-important, because as soon as it is looted it will go into a bag and will be as good as sold. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uboinshar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boinshar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/17/02 4:22:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub175.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My closing arguement</span><hr size=1> Moffon,<br>
<br>
Lady D's arguement was Rangers sucked before Luclin, which includes Velius, and I think both of us can agree that they did not indeed suck in Velius.<br>
<br>
I think you'd agree that the pvp game before and after Velius is completely different. Before Kunark ALL melees sucked. Kunark made melees and hybrids suck less than they did pre-Kunark. Velius made melees and hybrids far more powerful in pvp with the introduction of great weapons, especially an extremely large selection of great 2h weapons for jousting.<br>
<br>
Luclin gave rangers God status provided they have enough AA. However, a velius equipped ranger with a good 2h weapon is pretty formitable in pvp even without a bow.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I have no experience with getting jumped by 2-3 players, but if Lady D was basing her statement of "rangers sucked before Luclin" on how little rangers can do against 2-3 people who jump them... then that begs the question what other classes can do when 2-3 players jump them? Rangers can't gate, that's about it.<br>
<br>
As for clerics, the resist reduction on their nukes, especially Judgement, is far more than I expected. A few weeks ago I put on my normal resist gear and tested it with a 60 cleric. With 255 MR I did not resist a single Judgement from him, 80% landed for 500+.<br>
<br>
Yes, cast time is still an issue, and nobody's going to expect clerics to suddenly go around killing everyone, but they've got a pretty decent upgrade if you add in the new focus items. <p><BR>

The new cleric nuke is to clerics what sunstrike is to wizards, it can hit for full or it can hit for little it's kind of iffy.  I took down a necro the other day with it in the arena when he was at half health because he didn't expect a cleric to nuke him to death from half health.  But yea the casting time blows :*(<br>
<br>
p.s. it sucks that some classes AA abilities make them own in pvp, and some don't make much of a difference at all.  Any melee can up their hps without changing any gear at all, I wish I got that AA :/  But ALL AA abilities make a class better at PvE.  I think that's what PvPers should focus on, Verants lack of doing anything for PvP.  I like Lady D I think a lot was done for PvP under her, but cleaning up the mess after Verant introduces something that screws up PvP shouldn't have to happen.  I pay to play on a PvP server just like everyone else pays to play on a Blue server.  Should I be penalized just because theres more bluebies than reds?  I pay the same amount.  I mean, at least have a small team or even one person that approves changes before making it live to a PvP server.  But no, because more people collectively play on blue servers than rallos, the individual doesn't count.  I wish someone at Verant would read this and realize how unfair things are for us when we are nothing more than an afterthought, but probably not.<br>

<br>
Wrong.<br>
<br>
You are knowledgable about one aspect of pvp under one set of circumstances.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate to say this, but dueling, not pvp, is the true test of class balance &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...what two classes can do to each other when both are ready to fight&quot;<br>
<br>
Way wrong.  class balance can be defined as what the class is capable of in all environments under all sorts of circumstances. The sum of all this types of experience is a description of how powerful a class is.  The problem with declaring duels to be THE description of class balance is that situations will occur way way way more often than not that are far and away nothing like a duel especially as multiple parties on both sides and mobs become involved.<br>
<br>
If you balance classes based on what is in fact only a fraction of pvp, that is 1 on 1 fights in a fair enviroment with no interferance in which both parties are totally prepared then what happens in the majority of fights which don't follow that template?  Factors you didn't plan on come into play and your &quot;balance&quot; is fubar and meaningless.<br>
<br>
Take poison as an example.  In a duel vs a real pvper whose prepared its not very strong.  Just put on some pr gear and slap a pr buff on.  In a real fight at least on RZ it's very useful because most don't run around with good pr all the time.<br>
<br>
Do you balance classes based on poison being useless or good? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uboinshar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boinshar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 1:56:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub175.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My closing arguement</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

The one set of circumstances that deals with skill, tactics, and manipulation instead of getting lucky on a gank or using overwhelming force of a group to jump on someone.<br>
<br>
If you cannot face your opponent and fight, you will NEVER be good at pvp (not counting you go around ganking people with 20% health). Unless, of course, you do group pvp. However, I think many people enjoy pvp for the &quot;personal skill&quot; factor instead of random killing. Of course, I could be dead wrong on this assumption, but I think it's fair to say those who built a reputation on individual skill earns far more respect than group gankers, eh?<br>

Unless you are trying to say that unprepared pvp matters more than prepared pvp when you speak of class balance, you are just playing the devils advocate, and poorly. Is it not the essense of pvp to be prepared against most situations at all times? Is it not the mark of a good pvper to predict the tactics of your opponents and counteract them before they even begin to excecute?<br>
<br>
Under your limited definition, in a grouping aspect of pvp Ranger would be at least as viable as a rogue (ability to run away quickly, to joust, to handle mobs, to heal, to dot while the opponent is worrying about other things, to buff), and according to Lady D's accessment, since rangers sucked in Velius (before luclin) rogues must have sucked as well. Do I need to convince you that a well equipped, and actually SKILLED rogue does not suck in group pvp?<br>

Factors you didn't plan on will ALWAYS come into play, it is illogical and down right ridiculous to expect otherwise. Balance in pvp is a measurement of viability, not being able to handle any and all situations as you seem to suggest.<br>
<br>
The only way to test viability is in a controlled environment, I don't think I need to tell you that it's pointless to test something if many variables are introduced into the system. As I said before, the essense of pvp is to try to be prepared against as many situations as possible. This is mainly something the player must do, it has very little to nothing to do with the class being played.<br>

This is a fault of theirs for not preparing against and effective PvP tool, and it is an advantage given to you for capitalizing on that.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do you balance classes based on poison being useless or good? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Having options is always useful. The difference between a prepared duel and unprepared pvp is the clear advantage isn't purely determined by luck (sneaking up on someone and duelist+BS). It is up to the players to manuver for advantage, to find a crack in one's opponent's defenses, and then capitalize on that. <br>
<br>
Jumping an unprepared person either results in a quick kill, or them fleeing, or very rarely a long and dragged out fight. However, dueling against a prepared person will most certainly always result in a fight of skill and tactics where both sides, assuming equally skilled players, rack their brains to find a way to gain an advantage.<br>
<br>
Unprepared pvp happens far more than duels, I will grant you this, and part of a class' viability depends on being able to survive unprepared pvp. We are talking Rangers here, a hybrid, far more versital than pure melees. Do you honestly believe they as a class sucked during Velius? <p><BR>

On red servs u never know when ur going to have to fight, it comes out of nowhere all the time.  Duels you can plan your resists accordingly to who you are fighting.  If I duel a necro I go with hp items over resists, if I duel a mage I go MR/FR, etc.  When ur out xping and someone jumps you, there's no time to be prepared.

   Knowing whats going on is part of playing on a pvp server.  If you think your going to be hit by a group call for some back up from friends.  Real pvp is about dealing with a complex and changing circumstances.  It's true to say that anticipating these circumstances is what a good pvper does but ya know you can't think of everything and pvping is about reacting and improvising and dealing with less than perfect situations. <br>
   If you don't understand how different classes improvise and deal with less than perfect situations when /duel lasts real life months, the players in the conflict are known and unknown, and the entire world is your arena then you don't know how they pvp regardless of how much dueling you do.<br>

   All pvp matters.  Fact is little pvp takes place where both parties are 100% prepared in the same manner as duelists. Thus while this type of pvp should be taken into acount its not all there is.<br>

   First you are taking the word of Lady D as gospel when I get the impression that she has NEVER played a ranger period let alone a high end one.  From there you make a whole idiotic logic chain that totally ignores the fact that not one person agreeded with Lady D that rangers sucked at all in pvp and several people said that comment was way off.<br>
<br>
I'll let you in on a few secrets here... ready?<br>
<br>
a) The only huge pvp difference between pre and post luclin rangers is entirely due to archery mastery 3 and to a lesser extent combat fury and endless quiver.  Most rangers aren't there yet. They are either too low or don't have enough aa points yet.  Thus either rangers still suck or they never did.<br>
<br>
Lady D is aflicted with a very common disease among high lvl players and that is to take a very narrow view of pvp.  When she said rangers got better post luclin she meant the tiny fraction who are 60 with 30+ aa points.<br>
<br>
b) Ready for the big one? Rangers don't suck in group pvp... Shocked?  Track, good range dmg via bows and nukes, good melee dmg, buffs, and a bit of healing here and there during downtime make them actually pretty good.<br>
<br>
Maybe not good at fighting Lady Ds necro outdoors solo...but good.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------<br>
  Of course they will.  Your preaching to the choir there thats why planned duels aren't a good measure of pvp. Duels are usually quite predictable with the gear, buffs, environment, weapons, players, and often strategies known.<br>
<br>
  I don't suggest that any class should be able to handle any and all situations that arise. You misunderstand.  Pvp balance is the measure of what you are and aren't capable do dealing with and to what extent.  Its the measure of your strengths AND weaknesses. <br>
<br>
    It wouldn't be fun (at least from my perspective) to always have all the advantages, and it would suck in a major way to always get the short end of the stick. <br>
<br>
   Balance lies somewhere between those extremes and must acount for all the many types of situations.  Balance isn't about being equal in all situations as you seem to think I'm claiming or even being equal overall but rather being equal enough in enough situations to be fun.<br>
<br>
   Oh btw... real pvp is NOT a controlled environment, real pvpers make their own luck and pvp cannot be redueced to a handful of combinations.<br>
<br>
If pvp design was really as simple as understanding how all the possible match ups played out in a one on one battle we would allready have a balanced pvp enviroment.<br>
<br>
Pvp isn't just about that toe to toe fight to the death.  Pvp is about the server as a whole and cannot be understood without playing in the enviroment because it will effect every aspect of your play time and every aspect of your play will effect your pvp.<br>
<br>
If the designers do not understand that any more than you do then all is lost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uboinshar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boinshar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 9:54:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub175.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My closing arguement</span><hr size=1> In your post, you stated the obvious, agreed with me that rangers don't suck and clumbsily tried to twist your words to reflect that somehow I believed Lady D's words are gospal, and more than once included aspects of PvP that has nothing to do with class, but the player behind it.<br>
<br>
I will attempt to use capitalization to capture your attention.<br>
<br>
When you speak of CLASS balance in PvP, I would assume <br>
even you would understand that CLASS balance has nothing to do with PLAYER skill. If you still don't get it, read it a few times, distinguish between CLASS and PLAYER, and read it a few more times until you get it.<br>
<br>
The viability of a CLASS changes in the hands of players. However, you cannot say a CLASS is not viable just because it's being played by an inexperienced player. Therefore, the only way to determine CLASS viability, is in a controlled environment uneffected by PLAYER skill.<br>
<br>
If you still don't understand, here's some more obvious things you appear to be missing. Anticipation is a PLAYER trait. Reaction is a PLAYER trait. Calling in help from friends is a PLAYER trait. Using the terrain to lose your enemy, or to dodge arrows is a PLAYER trait. Prepertation is a PLAYER trait. Knowing when to run is a PLAYER trait. They have absolutely nothing to do with the class you play. Therefore, they should not be considered when you speak of CLASS viability.<br>
<br>
My statement stands, the dueling aspect of PvP is the best representation of CLASS viability assuming the participants are equally skilled players.<br>
