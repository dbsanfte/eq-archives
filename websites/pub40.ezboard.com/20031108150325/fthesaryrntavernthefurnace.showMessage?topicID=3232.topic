news and information about the world around me as I can get my hands on. I read as any sources as possible, because I am aware that the average media conglomerate is a nightmare of near Orwellian proportions. If you can find enough &quot;angles&quot; presented by enough &quot;journalists&quot; you can then compare them, and typically make a map accurate enough to find your way through the wilderness into a place where unbiased information lurks. <br>
<br>
For the past several years, I've spent most of my time frustrated and spooked by just how scary the world at large was. Relatively small but very, very serious groups of people abusing power, people, and the planet in general. Every day, all day! It was like a Festival of Bad. Oddly, right around the time that the rest of the scary world did just what I was most afraid of and came knocking on my country's door I was finding myself alternately perplexed, outraged or simply terrified by the actions of the local bureaucracy moreso than the actions of some random crazed despot half a world away.<br>
<br>
Lately it's been getting worse. I absorb my daily doses of information as best I can, and my unease has done nothing but grow. I feel an odd sense of foreboding these days that I can't say I ever felt before. This isn't foreboding in the cataclysmic gloom and doom sense, it's much more of a &quot;We are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not in Kansas anymore, are we?&quot; kinda sense.<br>
<br>
Random bizarro ramblings on points of interest to me will now commence:<br>
<br>
American Airlines. Again. Yeah, the bossman resigned after the recent bit of publicity, but they're keeping the pension plan, Which is technically funded by taxpayer money since the company hasn't actually made any in years. I'm not seeing much return on this investment. Odd item to start with, but it's really been bugging me. Why is this company still in business again? And why am I paying to keep it that way? <br>
<br>
Santorum. A lot of people freaked out after the things he said. Oddly, I wasn't freaked out by what he said - I was horrified that people were taken by surprise, and even more so that absolutely nothing has come of it. Lott was a clue, people. And the representatives are the least of my worries, we have Federal Court appointees now that have repeatedly and deliberately used the power of their positions to leverage their personal beliefs upon society. I grew up thinking that courts enforced the will of the people, even if indirectly. I did not realize the objective had changed to enforcing their will on the people, directly. I would like them to please stop, forthwith.<br>
<br>
Betchel. Hey, maybe they can finally finish that chemical plant they were building for Hussien before he invaded Kuwait and we had to spank his bottom and place him firmly in the corner. Harkin is probably dying to get back to work on that pipeline that Saddam himself turned them down on because he thought he was getting the shaft. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Shultz, these are men possessed of very large and very sturdy balls. Possibly cast of solid brass.<br>
<br>
The Budget. We have now departed all known realms of mathematics and entered into the purely hypothetical. Please keep all hands, arms, and the ability to prove that 2 2 does indeed equal three hundred billion inside the vehicle until the ride has come to a complete stop.<br>
<br>
The Tax Cut. Yay! As best I can tell, the primary reason being peddled to promote a massive tax cut following a year of nearly unprecedented debt accumulation with no relief in sight not to mention a pesky little war to pay for is that this cut will promote economic stimulus and eventually pay for itself by creating 1.4 million jobs in 18 months. Well, the historical average is 2 million jobs created every 18 months in a recession without debt relief, so that's a pretty fucking safe bet eh? Not that the numbers really matter, since the Administration has already severely restricted access to information regarding these types of statistics in the future, via an Executive Order. What we don't know can't hurt the economy!<br>
<br>
With the introduction of the Patriot Act 2 (Pry Harder!) the Administration now formally supports the arrest of it's own citizens (not just citizens, the bill also provides a provision for foreign nationals and reserves the right to refuse extradition requests) with no access to due process and no formal charge. Who would be arrested is to be determined by single individuals whose identities are protected and reasoning is entirely withheld. It formally supports the detention of these individuals for indefinite periods at undisclosed locations. The existence of said detainees would be classified and releasing specific information about them would be a Federal crime. Note that this is already a practice in use, the new laws would simply make it legal. Well, it's already legal in places like China and Iran but we have yet to receive the official nod here.<br>
<br>
We've got some odd friends at the UN of late. Sudan, Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Algeria, Iraq (at least until we had to start bombing them) and the United States have been the primary proponents of alterations to documents regarding women's and children's rights around the world. Concerned Women for America would like to see language condemning the religon-specific infringements on women removed as it paints religion as a whole in a bad light. That wacky National Right to Life Committee wanted the phrase &quot;forced pregnancy&quot; removed from UN docs on women's rights because it could be reasonably used as an argument to promote abortions. I think we'd all be much happier if we just didn't count rapes by soldiers as a human rights violation, right? Especially if it saves a fetus or two! The State Department's annual report on human rights has condemned every single one of the countries joined with us in this noble endeavor as some of the worst rights violators in the world. When asked if finding herself chummed up with this odd bit of riff raff in front of a UN Rights Committee, Ellen Sauerbrey (Bush's chief representative to this commission) had this to say: &quot;I don't think we're aligning ourselves with countries who<br>
have bad records on human rights&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm about to start trying the ol' heel-click thing.<br>

May not directly be used by everyone... but businesses make America what it is, air travel aides business.  Better business, a happier and more comfortable life you live.  I'm not smart, damn sure not political in any sense, but it's pretty easy to imagine these things do benifit you indirectly.<br>

<br>
AA isn't the only airline struggling, British Airways received a lot of debt deferrment in the UK at the insistence of the government, because without the flights being available, the indirect impacts on UK economy could be extremely serious.<br>
<br>
To say flights are for rich people is a nonsense, flights facilitate international and domestic trade.  Yes a lot of the people using them are likely to be rich because they are often the directors and decisionmakers for major global businesses.  But if they don't broker trade deals, then they won't have a market for the products their companies manufacture and those companies will end up shrinking and laying off the workers in the factories.  Such workers clearly aren't rich, and will be even less rich if they don't have a job. <p><font color="#0066CC">

After doing a research paper on the Homeland Security Act, which also included studying the Patriot Act, I can safely say that the current administration is doing their best at removing the freedoms that are so cherished. It is well worth spending some time reading up on these acts, since they will have a huge impact on your future life.

Sorry but you lost all credibility when you used the word &quot; Orwellian&quot; . <br>
I also read over 50 blogs and at least 10 languages of news from all over the world daily , yes im concerned but not &quot;real&quot; concerned . I will worry about it when it affects my life directly , which it hasnt so im not worried .  <br>
I even live about 5 miles from AA head quarters and the word on the street is &quot; Good riddance&quot;. We are sick and tired of being held hostage by a corporation and a bunch of glorified waiters and waitresses. I truly hope they fold, they suck at what they do and most of the metroplex saw this coming years ago.

It never has been. The governments have had their fingers in the mixing bowl for a long time. After September 11th, approximately 8 billion dollars was set aside for guarunteed loans to the airline industry. Only 2 billion dollars worth were given out. The major airlines aren't looking to be bailed out. What they've been asking of congress is for relief from higher fuel taxes, security costs, and other fees/taxes imposed after September 11th.<br>
<br>
American Airlines didn't become the largest carrier in the world (which it still is) because they &quot;suck at what they do&quot;. They did so by offering the flying public what it wanted at the time. Until about three years ago, the industry favored a higher quality product (as opposed to the low-cost carriers) at higher price. When the economy (specifically, the tech industry) started it's decline, carriers like American and United started feeling the pinch and began changing their business practices to suit the new environment. The incidents surrounding September 11th basically tossed a huge monkey wrench in those plans by imposing higher fuel costs, higher security costs (of which only a small part was allowed by the government to be passed on to the consumer) and a frightened public. Not even Southwest has been able to avoid being hit by these effects. However, since they were already set up as a low-cost carrier, they were already in a position to come out of the crisis.<br>
<br>
I too live in Dallas and I don't know what &quot;street&quot; you live on, but the general consensus among people I know is that if American Airlines goes under, it will be extremely bad for the local economy because they are the largest employer in Fort Worth and rate pretty high in the entire region. If American goes under, the unemployment rate in the DFW area will skyrocket. That isn't even considering the loss of tax revenues, revenue generated by DFW airport and it's vendors, or the other industries that rose up to support the airline (Sabre/EDS, Aramark, etc).<br>
<br>

I never said it would completely ruin the job market.  I said it would send unemployment skyrocketing.  There's a distinct difference.  Will it ruin the economy around DFW?  No, but several businesses and individuals outside the travel and cargo industry will bear a burden if AA goes under.  To think otherwise is to display ignorance about how a local economy works.  Especially when it comes to unemployment.<br>

In one paragraph you say that if AA went under, it wouldn't have much of an effect.  Yet here you say they are using it as a bargaining chip to leverage tax breaks.  Which is it?  It's niether, really.  American has never threatened to move it's headquarters or even it's DFW hub since originally establishing this area as their base of operations.  Even when the state legislature repealed the Wright Ammendment that restricted flights into and out of Love field, American used it's voice to lobby against it (though, I disagreed with that voice); however, they never threatened to relocate when that would have been the course taken by many companies.  As for these tax incentives, I'm not aware of any that other large companies in this area don't also receive.  Please provide some sort of evidence to contradict me and I'll happily admit error.<br>

That may only be partially true.  No other carrier has the infrastructure to fill the gap American would leave in Texas.  Every other carrier that might fill that void either lacks the capacity to do so (such as Southwest) or isn't financially able to do so (such as Delta and United).  Eventually the smaller carriers may be able to, but the amount of time that will take is going to make travel and cargo in this area extremely rough for a while.<br>

Why, exactly?  The increasing repeal of the Bill of Rights, and invasion of individual privacy really calls nothing else to mind so much as Orwell's vision of a totalitarian state that practiced total control over its citizens.

I for one can say Telecom Corridor for I worked there for ten yours till I was one of many that were laid-off. I consider myself one of the lucky one as I did find a job after ten months of looking, of course I had to move to Az for the Job, oh and I know many people that are still unemployed with more than enough skills you speak of but they couldn’t move due to family. Yes losing AA in the metroplex will have a devastating impact on the economy.<br>

Sorry. I've been through enough corporate reorganizations, downsizing and outright collapses that I'll happily given them my empathy but not a dime out of my wallet. Jobs should exist where is there demand for them to exist, not where it is demanded they exist. Just because you're a really swell flight attendent does not mean that the world needs you to be one. <br>
<br>
About half (maybe more than half) of American's fleet of aircraft are repainted TWA planes. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that those planes couldn't be repainted again. The routes that American covers that are currently profitable would be snatched up by other airlines, along some of the equipment and personnel currently employed by American to service those routes. The routes that were not profitable would also be snatched up, because nonprofitable routes only exist due to the pricing structures airlines bend time and space to produce.<br>

Lots of people would still be unemployed, but only because there really wasn't any demand for what they did in the first place. Them's the breaks, time to learn some new skills!<br>

You know how they'd write it? They would strive to ensure the government is always entirely beholden to the people which it serves and not vice versa, just like they wrote it the first fucking time. You put a bunch of guys who share not much more than a stark distrust for formal systems of state power in a room and tell them to write up a constitution for a new country and you're gonna get about the same document every time.<br>
<br>
If someone were to actually draw up a constitution today the &quot;completely different world we live in&quot; would only result in a document about 750,000 pages long and adminstered by a squad a lawyers large enough to fill three entire Holidy Inn Express locations. But they'd probably be a tad more specific about in just what context they provide the right of the citizenry right to bear arms.<br>

No, we obviously aren't dealing with a Totalitarian state that practices total control over us.  Its the movement in that direction that's the problem.  The Patriot Act is a bigger, faster step towards it than anything I've experienced in my lifetime.<br>

There is a large rock about half the size of earth's moon heading toward us.  From what I understand it could be a near miss or a hit in 2029 or there abouts.<br>
<br>
Many of you will laugh, many will half believe me and dismiss this as a stupid joke, and still others that believe will think.. &quot;oh 26 years away?  Who cares thats too far away to worry about&quot;.  Well this rock missed the earth on its last pass by, I for one hope it misses again since I want to hold out hope human kind might have some chance at becoming less &quot;sucky&quot;.  No matter how you look at it though we are living on borrowed time.<br>
<br>
Considering that people do suck I am at times tempted to not care if that rock or another one hits.  At times though I remind myself that for all he millions of us that suck there is 1 real, &quot;decent&quot; person.  That person is not me nor is it you, of that I can be mostly sure... but they are out there and with luck they will breed and we will not.<br>
