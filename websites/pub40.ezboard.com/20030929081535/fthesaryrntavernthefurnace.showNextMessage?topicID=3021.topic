<br>
I wasn't present at any of these events nor do I know any of the forementioned people personally. This, however is my take on the situation. I am by no means defending OoP.<br>
<br>
Order of the Phoenix members, everyone agrees that it was only a handful or two(not the entire raid force), camped through the wall in CoD to kill Bertox. I can see why people would raise their eyebrows at this action, but I really don't understand you getting mad at this, Ainian(and his staunch supporters). Actually, I don't understand why you care at all. It's not like OoP is a threat to your spawns in tier 4 planes as of now, and although Bertox's &quot;exploited&quot; death might get them closer to competition with HnE, the time that it would have taken them to kill HP is pretty insignificant. Sooner, not later, they would have gotten it done anyways; they have proved that they can kill him(HP).<br>
<br>
Why does this displease you enough to come here and post about it? There are several possible factors that I can see.<br>
<br>
1) Spite - You have personal problems with OoP and sought to belittle them here.<br>
<br>
2) You actually care - You like OoP and for their best interest, you call them down so that in turn they will shape up. While this is possible, I don't think this is the case, not because you are a bad guy or anything, but because frankly, why would you care.<br>
<br>
Seems like answer choice # 1 is the winner.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, while you list off the exploits and wrongs of OoP(mummy, mummy! johnny stole a cooky!), you deny everything, anything that someone pins on you. Wtf, are you guys holy knights on a crusade to battle evil? The fact is, people in OoP have done wrong, and people in HnE have done wrong. <br>
<br>
Coming here with intentions to slander OoP's reputation is pretty lame. You would say that OoP's actions were lame... even more, that the officers of OoP are not doing their job because their members did something wrong.<br>
<br>
When I was like lvl 50, I was in a group to kill Lodizal. When he popped, our druid engaged in kiting him to our group, we just had time to start fighting, and all was going well when a HnE paladin started stunning the @#%$ out of him, and proceeded in pulling him to the small group of HnE(which eventually killed him). There is no denying this. I was their, as well as other people, and it happened.<br>
<br>
We didn't come flaming here on the boards saying how &quot;wrong&quot; HnE is for KSing us. I don't have a hatrid for HnE, in fact I enjoy conversation with a few members. I'm not some kind of stand-up guy, always doing right either, I have my share of &quot;wrongs.&quot;<br>
<br>
The stuff in your post is similar to the bullshit that I am about to simulate.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
       Why do you guys stoop to KS lodizal. You guys did something wrong*gasp*! Granted, it was only a few of you, but from now on your whole guild is lame and the officers, the ones who knew about it and let it continue, are scum. Fvck them.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
True, Lodizal and Bertox are not quite on the same lvl, but the basic principle is the same. You found a flaw in OoP's moral code and you hurried over here to post it in an attempt to screw their rep slightly. The simulated flame I made is pretty damn lame, but damn, it was a joke, and example.<br>
<br>
To think that you would get all worked up over someone else's actions, especially when it hardly concerns you at all, is bewildering, and it shows that some people are still in a pissing contest.<br>
<br>
*Note* No disrespect to anyone meant, and I'm not on any side. This situation hardly even matters to me at all. I'm just clarifying.<br>

Now, to get to Bertox, you are supposed to have High Priest's flag.  OoP knew this and instead of taking an hour to get the last of their people the High Priest's flag, they used an exploit to get those people down to the basement...4 days straight.<br>
<br>
So this is the reason I have posted.  This is why Ainian started the topic.  If you do not feel exploiting is wrong then you are not going to feel the same as I do.  I respect that, I am not saying everyone has to agree with me, but we were letting the people of Saryrn know what was going on.  Its too bad what happened with your Lodizal experience.  I cannot act really since I wasnt there (or maybe I was and dont remember since I havent killed Lodizal in over a year).  So feel its a big deal or not.  Some care, some dont. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=illuvatorbrightstar@thesaryrntavern>Illuvator Brightstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/30/03 10:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3096.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> naval...</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to point out, Naval, that you pretty much ignored the meat of what Damo was saying...

It seemed to have happened early in the day, not many of us were on at the time but I was sitting in North Freeport chatting with a few people when I saw the incident being described in guild chat.  Ghar was the paladin you are referring to.  In any case not many people agreed or support what he does but what can someone like you and me do.  Our guild had a pretty bad reputation at the time due to a few in the guild being agressors in several incidents.  There was at least 1 person I remember who deguiled in protest over those actions but I don't quite remember anyone giving him a cookie for acting so &quot;honorably&quot;.  It's how the world works.  You do your best not to fvck with other people and expect the same.  If someone does step on your foot then give em the same treatment.  Not much else can be done.  Do your best to treat others well and hope for the best because although we play in a fairy tale video game we don't live in a fairy tale world full of happy endings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chichester@thesaryrntavern>Chichester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Best anon tard</span><br>  Posts: 1132<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/31/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3096.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://almosthuman.ca/eq/user/groo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A fairy tale world full of happy endings</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Homer:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>[sickly sweet]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Oh, look at me!
