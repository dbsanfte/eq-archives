 I was going to add that they should probably explain to him that he sounds like a complete fool when he pronounces &quot;Nuclear&quot; as well.<br>

 How the fuck does someone see the word Nuclear and pronounce it &quot;Newcular&quot;?<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
George W. Bush Resume<br>
<br>
George W. Bush, The White House, USA<br>
<br>
Past Work Experience<br>
<br>
I ran for U.S. Congress and lost.<br>
<br>
I produced a Hollywood slasher B movie.<br>
<br>
I bought an oil company, but couldn't find enough oil in Texas (!) to keep it afloat.  The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock.<br>
<br>
I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money.<br>
<br>
With my daddy's help, name, and contributions I was elected Governor of Texas.<br>
<br>
Accomplishments as Governor<br>
<br>
I changed pollution laws in favor of the power and oil companies and made Texas the most polluted state in the Union.<br>
<br>
I replaced Los Angeles with Houston as the most smog-laden city in America.<br>
<br>
I cut taxes and bankrupted Texas government to the tune of billions in borrowed money.<br>
<br>
I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history.<br>
<br>
I became U.S. President after losing the popular vote by over 500,000 votes with the help of major Enron money and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
 Accomplishments as President<br>
<br>
I've dissolved more international treaties than any president in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
I am the first president in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.<br>
<br>
I am the first president in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Elections Monitoring Board.<br>
 <br>
I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.<br>
 <br>
I authorized two pre-emptive attacks and overtook two countries.<br>
<br>
I rendered the entire United Nations viewpoints on these actions to be irrelevant.<br>
 <br>
I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S.Treasury.<br>
<br>
<br>
I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any president in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
My &quot;poorest millionaire,&quot; Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.<br>
 <br>
I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S.history.<br>
<br>
I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.<br>
 <br>
I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month  period.<br>
<br>
I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.<br>
 <br>
My record on environmental issues means nothing to me.  I do not regret the changes made by my appointee, soon after my election, that have virtually eliminated the progress that had slowly been made over a period of some 30 years.<br>
 <br>
I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.<br>
<br>
I set the the all-time record for most days on vacation in a one year period.<br>
<br>
After taking-off the entire month of August, I then presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history (WTC).<br>
 <br>
I am supporting development of a Tactical Bunker Buster nuke, which I proudly admit is a WMD.<br>
<br>
I am allowing our troops to be continual targets in Iraq.  They are being killed, almost daily, under the continued lie of Sadam's procurement of &quot;Yellow Cake Nuke&quot; WMD components, while I laid the blame of that same lie on our British friends.  <br>
 <br>
A leak from my administration has exposed a CIA agent (the wife of a former US Embassador) whose husband dared to disagree with the continued promotion of the &quot;Yellow Cake Nuke&quot; lie.<br>
<br>
I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. president.<br>
<br>
In my first year in office over 2-million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.<br>
 <br>
I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.<br>
<br>
I set the record for least amount of press conferences than any president since the advent of television.<br>
<br>
I signed more laws and executive orders effectively amending or ignoring the Constitution than any president in history.<br>
 <br>
I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.<br>
<br>
I've presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history and refused to use national reserves as past presidents have done.<br>
 <br>
I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- even during war time! <br>
<br>
I have set the all-time record for most people, worldwide, to simultaneously protest me in public venues (more than 25 million people) shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind.<br>
<br>
I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in U.S. history.<br>
  <br>
I am the first president in U.S. history to have almost all 50 states of the Union simultaneously suffer massive financial crisis.<br>
<br>
I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any market in any country in history.<br>
<br>
I am the first president in U.S. history to order a pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the world community.<br>
<br>
I created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of  the United States.<br>
<br>
I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any president in history.<br>
<br>
I removed more checks and balances and have the least amount of congressional oversight than any presidential administration in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. &quot;prisoners of war&quot; (detainees) and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.<br>
<br>
I am the first president in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors to be present (during the 2002 U.S. election).<br>
 <br>
I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.<br>
<br>
My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation) presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
My political party used Enron private jets and their corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.<br>
<br>
I have spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in U.S.  history.<br>
<br>
In less than a year, I turned the world's sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks into resentment towards the United States, which is considered to be the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.<br>
<br>
I am actively working on a policy of &quot;disengagement&quot; creating the most hostile of Israel-Palestine relations in at least 30 years.<br>
<br>
I am first president in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.<br>
<br>
I am the first U.S. president in history to have the people of South Korea to feel more threatened by the U.S. than by their immediate neighbor, North Korea.<br>
<br>
I set an all-time record for the number of administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not selling their huge personal investments in corporations bidding for U.S. contracts.<br>
 <br>
I failed to fulfill my pledge &quot;to hunt down and capture Osama Bin Laden, dead or alive&quot;.<br>
 <br>
I have failed to find Sadam Hussein and bring him to justice as I promised I would but I've allowed a lot of innocent Iraqi's to be killed during that quest, instead.<br>
<br>
I failed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the U.S. Capitol Building. Even after 18 months, there no leads and no credible suspects.<br>
<br>
In the two years following the World Trade Center attack, I have successfully prevented a full public investigation into the biggest security failure in the history of the United States.<br>
<br>
I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any president in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
In a little over two years, I created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the Civil War.<br>
<br>
I entered my office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and have turned every single economic category downward -- all in less than two years.<br>
 <br>
Records and References<br>
 <br>
I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine.<br>
<br>
My Texas driving record has been erased and is not available.<br>
<br>
I was AWOL from the National Guard.<br>
<br>
I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any questions about drug use.<br>
<br>

<br>
All records of SEC investigations into insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.<br>
 <br>
All records or minutes from meetings that I or Mr. Cheney, my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.<br>
<br>
Please consider my experience when voting in 2004.<br>

Fair enough.  On the other hand, I don't hear you listing all the positive reasons to vote Bush in '04.  <br>
<br>
If you'd like a reason to vote for the &quot;other guy&quot;, whoever that may turn out to be, think Supreme Court.  There are bound to be several appointments in the next term.  Who do you want to make them?  For most Americans, that may actually turn out to be the thing that the &quot;next&quot; President does that has the most significant long-term impact on their lives.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3624<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/28/03 1:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> They also predicted this president would appoint 3-4 members...<br>
