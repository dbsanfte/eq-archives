[21:04] &lt;rbarker&gt; hang tight guys we've got one coming up<br>
[21:04] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Wilhelm_Lany*  hi. I have a three-fold of questions. 1) Can we expect any changes in terms of  agro on demand; instant agro generation, without waiting for an opening.? 2) how will increasing the endurance bar work, in terms of getting higher endurance, and  endurance regen? 3) how will accessing these new skills once the opening is available work?<br>
[21:05] &lt;avancouvering&gt; We're getting a lot of questions.  So it will take us a moment to sort through them.<br>
[21:06] * Assassin is now known as ILoveMarijuana<br>
[21:06] &lt;jtroy&gt; 1)  Yes, the system we're getting allows us to create abilities that aren't tied to openings.  We will be giving warriors more options for aggro generation<br>
[21:07] &lt;jtroy&gt; 2) The endurance bar is based on your melee stats and level.  Regen is currently based on your level<br>
[21:07] * ILoveMarijuana is now known as IamSoHighRIghtnow<br>
[21:08] &lt;avancouvering&gt; We are only answering questions about the melee changes and melee concerns. Please don't deluge me with other types of questions.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
[21:08] &lt;jtroy&gt; 3) There will be an extra UI window to put hotkeys for the new skills, which will be accessible with keyboard shortcuts<br>
[21:08] &lt;rbarker&gt; we're still tuning specific values so we don't have actual numbers set in stone yet for endurance costs and regen.<br>
[21:09] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Galidin* How do you intend to maintain the desireability of knights in your new melee system when they allready produce far less damage then pure melee, while you fix core issues such as taunt which have been the strong suit of knights?<br>
[21:1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;rbarker&gt; There's several aspects of the melee revamp, one aspect of which is the new opening system.  There's plans on addressing other specific problems with melee in addition to the new system.<br>
[21:1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;rbarker&gt; The goal is to create a balance where knights and warriors both have equal desirablity in different situations.<br>
[21:11] &lt;rbarker&gt; We're really excited about all the new changes we're making and we're anquious to get them out on test where we can tune them and see them in action.<br>
[21:11] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Coronis* When are you anticipating these changes going live on regular servers?<br>
[21:11] &lt;Osmith&gt; Our changes are expected to go live during the December 16th update that'll be happening next month. We also plan on introducing them to the Test Server very soon. Feel free to log on the Test Server and use /feedback to tell us what you think about our changes. We'd be happy to hear everyone's thoughts on the systems that are being created.<br>
[21:11] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *CeNo65-FOH* how will acumen zing and others spells with similar effects, pertain to the new changes?<br>
[21:12] &lt;rbarker&gt; We're removing the old invigor type effects that restored stamina entirely for now.  It's possible we'll be adding endurance regen abilties later on but for now we don't want melee to be an more dependant on getting buffs to make use of the new system.<br>
[21:13] &lt;rbarker&gt; We decided to do that because it's really an entirely new system, and has very little to do with how the old stamina bar worked.<br>
[21:13] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Hamen*  Will these Melee changes effect everyone from level the first level on?<br>
[21:14] &lt;PCarrico&gt; You will be able to take advantage of the new melee opening system when you begin recieving new combat abilities at level 20.<br>
[21:14] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Illydth* As far as openings go, will any class be able to create an opening for themselves or are openings only created by certain classes?<br>
[21:17] &lt;jtroy&gt; You will be able to take advantage of openings that you create.  Some openings will work for everyone, but there's no link between your opening and someone elses.  There are no combinations or dependencies on other players.<br>
[21:17] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *ScootD* how can you acquire the new melee abilities?<br>
[21:17] &lt;rbarker&gt; The new abilities will be acquired by taking a &quot;skill tome&quot; to your guild master and he'll teach you the skill.  Most of the basic skill swill be available on vendors, while a few high level ones will be drops.  Right now we're planning on giving almost all of the sub 60 skills on merchants and having the 60+ skills using a system similar to the parchments quests in Planes of Power. From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same m<br>
[21:18] &lt;rbarker&gt;  From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same methods that you already use to acquire any other type of item.<br>
[21:18] &lt;rbarker&gt; sorry, my first response got cut off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
[21:19] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Lendaor* are many openings going to be based on mob placement? Such as from behind the mob as aposed to being infront?<br>
[21:19] &lt;rbarker&gt; None of the abilities currently take advantage of your position relative to the mob, so no you won't have to be behind or in front of the mob in order to take advantage of the new abilities.<br>
[21:21] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Badu*  will pure melee have their current dps lowered to take into account the extra dps from this system?<br>
[21:22] &lt;rbarker&gt; No, there will be no decrease in melee's DPS to account for the increase from the new system.  We're creating the system in such a way that they'll fit in right on top of the old one.<br>
[21:22] &lt;PCarrico&gt; Good thing Absor got lasik to read all the questions flying across his screen.<br>
[21:22] &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Subayai* Will disciplines be overhauled are are you simply transfering them over to this endurance system? Most melees only use 1 or 2 disciplines, because the others serve no useful purpose in their current state .<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; We'll be making changes to some of the disciplines that aren't very useful, as well as giving them different timers.  You will still only be able to have one discipline going at a time<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Flaash*  how long will the play have to take advantage of an opening, and how will excessive server side Lag (elemental planes) handle this ?<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; We're still tuning it, but our goal is to make the strategy be in what skill you decide is best to use at the time, not in fast-reaction or twitch gameplay<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Sabrosia*  HOW will these openings be presented?  for instance, will a new window open - and we click a button - will we have to issue a command?<br>
&lt;Hobart&gt; There will be a UI indicator that pops up when you can activate an opening. And yes, you will be clicking a button as opposed to typing in a command.  Once you activate the opening, that same window will show the opening effect.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Dranix* will jumping to negotiate obstacles or people remove from my endurance pool for combat and disciplines?<br>
&lt;Osmith&gt; There have been a few questions with regards to upcoming expansions and features. At this time we cannot go into detail about what's in development. However, please make sure to watch the EverQuestlive.com site for more information over the next few weeks.<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; Jumping will drain a portion of your endurance yes, but it's a reltively minor amount.<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; relatively even.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Tenludar* How will skill points be handled for warriors that have already pogressed in the game?  Will a level 65 be expected to spen hours doing nothing but training to get their skills up?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; You won't need to use skill points in order to learn the new skills, they're either on or off, there's no period of bringing them up to full power so to speak.<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; The only thing you need to do is give the tome to the guild master and you'll have the full skill.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Drewon-FoH* Will there be any new AA skills that are tied to, or create, these new melee abilities?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; There will AA abilites that will effect the new system yes.  We don't have a hard and fast list for it yet though.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Barney* it was mentioned some openings are available after certain skills go off, like parry.  What about classes who do not have certain ablities.  Like monks for example who lack parry.<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; For monks, it's based on dodge, block, and riposte.  We're tuning the rate that they happen based on the skills each class has.<br>
&lt;Hobart&gt; In addition to these melee changes, we have made a few others seperate from this.  All warriors regardless of level will now mitigate a percentage of all incoming melee damage.  Monk will also now be able to dodge when being hit from behind, this should aide thier pulling abilities.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Voldeth-BB*  How will the new system affect a melee's role? Clearly it will support the tanking of a warrior, but what of the monk? What will their role be?<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; #ban Japy<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; The melee skills aren't limited to the dps or defense of the player that uses it.  There are debuffs and group affects as well.  The goal with the skill sets is to provide more of a role for the pure melee during combat<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Stop changing your name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *VALBARR*   it has been stated by rbarker that position wont affect the skills, but in the chat overview, it states that position can change the effectiveness of certain skills ?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; The reference to the positional aspect in the doc on the website was an error.  We're not going to have skills dependant on position.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Dakkon* how many moves are you planning to introduce?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; We're planning on over 20 skills for each class to begin with and we'll be adding even more in the future.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *KyrosKrane* I apologize if this was asked before; I missed the first half of the chat.  Assuming an extended fight (e.g., Luclin bosses), how many openings per unit time could each player of an appropriate class expect?<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; We're still tuning it.  We're looking at a few per fight, though.  We're aiming for making each opening more important, not something that is making you hit an extra 20 keys a minute<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Avelariel* Can we make absolutely clear, these openings are solely for warriors, rogues and monks? Unless that's not the case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; Yes we're only adding the new opening system for warriors, rogues, and monks.  The discipline system revamp will be for all classes that currently make use of disciplines though.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Woody_GU* How exactly does this re-establish balance? Why does this constitute a &quot;fix&quot;? And not a bandaid on top of a semi-broken existing system?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; The new system is only one aspect of the melee revamp, there's several other changes in the works for them as well.<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; You can quote Barker in the comics Woody.<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; One of the major advantages of the new system is allowing us to more easily add new abilites to the pure melee classes.<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; There's several aspects of the existing system that are going to be adjusted, I'd keep an eye on test server if you're interested in more specifics.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Arlos-LOS* If openings are tuned to block/dodge/riposte, what happens if we're not tanking? This would seem to be most applicable to monks &amp; rogues. How do we activate the new abilities if we're, say, fighting a raid mob and doing DPS?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; And yes you can quote me on that, as long as you don't draw me with a bandana <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; There are other events that trigger openings based on your regular attacks.  If you're in a situation where you aren't tanking, you'll get more of those kinds of openings.<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; You have a chance to trigger an opening on any attack or special attack<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; NPC's also have a chance to &quot;fumble,&quot; creating an opening that anyone fighting it can take advantage of<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Layn*  How will the new skills affect aggro if successfully used?<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; There's several new abilities planned that will effect aggro generation.  Some might increase your aggro while others might lower it.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Adorae* just fix taunt? LOL<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; Saying that taunt is the one and only issue is fairly shortsighted, I think.  Pure melee have very few strategic decisions to make, don't get new abilities with an expansion the way casters do, and don't get as much from an item with both hp and mana.  These are all issues that people have raised, and this system gives us a way to address them.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Razorback* Will debuff disciplines stack, or will having more than one person using that make it a wasted use<br>
&lt;rbarker&gt; It really depends on the debuff.  Generally there will be enough differnt abilities you can take advantage of that you'll have several skills that will be useful even if you have several of the same class present.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *faithcrusher* When an opening exxists, you will be offered more than one option?  Like one that would be agressive in nature and one that would be defensive?<br>
&lt;Hobart&gt; When you are presented with an opening, you will have to make a decision on what type of ability you want to use.  There will be many per opening type.  And there are a few opening types.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; &lt;avancouvering&gt; *Depen_Hoss* Will class specific items be adjusted to add endurance, or will we need to look for new items?<br>
&lt;Osmith&gt; We do plan on adding endurance stats onto existing items. We plan to have this done at the same time the new system is introduced next month (Dec. 16th).<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Kilbane_luc* Will we have to buy a new expansion to use these skills too?<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; This is a free feature.  It will become available to everyone!<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Illydth* VERY important question: Since we have a chance to trigger a special attack with every attack, does it then mean that haste and dual wielding and double attacking means more &quot;openings&quot;?<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; More attacks will help a little, but in general they scale around delay<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; Thanks for all of your great questions!  We only have time for a few more, but remember, we'll be looking over the logs and we'll try to answer at least some of the questions that we don't have time for today on the web site later.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Aeria* Question,  this sounds great and all and maybe I missed this point..but if the openings are part of our text..thats ok for groups but major raids where the text OFTEN becomes sluggish means we will miss the opertunity to strike...is there going to be a visual clue?<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; The opening is going to display on the UI - you won't have to watch your textbox for them<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Another thing for warriors that some of you may have noticed on test is that you will now get a return message when taunt is used, so you will know if it was effective.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Aalek* Will the abilities have &quot;cast&quot; times?  Can they be interrupted by the NPC?  Can pure melee NPCs use the abilities against players?<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; No, skills, like bash, kick, and taunt, are instant.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; One more question and we have to go.<br>
&lt;PCarrico&gt; The taunt return message will be for everyone, not just Warriors.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Bumpper-Test* Will Taunt be increased for warriors?...Its a simple question that I know alot of warriors want to know<br>
&lt;jtroy&gt; Yes, we're giving warriors skills to better gain and keep hate\<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Xath* Ohh and thanks for taking the time to chat with us guys (and gals if you have any there).  The changes looks promising, and I for one at least appreciate the attention and info.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; We're hoping to do this on a more regular basis.  It's a lot of fun for us, and hopefully provides some useful information.<br>
&lt;avancouvering&gt; That's all the time we have.  We should have a transcript posted on the site tomorrow.  Thank you all for stopping in!<br>

They acquire these spells (tomes) from vendors up to level 60 then have to get parchments (special drops) in order to get their other spells (special moves). These spells (special moves) can have a variety of effects including stunning mobs, gaining or reducing aggro, do increased damage or even be group beneficial. These effects will only be given to monks, rogues and warriors despite the fact other classes melee mobs as well. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately Furor felt that it was unfair for Paladins and SK's to have mana bars so now SOE has provided him with one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sounded also like monks are going to get hosed a bit since they create openings by the riposte, dodge and block.  I guess unless the monk is tanking, they have much less of a chance to create an opening.<br>
<br>
It will be good for pure melee classes to get improved interaction during fights.  But does this really address the issues you warriors were mad about?  They did say that warriors were getting a mitigation adjustment as well, so that's something I suppose.<br>

Umm, tried playing a pure melee on raids? No?<br>
<br>
We stand there, turn attack on... and that's it. Nothing more. At least as a Knight, you have some variety to what you can do with your class and have the ability to exert some form of skill. You know -- like casting spells for more DPS, healing your group, etc, etc?<br>
<br>
You have your spells, we have our special melee attacks? Fair or unreasonable?<br>

The only Knights bitching about melee getting these upgrades are stupid ones; that for some crazy, fucked up reason think they're getting the shaft somehow.

EQ is at the point of being pretty boring no matter what class you play.  Knights do have a little more variety, I agree, mostly because we're usually given the task of add control.  Lacking adds though, we, like every other class, tap a few keys every so often.<br>

If Knight's seem a bit paranoid, you have only your fellow warriors and that jackass Furor to blame.  There's been post after post by warriors suggesting that the only solution is to nerf Knights hard.  Knights spent the first 2-3 years of this game without any clearly defined role and it should be no surprise that they got pissed when one of the holy trinity of EQ classes started screaming for us to get nerfed.<br>
<br>
I'm glad warriors are getting something to make them more interactive, hopefully that means I won't have to deal with tanks who are too busy playing PS2 to notice the mob they were tanking was pushed behind them.<br>
<br>
This whole Warrior vs. Knight issue was blown way out of proportion, by bankwagon jumpers and a couple people who engineered a problem.  The next time you jump to get another class nerfed or support the idea of grave class imbalance, sit back and actually think about how it effects YOU instead of leaping at Furor's command.  Repeating the mantra of Knights tanking better than Warriors, when in HnE the roles of the two mesh perfectly, makes no sense. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5948">Duke Krazaak Crushbone</a> &lt<a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a>&gt<BR>

Considering that ani is an HnE warrior, I'd say its not meshing all perfectly.<br>
<br>
*shrug* there needs to be SIGNIFIGANT reasons to pick a war vs a Pali vs an SK to tank.<br>
<br>
E.G.  Mob hits softer, but memwipes.  Sounds like a perfect job for a Pali/Sk.<br>
<br>
vs.<br>
<br>
Mob hits far harder (but setup so that /defensive works best- perhaps with a crazy high flurry proc %, but tied to thier &lt;otherwise useless&gt; manabar.), and has a greater chance at 1rounding a pali/sk due to DPS and lower pali/sk hps (Yes yes, I'm ignoring the fact that the HP gap is only 1-200 these days due to misitemization).  Sounds like a job for a warrior who can be kept up without a 0sec cheal chain AND massive spams.<br>
<br>
Once SOE has these &quot;model&quot; fights where the class in question is obviously the best choice for the encounter, then they just have to intelegently add them to the game. Sort of NOT HOW they did rogue/priest/caster traps in LDoN (sure we rogues get 50% while priests and casters each only get 25%, but you know, the only box's I ever find are caster/priests. *shrug* maybe the RNG hates me).  This includes taking into account PITA to get to the mob, and mob drops.  It doesn't matter if &quot;warrior tank&quot; mobs are out there in a 75/25% ratio with pali/sk ones, if they all are behind 14 locked doors, 400 unskippable trash mobs, and only drop bard 2 hand instriments. <p>Ninen of Saryrn<br>

<br>
HnE tanked none of the PoTime gods the first time with a Knight, Warriors tanked every one of them (as it should be), including the few gods that appear to have been designed to encourage Knight tanking.<br>
<br>
To date, HnE has had a Knight successfully tank one god in PoTime, one that as mentioned above, was meant for Knight tanking.<br>
<br>
In other guilds, the Knights that have tanked PoTime gods only did so after they were laden down with loot by farming those gods for months.<br>
<br>
That was my point and directed at Ainian.  There is a SIGNIFIGANT reason to have a Warrior tank the top end content and that is because they are the only ones who can do it until you've farmed enough loot that a rotation can actually keep a Knight standing.<br>
<br>
If, when the next expansion comes out, Knights are the dominant raid tanks, then there is a glaring problem that needs fixing.  Right now however, Warriors are by far the better raid tank for all non-trivial encounters, hands down.<br>

That said, I welcome these new changes if they make pure melee more fun to play, without making drastic changes in comparative power of the classes. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5948">Duke Krazaak Crushbone</a> &lt<a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a>&gt<BR>

I'm sure they had shamans slowing, and clerics healing, rather than BLs/enchs and Druids/shamans.  <br>
<br>
When you do a mob the first time, you fall back on whats been the most successful way of doing it.  And that means the old triad.  Basically it comes down to how you're trained.  You approch unknown situations in the way that has proven in the past to be the most reliable.  Only later, do you, maybe, change tactics to better suit the actual events.<br>
<br>
For example:  How long did it take monks to get the clue that they shouldn't waste all our time trying to pull in LDoN?  Hell, I still get monks that tell the bard to hang back while they waste our 90min timer trying to single.<br>
<br>
And yes, this argument is weaker sounding than I'd like.  <br>

As far as they are concerned if you dont agree 100% with them you are stupid.<br>
<br>
The funny part is if either one of them played a knight they would bitch up a storm at the very mention of a nerf for their class.<br>
<br>
Special abilities for melee class is not a new concept, they first introduced them with disiplines and are now expanding on that concept. The only difference is that warriors bitch long and hard enough to exclude hybrids from the new systems. <br>
<br>
There was no reason for them not to let the hybrid on the fun with weaker and fewer special abilities just like they did with disciplines other than trying to appease a_whinning_warrior_02.<br>
<br>
The only thing that needed to be done was to itemize time with war only gear and give warriors an innate damage mitigation ability. That would have assured warriors would be the prime tank without fucking up hybrids. <br>
<br>
There is no problem with knight versus warrior tanking unless you are in a guild farming time period. Dont let a_time_enabled_whinning_warrior_07 fool you, warrior really do tank better than knights at pre time level. <br>

<br>
what i see is warrior get 4% mitigation now on test, with defensive still able to be used, and with BoV this makes the warrior even better, possibly too much.<br>
<br>
as a warrior all <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wanted was the ability to get some snap aggro that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> could control instead of hoping that a proc would go off or a taunt would succed.<br>
<br>
im glad that the pure melee will get something else to do now other then hit auto and then afk. or at least the option to do that as im sure that a few will still do that part. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clerica>clerica</A> at: 11/25/03 9:25 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showPrevMessage?topicID=5572.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showNextMessage?topicID=5572.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5572.topic&index=15><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.emailToFriend?topicID=5572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.threadControl?topicID=5572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom>Commons Room</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
