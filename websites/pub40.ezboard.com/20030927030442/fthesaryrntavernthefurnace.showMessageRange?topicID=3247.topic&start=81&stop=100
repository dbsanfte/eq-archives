Kiddo did come back for a short time, but played so casually and infrequently that he lost touch and it didnt matter anymore.

<br>
I'll argue that TWC, who commonly raids for 10-12 hour sessions (sometimes not even ending before people are eating breakfast) is more hardcore than HnE and their 4 hour raid days.  Whether I am right or wrong is not significant (and I can already think of several counter-arguments), the point is that it is possible to seperate 'hardcore' from 'progress.' <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The only two other guilds I have ever been a member of met their demise when a large majority decided the guild was not hardcore enough for them and thus fled to what was then the top guild on the server.  Each time I felt betrayed because, well, each time we were in the middle of making such big progress.  <br>
<br>
Following a long period of being a lone wolf I was convinced to join the guild I am still currently tagged with.  After having been with the guild for several years and having seen it go from suffering from a major case of &quot;almost dying out&quot; to taking its place at the top of the food chain I've realized something.  The hardcore gamers,  deep inside, really want to see all, be all and conquer all.  They want to do the big stuff and to be recognized as being &quot;uber&quot;.  They want to do stuff that requires a huge amount of organization and concentration by everyone in attendance.  There are some people who are hardcore gamers but are stuck in unorganized casual guilds because of their sense of honor or duty to those guilds.  For most of those guys it's a sort of self torture as they long to see the bigger stuff while a large portion of their guild thinks differently, wanting to do the little stuff.  It's a struggle that most guilds on Saryrn go through because for the most parts Saryrn is full of casual guilds.<br>
<br>
So, after having given you all my insights into this predicament I'll offer you a solution if you want a method of limiting the turnover rate within your own guild. The guild I'm in has not always been as successful as it is now.   Most people do not know this but there were some dark times in our distant past.  Things that I am sure Familjen has been through.  Stuff like not being able to rally a large enough force to raids,  people only attending raids that would be most beneficial to them and such.  Luckily though our guys are mostly hardcore gamers, and that meant that a system like DKP would face less resistance.  DKP, if you're a hardcore gamer who is able to play all the time,  gives everyone a fair shot at any rewards that has been accrued by the guild.  One of the negative side effects of this is it leaves those who cannot attend most of the raids in the dust,  which is the main reason why the more casual gamers would be against it.  There are different DKP systems for different guilds so form one that most fits your needs.  While DKP will not fix all your problems I think it will most certainly satisfy some of your hardcore gamer's thirst for power.  Just have to remember that organization is key.  Raiding for 12 hours is one thing but if your people are competent and your force is organized enough you can get the same things done in less than a third of that time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ritkhan>Ritkhan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/13/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3247.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Groo, i'm talking even before that. It was so long ago it's fuzzy now, but way back when Fam was a hard core raiding guild. But that aside, the main problems Fam had are the same problems that would plague any guild<br>
<br>
1) Officers that don't play. There is a massive problem that is created when  your guild leader and officers log in once per week and pretend they know more about what's going on then people who raid every single night. The people in a guild who should play the most are the officers. If you can't log in every single night there is no way you should be an officer in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
2) No DKP. This compounded with the fact that officers have no real clue who should get that one piece of uber loot turns off the hard core gamers. Back before NTOV when uber loot flowed into the guild about once per month you can't really afford to make loot mistakes. Giving some stupid casual gamer that logs in once per week loot over someone that plays every day is stupid. DKP would of fixed those retarded mistakes. Sure if Furor was my guild leader who played 24 hours per day i would trust his decision making and agree to no DKP, but when your officers are comprised of Joe Six-pack and Sally Soccer-mom who can't log in for tonight's raid because they have to take their kids to baseball practice you have massive issues.<br>
<br>
3) People who dont understand that real life doesn’t mean jack shit in a game. I dont care if you are having RL problems and can't log on. Tough. You dont want a fair DKP system because you feel you are entitled to the same amount of loot as someone who plays 8 hours per day, even though you can only play 1 hour per week because of your family or whatever? Thats horseshit. Dont make excuses it makes you sound stupid and greedy. The greedy players are the casual gamers who think they deserve the same amount of loot as hard core gamers. If i cant raid one night because i have real life commitments or i have a kid and can only log in once per week i dont expect to get the same amount of loot as Furor. But i guess common sense and fairness are a absent in some people.<br>
<br>
4) Guild recruiting policy. This gets to be worse than chain immigration. You get one stupid casual gamer officer in the guild that over the course of 1 month the end up inviting the whole of Dragon's Syndicate in your supposed &quot;hard core raiding guild&quot;<br>
<br>
5) Hard core gamers are never at fault. It's always whiny casual gamers that think  they know everything who create problems. Casual gamers dont complain. DUH RETARD. If they play once per month, get loot once per month and the guild raids only once per month why would they not be happy? Then the hardcore gamer who's put in 150 hours in the past month is left empty handed in favor of some hack.<br>
<br>
6) Officers who think they're smart. Just because you're an officer does not mean you automatically receive &quot;The Uber Brain of 160 IQ&quot;. If i was an officer i would always ask smart people around me for suggestions and opinions even if they were not officers. You have to earn people's respect regardless if you're an officer or not.<br>
<br>
7) Real life time in guild doesnt mean SHIT!. If you're in a guild since beta but only play once per month you mean less and should have less say than someone that's only been in the guild for 1 month but logs in 40 hours per weeks. In game time is what counts people. Saying you were in the guild before this or that person is a load of scat.<br>

Let me tell you that fam was never a hardcore guild, i should know i was leading most fam raids back then. It was as it is now, a few hardcore play everyday players and alot of casual gamer. <br>
<br>
For a while it look like we would be the second guild to kill trak but that never happened. I cant honestly remember a time when we were in direct competition with OOP or TWC (TWC was the #2 guild back then) as in killing the same mobs they did. The closest we got to that was a few attempt on trak after which we pretty much gave up.<br>
<br>
That said i hope fam will go on i think there is a place for a high end guild for casual gamer on this server.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vermynator>Vermynator</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/13/03 2:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3247.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I will not write a subject line ever</span><hr size=1> The thing is... Familjen was never intended to be a 'hardcore' guild. The members knew this and people knew this when they joined. It was discussed many, many times. Hence part of the reason DKP was never implemented.<br>
<br>
Some people left, big deal. They weren't having fun and there isn't much point in a playing a game if you aren't having fun. Life goes on, and so will Familjen.<br>

<br>
In game payment means loot, right? I know I don't get payment in plat or something, you must mean loot.<br>
<br>
Ok. Lets compare the loot during Bashmash's tenure with the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
132 raids<br>
Bashmash  Blade of Carnage Jan 27 2003 <br>
Bashmash  Crystallized Acid Bracer Mar 05 2003 <br>
Bashmash  Girdle of Living Thorns Jan 04 2003  <br>
Bashmash  Ornate Vambrace Mold Feb 22 2003 <br>
Bashmash  Visor of Endless Sight May 02 2003 <br>
Bashmash  Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV May 07 2003<br>
<br>
51 raids<br>
Bethene  Wito Xi Tetoracu Jan 14 2003  <br>
Bethene  Protective Dust Drape Mar 26 2003  <br>
<br>
Let's see, he got one loot every 22 raids. I got one loot every 25.5 raids during that same timeframe. Yes, he raided a lot more than me, and yes, he got a lot more loot than me. Yep, I can see where that is completely unfair, and I must be using the fact that I do the webpage to get more loot. <br>

I still think ebay sucks, btw, and a lively discussion of that practice would be a nice diversionary tactic. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vermynator>Vermynator</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/13/03 7:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3247.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There are not enough intrusive, inflammatory posts.</span><hr size=1> Yeah!
