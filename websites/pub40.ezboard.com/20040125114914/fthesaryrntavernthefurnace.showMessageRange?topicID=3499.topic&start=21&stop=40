<br>
A business woman, making 6 digits, single, and very successful in all aspects of her life. Travels for work, which is required for her job. <br>
<br>
She is out one night, and someone rapes her. First of all, the mental anguish caused by this has already tortured her. She finds out she is pregnant. Now, having been around a pregnant woman recently, I know what they go through. This woman, would not be able to fly around the world, so now she can not complete her job. She could take maternity leave via FMLA but it has now interrupted her plans in life. During the time she is gone, someone else gets a promotion she may have been able to get. <br>
<br>
She now has the fetus of a sick, deranged individual growing inside her. What kind of fucked up genes does the father have? She now has to live with the mental anguish that she is pregnant with the man who violently and maliciously attacked her in a savage crime of lust, which she has to carry the memory of for the rest of her life. <br>
<br>
You are saying she should live with that baby growing inside her for 9 months, interrupting her life? Who are you to make that decision for her? Would you want someone telling you what you have to do with your life? Hell no. So why should they?<br>

If the pregnancy is from rape then that is totally different story, but usually now they can keep that from happening if you report it. <br>
<br>
I do believe abortion is an option if puts the mother's life at risk. I do believe it is an option if adding another baby to the family (accidents do happen) will actually hurt the other children, through neglect of parent's time and financially. I don't believe others should starve to feed another or go cold cause there wasn't enough money to by clothes and education is neglected from lack of money for school. <br>
<br>
I will never go out and wave banners or signs saying pro-choice, but I do believe above all else being a woman myself that I have the right to decide how my body, life and mental health is affected, through my choices. <br>
<br>
Those choices should always be there, and no man or group should be able to dictate how I live based on their religion or personal opinion. When I die, then ultimatly I will answer for the sins I alone commited in life and that is the only time anyone should ever worry about. <br>
<br>
Another thought about totally outlawing abortions. How many  women will die or loose any chance of ever having children again due to backstreet abortions if it is totally outlawed.<br>

The only instance I can see abortion being &quot;okay&quot; is if they know for a fact it's going to hurt and/or kill the mother in any way. <br>
<br>
I've also been told I should have no opinion in it because I'm male and have &quot;no clue what it's like to be pregnant&quot;<br>
<br>
true, but you're killing someone. It's black and white, I don't see how anyone can justify killing somebody because it would make their life easier. No gray areas, you're purposely stopping a human being from living, it's murder.<br>
<br>
Jack Kavorkian (sp?) went to prison for life for helping people who were terminally ill kill themselves because they didn't want to go through anymore pain. Women who abort a fetus choose that they want to have their innocent baby killed. Not aborted, disposed of, fucking killed. Not breathing, heart stopping, air supply cut. Why aren't these people put in jail too? I mean they're doing the same exact thing Jack Kavorkian did, kill people. I sure don't see the difference. <br>
<br>
&quot;I was raped&quot; this is why we have adoption. And Garb, your story is pointless. If someone is pulling in 6 figures, goes on a business trip, gets raped, loses a promotion, boo fucking hoo, if you can't support a child and you're pulling in $100,000+ a year, something is seriously wrong. My Dad made/makes around $35,000/$40,000 a year as a drug officer, I never grew up without food/shelter/clothing. Hence, we have adoption agencies for people like this...but it's okay, kill the innocent kid dwelling inside of someone, I mean, if it's going to mean she can't get that great promotion...<br>

<br>
The promotion is really beside the point, the point to what Garb was saying is this. Rape is a violation of a person's body, they did not want this and it's a sever trama, mentally and physically. <br>
<br>
Now you have the mental anguish of knowing that the man, that had no care about your feelings or will as a human being has a child growing inside of you. The child is unwanted, the child is a constant and permanent reminder that you were violated. <br>
<br>
Say the woman is married, she and her husband had not been able to have children and now for 9 months she has to wake up everyday with a constant reminder to herself and to her husband of what they couldn't acheive together.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I can't imagin the anguish it must cause to know that the child your having isn't from the man you love and I can't imagin the pain the husband must feel seeing his wife pregnant with another man's child. <br>
<br>
Some people are strong and I'm sure they could survive such a trama. Other's aren't so strong. Women who are raped often face depression, ptd and many other things. The added fact your pregnant now builds and multiplies the emotions already in place. <br>
<br>
These are all theoretical scenes but very real possibilities. The real question is, should a woman's life be destroyed further for the chance that a child can be adopted? Should a woman have to suffer for nearly a year after the attack just to satisfy a few self-rightous people? <br>
<br>
Should the woman have to pay for the medical bills that will come of having the child? No adoption angency that I know of will pay for all the doctor visits and the hospital time for birth. The rapest if caught isn't going to pay. It really costs to have a child.<br>

<br>
Some hospitals that are Catholic run, like the one my father was born in believe that the mother's life is the one to die over the child's. If it is a choice of the mother's life and the child's life, then the child is saved. It all comes down to a lesser of two evils.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=foranfor>ForanFor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/26/03 2:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3499.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: babies</span><hr size=1> Quote<br>

Secondly I agree with Ninen: I actually had a little altercation with a priest who was handing out pictures of aborted fetuses outside an abortion clinic about six months ago--how many adopted children did he have, I asked?<br>
<br>
None, he said. It isn't my calling.<br>
<br>
Ah, but his calling was to stand outside and harrass women making a really awful choice? Nice.<br>
<br>
Unless some of you have some adopted or foster kids, I don't think you have any ground to stand on--its like a PETA fanatic who has no pets.<br>
<br>
I do actually think abortion is serious, I even think its murder, if you use the term loosely. I also think it's fine. If you don't want to be a mother, you shouldnt have to...the amount of energy some people expend on protesting some people not wanting to be mothers...would be far far far better spent taking care of children who don't have mothers.<br>
<br>
So you love life? Fine. Go do some volunteer work with kids, adopt one, foster a few, become a teacher. Go devote yourself to making the world a better place for the people already in it. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=graowlwhitetiger>Graowl Whitetiger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/26/03 5:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3499.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: babies</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyone who is pro-life is a complete fucktard, and i will say that to their face.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yeah but see, from experience I can say you're more or less a complete idiot Nob, so what you say doesn't really matter all that much.<br>

1) IVF. Normally several embryos are implanted so that 1 or 2 will take. Is the doctor considered a murderer for implanting 8 or so, knowing that most of those will croak? Is the mother a murderer for having this procedure? In the case where she does have multiple embryos that happen to make it and keeping all of them would kill all of them, is it murder to sacrifice the life of one of those so that the rest may live?<br>
<br>
2) Frozen embryos. Is it murder to dipose of those things if they have been in stasis for 15 years? You could argue that those are &quot;potential life&quot; or whatever, but they are just sitting there doing nothing and costing a fortune to maintain, and will most likely never be used. Would the pro-lifers pay the cost to maintain those since the &quot;parents&quot; may not be able to?<br>

Actually, I'm fairly Pro-Death.  I don't think most 30 year olds have any more redeeming value than a 3 month old fetus.<br>
<br>
I'm simply anti-hypocrite.<br>
People who say they are Pro-Choice rarely, if ever, will outright admit that abortion is ok with them.  They try to hide it under a mask of kinder, gentler words, when the simple fact is by saying you are Pro-Choice you are accepting that one of those choices is abortion, and that people will choose it. You can qualify it any way you like.  It's only ok when the mother is raped, only when there's a medical risk to the mother, only when the full moon falls on a Tuesday.  These are arbitrary moral judgements that can and will change from culture to culture.  But if they make someone feel better about themselves when they say that abortion is ok with them, I guess they're needed. <p>-Tain<BR>

<br>
A rather asinine comment.   You act as if being raped were as bothersome as stubbing your toe.  Something that hurts for a second, but is forgotten by dinner time. Shame on women for not being able to handle being raped...tsk tsk.  I almost expect to hear some hue and cry about the rapists rights as a father after that post.<br>
<br>
When you get raped, and get pregnant, then YOU can keep the baby and pat ourself on the back.  Until then what business is it of yours what they decide to do?  It's a free country, so your relgious dogma has no power to deny a woman her choice.  Abortion's legal in some form in most states, so you can't legally take her decision away.   Assuming you're not the rapist, you have no legal recourse to deny her choice.  Assuming you are the rapist, no one gives a shit what you think especially the woman in question.   <br>
<br>
Instead of sitting there pointing fingers, victim blaming, name calling, and trashing on women in that situation, why don't you take your morals down to the rape shelters, or the rape clinics and offer to take care of the babies yourself ?  Hell some of those rape victims ARE children, you could &quot;save&quot; two for the price of one morally speaking. <br>
<br>
That kind of small thinking is what drives that demented segment of Pro-lifers to run out and buy guns, shoot abortion doctors, then go home and congradulate themselves over a beer for &quot;saving&quot; a life.<br>
<br>
Side note:<br>
<br>
While it's true every child that is born has the possibility of discovering the wonder cure for any and all plauges known to man.....it's also true they are all born with possibility of becoming something truly horrific as well.    You're not born with a destiny....what you become is a product how/where/and who you are riased to be.<br>

<br>
You choose a fairly tough topic to try to add a feather to your cap for a &quot;Blast Furnace Cookie.&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, this is a topic many people won't discuss with friends, family, or co workers, much less a random collection of strangers on a chat board known for asinine and aggressive behavior.  I commend everyone here who has expressed a real opinion here as it takes a lot of guts to do so.<br>
<br>
Now back to Tain.  Since your opinion narrows things, let's broaden them again.<br>
There really are more than 2 categories.<br>
<br>
Anti-Abortion<br>
Catholics: Not exactly sure the stance, but fairly close to Antiu Abortion/Extreme Pro-Life.<br>
<br>
Pro-Life:  very very very extreme instances where an abortion might be ok.  Most of the Christian establishment is here or more right.<br>
<br>
from here it gets cloudier...<br>
<br>
Pro Choice Limited:  Abortion ONLY to save the mothers life.<br>
<br>
Pro-Choice for mothers well being: Abortion to save her life, or to avoid the suffering of a baby who would be born VERY sick and probably die very young.  Rape case abortions are usually split here.  No numbers, just my guess.<br>
<br>
Pro Choice extreme:  Abortion is ok for any situation where the mother prefers it.<br>
<br>
Now... as I said, this is how I see the breakdown roughly.<br>
<br>
Many camps, many ideas.<br>
<br>
Tain fine... I will step into your trap.  I think abortion is ok in some cases.<br>
<br>
Life threatening to the mother/child:  I simply think it is more humane.  I hate to see any one suffer, and remember the same people who scream about cruel and unusual punishment when it comes to criminals are the ones condemning these women to exactly that.<br>
<br>
Rape:  This one is touchier.  If the rape wasn't bad enough... I cannot imagine telling any woman, &quot;You have been raped, now you have to wake up every day for the next 9 months with a glaring reminder of your rape, you must carry the seed of the rapist, and must let him/her out into the world.&quot;  You know they have linked aggressive behavior to a gene right?  This gene could be carried on, this child could grow up to cure aids, or kill 10 people, or anything in the middle.  <br>
<br>
No woman with this decision is going to come asking our opinions.  You start a topic to bait some sucker into slipping up so you can nail them... well rough topic to do it on.  <br>

Abortion would consist of destroying a forming embryo before it has even really decided whether or not it was going to be human. It couldn't survive on it's own, therefore you're not taking anything away from it.<br>
<br>
I'm pro-Abortion, but don't think I'm in it for the mother. Being a totally non-religious person, I fail to see any distinction that would make humans &quot;sacred&quot; in any way. In fact, I see a lot of evidence to the contrary, but that's a whole different argument. <br>
<br>
Since I don't believe that there's anything special about people, I don't see any valid reason to go out of your way to make sure we have more of them. It's not like there's a baby shortage to begin with.<br>

I'm sure that your symantic deconstruction technique of argument was a big hit in discussions during GED night school classes, but impressing morons doesnt make you smart. If you think &quot;Pro Choice&quot; is the same as &quot;Pro Abortion&quot;, would &quot;Anti Abortion&quot; then be equivalent to &quot;Anti Choice&quot; perhaps? There are two different issues you are mixing up here. The idea of allowing women a choice to terminate a pregnancy is an issue of the extent of individual liberty, seperate from the issues of abortion concerning its legallity, as well as its moral and ethical character.<br>
<br>
You can believe abortion is wrong in every scenario, but still respect the right of others to decide for themselves. This whole issue so complex that oversimplifying concepts and expecting insight to arise from flipping words around is really callous. We would all rather live in a world where abortions weren't wanted or needed-- it is a horrible thing for someone to go through, especially in combination with a sexual assault. Nobody is &quot;pro abortion&quot;...it's kind of gross to even suggest it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dyrkkdyggler>DyrkkDyggler</A> at: 8/26/03 8:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghandue>ghandue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sycornet.com/familjen/images/members/thumb_ghandue.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/26/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3499.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pro-Abortion</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;&lt; pro choice,  Doesn't mean I'm pro abortion, mean I'm pro being able to make your own choice.

Uh.<br>
Yes.<br>
By saying someone is not allowed to have an abortion under any circumstances, then you are removing the choice.  How is that not anti-choice?<br>
<br>
By saying that you believe abortion is sometimes ok, how is that not taking a pro-abortion view?  Simply because you don't like how it's worded?  It makes it sound nasty?  If you believe the act is nasty, why shouldn't it sound that way as well?  If you believe that it's simply a biological process that is undertaken, and isn't a bad thing, then why should the connotation of the word be a bad one?<br>

It's perfectly reasonable to find a certain behavior distasteful but recognize that it's beyond the scope of what the government should make illegal.  Like chewing gum: I have a weird prejudice against it, inherited from my mother, who was strangely zealous about our not ever chewing gum.  I find the habit nasty, and I'd prefer people didn't do it around me.  On the other hand, I think it should be legal.  By Tain's logic, this means that gum-chewing is ok with me.  Which it's not, really.<br>
But anyways, I'll call Tain's bluff: abortion is ok, any day of the week.  You might even convince me it was murder (which I don't really buy, but both sides of the argument have to get into some hand-waving), and it would still be ok.  It's an exception I'm perfectly willing to make, because it's a situation that's completely unique -- this woman has something GROWING IN HER ABDOMEN.  Freaky!

<br>
The problem is not that people care more about the label than the act itself.<br>
The problem is people react strongly to being labeled.  People may even react more strongly to being labeled arbitrarily by someone with a sudden thought than they are by an act they are not actively involved in.  Trust me, when the question hits a little closer to home, it is a very clarifying moment.<br>
Some twit randomly deciding that his point of view about the meaning of words is right, and therefore your opinion carefully thought over is now in fact something entirely different is annoying.<br>
<br>
Akin to racism this is a charged topic for some.<br>
Your argument turned on the topic of racism or some other topic like the death sentence.  If you are pro-capitol punishment, then you must be raving lunatic murderer or supporter of other raving lunatic murderers.<br>
