<br>
1) Come up with a name that nobody has any idea how to pronounce and is very difficult to spell. Something like Axeoebela.This way everyone will remember you. And just think of all the fun they'll have everytime they try to send you a tell.<br>
<br>
2) Try to get into a mid-50's level guild or higher while you're still in your 20's. Make sure to ask everytime you log on for somebody to give you some gear and come power level you because, let's face it, people in their 50's really have nothing better to do so they will love you for asking. Also don't forget when you get into your 50's others will ask for help when you're on too. Make sure to tell them that you are very willing to help. It is not important that you actually go do it just make sure to offer. This will keep you on everyone's good side.<br>
<br>
3) Everytime you log on you should announce in guild chat that you have arrived. You should always make sure to respond to anyone else that says they have also arrived. You should announce when you are leaving and say goodbye to each and every other person that says they are leaving too. This way people will know just how nice of a person you really are because words speak louder than actions.<br>
<br>
4) Most people never have enough to read. When they're out there in groups and killing 3 MOBs at once they need more to do. Make sure that every chance you get you post a message in guild chat. Tell them when you've dinged 3 and 4 and 5 and so on. They really want to know when you're bored and they want to hear every little thing that is on your mind. Doing this surely keeps people from getting bored and remember it's all about marketing. You need to get your name out like Coke or Pepsi so that people remember and always think of you.<br>
<br>
5) When you get into your upper 40's it's time to start whining about getting your epic. Make sure to mention every chance you get that nobody is helping you with yours. This will give the guild plenty of options when deciding what they should raid next. If you've done your job right then they will all like you so much by now that they will go kill the MOB for you and then use CoH to just bring you in at your convenience so you can loot the piece you need.<br>
<br>
6) Make sure to check the guild's website often. You should never post anything that makes you look intelligent. This could cause other people to feel inferior. Therefore, you should always reply to every single last post that you read. And your reply should be short and easy to understand. I recommend you use one of the following for your reply: LOL, ROFL, LMAO or if you really want to take that extra 15 minutes of typing then you might try &quot;That's a good one.&quot; but that last one is really pushing it.<br>
<br>
7) spelling  grammar and puctation are important to make peeple like you your speling and grammer shood be atroshus that way people wont feel inferior to u it is impotant 2 use abbrviasions as much as posble 2 and dont forgit that capitol leters r very much ovarated eveyrnoe enjys figruing out what your tring 2 say its prolly like a puzle 2 them so make sure 2 do it as much as u can and peeple wont fill your talking down on them noone likes feeling inferier<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   When you finally do show up to a raid it is important to add plenty of humor. By now everyone has gotten to know you quite well because you have followed all the previous rules. So keep everyone's spirits up and spam the raid channel with childish remarks and jokes. And be sure to ask plenty of stupid questions about instructions that were given to you 12 times already. This will prevent the guild from venturing further on into almost certain death and this way everyone will stay alive. You'll always be remembered as the hero.<br>
<br>
9) Also when you're on that raid make sure that you don't do too much. This could steal the glory away from other individuals and that's just bad. It would probably be safest if you just sat on your ass and let someone else do the work. Besides, you're very busy telling jokes anyhow.<br>
<br>
10) There will be some rogue players now and then that do not follow these rules. It is important that you do not let these people upset the balance of the guild. Therefore, you must bitch and complain constantly in guild chat and on the guild's website and be sure to complain to the officers as much as you can because, of course, they have nothing better to do anyhow and they'll really appreciate the feedback. Let's face it, you're doing it for the good of the guild and it has to be done or the next thing you know people will start asking you to go kill Vindi and that's just not right.<br>
<br>
These rules should be followed implicitly. Any deviation from this could mean getting shunned from your guild and being blackballed from joining any other guild. Do so at your own risk. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cenyenlamorak>CenyenLamorak</A> at: 8/1/03 4:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanmers>kanmers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/1/03 3:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5314.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to be well liked in EQ</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>7) spelling grammar and puctation are important to make peeple like you your speling and grammer shood be atroshus that way people wont feel inferior to u it is impotant 2 use abbrviasions as much as posble 2 and dont forgit that capitol leters r very much ovarated eveyrnoe enjys figruing out what your tring 2 say its prolly like a puzle 2 them so make sure 2 do it as much as u can and peeple wont fill your talking down on them noone likes feeling inferier<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You know, aside from the jokers from ST who might send me tells, I really do get questions from lvl 25 people about joining early and just being in the guild until they're 65 and can raid with us.<br>
