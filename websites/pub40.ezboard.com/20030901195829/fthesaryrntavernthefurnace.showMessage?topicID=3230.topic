<br>
I used to spend a few hours here and there just breaking these people down, slowly draining their cash flow until they had nothing.  They all said &quot;Man, you're lucky&quot;, but it wasn't luck - hell, they had the odds.  I just turned the tables on them and ended up with things in my favor.  <br>
<br>
The easiest way to bust these guys up is to convince them that you simply like gambling, and you have a nice size bankroll you want to spend.  But, you're not going to do it with some anon level 1 merchant who has no reputation for honesty.  You show them the cash, and let them think you're serious, and they'll be more than happy to log on their main and play a nice, fair game.<br>
<br>
I know it sounds too easy, but remember - the people running the &quot;casinos&quot; are looking for a get-rich-quick, so at this point all they're seeing is your cash, not the big picture.<br>
<br>
The next thing to do is to turn their game to your favor.  Now, you're never going to be able to convince them to change the odds, but you can almost always negotiate the payoff, and the minimum / maximum bets.  Again, all they see is your bankroll, so as long as they still think they've got the odds in their favor, it's all good.  <br>
<br>
So now you've got a good idea of who this person is, and you've got a game that, if you're smart, is pointing in your favor without being obvious.  But you still have to set some ground rules:<br>
<br>
1) No money changes hands before the /random.  I will put my bet in the trade window, and then /random.  If I lose, I will hit trade, and you get paid.  If I win, then you place my winnings plus enough to cover my initial bet in the same trade window, and I accept.  <br>
<br>
2) No one sits while we play.  You sit down, and I'm gonna think you're trying to bail out and cheat me.  <br>
<br>
At this point, as long as you're good with numbers and know how to place your bets correctly, the /random rolls are gonna allow you to win, and more than likely win a decent amount of cash.  And, if anything goes wrong, you've got their identity (and probably a guild to associate them with), which puts their ass in a sling.  Because no respectable hustler wants to be known as a cheat and a fraud.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, I hate idiots who run these &quot;casinos&quot;, but if you can have some fun, why the hell not? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=358285"> <br>

I was pretty tired when I wrote that piece, Seani.  The initial idea was to give an example of how, if you beat these &quot;casinos&quot;, it does a lot to discourage them.  I was using a mule character when I was working them over, and saw a lot of people re-think the get rich quick scheme after losing their nest egg.  But after a few sentences, I started babbling about details and crap.  <br>
<br>
Anduran, most of your examples are right on track with how I was beating these guys.  Find out their bankroll, and select a minimum bet which is going to let me stay within their payrange, and still let me &quot;pass&quot; 7-8 times before I hit my maximum allowed bet.  Usually, in 30-45 minutes, I'd have their pockets depleted.  <br>
<br>
The thing to remember is that while normal &quot;casinos&quot; discourage playing system bets, most boneheads in the bazaar aren't even going to realize what the hell you're doing until they're broke.<br>

<br>
More times than not, it'll follow a simple pattern. example is using consecutive rolls, over a short period of time. /rand 100<br>
<br>
Some number 34-66....\<br>
Some number 34-66.....|- some number of these<br>
Some number 34-66..../<br>
Some number 1-33....1-3 of these<br>
Some number 67-100....1-2 of these, then back to the mid numbers.<br>
<br>
If it's a busy area, and all the scammers...err...casino operators have a large number of marks, and the /randoms are really flowing; if you jam your /random in right after some other smuck gets a 20, you're rather likely to get a 67 or better.  If you don't you'll likely get a 15 to go along with him, and someone else who's paying attention will get the 67+ _right_ after.<br>
<br>
Of course, the above comes into play alot more on the /random's you get on the misc crap that drops while exping....<br>

<br>
Actually…the RNG is very easy to “beat”. Each server (each is actually a network of many servers) has one box dedicated to cranking out the so-called random numbers.<br>
<br>
The way it works is, a sampler routine pulls whatever happens to be in the accumulator at any moment and thus has a “reasonably random” seed between .01 x 10^-31 and .1 x 10^-31. This value is then indexed by an extemely stable period (Sony uses the pulsar PSR B1509-58 for their indexing).<br>
<br>
An array of many seeds is generated over a period of time (let’s say 30 min), each precisely indexed. At the end of the 30 min, the values recorded over the cycle are analysed by a statistical package which finds and flags aberrant values (clumps of numbers which are too close in value).<br>
<br>
These flagged numbers are then compared to another array of values recorded on a central server for exactly the same time period. These other values are called P/PI’s (Probability/Psi Indicators). Back in the 1970’s, the casinos on LasVegas did a study to determine if there was any way that people’ desire to win at their casino games might in any way actually influence the supposedly random nature of the game. A six year study proved inconclusive because nobody saw that the data they were analysing was offset in a way which nobody imagined was possible.<br>
<br>
At some point someone figured out that the P/PI data being retrieved from test subjects matched up with startling accuracy IF one compared the current P/PI data not with the current games the test-subjects were playing, but with ones they would play later on! This time difference (roughly 1.75 hrs) is known as the Minden Offset. When factored in, it was found that something about the gambers…psycic?…mental? WAS affecting the randomness of the games, and thus indeed cutting into the house-odds.<br>
<br>
The finding were kept secret for years, and the casino-owners set up secret P/PI collection equipment in all of their casinos. They would constantly screen the data, and if “spike” in the data indicated that abnormally many people would soon be winning, they would find some excuse to close (usually for “maintenance”) until the spike blew-over.<br>
<br>
The NGC eventually got wind of this, and forced the casio-owners to stop the practice. Though the government has never lost interest in P/PI research, there really was no longer a market for its private use. Since EQ is not actual gambling however, it is legal for Sony to make use of the technology to help keep their RNG as perfect as possible. They use the P/PI numbers to filter aberrances (people overly focused on a certain mob popping, loot dropping, etc.) and generate a very clean, and truly random number.<br>
<br>
The trick is, now that you know what you know, simply decide to gamble about 1.75 hrs before you actually do, and concentrate on LOSING! That’s right!…just think about all those 2’s and 17‘s out of 1000 yer gonna’ roll! This will cause Sony’s RNG to be skewed toward higher numbers! (because it ~thinks~ you wanted the lower ones….). If you doubt this, just remember all the times you camped something and it never popped…when some guy who never heard of the mob walks by your camp 4 seconds after you leave only to trip over the mob you wanted!<br>

<br>
Basically, What you are doing is doubling your bet every single time, to lower the chance that you lose exponentially, what happens is after a certain number of steps you assure yourself of winning, here's an example.<br>
<br>
johnny_scammer says out of character, &quot;casino open, ran 1000, roll over 600 and get double back&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bet 1pp</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
at this point, if you win, you win 1pp, grats you, if you lose, you step to the next level<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bet 2pp</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
at this point, if you win ,your total bet has been 3pp, and you win back 4pp, meaning you win 1pp overall<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bet 4pp</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
at this point, your total bet has been 7pp, and you win back 8pp (if you win) meaning your profit is 1pp.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bet 8pp</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
can you see a trend yet?<br>
<br>
<br>
This does work, is it fool proof? No, but it's fucking close, there's more to it which i'll post when I get to work today.  You DO need a fortune to be able to pull it off with a huge assurance you wont lose however.  The problem doing it in everquest?  People log with your plat.<br>
