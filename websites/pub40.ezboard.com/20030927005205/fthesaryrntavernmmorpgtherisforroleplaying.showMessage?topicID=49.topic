one silent moon less night. She was young, but born wise, and she was the<br>
close companion of an dark elf elusive necromancer who liked to call her<br>
his pet. His name must be unspoken. She lived in the shadows and learned<br>
the dark arts of enchantment and illusion, she learned alone the mysteries<br>
of her craft and her master was proud of her then. Always alone, even with<br>
him, she traveled through the forest fighting her own demons and seeking<br>
the truth in the darkness. She grew strong and brave, and with her pets the<br>
dark elf enchantress was happy and complete. As she grew and changed her<br>
master would help her and teach her more of the dark arts, they were happy<br>
and she grew hopeful. But her master was teaching her more than her craft.<br>
Anama traveled far and wide, she learned of willowisps and how if she<br>
killed them she would free someone's soul. She was a solitary creature,<br>
happy in her travels and explored the dark continent of Norrath in many<br>
many ways, she went to the ocean of tears and the call of the ocean<br>
captured her soul. She went to the forbidden city of Qeynos and alone she<br>
quested for the stein she needed for her craft. Her illusions grew and her<br>
soul grew strong. She thought she was invincible and she needed no-one. But<br>
one day her heart was shattered and her master told her she must go into<br>
the world alone now and he would not be with her any more. Anama learned<br>
she must look into her own soul and she saw the power of her role. She<br>
wanted to die but knew she must live. She learnt the enchantment of<br>
precious metals and seeking stones far and wide she practiced her craft of<br>
jewelry. She would change her form , confusing people and remaining<br>
elusive.  In the green alien plains of the westcommon lands she soloed many<br>
wild creatures then the desert called her. Sometimes she would meet other<br>
adventurers and would change through each encounter, and she would talk to<br>
people who needed her wisdom and help, for the dark elf enchantress had a<br>
hidden side. She made a few friends and she liked a few people, preferring<br>
the solitude of her heart to the loneliness of crowds. Happy again she<br>
fought true and crocodiles and caiman became her chosen sacrifices.<br>
Sometimes bored she would join a group and mostly she preferred to be free<br>
and alone. One day she made a friend, another solitary and transformative<br>
soul who showed her the arts of hunting and playing. Scared she followed a<br>
little behind and saw there could be more than she knew. She took the task<br>
of killing the treants of Karana upon herself and she realized even in the<br>
light there was evil and darkness and light were merely mirrors of each<br>
other. Anama came to maturity and her name was Anama Animus the balance of<br>
male and female, Yin and Yang and darkness and light. <br>
<br>
Bravely she wandered and came to another dimension a mirror image of the<br>
world she had left...she was alone and the world was quiet and<br>
deserted...so she adventured bravely and explored the dungeons and dragons<br>
of a new continent, she learned to charm and mesmerize, and many she<br>
encountered of all races and classes...she met them all as friends...An<br>
elusive agnostic she could change form and blend or float like an elemental<br>
above the world of dreams....she looked for a family to call her own and<br>
continued to travel into deep chasms of frogloks and spectres...other<br>
planes welcomed her and she grew and worked hard on her talents...friends<br>
came and went and she shyly went about her way....She came of age and then<br>
she found a family and learnt to slay dragons and gods...with her brave<br>
family she adventured more and she still walked a solitary path in her<br>
heart...happy in her enchantments and dreams....<br>
<br>
<br>
One day some friends asked her to join their ranks, she didnt know them but<br>
they said there is a group of people, a special family would you like to be part<br>
of them? Surprised her solitude shaken, she wondered if she should. Many<br>
lessons she had learned but her heart was still fragile, and her solitude<br>
her fortress. But she pondered and she thought and she saw the family was a<br>
good one, and she joined their ranks. She learnt that friendship could be<br>
good, and her family made her laugh, and sometimes she cried too. Growing<br>
strong her heart forgot the past and healed a little. She learned to laugh<br>
more and she knew she was traveling the path of her soul to her destiny. So<br>
look inside the darkness and find the truth and never be scared to follow<br>
your soul you never know where it might lead you. Her questions unanswered<br>
but learning to live in the moment and let life unfold Anima Animus<br>
continues her quest about her life and her soul, but now she has a family<br>
to share her adventures with and she is almost complete....she has many<br>
adventures to follow still and she knows the future is unrevealed and the<br>
mysteries of her own soul only can show her the path she must take....and<br>
her heart may yet be full again. But her soul knows the truth only there<br>
can her true answers be found....<br>
<br>
Anama travels still the dark and mysterious lands and knows there is much<br>
to explore....her soul is light and the path is dark...she is waiting to<br>
blend the answers she is seeking....many wonders wait....<br>
