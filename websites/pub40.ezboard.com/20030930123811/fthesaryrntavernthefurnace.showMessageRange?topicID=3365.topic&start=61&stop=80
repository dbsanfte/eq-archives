I dont remember ever seeing a disclaimer in any of your posts saying you didnt actually believe the crap you would post so why in the world wouldnt he treat you accordingly &quot;in-game&quot;? and if your messageboard personality/opinions werent enough to make him treat you negatively maybe it was the fact that even in the game you would make things up and lie to him (remember when you admitted this?)? he was trying to run a guild and didnt need your nonsense. so maybe look at yourself as at least part of the reason he treated you the way he did.<br>
<br>
of course I have no clue what &quot;anti-american&quot; stuff you both may have squabbled over. Im an american and was one of his best friends in EQ. it didnt seem to be a problem. I do remember him telling me some of the things he did say to you during the enchanter botb, though, and those had nothing to do with politics. but I actually asked him to leave you alone once he told me. not that I didnt think you deserved it because Ive seen your nonsense as much as anyone but that part of you is just not worth the time interacting with.<br>

when did I say he was &quot;the clean cut all european you make him out to be&quot;? I said I have no idea what you guys talked about. I just gave the flip side that he is obviously not the &quot;anti-american&quot; you make him out to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did I deserve any of that?&quot; Yes you did and I said why. Well, that is unless youre talking about whatever american/euor fights you guys might have had. If thats what you are talking about then I cant comment, wasnt part of it. But I took that to mean his attitude toward you and that you clearly deserve regardless of the american/euro issue.<br>

Youd rather he played messageboard games with you? I think sending tells is more worthy of respect than this place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep shoving your head up his ass even more, much like you'e done for 3 years pal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why are you so jaded? Why is my head up his ass? He was my friend and I clearly explained good reasons why he treated you the way he did. I cant claim to know them all and maybe what I posted was only 10% of it and the other 90% is that he wants to be a Swedish Hitler and hates americans, I have no clue. But get over it. Im not putting 100% of anything on you but I definitely wont sit here while you take pot shots at an old friend especially when you have admitted you are at the minimum partially responsible for the way he treated you. Seems innane you would say anything at all given the admissions you have made. At the best you are saying you both suck. Grats.<br>

I will also assume that you used my sarcasm, as if it was how things would actually take place rather than an example of your competance, to make some sort of 'witty' rebuttle and 'own' me as you so often do.<br>
<br>
My statement wasn't to enfornce Garbhad's point of Toor being an ignorant fuck, but more towards you being an ignorant fuck.  You've spouted shit on FoH boards (the serverwide one i talked about) about the emp/ssra race which you failed to live up to until PoP came out with new AA's and more effective slows against him.<br>
<br>
I don't suppose how you posted on that 'other' board about how you 'own' everyone on your local board with your flames?  You've posted non-sense for as long as i can remember reading these boards and thats all its been.  If that doesn't count as a 'qualifying arguement' as to why you are a flaming fucking retard, i suppose you just 'owned' me again.  <br>
<br>
Was it you that went to FoH and tried to flame them about Vulak and how you were better than them?  ( this is a serious question, i'm really curious~  ) <br>
