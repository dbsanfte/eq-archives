<br>
He does nothing, and covers his inaptitude by staging this stupid, worthless, ineffective, and unnecessary war on drugs.<br>
<br>
Recent reports say that he's wasted over 90 billion dollars on the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and he hasn't even been able to touch the problem! What'd he do, close the Canadian border?  Marijuana is a plant! You can't just expect that to stop the flow, when people can grow it in America!<br>
<br>
Not only does he have to wage a completely ineffective war on drugs, but he has to &quot;work&quot; to hunt down and arrest people using marijuana for medical purposes, and then send them to jail, and fine them... He's gotten to the point where he's persecuting cancer patients, people with severe pain, people with terminal disease, chronic arthritis, and fining them thousands and thousands of dollars, talk about bullying in the government!<br>
<br>
As if that were it, what's going on with Ashcroft, telling judges recently that he is making &quot;logs&quot; mandatory, so that he could check to see if judges were &quot;being strict enough'', as if the failure of the war on drugs was their fault.  He's mad because the fining money from the mary jane prohibition isn't making enough money to make up for the expense of his stupid war.  He's been doing this all along to make it look like he serves a purpose... but what does Ashcroft do, other than the War on Drugs?  <br>
<br>
Obviously he wants some kind of pseudo-feudalistic society, where he can overstep his boundaries, and screw around with the system of checks and balances.  the Judicial Branch should be balancing the Executive Branch, not the other way around, but somehow he justifies this &quot;Because it's drugs!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ashcroft's been spending all this time screwing people's lives, giving them arrest/criminal records, for puffing on a joint.  Now I'm not saying that drugs are a good idea, but decriminalization would be a better way to go, legalization would bring some defenite revenue to the government, but he either doesen't realize this, or he's in stubborn denial, and refuses to just give in.  Maybe he doesen't want to look &quot;soft&quot;, but that'd be better than making a mockery out of the nation, and wasting much-needed budget money out of taxpayer's pockets.<br>
<br>
Then there's this wonderful and oh-so unconstitutional RAVE Act that he's pushing forward! Oh this is beautiful! It states that law enforcement may criminally prosecute business owners and promoters who control or manage a facility &quot;for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance&quot;.   Now, this would be GREAT for controlling things like Crackhouses, or other drug-dealing houses, to help abused children, but He's been having his officials cite the RAVE act to shut down promotional concerts and perfectly legal gatherings!  First amendment, anyone? <br>
<br>
Recently, he used it to pre-emptively shut down a scheduled benefit concert for the local student affiliate of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and Students for Sensible Drug Policy, because you know they were doing huge harm!  When is the ACLU going to try and shut this stupid act down?  Or, will Ashcroft shut them down now, too?<br>
<br>
Government officials try to make him a GOD, they put him on this pedestal for &quot;fighting drugs&quot;... when in actuality he's not doing anything.  Even if he were to block 100000 pounds of marijuana from coming into the US every day (which, if i'm correct, he doesn't even come CLOSE to),  he still wouldn't have corrected, or even came close to solving the &quot;problems&quot; with marijuana.  <br>
<br>
If I'm correct, surveys HAVE been taken, and it IS easier for kids and adolescents to get Marijuana, than it is for them to get Alcohol and cigarettes (which I can attest for)... so what's the deal with keeping it under prohibition?  The reasons it was made illegal in the first place back in 1937 were ridiculous! Instead of promoting those old laws fueled by ignorance, greed, and blatent racism, why doesen't he use his brain for once?<br>
<br>
When is this going to stop?  When is Ashcroft going to stop imposing all these rules and regulations for something that's impossible to regulate?  When is he going to stop being such a bleeding-hearted fool? I mean, use common sense, the war on weed has failed, just as alcohol prohibition failed.  I don't promote drugs, but I think that these laws and mandatory minimums are ridiculous.  If you're going to use all this money, at least be successful, this has been the biggest SCREAMING evidence of failure, since the Vietnam War.<br>

<br>
&quot;In 1983, President Reagan declared the War on Drugs.  I should mention that, at the time, I fully supported that initiative.  But since then, that war has extracted larger and larger pieces of our federal, state and local budgets, without any measurable success.  Let me emphasize that last phrase - &quot;without any measurable success&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Since then, that war has almost single-handedly eroded our Constitutional Rights into oblivion.<br>
<br>
Since then, younger and younger children are being enticed into the drug culture.<br>
<br>
Since then, HIV and hepatitis infection through dirty needles is up.<br>
<br>
Since then drug arrests are up sharply.<br>
<br>
Since then, drug deaths are up.<br>
<br>
Since then, drug related murders are up sharply.<br>
<br>
Since then, tens of millions of citizens have had their right to vote systematically revoked for non-violent convictions on possession of as little as one joint of marijuana.<br>
<br>
Since then, our prison population has reached world record levels&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and:<br>
<br>
&quot;OK.  I admit that there are those who would disagree with that last statement.  Actually, I'm sure that many in government would consider that some of those statistics do represent success.  After all, creating millions of felons out of otherwise law-abiding citizens, reduces the number of eligible voters that a politician has to please in order to get re-elected.  Remember that a citizen loses his right to vote upon any felony conviction, even a non-violent act like possession of a marijuana joint or an unlicensed firearm, that only carries a probation sentence.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John Aschroft is just carrying on the legacy of these fine...uhm...'successes'. <br>
<br>
<br>
And now that 'drugs support terrorism' and 'downloading illegal mp3s supports terrorism' Im sure we will all be in jail in no time and the streets will be safe at last!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The war was never lost in the 80s and 90s.  Nope.  Even the Clinton administration handled it exceptionally well!  Really!<br>

It's like telling saying Nixon lost Vietnam without even mentioning LBJ. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Wonder what would happen.....<br>
<br>
....if all (well, at least most) drugs were made legal overnight....<br>
<br>
….prices for narcotics would drop to a fraction of their current costs….<br>
<br>
.…the harmless potheads would sit in their mom’s basement and get fat….<br>
<br>
…the dope fiends would OD or be locked up for good after driving through a little-league parade….<br>
<br>
….all the money spent on prevention could go to education, fighting disease, and on little-leage parades.<br>
<br>
….bear in mind though, Americans spend over $60 billion a year to purchase illegal drugs….<br>
<br>
….do the math however it suits you, but a lot of criminals would be looking for “jobs”….<br>
<br>
….wonder what would happen. <br>

The reason drugs aren't legalized? Who do you think runs a lot of the drug trade? The CIA and other govenment agencies. The &quot;War&quot; on drugs is laughable and an excuse to keep the american public distracted. Why they fail to mention is that drugs can be legalized and people can still make responsible decisions to not take them. Legalize them and then continue the campaign against drug use. Just like they have done with alcohol. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23503" target="top">Cerranshaun Lightbringer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Yes.  I know people who all sorts of shit for the hell of it, who won't touch an illegal drug simply for that reason.<br>
<br>
And we lost vietnam ot public opinion, especially due to policies about the war started by LBJ.  We were already in deep when it came to Nixon.  Blaming Vietnam on him would be stupid.  Likewise, blaming a failed drug war on Ashcroft is stupid.  The point I'm trying to make isn't about Vietnam.  It's nothing more than a partially similar analogy. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If they legalized pot, seriously, not only would that group quit, our economy would take a nice shot upwords, if the government taxxed it.<br>

Now, I'm not a big fan of potsmokers, I'll admit.  I know one guy, who was in my school group, and he was a fucking genious.  But he flunked out, because he didn't care enough, and yeah, he smoked pot, and I know not all are that bad, but the thought has always left a sour taste in my mouth.<br>

What planet are you on? People can't make responsible decisions not to use it when it's against the law, what makes you think removing restrictions on it will suddenly cause people to act responsibly and intelligently? Pot doesn't exactly promote clarity of thought. Besides, alcohol is legal, and every day people fail to act responsibly with their drinking habits. Think about this; all the people who drive drunk, all the alcoholics who drink every day...how much easier it would be to just smoke one little joint while you're heading out on the road instead of having to down a pint of vodka to get blitzed...and there's no roadside breathalizer test for marijuana. Don't kid yourselves thinking that marijuana is just harmless. Train wrecks have been caused because the conductor was high. It may not be devastating to your system like &quot;hard&quot; drugs, although they are still undecided about it's long-term effects, but the fact is that anything that impairs your judgement is potentially dangerous to everyone else around you. So for those of you who want pot legalized and made available to the general public, I'll let you drive on the road with all the people who decide to get a little buzz going on their way to work to make the day go by a little easier. Not really something you can do with alcohol very easily, but with legalized pot readily available for purchase at your local 7-11, getting around on the highways should be a real adventure.<br>
<br>
BTW Multanis, the government's drug enforcement policies have been in place for decades, and Ashcroft's job is to enforce them, not to scrap them because some people think giving up drug enforcement is the right thing to do. So basically, you're ripping on Ashcroft for doing the job that he was hired to do, as if he had the choice to do anything else.  That's pretty dumb. <p>Jangral<br>
