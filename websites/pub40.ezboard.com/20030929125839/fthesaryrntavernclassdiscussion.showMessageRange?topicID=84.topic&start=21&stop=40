Ok alot of people saying have alot of mana helps and I aggree or dissagree with that.<br>
Whether you have 1000 mana or 3000 mana you still gain it back a X per tick. Lets say x is = to 10. That means it takes 100 ticks to be FM with 1000mana or 300 ticks with 3000 mana. That means that if you are NEVER FoM your doing just as well with 1000 mana as someone with 3000 mana. Now if you are FoM you aren't burning mana fast enough.<br>
<br>
The truth is in any sustained killing enviroment having more mana means shit if you keep yourself from going FoM. Someone with 1000 mana can do JUST as good a job as someone with 3000. <p>Zurrin Zypher <BR>

Some Necros around 50 Some Necro don't even use heart flutter line anymore though they do use ignite blood at times.  Now, in a group with SK/Necro and no ranger/drood, the necro rarely wants the snare duty since darkness line is a MEGA taunt, yes, bigger than drood/ranger snare cuz it does significantly more damage although shorter in duration.  Other uses for mana in group includes draining hp like a vampire when healer is LOM or OOM, draining AC/Attack for some nice boost or to get that ex-mezzed/chamred mob who won't get off the chanter etc.  All in all, just because your parent class is in the group, it doesn't mean your spells are useless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukrazaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/23/01 10:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tiac.net/users/eswimm/Krazaak.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Take on Shadow Knights</span><hr size=1> You've got to take into account two different scenarios when you discuss SKs, grouped and solo.<br>
<br>
When grouped, your primary concern is AC and damage output.  Stats are nice, but they don't have much impact, even STR.  INT isn't terribly important either, because as mentioned above, mana regen is static and you won't want to be going OOM because of the increased downtime.  Most of your casting will be debuffs and the occasional lifetap to keep your health topped off.<br>
<br>
When solo, you need to find a good balance of AC, damage, and mana.  The level of the MOB you can take down is directly related to how much mana you have (how long you can keep it feared and darked) and how fast you can do damage.  If you are going for efficiency, then you'll need to find your own balance.  As a Troll, I have such a high regen, that I typically forego a fear or two and do some tanking.  With a high AC, I take minimal damage and regenerate the health while I'm medding.  The most efficient way for me to end a fight is down 30% HP and 40% mana, since they'll both hit full at about the same time.  At 51st, I've got 2100 HP, 1500+ MANA and a 926 self-buffed AC.  <br>
<br>
Don't underestimate natural regen at high levels.  If I'm not the puller, I'm getting back 12 HP per tick sitting, before any spells.  I generally also drop a Life Leech every other fight, and a few procs of Vampiric Embrace as well.  If I'm not the primary tank, my own lifetaps and regen mean I don't need heals, even if I take 500 or so damage per fight.  It also comes in handy to regen 6 per tick while feigned. <p>Krazaak Crushbone<BR>

aside from that, everything lothe said is true, Garbhad your sk is twinked thats all, you are soloing the same stuff at the same level i was when i wore leather and banded armor. and to the person that said your  mana would actually make a difference? only when grouped but the level 50+ game we all know is far more different than dervs in sro.  heres the thing - MR mobs, your lifetaps dont do jack, neither do your shadow vortex etc. that means all that precious mana you have is nothing. when i fight MR epic mobs i always die FOM, my spells do nothing against them. in those encounters you need pure melee, thats where ogres and trolls have the huge advantage. also at only level 12ish you havent experienced the damage cap really. as you level more, to say 30, if you still do 40ish damage with your 2h weapon thats really weak. post 20 is when you will realize how much more damage a troll/ogre will do.<br>
but like everyone else says, just play the race you like, when erudites sks first came out i thought that was a good idea, nice high int, sure they might suck at melee, but so what. making an erudite sk is like making  a human ench, definitely not the best race/class combo but it doesnt matter if you have fun, feel unique and most importantly LEVEL.<br>

Of course our spells are useless when it comes to uber mob encounters.  Hell, technically, the SK class is one of the least desired class for one of them uber mob fights.  However, in terms of the day to day exp hunting groups, I find mana useful although I'm never even near FOM unless there's C2 or mana song.  I guess it also depends on where you fight.  If you're inside dungeons, you'll use less mana because you don't need to use fear, the highest level darkness spell.. etc.  I found that the only spells I use in dungeons are lifetap once in a while, vortex/shroud and snare.  Outdoors you need to fear kite, DoTing, lifetapping for heals.. etc, so mana does make a difference.  Everyone knows SKs are barely useful in ubermob encounters unless you've got CoF or CoCW and even then, we're only marginally useful.  What matters to the SK class is our day to day function inside a group and yes, I still think mana plays a key role especially if you're main tank.  Think of it, chain casting Shadow Vortex is a quick way of building up massive aggro and keeping the mob on you instead of having that same mob pummeling the clerics/chanter while waiting for the Warriors to taunt them of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usoulstarl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulstar L</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/8/01 4:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> SK's</span><hr size=1> Hey you punklins u keep yappin bout ogres 'n trolls 'n DE's 'n even erudites but noone has said a damn thing about IKSAR!  (or humans but every1 knows human sk's are crap =P)<br>
<br>
Iksar have a pretty decent int (i have 90 base? i think) and a fair str as well (90)?<br>
<br>
At lvl 42 my str is 158 self buffed easily 190sum w/ a drood or sham in group, and int is 111.  My damage output is prettymuch the same as a ogre or troll sk's.  Iksar make great SK's because we're naturally the most evil bastard race in norrath and b/c we're also the coolest lookin =) w/ second to DE's prolly.  My AC is a lil on the low side b/c of the plate issue but that's all changing as i aquire new velious stuff.  It's about 850-900 i think.  HP's are around 1500, which is prolly a couple hundred less than a comparable troll or ogre but in a group that hardly matters.  The only situation where hp's matter is when you have max and when you have none, all the time in between it's all about AC and dex/agi.  Of course mana doesn't matter that much either =) since when i'm in a group and i'm not the puller i'm FOM 90% of the time.  At 42 i don't even keep Lifedraw memm'd as it only does 45 hp for 1/3 a bub or so, not that useful since 45 hp is less than one hit.<br>
here's my spell lineup:<br>
1. Grim aura (utility slot for pet buff, lifetap if no healer around, heat blood mebbe)<br>
2. siphon str<br>
3. shadow vortex<br>
4. shroud of hate<br>
5. engulfing darkness<br>
6. fear (also a utility slot sometimes)<br>
7. feign death (always have that memm'd!)<br>
8. vampiric embrace (more efficient than lifetaps if you get at least 3 procs a casting)<br>
what's the spell lineup of other sk's running off the 39 spells and under? just curious.<br>

Ogre and Troll already has a high starting Strength so it's easier for they to get up to 170+ str as they get higher in level.  I play a DE SK and my starting str is 90, after points modifier and all that.  Right now, I have 150 str self buffed and frankly, I notice very little difference between 150 and when I get buffed to 200.  On average, I hit about 3 to 4 points more using a moss and my max damage went up from 80ish to about 88ish.  Big whoopie.  Let's say you swing 40 times per fight and 30 of those lands on a mob, if that much, you'll get a grand total of 90-120 more damage per fight.  Is that worth blowing all that money trying to get your str as high as possible?  No, not really.  I'd rather spend the insane amount of cash you'll be using on high end str items on high end haste items.  For Rogues, Monks, Warriors and Rangers, str is a worthwhile stat because they get duel wield, therefore swinging a whole lot more per fight.  Not to mention the backstab, flying kick str modifiers for rogues and monks but as for SKs, IMO, it's just not worth it.  I find that 140-150 str is fine for any non-Ogre/Troll SK and my main focus now when it comes to upgrading my gear is Sta and +HP gear, not str. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/urrumncokke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rrum Ncokke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/9/01 8:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Take on Shadow Knights</span><hr size=1> Troll SK's are the best....They got the balance of STR and STA, INT isnt bad but SK's dont need to use much mana, but if its your thing get yourself some sintient and your set, im only lvl 38, regen has probably made all the difference in my experiance, it makes a &quot;defensive hybrid&quot; useful and well trolls got the best Regen, and that type of regen particularly mixed with that fungi tunic in the first post would make you have almost no downtime with a life tap or two thrown in...admittedly there is a downside the EXP penalty...although it is difficult at times the exp penalty dosent effect the ability of the class/race combo to be played, moreover the exp penalty is negligible when grouped which you will end up doing as you increase in lvl.

A SK without spells is basically a warrior with HT and less hps. The dual wield factor will more than make up for not having HT and you will have many more hps. Basically though it all comes down to what Nabum said. Play whatever class/race combo you like, its all up to personal taste really, although people sometimes feel the need to burn others for their decision on what to play. I say just ignore them and have fun. <p><html><body><font face="creeper" color=990066 size=3><b>Samhaine Helsnicht</b><br>Innoruuk's Chosen<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udaclifster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaClifster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/4/01 3:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Take on Shadow Knights</span><hr size=1> Actually, If I knew then what I know now....<br>
<br>
Alot of good points brought up but, I think if I had it to do over again, I woulda went with an Ogre or Troll SK.. At the time I made my Human SK it was because I didn't see many of them around... I shoulda read up a bit more.. because post level 50, that int isnt going to do you squat on the Uber mobs...(ever try lifetapping Naggy?? not only is it resisted like your HT.... ROFL good way to get on top of the hate list) <br>
<br>
I really think the SK should be played almost in a warrior frame of mind.. hence STR and STA are key. An SK is NOT a main tank, we are damage dealers.. we are most effective when we have time to debuff, and help keep the mob off the casters.<br>
<br>
We just had a Ogre SK win the BOTB.. nuf said. That competiton came down to pure melee. (an please dont say the epic did it all.. alot of the SKs had Epics)<br>

Ogres and trolls can have 50 str more than others but this not makes the diference. Large races have more hitpoints, lets say a 60 sk def with same equipment of a lvl 60 sk ogre, the ogre have around 350 hp more. But the small races have more mana so that means a lvl 60 dark elf have around 200 mana more ( 200 mana used with lvl 60 drain spell). So all races all good, just choose the one most you like. I Think they are all balanced.<br>
Btw what can i say about BASH skill, ALL ogres/troll that i know they change his image for ilusion def or skeleton so bash result nerfed.<br>

I have played both Ogre and Dark Elf Warriors... I got the ogre to about lvl 20 and started my DE, and I immediately liked my DE better. No offense to ogres but I almost never got that annoying MISS crap anymore. Now, although this isnt SK I DO have something to say about strength... My Ogre had 165 Str and when he swung a Lamentation he did anywhere from MISS to 17-40 dmg, sometimes getting unlucky and hitting below 10, as happens sometimes. Now, my DE has 118 STR, and when he swings his Lammy he does 15-37 dmg, also hitting low occasisonally, and missing, although not nearly as much as an Ogre. Seeing this info, I frankly don't care AS much about STR. It just doesnt affect you THAT hugely.<br>
Now, I am not saying who is the superior Warrior, I don't beleive there is such a thing. I play a DE because they look damn cool and I like their character more than a fat ugly gray thing that needs shrink every time he enters a dungeon.<br>
I have only 1 more thing to say... play the class you enjoy ! Not because of stats ! Thats not what this game is about, and besides your equipment matters more than your stats anyway, and if you are on a high lvl raid your str is gonna be max or close to it anyway...<br>

To all the people that told me that (anyone remember Maggot?), thank you! I love being a Troll SK, pulling shit, regening feigned while pulling mobs away from camp, regening while medding, powerleveling friend, family, secondaries (uber taunt spells, and ghetto heal works quite nicely at low levels with regen, your HP never goes down), and the BIG HITS. I love hitting 279 with the tantors tusk...it outdamages any weapon I have so far...<br>
<br>
Strength and Dex I love...<br>
yeah i have prolly the WORST int of any SK on the server..but so what when your grouped with an enc and have c2 anyway? your mana never gets low.<br>

Troll or Ogre Sk is the best.<br>
<br>
Iksar seem nice at first blush but the &quot;no plate&quot; situation is a big downer especially working through the mid-40's and lower 50's.  If they can get past that hurdle most of the vellious gear seems to be ok for them however.<br>
<br>
I still vote Troll as my number 1 choice for an SK, Ogre being a very close (nearly tied) 2nd. <p><TABLE Width=580 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

<br>
I'm at 220 unbuffed STR without focusing on STR gear and without having put any points into it.  I hit near max STR with a frost giant beard, let alone with a Shaman buff.<br>
<br>
Troll or Ogre SK should put starting points into INT if they plan to solo alot or STA if they don't.<br>
<br>
Max epic hit is 217 damage with max STR, 211 with my unbuffed STR, but my average parsed damage doesn't change by more than 5-10 damage per minute with max STR.<br>
<br>
Ogre makes the best tanking SK, but even they can't stand up to major tanking in the high level game.<br>
<br>
Troll makes the second best tanking SK and the best soloer, straight up to 60th.  The added regen really helps.<br>
<br>
Iksar makes a good soloer and sports the higher AC once they get into planar gear.  Starting with Fear Plane armor, their armor is as good or better than the other races.<br>
<br>
Heck, now at 56th, I can handle all of SS [Sol B] and the surrounding LDCs solo as fast as they can spawn.  It takes a really incredible group to get my exp faster than I can solo it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=84.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=84.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=84.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=84.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=84.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=40><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.threadControl?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion>Class Discussion</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
