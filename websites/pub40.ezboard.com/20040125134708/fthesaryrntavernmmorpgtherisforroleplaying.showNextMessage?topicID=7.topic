Just after I graduated from the Qeynos University, I was approached by the Highmen of Halas to bring our people into the diplomatic circle of Antonica.   My Father and mother were disappointed that I held no interest in becoming a holyman as they had.  But they were encouraged that I wished to become a scholar.  Before the unbalance of the powers, and the current war, Antonica was a peaceful continent.  The only real trouble came from occasional Orc raids from the Deserts of Ro.   The Icy Orc clan had not emerged as yet.  The High King sat on the Throne in High Keep.  It was a golden time of Scholars, and commerce.  There were some rumors of plots, and an emergence of the long extinct Dark Elves, but everyone of education (myself included) dismissed these prophecy's, and their prophets as the ramblings of the ignorant. It was my first year in the Newly formed Halas Diplomatic Corps, and I was still green, and wet behind my ears.  It was my first trip to Freeport, and I was excited.  I had heard that the port city on the eastern sea was an amazing place.  I had heard of the Elves, with their art, and poetry.  I had heard of the fine dwarven weapons, and armor.  I read stories of the Paladins of Mar, as well as the deeds of the Steel Warriors.  And I also read about the beauty of the Women.  Freeport then wasn't the cesspit that it is now.  It was the hub of trade for Antonica.  Eurdite Caravans would leave daily from Qeynos in route to Freeport to trade with the Elven, Gnomish and Dwarven artisans.  These caravans where rarely harassed due to the many Barbarian Mercenaries that the Merchants would hire for the trade routes.  Not to mention the still capable Armies of Antonica, and Karana that ranged the plains, and trade routes.  All this would change however.  <br>
  It was during this trip that I first met a Halfling.  I was amazed at their smallness.  When I first encountered the little person, I was in Highhold keep attending a political function. The King was an arrogant bastard I thought.  He was so sure of the security of his hold that he was not even willing to see the trade delegation from Halas.  Since Halas is so remote, we don't have much in the way of trade.  Oh we do a fair trade with Qeynos, and the Glade, but when it came to Euriden, and Freeport.  We didn't have anything to sell accept for troops.  So we of Halas have become a race of Warriors, and mercenary's.  In those times of peace our economy was in need of renewal, and fast.  The people of Halas were not starving yet.  Nor did we have beggars in the streets. (Not a trade encouraged in Halas)  The Elders knew that in order for the Wolves of the North to thrive in the newworld, there must be trade other then Mercenaries.<br>
 The dinner party had become boring at best, and I ventured into the pass to sit near the sparkling lake not far from the keep.  I was thinking of the young human woman I met at school.  We would often go walking in Qeynos hills before dawn do discuss poetry, nature, and music.  All things that I wasn't very interested in at the time.  Well, all except for poetry.   I knew poetry was the way to a woman's heart.  And my being a young Barbarian at a human collage I found it to my advantage to learn all I could on the subject. It turned out; I had a knack for it.  So this young Noblewoman found my company entertaining.  Or so I told myself at the time. It turned out to be me who was smitten though.<br>
<br>
   Arianna Q'Tonoth was a black haired minx as her father described her.  She had already turned down just about the entire Guard force of Qeynos of various marriage proposals, and was now working her way through the ranks of the collage of Qeynos.  Until she met the hulking man from Halas, she never felt intimidation from men.  She studied the arcane arts, and was from a long, line of wealthy Wizards, and Enchanters.  So she normally let a man carry on for a while, then dispose of them.  Men knew better then to attempt to force their way on a wizard.  <br>
  Gavin was smitten with her from the first.  He had his choice of the women at school, but Arianna's fire attracted him.  She was outspoken, and didn't play the usual girl games of subtle hints, and teases.  She just walked up to the giant, and said: &quot; Well, are you going to ask me for a walk, or not?&quot;  <br>
Gavin for the first time in his life didn't have a thing to say.  He looked at her, and just held out his arm.  That was the first evening that the couple strolled into the hills along the Western Sea.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hey, whatcha doing Mister?&quot; came a high child like voice from Gavin's left.  He stood up from his position on the ledge of the falls, and looked around.  He didn't see anyone, so he sat back down, thinking he heard an echo.  Then there was a tug on his sleeve, and he looked to his right, there she was.  I thought that this person was a child, she was so small, so I said.  <br>
&quot;Good evening child, why has your parents let a bundle like you get so far from home?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey, I am no child Barb Brain, I am a Halfling.  The master race of all Norath.&quot;  With that she scampered off on her little feet, and was gone. Or so I thought.  I stood up, and went to the inn at the base of the falls, and decided it was time for an Ale.  As I entered the tavern I noticed that I had been robbed.  There was nothing I could do about it now, so I turned back to the rooms I shared with the rest of the delegation in the Keep.  As I was walking this pocket thief scampered up to me again.  She ran past me, and stopped just ahead on the path and held my change purse in her hand.  With a little impish grin, and the twinkle of mirth in her eye she said; &quot;Here's your purse barb brain.  You should carry gems instead of those Qeynos coppers.  How is a girl supposed ta earn a livin?&quot;  With that she tossed my purse to my feet, and ran off again.  I could not bring myself to call the constable; as a matter of fact the whole event had me so amused, that I began staggering in gales of laughter.  Once again the little bundle accosted me while I was leaning on a wall trying to regain my composer.  &quot;What's so funny ya big oaf?  You'll be causing an avalanche with all that racket.&quot;<br>
  I could not reply. I was so caught up in my laughter that I just sat down, and offered the little thief a swig of my flask.  She accepted it, and sat down before me just out of reach.  She took a long pull from the flask, and smacked her lips, and stood up again.  &quot;I am Shalia, since you have made it impossible for me to work tonight, you could at least let me know your name.&quot;<br>
I finally recovered enough to respond from my laughter to respond.  I stood up, and bowed with a flourish to the little woman; which caused her to jump back a ways.  <br>
&quot;I am Gavin Macalaister of the Clan Macalister at your service my lady.&quot;<br>
Now it was the Halfling's turn to laugh.  I was a bit taken aback at the intensity of this small person's mirth since I was being formal.  I should have known from my studies that halflings took almost nothing seriously.  But me being the young barbarian fresh from the Qeynos University, I forgot to take this into account.  Which of course caused my small friend to roll around on the ground before me in gales of laughter.  The more embarrassed I became, the more she laughed.  If ever you find yourself becoming big headed.  I suggest a trip to Rivervale to regain your humility.  Well, once Shalia composed herself, she told me that no one; much less a barbarian from Halas had ever bowed to her.  She removed a loaf of black bread from her pack, and offered me a piece.  Which was also a lesson I should have studied more closely.  It seems that in Halfling society if a woman offer's a man her bread….Well, I will let you guess the rest.  To make a long story short.  I was able to back out of an awkward situation stating that I was betrothed and to ignorance of the ways of the vale.  However she insisted that she would accompany me in my travels for a time until she got bored.  If I knew what I know now, I would have called the guard on the spot. That little woman caused the majority of my gray hair I believe, well, Her, and Ardin.  <br>
  We finished our late night snack, and headed back to my rooms.  I awoke in the morning to the laughter of my traveling companions.  It appeared that my newfound friend had snuggled up to me in my sleep, and my fellow delegates found the picture hysterical. Well, Shalia not to be out done hopped from the bunk (fully clothed) and stated that the night was much to her liking.  After a great many comments on how good it must feel to have been able to please the &quot;insatiable appetite of a Halfling&quot; my companions began to pack for the second leg of our journey.  <br>
  Personally I was relieved to be on my way.  The aloofness of the High court to the Halas trade delegation was still on our minds as we descended into the Kithicor Forest.  Our caravan wound its way through the forest with little incident.   Our new escort lead by the Freeport Militia, had consisted of 2 troops of Cavalry, in addition to our already sizable contingent of Halas Mercenaries seemed to be enough to discourage the Sharlok Orcs that had been more active in the forest lately.<br>
  My newfound friend chattered her way into the hearts of all around her as we traveled.  She rode most of the way on my shoulders, and annoyed me by telling everyone that I was her hired manservant.  This of course made her the talk of the caravan, and me the laughing stock.  Considering that she was not only a woman, but a Halfling there was no way for me to rid myself of this new burden, and maintain face so I resided to endure this inconvenience. <br>
  By evening we had made our way to the western portion of the Freeport commons, and set up our camp for the night.  The Militia scouts reported that there had been a raid the day before by some unknown assailants on the commons, and suggested that we post a double guard for the night.  Since the Mercs were tired after the long journey, the Halas delegation chipped in on the duties.  I awoke that night to Shalia jabbering about something happening outside the large tent we shared with the rest of the delegation, and I should arm myself.  I could hear shouting, and the sound of people running.  I pulled on my leather traveling tunic, and armed myself with my sword.  Just as I was about to exit the tent one of the Halas mercenaries burst through, and shouted &quot;Raid!&quot; and ran out again.  I followed, and discovered that there were torches lining the hilltop above our camp.  There must have been hundreds of them.  Shalia hoisted herself to her favorite perch on my shoulders, and whistled.  &quot;I guess I should have headed back to the vale when I had a chance.  Those are dervish cut throats up there. And lots of them.&quot;  I also noticed that our militia escort was no were to be found......<br>
<br>
More to come.  <br>

Came the shout above the dinof upcoming battle.  Warriors scrambled to their assigned placesamong the ranks.  The Barbarian mercenaries were well-trainedin battle,  we have trained all our lives for these moments.The Erudite spell casters perched them selves on barrels, andcarts behind the ranks of massive warriors, and prepared chants,and incantations.  To my surprise my new found friend nudgedmy left knee, and smiled up at me as I took my place with therest of the delegation in the rear ranks of our little host.The warriors prepared them selves with our traditional war paint,as shaman trooped the ranks chanting blessings from the Tribunal.The devout kneeled before the shaman, and accepted their blessings.<br>
  On the hill before us the bandit host prepared it self,and worked their way into a frenzy for the first charge.  Withno sign of the Militia the host charged.  With torches blazing,and glinting from tattered armor, and weapons of all types themulti raced bandits came.  The first few of them were felledhandily by the lead ranks of the Barbarians, as we returned theirwar cries with that of our own.  The blood in my veins boiled,and I was eager for the first bit of flesh upon my sword.  Theranks before me held however, and bandits retreated to regroup.The casters blasted many among the ranks of the bandits as theyretreated, and others were frozen in their tracks.  My countrymendidn't allow these later souls to escape, and demonstrated thewarrior code of our homeland by giving them a quick death.  TheBandits reformed on the hill once more.  This time however wecould hear the horns of cavalry to our left flank, and I couldsee the plumed helmets of Militia approaching at a charge.  Therewas something wrong I noticed.  While the Eurdines prepared towelcome the oncoming cavalry, we of the infantry ranks couldsee that this charge was for real, and aimed at us.  <br>
 &quot;FORM BLOCKS TO THE LEFT!!!&quot;  came the bellow of the MercenaryCaptain.  The disciplined Mercs scattered, and reformed in theclassic block formations to repel the cavalry charge.  The Northmen worked with the skilled precision of the warrior race thatwe are.  We formed the blocks in mere seconds, and just in timeto engage the Militia charge.  The cavalry fell on us with acrash of steal, and the screaming of war horses.  The outwardranks lowered spears, lances, and long swords that caused someof the horses to shy away.  The few that did not impaled themselveson the steal of Halas.  The riders could not offer resistanceafter being unhorsed, and were quickly dispatched by the Northmen.  Once the cavalry commander realized that he was dealingwith trained professionals and not a mere rag tag guard madeup of simple street thugs he called in his troopers to regroup.The Cavalry then rode to the hill were the Bandits surveyed thebattle, and it became obvious that the 2 units were going toattempt a combined effort this time.  The merc captain shoutedout yet another formation, and the north men scurried to formranks facing the enemy again.  The bandits once again workedtheir way into a frenzy on the hill by shouting insults, andhowling screams at the awaiting mercenaries.  A massive orc movedto the front of their mob, and hurled a spear at the front ranksas the mob came charging down the hill.  The Eurdines among theranks of the North men began to cast their spells of destruction.Shalia climbed down from my shoulders, and disappeared, or atleast so I thought.  I had no time to look for her since justthen the cavalry charged as well.  The forward ranks engagedthe bandits with yet another crash, and the blood curdling howlsof the Halas battle cry.  The cavalry hit our right flank thistime, and I knew that I would finally blood my sword.  The northmen on the right flank turned to the cavalry, but the forwardranks were swept under the charge, but not before slowing themso that we of the center could counter with a charge of our own.We surged forward unhorsing, and slashing our way through theMilitia cavalry as fast as possible.  The men of this light horseunit had misjudged the men of Halas for the their last time.As we moved through them I was pleased to feel my sword strikemy enemies in battle.  I don't know if it's in our blood, nordo I imagine that I am a warrior at heart, but there is somethingabout battle that makes a man feel more alive, and the surgewas within me.  I felled foe after foe, and my sword arm felttireless.  My comrades, and I surged through the petered chargewith the fury of the Tribunal.  Once again the cavalry commanderrealized his mistake, but this time it was to late.  We of thenorth fell on his troopers with no mercy.  I had no time to lookto my left to see how the forward ranks were dealing with thebandit infantry.  But from the screams, and explosions comingfrom that area, I could sense that the forward ranks were holding.<br>
  Finally my little companion made her appearance.  Justas I thought to have finally engaged a foe worthy of me, sheappeared behind the Hulking Ogre that I was engaged with.  Islammed the foul beast with all my might, but the creature onlygrinned at me, and delivered a blow that shattered my alreadytattered shield.  I was able to parry his next attack, and counterwith a slash across his midsection.  To my surprise the massivecreature only laughed at me again, and struck me with a blowto my right shoulder that brought me to my knees.  Just thenShalia screamed, and jammed her daggers into the back of theOgre.  With a surprised look, he turned to face his new enemy.I can't remember much about what happened next, but my comradestold me later that I went into some sort of rage.  I guess Ipicked up a sword from the ground, and began cutting my way intothe bandits, and Militia with the blood fury that is known toour kind.  The shaman called it the divine will of the Tribunal,while others called it beserker rage.  It's happened to me sinceon many occasions but I still can't say that I understand it.The Ogre was a distant memory that faded into a melange of battlescenes running their way through my mind that night.  I rememberShalia shouting at me, and I also remember a Shaman waving ahand above me.  But there isn't much more.<br>
  I regained mysenses sometime close to dawn, and was surprised to find thatI was no where near our camp.  I stood up, and winced at thepain of my wounds.  I looked my self over, and I could see thatsomeone had taken the time to set bandages on the worst of mywounds.  My shoulder was in a sling, and my armor in ruins, andcovered in dried blood.  I was a mess.  I noticed that therewere several other warriors, and trade delegates sleeping nearwhere I awoke.  I noticed that these men were also wounded insome cases it appeared to be mortally.  There was a female shamanmoving among the wounded, and with her was a wood elf girl ofstunning beauty.  She was playing a loot, and it seemed thatjust the sound o her music was healing the wounded.  Just asI was about to introduce my self, I felt a tug on my kilt.  <br>
&quot;Hey!, it's about time you woke up you oversized fruitcake&quot;  I looked down to see Shalia standing to my right posedin a stern stance with her hands balled in fists at her hips.I smiled at the sight since she reminded me of spoiled girl thathad been denied an expensive doll.  <br>
&quot;Just what areyou smiling at Barb Brain!?!.  I suggest you sit your big buttdown before I take a bite out of your knee!.   You scared mehalf to death with your shenanigans last night, and I am notabout to let you go opening those wounds again after it tookme so long to bandage you up.  NOW SIT!&quot;  I looked at mysmall friend, and was surprised to see that she was on the vergeof tears.  &quot;I think she means it brother.&quot; Came a voicefrom my left.  I looked to see an older north man laying on amat to my left.  He was wounded severely, but he looked at mewith the eyes of a man content with himself.  He spoke again.<br>
&quot;Lad, you almost got yourself killed last night withthat rage you went into.  That little one there saved your life.I suggest you listen to her.&quot;  I sat once more with my backto the tree.  Shalia made a &quot;humph&quot; sound, and scamperedover to where the Shaman, and bards were healing the wounded,and comforting those that have reached the end of their journey.The old warrior turned his head to me, and smiled.  <br>
&quot;I seen you last night lad.  You have the fire.  But you haveto learn to control it.  After you felled the bandit commanderyou ran off after the retreating Bandits.  If it were not foryour little friend convincing a Shaman to root you, you wouldbe the main course on an Orc fire right now.&quot;  I lookedback at the old veteran.  &quot;I don't remember older brother,I blacked out after that Ogre struck me with his war hammer.&quot;  I told the veteran.  &quot;Well Lad, you can probablyexpect to be recognized for your stupidity since you are theone that killed the bandit Commander.  But remember you had alot of help from that little thief friend of yours over there.So don't go and get a big head.  You need a great deal of training.Last night you got lucky.  I suggest that you get your ugly arseback to Halas post haste.&quot;  I was both shocked, and stungby the veteran's words.  I knew that I carried my clan name withhonor during the night, but I had no idea that my rage almostgot me killed, nor did I know that the Ogre I was engaged withwas the Bandit commander.<br>
Hell, at that point, I still wasn't sure if we had carried the day or not.  I look again to theold warrior to tell him that I was not in fact a warrior by trade,but he had died.  I look at his remains for over an hour beforeShalia returned, and covered the veteran's face.  She lookedtired, and very sad.  It was getting on in the day, and the sunwas getting close to noon.  &quot;Gavin, we have to get movingsoon or we will not make the city before night fall.&quot;  Ilooked at Shalia in shock.  &quot;City?!  We were just attackedby the city militia, what makes you think I am going on to thatcity?&quot; Shalia looked again into my eyes, and said &quot;Gavin, those were not the true militia.  Our real escort wasfound dead by some scouts of  Tunare this morning while you weresleeping.   They were all found with their throats cut, and strippednaked.  The bandits came from the deserts, and ambushed themin their camp before they ever linked up with the Caravan.&quot;As she finished, several carts were pulled to up to our littleaid station by a group of peasants.  The Shaman, with the helpof a few bards, and some of the walking wounded started to placethe worst off of us into the carts for the journey to Freeport.My original excitement about this journey was all but gone. Now I only wished for the warm embrace of Arianna, and sweetmusic of Qeynos……<br>

Our weary band made it's way toward the city with a mixture of relief, and of loathing.  Although we knew that the Militiamen that attacked our Caravan were frauds, we still could see the Plumed Helmeted Troopers of the Freeport Cavalry charging in our minds.  The darkness of the night will never fade in my memory.  I suppose that is because that was my first real battle.  Oh I had been in many tournaments in Halas, and in Qeynos, and I often won. But this was unlike any tournament.  This was a desperate struggle for survival.  one that we won.  We received the happy news that morning just as we finished loading the wagons, and carts that were sent to us by the headmen of the Caravan.  The message was simple, and by word of mouth.  <br>
&quot;Thank you, brave men of Halas.&quot;<br>
  To this warrior, would be diplomat.  That is thanks enough.  But that would not be the case.  Once the Halas trade delegation, and the Merchants for the caravan heard that the carts of wounded were approaching the city, a party of warriors, and healers were sent to escort the little wagon train through the city to the fair.  Shalia whistled as I was met with a flourish of salutes, and bows from the members of the Steel Warriors, and of the Wolves of the North that met our party.  Apparently there was a bit of over celebration, and exaggeration that went on once the Trains of the Caravan arrived in the city, and the tails were told in the Taverns, over tankards, and bottles.  My deeds were now of legend although slight in my memory.  My little friend, and I were brought before the elite of Freeport, and heralded as the Heroes that saved the western Caravan.  Shalia was not one to shy away from fame, and made sure that all there knew her role in the battle.  I thought it comical when she was approached by the little delegation from the Vail, and asked to tone it down a bit.  I think that was the only time I had ever seen her humbled.  <br>
I on the other hand was asked to do pretty much the opposite by my fellow delegates.  It seemed to them that I should not only be proud of my performance in my first battle, but that I should help our cause by boasting our prowess.  I found the boasting difficult.  I am not suited to it, and I also felt ashamed.  I knew that my role was minor at best during the battle.  I also knew that my comrades were stung that I, and not the Mercenary Captain was chosen to be the so called Hero.  But being men of Halas, they did not voice their disagreement openly.  Instead they talked among themselves about it. Soon, I was no longer welcome at the tables of the rank, and file among them.  This is what bothered me the most.  I am after all a simple man, and to be shunned by my fellows was severe punishment for someone else's idea of fame.  It was then that I decided that politics was not to my taste, and bid farewell to the trade delegation.  After spending a week in Freeport, I left my Inn in the middle of the night, and took ship to Feydwer.  I was paid handsomely for my part in the Caravan's defense, much to my surprise.  So I decided that I should take my studies to the City's of the Fey, Hammer, and Tinker's box.  I wrote Arianna a lengthily letter, bringing her up to date, as well introducing her to the rumors that I was sure she was hearing regarding my new traveling companion.  I also asked her to join me.  I knew that asking a woman to brave the wilds of Antonica would normally offend, and even cause some women to forget about you.  But this was Arianna.  She was a wizard of skill, not to mention a woman with more grit then most men that I have met.  She would be offended if I didn't ask. <br>
<br>
  I wasn't surprised to find out that Arianna had made it to Feydwer ahead of the ship, and was waiting for us in the Wood Elf City of Kelethin.  She wrote of a terrible war that was being fought there in the hills, and that of an Orc strong hold called Crushbone.  Shalia not being able to read hovered around me like a fly over a carcass.  She would not let me be until I finally read letter to her.  Arianna wrote of the regiments of Elves that left for the hills daily to engage the Orcish hordes.  She also wrote of a race long thought dead.  The Tear'Dal.  She wrote that the Tear'Dal Dark Elves had emerged from there subterranean strong holds, and were now making a move to retake their former homelands. <br>
  As Shalia and I traveled through the Butcher Block Mountains we could see the evidence of the war being fought in Greaterfeydark.  The dwarves were mobilizing, and there was much activity in the, and around Kaladim.  We arrived at the Dwarven strong hold on our second day in Feydwer, and we were welcomed heartily to my surprise.  The dwarves had hired two regiments of Barbarian Warriors, and were so pleased with their fighting prowess that even a man that was merely of the same race was welcomed into their homes with out question.  The city to me was very uncomfortable however.  Despite every attempt by our hosts to make it otherwise.   Everywhere I went in the stout home of the Dwarves, I had to duck, crawl, and crouch.  Needless to say, it was a humbling experience.  We stayed with the Dwarves for a few days, and then set out for Greaterfeydark dark in the wake of a departing Dwarven Infantry Regiment heading for the lines.  We followed along with the trains of the Regiment to their first rest stop some 15 miles out of Kaladim before the hearty warriors stopped for lunch.  I was impressed with the pace of the small warriors, they kept to a trot almost the entire distance, and I didn't hear one complaint from the line troops.  I thought this to be particularly impressive for all soldiers know that there is no such thing as a soldier that doesn't bitch about something.  But there was a quiet purpose to these small men of oak.  They knew what was to come.  The losses from the lines were heavy.  These men faced it with quiet determination, and a bravery that I have only seen in my homeland.  It was comforting to see this brother race of stout hearts, and it was a pleasure to travel with them.  <br>
  After lunch the Dwarves packed up their trains, and started out at a brisk trot east to the frontier.  Shalia, and I kept pace to along with them, and were asked to join the lead officers at the front of the column.  The Commander briefed us on what was to come at the border as we ran, and informed us that a large Orc raiding Party had flanked a Woodelf light infantry battalion, and was now at the outskirts of Butcherblock.  He, and his unit were on a mission to intercept them before they could get behind the Elven, and Dwarven lines and disrupt their supply trains.  He also told us a little of how the Orcs were never organized until this new offensive started last month.  Now the Orcs were well organized, and lead in a way that proved to the Dwarves, and Elves alike that there was a new leadership driving the Orcs, and this could only mean that the Dark Elves had finally returned.  I found this disturbing taken with what I read in Arianna's letter.  I had always thought that the Dark Elves were just creatures of fiction used to scare children with.  Now the evidence was clear.  They did exist, and they have now returned.  Arkis, the Dwarven Paladin in command of the Dwarven regiment ask us to reconnoiter for him during their next rest stop that evening.  Eager for something useful to do, and to help our new-found friends, we took up the mission and set out to the frontier.  Since I do not see as well as a Halfling, Shalia took up point, with me tagging along behind her.  If we encountered trouble, I would be the muscle, and her the flanker.  Our plan was to avoid trouble at all costs though.  <br>
  We moved slowly through the forest in the direction of the frontier.  Shalia would slink silently away into the darkness, and return every so often to lead me to a new area.  We reached the frontier of Greaterfey in this hop scotch manner shortly before midnight without encountering anything of note.  Once at the frontier though it was obvious that there was something of profound evil in the area.  The air took on a stale sent and became noticeably colder.  The sounds of the small creature of the forest were gone now, replaced with low growls, and painful moaning.  I am not a man given to fear, but there was something here that was very wrong.  I was scared out of my wits.  Shalia was scared too, and that was unlike her.  We traveled carefully, and quietly for about another mile before we came upon something that will haunt me until the end of my days…<br>

Ahead we could see the flickering light of a fire in the clearing ahead of us.  We could hear that this was the source of the moaning, and shrieking.  Shalia motioned for me to hold my position just out of the fire's light, and once again disappeared into the darkness.  From my concealed position I could see that there were several Orcs in the camp, and that these Orcs were consulting with a cloaked figure concealed just inside one of their tents.  I could also see that there was a spit on the fire with a captured Dwarf chained to it.  He was rotating the carcass that was mounted on the spit while at the same time he was retching into the fire.  This seemed to amuse the Orc that would occasionally wipe the poor sod when he hesitated to rotate the spit.  I could not make out what was on the spit, but it looked humanoid.  Judging from the dwarf's reaction and the shape of the carcass I drew the conclusion that the Orcs were about to feast upon one of their prisoners.  Once again I felt my blood begin to boil at the thought of these foul beasts, and their atrocities.  I had to remind myself of old warrior's words to me that day after my first battle. &quot;You have to learn to control the fire lad&quot; Remembering this, I relaxed my sword arm, and maintained my observance.  I would not sit long however.  I am guessing that the moon was at it's high point when I heard a blood curdling screech from the other side of the camp that I was watching.  I perked up to see what was going on, and what I saw both shocked, and horrified me.<br>
  From the darkness inside the tent that contained the hooded figure a large skeleton emerged carrying a small eleven babe.  The skeleton was followed by a separate figure that seemed to be controlling the foul creature.  The figure came into the light of the fire and I could see that it was a creature that I have never seen before, and later I learned that this was one of the dreaded Tier'Dal Necromancers that I had heard so many horror stories about.  I was so enraptured, and horrified that I did not notice Shalia sneak up beside me.  She tugged on my kilt, and almost caused me to jump out of my skin.  Once I looked down to meet the eyes of my small companion I could see that her face was ashen, and her eyes bright with terror.  She had seen something terrible that was sure, but we were on a mission, and I was going to complete it.  Shalia, motioned for me to leave with her, and there are times in my nightmares that I wish I had.  <br>
  Just as I turned back to the scene before me there was yet another scream from the babe as the skeleton broke off one of it's legs and handed it to it's master.  From within the tent there was the sharp sound of a sword striking bone at the same time.  From within the tent a head rolled to the feet of the foul Tier'Dal who looked down at it.  He turned the head so that it could see the bloody limb in his hand and shrieked. &quot; SEE WHAT BECOMES OF YOUR CHILD WITCH OF TANARE!!!&quot;  &quot;SEE WHAT INORRUCK DECREES FOR YOUR WEAKLING RACE!!&quot;<br>
The Tier'Dal then devoured the limb, and reached for another.  I could see now that the head was that of a High Eleven woman.  Her Eyes were wide open, and her mouth agape in a silent scream.  It was all I could do to keep from retching as the dark elf proceeded to devour the rest of the babe.  I could now see that the figure on the spit was also an Elf from the size of its frame.  Shalia was now frantic as she pulled on my kilt to go.  I slowly began to back away from the grizzly scene before me, and began to follow her.  It wasn't long before we reached the frontier again.  Still shaking with fear Shalia and I returned to report our findings to the Commander of the Dwarven infantry regiment.  But just before I entered Arkis's tent I could here a whisper invade my thoughts.  It was a foul, and hollow voice and I knew that it must be that of one of the Tier'Dal that attended that horrible scene.  <br>
&quot;Bear witness to your future Barbarian for what you have seen will be your end&quot;<br>
  Arkis became almost irrational as Shalia, and I described the horrible details of the night's recon. <br>
&quot;I never cared much for the snooty high Elves, but this is an atrocity that can not go unpunished by Kaladin I shall avenge the Elven Woman!&quot;  Arkis called for his troops to muster, and prepare for battle.<br>
  The Dwarven infantry were prepared to depart within an impressive 5 minutes of the first drum.  The lines of warriors among them were standing at attention as the Clerics trooped the lines in the same manner as the Shamans of Halas.  It was no wonder that the dwarves found barbarians like me so amicable.  They were just a smaller version of the men from Halas, and no less fearsome.  After the Clerics had finished with their blessings Arkis sounded the advance.  He deployed his men on in a 3 Phalanx formation with one battalion to the front in rank while on either flank he had one formation in column.  The dwarves worked their way through the forest with speed, and precision that denoted there training.  This was no green unit.  These men were of the elite Kaladim Royal Guards.  It was impressive to watch from our position to the rear of the center formation as the Guardsmen advanced through the wood.  Shalia was not impressed however.  She commented on the noise the dwarves were making, and there their pretty formation better be prepared for an ambush.  <br>
  It came with lightning speed.  One minute we were marching to contact with the Dwarves, the next we were in the middle of a pitched battle.  The Orcs fell on us from all sides.  Shalia, and I were caught in the middle of the fray, I was hard pressed to keep us both alive.  Two Orcs were on me, and I could see Shalia hiding behind a tree waiting for her chance to dart in.  The 2 Orc Legionaries were pressing me hard, and my new shield was already in ruins.  The first Orc launched a vicious set of sword strokes aimed at my head while the other attempted to get behind me.  I countered with a bash to the 2nd Orc, and struck him with a stunning blow. As he stood there shaking off my strike Shalia finished him with a perfect strike to his spine.  He then fell one his face trembling in death.  I didn't have time to congratulate Shalia however.  With my shield gone now, I was hard pressed to keep the other legionnaire from gaining an advantage.  My attacker was weakening I noticed, and he began to show an opening, on his left side.  I countered, and launched an attack of my own.  I fainted to his right, and he winced while trying to counter.  I then bashed him in the face with my shieldless left for arm and then ran him through with the remains of my longsword.  He slid from my sword clutching his midsection.  Shalia and I were now surrounded by the battle as the Orcs pressed the Guardsmen from all Sides.  I could see Arkis at the head of the center Phalanx engaging a dark figure as they both shimmered in strange light; I looked from him to the right flank and could see the Dwarves were being overwhelmed.  I grabbed Shalia and ran toward the left Phalanx commander to inform him that he must reinforce the right.  I didn't get 3 steps before I heard Shalia scream at my side.  She was surrounded in a green aura, and I could see blisters appearing all over her face.  I looked around to find her attacker, and seen a Dark Elf in the process of casting another spell.  I charged him, but a Skeleton warrior intercepted me.  I bashed the foul beast with my forearm, and the shoved it aside, I wanted that caster, and I didn't have time for this walking bone collection.  The caster unleashed his spell on me then.  I was momentarily surrounded in a white light, and I could feel that I was growing weaker, and I was slowed to a walk.  I fought to get at the caster but the Skeleton recovered from my stunning blow, and took a swipe at my back.  I turned on it again, and this time took its head with an overhand stroke from my sword.  The Skeleton now crumbled at my feet I turned once again to the caster just in time to see him unleash yet another spell.  This time I was surrounded in a green light, and I could sense fear, and panic creeping up on me.  I shook it off however, and continued my slowed advance.  Just as I was about to strike the evil Necromancer Shalia appeared behind him, and sliced open his neck.  His scream gurgled in his throat as he fell to the ground.  Shalia was hurt bad, and I could see that she was in immense pain.  I picked her up in my arms, and ran to where I thought the left Phalanx commander was with all the speed I could muster.  The sounds of battle were all around us.  As I ran I could hear screams, war cries, and explosions.  Evil spell casters were spewing forth the wrath of their foul gods on the Dwarven troops relentlessly, while the Dwarven Clerics struggled to keep the men in line, and healed for battle.  As we neared the embattled left Phalanx I could see that there would be little help from them.  They had collapsed in a tight block formation, and were fighting for their very lives.  Shalia and I barely evaded a charging Orc platoon as we looked for a place to rest and heal her wounds.  We retreated from the battle to a near by Hill.  I bandaged the worst of Shalia's wounds but I could see that she was still in poor shape and barely conscious.  I set her underneath a fallen tree, and then set out to rejoin the battle and to find a cleric that could better tend the wounds of my friend.  I prayed to the Tribunal that would not be to late.  As I approached the battle I could see that the left phalanx had defeated yet another Orc charge and were preparing to counter attack to releave the right.  I could not see the center Phalanx but I could hear that the battle was still raging in that direction.  The Left Phalanx began their charge, and I hurried to join them.  We surged toward were the right had been, and discovered that the Orcs were already gone.  What was left were the tattered, and bloody ruins of what was once the right phalanx of the regiment. The left phalanx commander left his clerics, and once again sounded the charge this time toward the center formation.  The Orcs there were still attempting to crush the block that the dwarves had fallen into. The battle desperate, the Dwarves fought as if the were already dead.  They were fearless and self-sacrificing as they protected their last Cleric who sat in the middle meditating.  The left commander simply screamed the war cry of Kaladim, and his soldiers charged behind him.  The Orcs were now the ones on the defensive as they were caught between the desperate and the tenacious.  With the 2 handed sword that I had taken from a fallen Legionnaire I cut my way threw the Orcs feeling the fire once again rise within me.  I made no move to defend.  I simply found a target, and attacked until there were no more Orcs.  I once again lost track, and again I found myself coming back to reality after the battle was over.  We had won, but barely.  Arkis lay dead with a wicked looking blade piercing his breastplate.  Near him were many slain Orcs, and 3 Dark elves.  He had died a hero's death.  I saluted his corpse, and went out to find a healer.  I had to be sure that Shalia was alright……<br>

We arrived to find Shalia lying against a log weeping.  At her feet were the remains of 2 Orc pawns.  I was struck dumb with fear for my friend.  She was bleeding from wounds all over her and the blisters were even worse now.  The Dwarven cleric rushed to her as soon she saw her and started her healing chants, and incantations.  Gaitalla worked with all the remaining power she had, and Shalia was at least out of pain.  I sat helpless watching the cleric work, and struck with fear and self-loathing for not staying to protect my friend.  I prayed in earnest that she would recover.   <br>
&quot;Gavin&quot; She called to me.  I opened my eyes and stood up from my prayers.  She lay with her head on Gaitalla's lap; her face no longer covered in blisters.  She reached up to me, and brought my face close to hers.  As I leaned over to get closer, I glanced at Gaitalla with a questioning look.  She returned my look with one of sadness.  It was all I could do to keep from breaking down.  I had to be strong for Shalia, now more then ever.  Shalia put her little arms around my neck, and whispered for me to take her into the forest for the last time.  I cradled her in my arms and walked numbly into the forest away from the grizzly battleground.  I walked until I came to a moss bank on a short cliff near a massive oak tree.  I sat down with my friend held close to me, and whispered her name.  Shalia was gone.  <br>
  I laid her down under the moss beneath the massive oak and I stayed near her grave for longer then I can remember.<br>
   I awoke suddenly in the bright sun to the tingling of a fairy playing near my face.  I came to my feet with a start as the fairy darted off frightened much the same as I.  The Fairy returned slowly, inching her way to me.  Once near to me again she asked in a voice I could barely hear.<br>
 &quot;Are you the man known as Macalister?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am.&quot; I replied in a low voice, not knowing what this creature wanted and wanting to be alone with my friend's grave. <br>
&quot;I have come to bring a message from Shalia.  Gavin of Halas, know that although you are betrothed.  Know that I loved you, and know that my time had come.  My god called to me, and now I am home.  Be well, and live free.&quot; I stared at the tiny being tingling before me amazed at her words, and her appearance.  She almost took on the shape of Shalia as she delivered her message, and her voice was that of Shalia.  Overcome, I knelt before the fairy, and bowed my head in submission, and asked for forgiveness.  But in Shalia's voice she reprimanded me for being a foolish barbarian.  She had been called she said.  There was nothing I could have done to stop her time.  Her message complete, the little fairy swooped down to my face, kissed my cheek and then disappeared into the forest.  I stood up then still unsure of what to do until a voice entered my mind that has been with me ever since.  <br>
&quot;Quit chor snivlin ya oaf, and get to Kelethin.  Your betrothed needs you&quot;  <br>
Shalia was even worse now then she was when she walked with me in the mortal world. <br>
She has been with me ever since that day.  Sometimes I think its the Tribunal's way of letting me know that I messed up somewhere along the way.  But I have to admit.  I would grieve her all the more if she were not with me in my dreams, and in my thoughts.<br>
I donned my tattered armor and weapons and headed east along a ridgeline overlooking the road to Felwyth.  I noticed that the traffic on the road was heavy and mostly military heading for the lines that the Dwarven Royal Guards had made secure with their sacrifice.  It seemed the campaign was heating up from the activity on the road.  It was about 3pm on my 7th day on the Island continent that I finally arrived at the tree City of Kelethin.  Once there I was amazed at the ingenuity of the Wood Elves as I rode one of the 3 lifts that brought me to one of the many platforms that made up the City Among the Leaves.  I have to say though that although Kelethin is a very Beautiful city, I found it almost as uncomfortable as Kaladim.  Due to the fact that the people of Kelethin are so slight in size, almost all of the doors were inaccessible to one of my race.  There were only 2 or 3 dwellings that I could actually access, and they were not available to the general pubic.  The ambassador from Halas was a Human named Jason Bartoff, who also doubled as the Ambassador for Antonious Bale.  Once I was able to contact him, I was directed to a make shift camp at the base of the city on the ground where all the Northmen were camped.  Once I found lodgings among my countrymen, I set out to find Arianna.<br>
  After speaking with the some of the Wizards of Felwyth I discovered that the Antonican Wizards had sent Arianna along with a few of her fellow Wizards along with a Regiment of Highelf Cavalry to the lines.  According to the Elf Wizard I spoke to, the Dwarven Infantry supported by a Mercenary Regiment from Halas had broken through the Orcish lines, and the Elvish Cavalry was sent to exploit the breach.  <br>
  After hearing this I made arrangements for to travel with a platoon of Woodelf scouts that were bound for the lines the next morning.  <br>
  That night I settled into my tent near the R&amp;R area of some of the same Mercenaries that I had traveled to Freeport with.  The men that I fought with so many weeks before had forgiven me my fame after our arrival at Freeport, and were genuine in there condolences for the lose of Shalia.  They played sad songs on the pipes, and toasted long into the night of the fearless little thief from the Vale.  I was once again among my brethren, and it did my heart good to know that they felt much the same about her that I had.  Many wept at my telling of her fearlessness in her final hour, and of her final resting-place in the wood.  That night was a turning point in my grief.  I swore a blood oath of Vengeance against the Orcs of Crushbone, and the Darkelves of Neriak along with many of my brethren.  The Shaman sealed the oath, and the Mercenary Commander released a platoon to me to carry out our oath.  We would depart as I had planned in the morning.  Although I planned to find my beloved Arianna.  This errand would have to take priority.  The honor of Halas, and of the Vale would be our cause, and Blood Vengeance of a fallen comrade. <br>
  I awoke before the dawn the next day.  I lit a small fire, and began to prepare for the days action.  This was the first time I had taken the blood oath, and I was careful to observe the right as I had been shown by my father.  I kneeled on the soft morning grass facing the northeast toward the lights of my homeland.  I lit the sulfur of the Caverns of Everfrost given to me by one of the Shaman of the Tribunal.  I prepared the colors of vengeance in a blessed Orc skull, and set to my rights, and prayers.  During the Ceremony as is custom, I was joined by 2 Shaman, and the Warriors who would join me on my quest.  All were already prepared for the journey.  In this tradition my people carried out our rights for over 2 thousand years.  On the walls of caves, and in the Mountains of Everfrost were the signs of my people's devotion to the 6 Hammers, and to justice.  We of the north regard justice above all else, and justice to a close friend, loved one, or family member wrongfully slain was a crime only atoned by death.  Shalia was all of these to me.  During the night she appeared before me just before I closed my eyes for some rest, and smiled her smile.  <br>
&quot; Don't ya be doing nothin stupid ya big oaf, and don't ya be thinkin you can take um all to yer self.  Let the warriors who are with you get a few too.  I will be with you always&quot;<br>
She shed a tear, and touched my cheek with her palm.  Then she faded. <br>
  I lay there on my cot for a few minutes before drifting off to sleep.  I slept soundly, and dreamlessly that night, and I awoke before the dawn refreshed, and feeling better then I think I had ever before.  I kneeled in prayer to the Mother of all for the morning, and to the 6 Hammers for the strength to carry the day.  <br>
It was not long before the Shaman who were to join us arrived to prepare me for my Blood Revenge Quest.<br>
We prayed, and I painted myself with the colors of Vengeance, and justice.  Once complete we were met with the warriors, and made our final preparations.<br>
  We departed with the platoon of Tunare scouts as planed, and marched through the day toward the lines of the embattled elves, and Dwarves.   The scouts told us that there were several reports of Orc raids to the rear of the Dwarvish lines that linked them to Kaladim, and it was suspected that there were some survivors of the large raiding party that attacked the Kaladim Royal Guards.  Something told me to start here so I informed the platoon leader of the Tunare scouts that we would travel the rest of the way on our own.  The platoon leader assigned one if his rangers to us for recon and wished us luck on our quest.  <br>
  We proceeded along the Western Frontier of the Greaterfeydark frontier following our scout.  Not long after dawn on the 3rd day we finally encountered signs that we were nearing our query, our scout picked up the trail of what appeared to be an Orcish party of at least 20.  We followed, and discovered a grizzly trail of religious sacrificial remains, and camp sites littered with bones, and bits of flesh left for the local carrion eaters. <br>
Once, we came into a site only an hour behind these vermin and had to ease the pain of a half eaten Dwarven woman. They just left her to die. The Shaman gave her potions to put her to sleep, and 2 warriors took her into the forest, and opened her veins so that she would die peacefully, and painlessly.  The Beasts that had attacked her made sure that she would not be healed.  They maimed her in the most unspeakable ways just for sport.  We spent another hour in the cam as I helped my 2 brothers prepare for the right of Vengeance in honor of the Woman.  The Orcs had much to atone for this day, and the Shaman made sure that the will of the 6 Hammers was with us.<br>
  NaunKa, our Ranger guide told us that the Orcs knew that they were being followed, but was puzzled that they didn't seem to care.  That night we found out why.  Naunka suggested that we follow at night from now on so that we could catch the Orcs by surprise.  We once again prepared for battle but this time before dusk.  We struck our fireless camp, and moved out swiftly, and quietly.  The Gods made the night Clear, and bright.  The moons were full, as the sound of screams shattered the peace of the night.  We could hear that the Orcs were preparing their evening meal.  We could here shouts, and pleas as we neared the camp.  To a Man the Mercs were ready to end the lives of these things that fed on sentient beings…..<br>

Then we set out to the camp.  It wasn't hard to find.  The oily smoke from their fire was heavy in the humid night.  The awful smell of burning flesh was suffocating as we approached the camp.  From the camp we could hear the schrill screaming of a Darkelf, and the heavy crack of a large wipe.  There was a grunt, and then there was a female scream that chilled my blood.  It was Arianna.  My comrades must have seen my reaction because we charged as one as I bellowed the battle cry of the Wolves of the North.  We came into the camp from the north, and caught the occupants by surprise.  I charged the Darkelf that was about to slice the throat of a human that was hanging upside down over a large kettle.  It spun on me as I bore down, but I didn't give it time to loose a spell before I left it's corpse with the disembodied head staring at the human still hanging above it.  My comrades and I engaged a slight looking Dark Knight near the fire once the orcs were dispatched with little effort.  The Dark Knight was no easy match however.  He parried, and reposte our attacks with what seemed little effort.  His 2 handed sword was black as night, and difficult to parry due to its ability to almost become invisible against a back drop of star lit forest.  Our casualties began to mount as another of my comrades fell to his knees clutching his open midsection.  I renewed my effort, and attempted to taunt this Dark Avatar off of one of our younger warriors.  He turned on me, and brought all his dark powers to bear.  Two of my comrades took the moment, and engaged our evil foe from behind.  One of our Shaman cast a spell that caused that Dark Elf's skin to become frosted to the point that it was breaking off in flakes as I bashed, kicked, and slashed blow after blow on the Dark Elf's armored body, and head.  Now there were 4 of our party on the evil one.  The elf hissed insults at me as it became clear that it would be defeated.  My comrades, and I were wearing the abomination to the breaking point, but he still had some tricks up his sleeve.  The evil son of a Goblin seemed to be able to draw life from his enemies, and brought me to my knees once with a crushing spell that seemed to suck the very life from me.  Finally it took one of the Shaman to end his life with a damning spell from the Tribunal.  Once the Dark Knight was slain, we were able to mop up the remaining Orcs and lesser Dark Elves easily.   There was a prisoner's stable to the rear of the camp, and I was relieved to find my Arianna was still alive, although beaten severely, and covered in grime.  It was obvious that her ordeal had lasted for sometime.  She was barley conscious when I released from her shackles, and I could tell that she could not recognize me.  As she became aware that she had been released, she shrank away from me, and screamed again as I had heard upon our entering the camp.  The anger returned again as the image of what could have been the cause her screams.  <br>
  I kneeled before her and offered my water flask and a dry chamois.  She then looked at me, and slowly I could see her eyes light up in recognition.  At first it seemed as though she did not believe her eyes, and then  she began to shrink away again as if I were some evil being.  I have heard of casters known as enchanters that are able to twist one's mind, so I took my time.  The Warriors, and Shaman of my war party took the other prisoners out of the pen while I sat with my betrothed.   Arianna, look at me again, and it seemed that she was surprised that I had not become violent with her.  I just sat there with the water flask, and chamois before me.  Then I remembered.  She had never seen me in full battle gear, and war paint.  I took the chamois and began clearing away the blood, and war paint that covered my face, and hands.  As I worked to make myself recognizable, Arianna finally whispered my name in a quite, and questioning voice.<br>
&quot;Gavin?&quot;  Arianna, then surprised me, and threw her arms around me with a shout.  &quot;Gavin, it is you!  You came for me!&quot;  Arianna and I cleaned our selves as best we could with the water flask, now very stained Chamois.  Just as we were finishing; NaunKa entered with some Robes, and equipment.  Arianna composed herself, and stood from our little reunion and thanked the Ranger for her things.  &quot;NaunKa told us that he had found her robes, and equipment among the Shadow Knight's things in his tent.  He also told us that there was a Wizard's' tent there, but he did not see a Wizard among the dead.  &quot;Gavin, I think there is another party working from this camp.  We should prepare.&quot;  The ever serious faced woodelf said. <br>
&quot;Gavin, go to your friends. I must prepare myself to travel.&quot;  Her face now stern, and eyes averted as if something deep within her heart were troubling her and she could not bring it forward.  I left her to her preparations, but I could not help but to feel as though I were.  I knew that something terrible had happened to her, but I also knew that she would keep her own council.  I only hoped the she still felt as she did before I left for Freeport so long ago. <br>
  I didn't have long to ponder the current events of my personal relationships however.  NaunKa returned to the camp after a brief patrol of the area and reported that there were at least 15 Orcs, and 3 Dark Elves heading up the River toward the Raider Camp.  In a flurry we worked to hide the bodies, and set traps, and blinds for an ambush. During this time, Arianna, and 2 of her party members stepped into the center of the Camp, and demanded that blinds be set for them.  Angus MacTavish, one of the Warriors on the quest with me gave me a look of disapproval.  I nodded to him, and off he went to set the blinds.  Halas men had no problems with folks issuing orders, nor did they have problems following them.  But when some snooty Elf or human starts demanding things we are apt to get a little snooty back.  Usually snooty for us means a bust in the chops though.  Angus didn't like it, but he did his job.  As all of us did.  I pulled Arianna to the side as she turned to the 2 high elves that we rescued with her, and asked her why they were treating their saviors as though they were servants.  We didn't ask for much.  But a little appreciation was certainly in order.  Arianna turned on me then, and gave me a withering look that convinced me that this was not her.  <br>
&quot;Do not suppose that you can question me Barbarian.  Just do as your told&quot; I watched her follow her 2 friends to their blinds.  Then I called for the Shaman.  <br>
  Angus, brought the 2 Shaman, and NaunKa with him as he returned.  NaunKa reported that the Orc party was still at least 15 minutes out, and that we had time to deal with our current problem as well.  Gertrude, and Rolan Romtuk, our 2 shaman suggested that we set 2 traps.  One for the incoming party, and another for the one already here.  There was something strange about these 3.  Arianna, no matter what she had been through would never cast her lot with arrogant fools.  She spoke about such people often at the University, and on our walks in the hills of Qeynos.  I would never dream of betraying a loved one, but this could not be her.  I did ask my comrades to wait until there was at least more substantial evidence however.  <br>
  After our brief council we set in our blinds, and waited.  The party didn't take long.  Once again I noticed something strange. This Orc party didn't enter the camp.  Instead, they scouted the area around it as if they had just discovered it.  Also the manner in which they scouted was not Orcish.  Orcs were not known for stealth.  This party was good.  NaunKa reported that there were a few times that he thought that he would be discovered while he followed there party's scouts.  He suspected that this party was not as it seemed.  We waited for another hour before the Orc party entered the camp.  The first scouts came in slowly, and carefully.  Moving from tree to tree as they surveyed the camp for signs of an ambush.  They waited just past our first blinds, and motioned for more of their party to advance.  The Dark Elves that approached also seemed strange.  These Elves seemed larger then the ones that I had encountered so far.  There was definitely something wrong here. Then, with a rushing sound one of the Orc scouts was struck with a charge of light that completely engulfed him.  Gertrude and Romtuk then unleashed their ambush.  But not on the Orcs.  Instead they combined forces, and cast canceling magic on the 3 casters behind the blinds we set for them.  That's when the confusion really started.  A cloud of confusion rushed over me, and it seemed that I was not in control of my own body.  I was an observer from inside my own mind as I watched myself charge out from my blind and attack one of the Dark Elves entering the camp.  It seemed that I was alone however.  My comrades did not rush forward to join the battle as they had before.  I watched my self as I drew forth the great sword that I still carried, and brought it down on the Dark Elf.  There were explosions all around me then, and something was grasping my legs firmly to the ground.  As I felt myself regain control of my movement, I discovered that the Orc party was not an Orc party at all.  Instead they were a party of Human, Dwarven, and Elvish adventurers. They were staring at me in disbelief.  I was still confused however, then someone shouted my name, and I spun to face NaunKa.  &quot;Gavin!! Enchanters!!  We have been deceived!!&quot;  Just as NaunKa screamed his last words, he burst into flames, and fell to the ground.  My warriors, supported by our 2 shaman rushed for the blinds containing the Dark Elf casters.  Only one remained.  The woman laughed at us as she shimmered, but not for long.  Gertrude bashed the Dark Elven woman with her mace, and interrupted her casting.  She then made short work of the Dark Elf as we stood near.  The party of adventurers stood beyond us still looking confused.  I then noticed that my armor was scorched, and I was bleeding from what looked like thorn pricks all over my body.   I sat down on a log near by holding my head in disbelief.  Still confused on what had just occurred, and troubled at losing yet another brave soul.  I didn't see that some one was standing before me looking as if she had seen a ghost.  &quot;Gavin?&quot;  Reluctant to look up, and not trusting my self after the events that had just transpired, I continued to sit, and stare at the ground.  It's not an easy thing to have the Woman you love turn into a Dark Elf Enchantress before your very eyes.  <br>
&quot;GAVIN!,  Look at Me!&quot;   She shouted this time, and push back my forehead forcing me to look at her. It was her alright. This time there was no mistake. Behind her stood several familiar faces from Qeynos. My Party also joined the growing group who cheered as Arianna dragged me to my feet, and kissed me soundly. &quot;Now do you believe Gavin?&quot;………………………<br>

As it turned out most of my new friends knew the warriors, and shaman from Halas.   Our cities have been allied for so long that is was difficult to separate the people of the western lands even when abroad.  Our 2 party's joined as one in an effort to further our cause.  With the casters from Qeynos, and the Warriors from the Tundra we were able to block the breach on the right flank of the Greaterfeydark campaign with no losses.  We remained on the lines for 2 uneventful weeks when we received word that 4 regiments of dwarven infantry, supported by a Troop of High Paladins of Mar had created a breach in the Orcish lines.  We were ordered forward on a general advance as the Orcs fled before us.  We of the Western lands showed the Orcs no mercy as we drove our enemies before us with the fury of Radcet Nife, and the Tribunal.  With Arianna at my side, I had little to fear.  My fiery woman was indeed that.  I could hardly engage a foe before it would be incased in Ice or Fire.  It was becoming a little embarrassing.  There was only one instance were we ran into any trouble. While chasing a fleeing Orcish scout party a band of Dark elves were able to get on our flank.  We were fortunate that one of our Rangers from the Glade picked up on the putrid sent of a Necromancer before he was able to cast his evil upon us.  We quickly engaged the Darkelves.  We had them beaten long before the battle had begun.  We were a large party of mixed classes.  This surprise attack was ill supported, and undermanned.  But they did manage to cover an assassin well enough to get past me.  I heard a scream to my rear &quot;GAVIN!!!!&quot;….I turned to see Arianna was being faced with a short Darkeelf woman attempting to slash her with a wicked looking dagger.  Arianna dodged the blue woman's attempts, and bashed her once with her staff, but it was clear that if she did not get help, this fight would not last.     I charged the woman, but she rolled into me, and attempted to get behind me.  I spun on her, and was about to bring down my great sword on her when the woman shimmied, and disappeared.  Arianna cast a spell of seeing on the party, but it was confirmed that the Darkelves had ported away.  We suffered only one injured to their 5 losses.  <br>
  A mixed Company of Elves relieved us shortly after this last engagement.  The Commander of the combined force informed us that the Orcs had retreated into their strong hold of Crushbone, and we were to head to Kaladim for payment.  We were not prepared for the opulent reception we were to receive.  It seemed that our party's exploits had become the talk of the campaign.  Between the blood vengeance of the Halas mercenaries, and the crusade led by Arianna's party, we had defeated almost all of the Dark Elven supporters of the Crushbone offensive.  Arianna, and I stayed in Kaladim for the week, and the started back to Qeynos.  The trip back was a bit different then the one that had brought us to the magic Isle of the Fey.  Instead of the long, and dangerous trek across the Antonican continent. All we had to do was make a half day's ride into GreaterFey to the Wizard's spires.  There we met with the Wizard's Guild leader of Qeynos (Arianna's Father), and to my great surprise my parents.  It seemed that there was a surprise in store for me, and there was no way that either Arianna, her parents, or mine were going to leave things to chance.  <br>
&quot;Looks to me that what ever chance you had of escaping brother, is now gone.  She's Got ya&quot; Angus MacTavish said as the air around us began to crackle.  Arianna gave my friend a withering look, but he only beamed a smile at her.  He finished his sentence on the Western plains of Karana, which caused him to hesitate a bit.  Looking around with a look of confusion on his face he said &quot;I am only watching over my brother young lass.  After all he, and I have completed a long quest. It pains me to see him now brought to the alter without so much as a good Halas beating&quot; He finished with an impish grin.  <br>
&quot;Who said anything about an Alter?&quot; Arianna replied with a cat caught with a paw in the birdcage look on her face. <br>
&quot;That will be enough my children.&quot; My mother cut in.  &quot;We still have several hours of travel before us before we reach the city, so stand still while I invoke the spirits of our kinsfolk of the forest to speed us on our way&quot;  My mother cast several spells along with my father and then we were off to the city of Qeynos running with all speed, and stamina of wolves.  I held to the rear of this group of friends as we ran along the Karana river.  I looked at the faces of each of my family and companions and suddenly realized that we were indeed wolves.  No not the true four legged sort, but we were a pack.  We were devoted to each other.  Our lives were intertwined, and depended on each member of the pack.  Wolves we were indeed, and like wolves we would triumph over our enemy's through each other.  I was comforted, and contented by this.  It must have shown on my face too, because Angus trotting at my side broke my mussing with a playful shove.  &quot;Hah, if I didn't know you better Gavin, I would swear that your looking forward to getting married.  I guess I will have to have our kinsmen give ya a good ole fashion Halas send off once we get to Qeynos.&quot;  I looked at my friend in surprise.  &quot;Who's getting married?  I am not getting married yet!&quot;  I replied.  &quot;I have to much to do before I settle down to marriage.&quot;  I replied.  &quot;You better look around you, you stupid Barbarian&quot; This time the voice was Shalia's.  &quot;What do you think the top brass of the Qeynos Wizard's Guild, and the 2 most respected Shaman in Norath have made a special trip to get your party for? Your not that special Gavin&quot; She had a catch in her voice after that last sentence, and I could tell that Shalia wanted to be here with us.  I was afraid to answer, so I remained silent.  She knew I missed her though.  <br>
  It wasn't long before we were in Qeynos hills, and on the road to Qeynos.  Once near the gates I could see that banners of welcome had been hung from the walls of the city, and there were crowds of people awaiting our triumphant return.  Arianna drew close to me, and whispered &quot;Is she jealous Gavin?&quot;  I looked at Arianna in surprise, and asked &quot; Is who jealous?&quot;  &quot;Shalia of course you lout.  Who else would I be talking about.  She's been staring at me from your shoulders since my father teleported us from Greaterfeydark.&quot;  I stopped in my tracks, and turned to Angus who was with the mercenary escort that had started the trek from Qeynos with me the year before.  &quot;Do you see her brother?&quot; I asked him.  &quot; See who Gavin?&quot;  he replied with baffled look.  &quot;Only you, and Arianna can see me Gavin, I wanted her to see me so that she would know that I am still with you, and tell her that I am happy for you both.&quot; <br>
&quot;She says that she is only happy for us, and that she wanted you to know that she is still with me.&quot; <br>
&quot;I will take good care of him Shalia, and you are welcome in our family.&quot; Arianna said looking at a place just over my head.<br>
  The throng of people had to be held back by the Qeynos Guards as our party approached the gates.  Before the gate of Qeynos stood two figures.  One was Antonious Bale, and the other was none other the High Chief of the North.  My father Gerhard Macalister, and my Mother Reanen flanked by Bastin Q'Tonoth faced me.  &quot;Gavin, as the leader of our party it is your duty to announce the arrival, and proclaim our deeds to the tribe.  Now kneel son, and receive the blessing of the Six Hammers, and that of Radcet Nife.&quot;  Our Party stood in a half circle facing the Qeynos, and Halas dignitaries as I received the blessings from my parents, and from Bastin, Arianna's father.  Once finished I stood before them.  &quot;Now select a guard, and stand before our leaders, and present our deeds Gavin.  Proclaim to all that on this day our 2 cities of Qeynos, and Halas are one, and have helped to save our distant allies, and cousins on the Isle of the Fey.&quot;  My mother could get ceremonial at times, but I knew what she said asked of me was part of an ancient Halas tradition.  I selected Angus, Arianna, and the ghost of Shalia, and then turned to the City gates, and made my proclamation of victory to the people of the West.  <br>
&quot;People of the West.  I stand before you as your brother, and ask that you welcome my party back to the Village.  We have quested long, and far to bring you news of Triumph over evil, and of justice.  My brothers, and sisters whom you see behind me have assured the freedom of our Cities.  Will you welcome them?!&quot; <br>
  The crowd roared it's welcome.  Shalia was beaming at me from my side, and noticed that she was no longer ethereal, but substantial.  She was dressed in white robes, and her hair was touched with gray.  But she was there.  I lifted her up, and kissed her soundly, and helped her to her usual place on my shoulders, and then turned to reach out for Arianna, and the rest of my party.   I noticed that the dwarven woman who was so brutally wounded in the forest of Feydark walked now whole, and alongside Angus.  There were others walking with our party as the Tribunal allowed those that had been avenged to return to earth to help in celebration one last time.<br>
  Antonious Bale motioned for silence, and stepped forward to greet us.  He took my hand, and asked me to kneel once again.  &quot;My Brothers from the North told me that a Brave, and Powerful party of brothers, and sister were arriving from the war in Greaterfeydark.  My Brother the High Chief of Halas has honored us with his presence, and allowed us to present the honors, and rewards of the gratitude of our people here in the city of Qeynos.  Before me is the man known as Gavin of the clan Macalister.  Who from this day forth shall be known as the Wolfguard of the North.&quot;  The High Chief then stepped forward, and presented to me one of the most sought after swords in all of Norath.  The Langseax of the Wolves.  &quot;Go forth Gavin of the Clan Macalister.  Bring Pride on your Name, and to that of the Wolves of the North.&quot;  The High Chief then stood to the side, as Antonious beckoned to Arianna.  She also knelt at my side, and before the rulers of Qeynos, and of Halas. <br>
 &quot;People of the West. Know ye that from this day forth these two souls before me will be known as one.  They will travel as one always, and they will walk in the after world as one.&quot; <br>
 I was shocked, and looked from Shalia to Arianna to Angus.  All of them looked at me as if I was a child.  I had no Idea what was going on, until Antonious started the Marriage rights.  But I have to say that even now I look on that day as the best day of my life. <br>
&quot;Wolfguard, do you take this woman of Radcet Nife to your home of free will, and do you swear to protect, and provide for her until which day are called to our gods?&quot;  I looked at Arianna, and I knew that this was meant to be.  At that moment I knew that my vow was not only mine to her, but the Tribunal's, to Radcet Nife.  I would not know until much later what this meant, but for now all I could do was speak my heart.<br>
&quot;I swear with my last breath that I will protect, and provide for Arianna until the Tribunal calls me home.&quot;<br>
&quot;Arianna, do you swear to walk at the side of the Wolfguard, and to honor, and protect his children until which time that the Healer should call you home?&quot;<br>
Arianna simply looked into my eyes, and whispered. &quot;Yes&quot;<br>
&quot;With the power invested in me by the priests of Radcet Nife, and that of the Tribunal, I pronounce you as one.  Stand before your brothers, and sisters and let them behold the union of our people, and of our Champions&quot; We stood and faced the crowd as they roared their approval.  The celebration lasted for almost a week after I am told.  Shalia made good use of her day back, and drank almost the entire Qeynos Guard force under the tables of Qeynos.  Angus spent his time with the Dwarven woman he had completed his blood quest for, and my parents attended the High Chief on his trip back to Halas.  Bastin teleported Arianna, and I to an inn located on Lake Rath, and then settled back to his affairs in Qeynos.  As for Arianna, and I.  Well.  We stayed at our lake side inn for almost a month, and just enjoyed each other.  Then we moved back to Qeynos hills, and I built a Cottage for us along the Western sea overlooking the surf.  We lived there in peace until Ardin was born a few years later in the Winter of the Vox.  But that is another story.<br>
