<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let this post be a warning to never cross and piss of a Necro!<br>
So today I have a group in Paw, the worse one I've ever had.<br>
<br>
I had a chanter that refused to buff with clarity. A druid that refused to buff with sow on the way over to the zone, a ranger that wouldn't stop ninja looting out of turn, a beast lord that kept pulling before the group was ready and refused to heed the groups plea to stop and make sure they are ready, and a wizard that kept pulling with nukes even though he was not puller and was asked repeatedly to stop. Our tank would be pulling and then he would be some where else pulling another one in on top of us. once the tank got two adds and we ended up with four mobs and almost died.<br>
<br>
I was so pissed at these people, this crap went on for three hours. I lost it. Right or wrong I decided they were all going to die.<br>
<br>
So we were in the big room in front of double doors. We just finished fighting the three mobs near door and one in the sand pit. They again drew adds and was real low on hp and mana so I'm in the back of sand pit medding and they are all in front of me facing the doors. Except for the stupid beastlord who was at the double doors and kept opening one to look inside.<br>
<br>
So I cast gathering shadows and went invis as my pet had died in previous battle.<br>
<br>
Then I talked to them a couple minutes to make sure no one noticed I went invis.<br>
<br>
And then as the beast lord opened the door, I went through and as he closed it, I went through the second door.<br>
<br>
I then went past the other side of bridge to a place I know where there is only one mob. And then cast screaming terror on it. And went invis again and started running back out.<br>
<br>
Now screaming terror last about 18 seconds. And has a chance of mem blur which would make my attempt a failure if it worked lol. But I usually have a very high failure rate with the mem blur.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this gave me a 18 second head start on the mob.<br>
<br>
I made it back to the sand pit, sat down and dropped invis, just in time to hear the beastlord (still at the doors) sat &quot;oh crap&quot;<br>
<br>
About that time the mob from the sand pit spawned right next to me, which drew the groups attention as the spun around to engage it. And I cast FD, which failed. I turned to doors and recast FD and as the spell is going off I see the train a coming lol.<br>
<br>
<br>
It looked like that one gnoll must have brought 15 to 20 mobs with him. I could even see the beast lord they went through him like he was butter. My FD must have worked, because the next thing I know, the gnolls are all marching back through the doors and the corpses of my group were all over the floor.<br>
<br>
I was laughing so hard my side was hurting hehe.<br>
<br>
Then, I really got nasty. They couldn't figure out where or why the train came. Didn't suspect me at all. So I told them to consent me and I would drag their corpses to the zone entrance.<br>
<br>
So each one consented, but instead of dragging them to the zone line I invis and drag them through the doors and left them in room on other side of bridge deep in paw. Then I gated and disbanded.<br>
<br>
Now I know allot of people will flame me over this. And to them I say in advance, bite me, the y deserved what they got!. I am normally a very nice person and will bend over backwards to help people in or out of a group, but these jerks pissed me off and deserved to die!<br>
<br>
So why am I posting this. First because it was fun as hell. And second, if there are any other ediots out there that do the crap they did, be forwarned, that soon or later you will meet up with some one like me and they will get you. And I hope its a necro that does it!!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

WTF? This guy is on fuckin crack. They're fuckin NEWBIES... they're supposed to do that shit, wipe in place like Paw, Befallen, Unrest, etc. So this asswipe totally fucks everyone over... even though (apparantly) nobody wiped, nobody died, and a ranger was ninja lootin gimp ass vendor loot?<br>
<br>
There's fucked up groups everywhere... but acting like that is uncalled for. Just politely excuse yourself and go somewhere else....<br>
<br>
<br>
*edit* I don't think it's a troll. People actually do this kinda shit, albeit it's usually confined to &lt;L40. Mostly because these kinds of players don't have the patience it takes to level past that. However, since the XP bump, a slow moving tide of jagoffs are starting to show up in the 50's.<br>
<br>
What astounds me, is this guy apparantly thought he was doing the world a favor, and bragged about it.... <br>
