I don't WANT to cast it at all.  I am not standing around casting kei whining that I'm not making enough money.  The 100pp is a deterant, or is supposed to be.  I'm BUSY when I'm in PoK.  I don't want tells.  I don't want hails. I don't want 5pp shoved into my trade window without any further explanation or request.  I am NOT standing around waiting to cast KEI and crying that my income from buffing isn't sufficient.<br>
<br>
I am tradeskilling.  I am making celestial essences, or doing precombines, or enchanting clay, or using the Tanaan containers and I don't want to lose my spot.  Buffing everyone that wants KEI for what they want to pay for KEI is a full time gig.  I don't have that kind of time.  The 100pp is to weed out people that dont' REALLY want it, and to make casting KEI worth my time.  Has nothing to do with mana cost, or whether there is a component.<br>
<br>
In fact, I am sooo nice, I added an addendum to my message.  I will now accept stacks of celestial essence in lieu of the 100pp.  If you farm your research parts, that's a 5pp KEI right there.  If you buy Scent of Marr, that's a 35pp KEI.   Still a good deal.<br>
<br>
And I can't WAIT for the first person that tries to argue about the time it takes to make up a stack of essence. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.familjenguild.com/dspMember.php?Name=Hildie"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.familjenguild.com/images/logo/hildie.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am now an NPC.

-Make a /rt &quot;No. No. Hell No.  Don't ask me again.  NO.&quot; hotkey.<br>
-Turn off trade with others.<br>
-Make a new window and send all tells there, then minimize that window.<br>
<br>
If you don't let others know that you're busy, you've got no place to complain.  True, way back in the prehistoric past folks didn't just assume that you are a buff-bot.  Those days, right or wrong, are over.  The person who DOESN'T ask is now the aberation, rather than the norm.  Accept it, and do what it takes to make yourself some personal space.<br>

And good ideas.  <br>
<br>
I'd still get tells, because I do go /role and /anon and get tells and hails anyway.  So the afk message would indicate I'm not casting.  I'd look mean, but hey, my /ooc makes me look mean (and greedy) anyway so I wouldn't be losing much, and at least the afk message isn't broadcasted to the zone like the /ooc one, so I'd look mean to less people.<br>
<br>
Aside from the fact that I shouldn't have to hide, though, I have another reason for taking the action I did.  I am trying to achieve a balance.  I'm not going to be so self-sacrificing that I cast whatever anyone wants, whenever they want, for whatever they want to donate...but at the same time, I don't want to be so hard-assed that I never cast KEI under any conditions, ever.<br>
<br>
With the 100pp or celestial essence option, I think I have achieved the balance I want.  I'll look mean to greedy, lowbie cheapskates, but the opportunity is there for others.  I'll be compensated for the time I lose, and people that really really desire kei can get it.<br>
<br>
This decision is, of course, subject to change depending on how universal the loathing is for my new /ooc.  So far, I get at least half the zone defending me and 5 or 6 people come to me each hour for kei, essence or plat in hand.  The day I have no defenders, the bitchy afk message goes up.<br>
<br>
I also like it that my /ooc message, and the resulting /ooc war usually brings 2-3 chanters to the zone, trying to make me look bad by casting for donations...or free.  They may or may not realize I'm perfectly happy with that.  My own private joke, and I derive quite a bit of personal amusement from that.  And then, of course, I can go back to clicking in peace. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.familjenguild.com/dspMember.php?Name=Hildie"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.familjenguild.com/images/logo/hildie.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am now an NPC.

<br>
For those comments that Hildie made about a cleric having it tough, yeah, the rezzing for money is not that great of an option. They'll come to a chanter for KEI but you have to go to them to rez. And people never die in PoP zones and come to you with 200pp. Oh no. They die in Kedge, KC, OT, or some other God forsaken hellhole that no one goes to unless they have a reason to go there. After a year of having a clicker, if someone I don't know asks for a rez, I don't even reply anymore. As a matter of principle, I no longer rez in OT or OoT under ANY circumstances... if I have to catch a boat, you're outta luck. <br>
<br>
Yeah, not replying to people who want me to go rez them just adds to the things that make me a jerk but I've done my share of out of the way rezzes. At this point, if you go to a zone with no rezzers in it, that's not my fault and no amount of money is going to make me, and I've been ASKED to do this, rez you in Hate because some rogue asked you to port them up so they could get the book and you died. <br>
<br>
If I see a body in front of me, I click it. If someone in my group got you killed, I click it. If I'm on a raid with you, I click it. That's the extent of what I feel I have to do for anyone not my good friend anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aflacksaryrn>Aflack Saryrn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/9/03 6:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3209.topic&index=47>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chanters like me caused the War</span><hr size=1> Ninen what you suggest wont work most of the time, and ill explain why:<br>
<br>
Putting on /anon. People see you walking around with a snake in your hand.  Instant spam for hails and tells.  Also there are times when you want people to know who you are.  IE your LFG, or friends are looking for you and want to see what zone your in.  <br>
<br>
Putting on the /afk tag.  Hmm maybe I should have thought of this one, or maybe it doesnt work because tardnewbie_01 will spam you for KEI every 2 min.  <br>
<br>
Making /rt.  This one will not work also.  You get the smart asses like you see in Hildies story who will just stalk you and harrass you for not KEIng them.  You petition them, and all the GM's will tell you 4 hours later when they reply is, well they are not doing it anymore (duh, 4 hours later).  I sadly know this by experience as well, as many Enchanters do.  <br>
<br>
Turning off trade with others still wont stop the tells and hails.<br>
<br>
Making new windows for tells.  This one would work perfectly if the Enchanter was totally anti-social, and had no friends they use /tells with.  Yeah sure ill minimize tells and not talk to my friends when they are 6 zones away, or am not in the same raid as me.  I mean us Enchanters only play this game so we can do our thing by ourselfs and not be social right?  Makes sense.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I get no way near the tells that some Enchanters do for KEI.  Here is the reason why.  I am almost always on /role.  I can sacrfice not useing the /lfg tool, and my friends can ask me where the hell I am.  I dont spend a lot of time in places like PoK, or nexus.  I also dont /ooc that im KEIing for donations please hail me.  Out of all these, the most effective thing is #2.  Not to spend a ton of time in PoK, nexus.  Unfortunatly Hildie, and many other tradeskilling Enchanters do not have this option.  They have to do their tradeskilling there, and no other places will do.  <br>
<br>
I do know the feeling that Hildie gets, sometimes even in my limited time spent in nexus, and PoK.  I will get tards sending me /tells for KEI, which I promptly reply &quot;No&quot;.  If they dont move on, then I will put them on ignore.  If they start to act beligerant and try to slander, i will do a /report.  Unfortunatly out of all the /reporting I've dont, GMs have done 0 to stop things like this.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=479240" target="top">Sage Aflack Dukky </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Patch Message February 24, 2003  5:00 am<br>
<br>
- Increased the maximum number of members on ignore and friends lists to 100.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
So in theory, unless said enchanter already has 100 people on ignore, they could ignore... <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>tardnewbie_01<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> ...and remove them from their ignore list at a more convenient time. <br>

4- It's not the guy who doesn't know you's job to keep you buffed up.  Not because he's class X means he's supposed to give buff Y to you.<br>
<br>
Nothing I hated more than buffing...what a waste a time.  Had to get up off my butt to do it...sheesh.  You still gladly do it for your current group/raid tho  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rule of thumb, look for people who advertise.  If none are around, either wait or try something very near! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Try XPing the way it was meant to be...the old fashion way!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <br>
<br>
I used to have a 2-level response to buff whores.<br>
<br>
1- Sorry, I'm not in the &quot;buff/port/PL&quot; business.<br>
2- STFU and go visit one of them pimps in the Nexus.<br>
<br>
If 1 failed, 2 would follow.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone can't afford a 100pp kei then they are obviously low level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I never had Kei when i was low level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kei is a crutch.<br>
<br>
If lowbies refuse to level or be in groups without kei i'd like to see what happens when all the enchanters jack up their prices to 500pp per cast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm biased and have never needed kei but on my caster alts i never beg or go out of my way for a kei.<br>
Therefor i'm used to slow mana regen.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think people are spoiled and if they never used kei in the first place, they wouldn't see it as a needed part of the game and bother people like Hildie.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my opinion....Thank god for seduction of saryrn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garbhad>Garbhad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I will not<br>celebrate<br>

<br>
I would like to say thank you to all of the people who have sent me tells about this thread.  You have all been very supportive, and I appreciate the feedback!<br>
<br>
Vainne, I still owe you you-know-what for the thingy in you-know-where.  And thanks.<br>
<br>
I still get some fairly rude /ooc comments when I make my &quot;100pp or a stack of celestial essence&quot; pitch.  I have also gotten several stacks of essence, and some very grateful, polite, wonderful characters gave me or tried to give me, 100pp.  (Some I accepted...most I declined.  And KEI'd anyway.  Surprise!)<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I have gotten very kind tells and /ooc comments from all sorts of people applauding my choice, and my determination to stay true to my word.  To those...thank you.<br>
<br>
The other cute side effect of all of this is that when I make my /ooc...and if people get upset about it...even if it's been an hour with no other KEIers in the zone, within 10 minutes of my /ooc and resulting flame wars, some other chanter...or two...or three...miraculously pops up and KEIs for donations.  Or Free.  Or MGBs it.  *grin*  Presumably, this is to highlight their kindheartedness in the face of my selfishiness.  However, I am delighted these chanters show up, as I can then get back to work.  Heck, lately the only times I hit my /ooc button is to summon an enchanter for the little beggars.  They ought to be grateful.<br>
<br>
All in all, things are working out very smoothly...for me, anyway.  The only times I get caught off guard now is when I die and get punted back to my bind spot in PoK and get inundated with tells at a time when I'm nakid and already fairly frustrated.  I'll work on that.  <br>
<br>
In the mean time, keep on keeping on, and thanks again for the support from all of you, whether posting, silent observers, or quiet /tell'ers.<br>

The same person never asks twice.<br>
<br>
As for your worth in $$$, here is my suggestion:  Strip it of all droppables and cash (give em to friends, or sell em separate).  Then sell with just no drop gear.  Got $350 for my lvl 65 enc with just a handful of AA and no drop items (far from uber).  It's the XP people want to buy, the gear is fairly easy to replace (or at least get something decent).<br>
<br>
Edit: Selling stripped is so you don't get scammed.  Person 'A' buys your account, takes away all droppables and cash, then cancels payment.  Happens a lot.  And be careful, some people are jealous of folks selling their chars, and others buying.  Always the same old argument &quot;They won't know how to play a 65 enc properly...yadida...blah, blah&quot;.  As if EQ was rocket science!<br>
