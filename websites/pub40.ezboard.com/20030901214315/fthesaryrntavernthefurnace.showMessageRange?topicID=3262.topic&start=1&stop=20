In the past week Hayley and Detah have drove away several of the oldest members of FS. Now that Aono is gone Hayley and her puppy dog Detah have pretty much drove it to the point of no return. I am posting this becuase alot of FS will be looking for new homes. Please don't judge them for Hayley and Detahs mistakes 90% of FS are really good players and deserve a fresh start. As for Hayley and Detah stay as far away from them as possible. They are EQ's version of SARS!!!<br>

<br>
for those that are now wondering why I have deguilded, thats why they make message boards, to explain to the most people the same thing so that there will be no confusion when this is done (yeah right, I'll be all over the place, as usual).. <br>
<br>
bottom line is that I cannot remain an officer of a guild that no longer operates on the best interests of the guild as a whole.. after seein many of my closest friends leave either the guild or this game, I realize that my time playing this game might just be waning as well, and there is no time for the massive pile of negativity thats festered itself within this guild.. I can no longer positively affect any change that might improve the lives of the members of Frozen Spirits, and I realize thats a shocking revelation to hear from an officer.. the only capacity I could fulfill as an officer was to be a positive role model, but those get pretty much ignored in this guild, preferring to emulate the loudest people.. <br>
couple that with being lumped in with the leaders (and raidleader) when so many feel that they are being cheated by those same people, makes me want to distance myself from them as much as possible, becuase this game is all about reputation as a player and as a person, and being lumped in with people that even within the guild have shady reputations, has become too much for me to continue with.. not all of the officers are shady, but the rotten is too close to the core to cut out.. <br>
<br>
Im quite sure I will be blasted for this, and you can go ahead and have at it.. but, I personally have felt for weeks now that the only way this guild would ever recover and progress would be without detah and hayley in leadership roles.. I have actually SEEN both of these people treat myself and others either in officerchat or in private with such disrespect and downright cheating methods (such as having others bid on an item so that others couldnt get, I saw personally one incident, and have heard rumors of 2 others from people that I would trust more than either hayley or detah), and most of you would have left a long time ago.. I didnt say anything about them, so for that I am just as guilty, and punishment for me for that is to not be in the guild... <br>
<br>
detah really likes to say that I &quot;act all high and mighty&quot;, and you know what, I like that, thanks Detah!! I dont cheat people out of anything, I at least try to treat people <br>
with basic respect (until they show me disrespect first, detah), and I like to give the benefit of the doubt, until they show that they arent worthy of that.. I also dont show <br>
two faces.. I dont say how glad I am to see someone playing again, only to call them a &quot;little bitch&quot; and &quot;dont have much respect for a woman who would throw away her children <br>
^_^&quot;.. thats right folks, detah, was so happy to see jorran come back to playing the game just a few weeks ago, sends those as tells after she deguilded.. no asking why, just went <br>
straight to the attitude that Ive seen far too many times.. <br>
mvancexedia: so, even if my intentions were to deguild as an officer to become a regular member were dashed right then and there... <br>
<br>
while Im thinking about it, I have 12kpp worth of cash, and 2 backpacks worth of junk loot/pearls/dots that belong to the guild, and a couple mules with spells looted on raids, and shissarbane weapons that belong to the guild as well.. I'll be needing to get those to someone still in the guild.. <br>
In the end, everybody has to do what they feel is right, and this is what I feel is right for myself.. I got in this guild because of a technicallity, tried my best to help the <br>
guild grow (despite detah's claim that I have done one thing to help this guild).. I didnt ask to be an officer, they came to me.. the only raid I ever asked that we do for selfish reasons was CT Ring of Slime, and the one time the one item I wanted from there dropped, I did not bid so that others could get, even though I wanted them badly.. and even then I was called names in officer channel.. I hate raiding with a passion, but yet I leave the guild with the most dkp of any caster (and coincidentally didnt do the burn dkp and leave thing).. yes my friends, I am a selfish bastard and everything that the people that dont like me will say about me is true.. <br>
<br>
I hope you all the best of luck, and enjoy what you are doing when you are playing this game.. feel free to send tells to jorran and myself, because Im sure we'll be looking for <br>
more for xp a lot since we wont be raiding much.. now, more than ever, the sig at the bottom speaks the truth... <br>

<br>
Thats a mighty bold statement, I am glad to see that you speak for the core of FS.  You can blame me for people leaving, and yes a few left because of decisions that were made by leadership.  <br>
<br>
The rest that have moved on are leaving for the desire of higher end content.  This has been a long time coming, and to be honest, im surprised it didnt happen sooner.  everyone makes mistakes, and perhaps if the anon poster had the balls to reveal his own name we could all have a better understanding of his frustration.  <br>
<br>
Whatever anyones opinion of me may be, and whatever drama you may wish to start yet again dragging my name in to your issues, go for it.  I am one person.  I can take accountability for me, and me only.  I do not believe that I have treated anyone unfairly.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line was, FS degenerated from having 70 people online at any given time to having 50 then 40 then 30.  We can't raid jack with those numbers.  If you wish to blame me entirely for the fall of FS, thats fabulous. <br>
<br>
To be honest?   I was looking for an out personally.  Scraping the bottom of the barrel for someone to lead this guild came up with me.  Abandonded by the 2 previous guild leaders and not wanting to see FS fail, I tried my best.<br>
<br>
It's really difficult to lead people when a great majority of the guild wants to be constructive and the rest want to be destructive. I am sure this flame will also degenerate in to a post about how I loot whored everything from FS and how FS was there for nothing but my amusement.  That's fine.<br>
<br>
Unless you have lead a guild this size, you can't really know what it's like to log in and be inundated with complaints for 6 hours straight.  Not to mention the emais at work, the phone calls to members to better understand their drama and the attempts to resolve customer service issues to keep your guild afloat.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 Hayleys attempt to just make the truth go away again pretty much guaranteed that wouldnt happen.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your issue was with me, not the people that you attempted to drag in to your flame. <br>
<br>
I don't mind the truth, but stick to your main issue, don't try to drag innocent people in to your attempt to thrash me. I will admit that I failed FS, and for that I am truly sorry. <br>
<br>
People don't like me for whatever reason, and thats ok too. Different people have different approaches to getting the same things done. I took an aggressive approach to leading FS rather than a meek one. Perhaps this meant pissing a few people off, but I didn't know any other way to bring this guild in to the higher end game. I made some mistakes, burned some bridges, and yes, the good with the bad gained some respect. <br>
<br>
I don't care what people think of me, and I don't care that I have to shoulder the blame for several members leaving. It's only natural to have to blame and point fingers when something happens we have no control over. <br>
<br>
Several people were unhappy with the lack of FS progression. Heck even I was unhappy with our progression. I did the best I could with these people, and I was honest with them. The people that stuck by this guild, Treehugga, Ninidir, Seule, those of you looking for higher end content, I consider you all the best type of people. I understand your desires to move in to pop, and respect your decision. <br>
<br>
Rather than try to burn more bridges and hold people back, I choose instead to support my friends and guild mates and encourage them to pursue the content that makes them happy. Content I lack the knowledge, and ability to raid. I won't deny that. <br>
<br>
To be honest, I breathe a sigh of relief knowing that I am going to be relieved of some of that stress.  Maybe I can find some enjoyment in that game rather than dread loggin in to hear complaint after complaint. I used to be on leave from my job, and used to have the time to deal with crap like this.  I had to return to work for several reasons.  I just thank god that my employer still held my job after being fine 14 months.<br>
<br>
But alas, I have found sunshine, money, friends and wow...I have a family.  Thank you, for giving me the out I needed.  I really do still wish I could play EQ 15hours per day, and I really do wish I could wade through shit and drama with the fabulous fine people of Saryrn.<br>
<br>
Rather than see any good in the things that I attempted to do for FS, its all bad.  I expect that everyone will have something to say on the matter.  Come on, Lemme have it!<br>
Let the flames begin, because after all, im an evil bitch with a shady reputation that has never done a single act of kindness nor given my resources to anyone.  Right?<br>

Nope Hayley unlike you, I stand behind my name and my characters for good and for bad.  I dont feel the need to log in anon here or to log on alts to pester other guilds because they wouldnt talk to you if they knew who you were.  I have no problem with standing up and saying how worthless I think you are and that your greed and lies have led to the utter downfall of FS.  Congrats.<br>

Hayley I never had much of a problem with - I could even ignore some of the shadiness b/c she was always good to me.  Detah is another matter.  Immature, mean, cruel person.  He is one of the big reasons people keep leaving FS...he's certainly one of the main reasons I quit yesterday.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of some of the abuse a person has to go through in FS if they disagree with Detah:<br>

How about log in, play, level, and do something other than cheat people out of Tunare earrings, Maneta. Go make your shitty smart ass comments elsewhere. <br>

<br>
Nin then stuck up for me and said she didnt steal the earring.<br>
<br>
Detah replied:<br>
Actually, Ninidir, she did.  When Hayley tells me she feels she can't bid on something because of all the back door campaigning then, yeah, stuff happened.  There is no reason a level 65 shaman without max FT and no earrings anywhere close to those stats would pass, and you know this she did not want to pass, not in the slightest.  Go remove your head from Maneta's butt and shut up when you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  I'm tired of this you suddenly know everything attitude, Ninidir.  How about go back trolling your former guild boards, Nebula, or doing stuff behind this guilds back with OS? <br>

<br>
you are a horrible person, you know that?<br>
<br>
you were given warning to shut up, but yet, you continue to defy authority time and time again. you place yourself above everyone else, while, knowing outright that one of the #1 main reasons why our attendance suffering, and difficulty of recruiting comes directly through you, and you're attitude problems. Grow the hell up already. <br>
<br>
<br>
and then Ninidir replied:<br>
<br>
Thanks for showing your true colors detah.<br>
<br>
If hay really wanted the Item she could have gotten it. I was there at the same time as you, so you have no right to say jack to me about this subject. Seeth passed as well as Hayley. Why who knows, cares. Maneta didnt pressure anyone, if you feel this way im sorry.<br>
<br>
And dont talk about OS when you were part of taking out telk during raid hours for FS and Vindi 2 times, etc. You cant make me look bad when your playing on the wrong side yourself.<br>
<br>
You need to grow up, put your head on straight. <br>
<br>
<br>
And then i sent Detah a PM explaining how i was sick of his controlling behaviour and how id be surprised if he didnt reply by calling me names<br>
<br>
his reply:<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to inform you, Maneta, the world does not revolve around you.  I don't care about, especially to the point of trying to control you in the slightest.  Not being mean, but I don't sign on to plot, devise and scheme how I'm going to mess with Maneta.  You don't even begin to cross my mind honestly. <br>
I have no elitist attitudes.  I want the rules to be followed.  Sorry, you weren't a member of this guild when it fell down to like /w all guild would be less than 10 people, you don't know how we disintergrated to almost nothing, because people got sick and tired of the rules breaking bullshit.  Sorry, I care about my guild and want it to survive, grow strong and prosper.  I don't lead every raid and put up with all this junk for &quot;fun&quot;.  It quite frankly isn't and you don't even begin to have the first inkling of what you are talking about. Actually, you are the only one with an elitist attitude.  You sit up on high with your friends and make snide, rude comments all the time and expect to do it with no retribution it seems.  How about remove the stick from your butt and stop whining, insulting and making fun of others and try and do something for yourself instead of blaming others for your problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
I then spoke to seeth, who said:<br>
<br>
<br>
I passed on that earring because I had just gotten that really nice shield and because I like you and felt you deserved it from your raid attendance and such. Hay on the otherhand kept crying to me in tells for 5 mins about her damn reputation to the guild of being a loot whore. I told her to do what she wanted but I was passing to you.<br>
<br>
You can post that to the thread if you like.<br>

I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you're one of those people.  Take out any possibility that I might believe you engaged in these back-door shenanigans and that fact remains.  You don't exhibit the qualities of a good leader.  That you can't even speak to members of other guilds on your main characters is just one example that attests to this simple fact.<br>
<br>
All those accomplishments you listed (AL, Tuna, AoW) were first done before you took over as GL.  When the guild still had direction and focus.  When the guild had a strong leader to look to for those things.  Do you really attribute the timing between Aono's departure and the guild's decline to pure coincidence?  I assure you, it isn't.<br>
<br>
This isn't a flame.  It's not a personal attack.  It's a simple statement.  You are not cut out to be a leader. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7981">Dakston Darkbow</a><br>65th Man in Tights (unretired)<br>

My life has changed to a point where this game isn't my number one priority anymore.  Aonodorus was not the only one responsible for FS rising to what could have been great.  For a period of approximately one month after Team Tab left, he did lead us in to SSRA, and did have the ability to camp spawns there.  <br>
<br>
Saying that I did nothing to lead us in to higher end content is just another attempt to tear me down.  It's ok to give credit where credit is due, but saying I didnt have the initiative or the ability is utter BS.  What I dont understand is why you are not willing to at least admit that I tried when no one else would.  I never said I was the supreme being of FS, I never claimed to be the sole contributor.<br>

<br>
no I attribute it to realizing I had sat on my ass for 14 months in front of this computer, doing nothing but playing this game.  I had no choice but to return to my job, and when I did it helped decline.  I strongly feel that if I hadnt had to return to work, I would be sitting on spawns too.  Both Aono and I had IRL throw us a curve ball, and neither one of us could do what we committed to do.  IRL &gt; EQ.<br>
<br>
If I was doing such a suck ass job, Dakston you were more than welcome to step up and try to help.  Besides there is a lot more to be a leader than simply leading raids.  You have to be a social worker, a counslor, a mother, a vending machine and a punching bag.  One person cant do it all.  Every leader of this guild, necole, tab, aono, myself, xedia, detah and every member made those accomplishments.  <br>
