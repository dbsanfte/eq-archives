Got that waking-up-in-the-gutter-mouth-full-of-cotton-something-sticky-on-me sensation.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in one of the threads I've inhabited here recently, Vainne says &quot;It doesn't have to be this way,&quot; and she's right.  Fact is, relationships between the larger guilds have improved over the past year, there's just a little bit less of that wild-west feeling.  Chances of an actual race on a given day have been diminished by the vastness of the raiding content, and anyone at the level of ToS, ToN, TWC and above has an innate understanding of the unwritten rules of the game, and we generally don't put ourselves in positions where we are vulnerable to each other.<br>
<br>
Its also pretty clear that the leaders of the elemental capable guilds have at least some comittment to cooperation.  Backflagging agreements have sprung up on (almost) all sides to ease the incessant pain of having to whack Magnetic Bejesus for the 800th time so that 3 more recruits can get into the Planes.  Some guilds actually talk to each other regularly to avoid butting heads.  This is all far from sweetness and light, but its also far removed from the barefisted brawl that it could be.<br>
<br>
In the past six months, there has been a tremendous shakeout among the larger guilds on this server, produced by the pressures of raiding in PoP and the high end of Luclin.  Some guilds have disappeared, some are shadows of their former selves, some have consolidated, and a very small group have thrived and continued to advance.  The leaders of these successful guilds know intimately just how much pressure and stress is involved in advancing through the high end of the game, contesting not only with herding 70+ man raids through buggy scripted events, but with other guilds competing for access to those same events.  I think the growing raprochement between the guilds, overt or not, is evidence of a universal desire for there to be less energy going into pissing on each others petunias.  <br>
<br>
To put it a bit more simply, game is hard enough without being at each other's throats constantly.  I try to remember this, generally I succeed, but to my chagrin I occasionally forget, and all of a sudden I'm climbing the ramparts with a torch in my hand and blood in my eye.  And all because some dumb kid pulled a stunt that he now has cause to regret.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at my posts here of the past few days and the one that stands out to me is the one where I condemn TWC as a whole, saying that nothing they can possibly say will convince me of jack, because to me they are all liars.  Now, I don't like TWC, they have been the bull in our path for far too long for me to be even remotely chummy with them.  But I know in my head (the big one) that the majority of them are not hellspawn.  Some of them used to be guildmates, and are still on my list of folks I like.  And while we have had some pretty brutal races for Seru and Ssra mobs recently, with plenty of knees and elbows being thrown around, none of it reached the level of what we used to be dealing with in NToV so long ago.  Sorry if it waters down your rep guys, but TWC is annoying, and its pushy, but you do actually have some standards, you've proved it more than once recently.<br>
<br>
So I come here to say this.  TWC are not demons, they do not lie with each breath they take.  I hope that something like normal guild relations can occur between us someday.  I think that would be a good thing for both guilds. Meanwhile, we would appreciate it if you would keep your younger/more foolish members out from under our feet.  Do that, and we can be something like cordial even.  For my own part, I plan to stop throwing bombs, and to ignore the ceaseless and reflexive provocations that are par for the course here in the Blast Furnace.<br>
<br>
Who knows, we might all have more fun. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nayl7>Nayl7</A> at: 9/5/03 6:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anduransaryrn>Anduran Saryrn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/images/avatars/187040ee3deea6510867d.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Doing it Dingo Style!</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/5/03 7:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3526.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morning after</span><hr size=1> I hear ya, fighting on the blast furnace achieves nothing.

<br>
You hear stuff, and you get a bit ticked off, and post on blast furnace so your opinion is heard, usually what is posted doesn't generally reflect truly on what you feel or think, it's just one small side that comes out through either anger/frustration/pity/whatnot.  Usually what you see here are the ass-ends of people, thier very worst traits.<br>
<br>
Talk to bdaan, arma, myself, nand, or anyone else from TWC who looks stupid here, in game, I guarantee you'll think differently of us, and i'd say it holds true for anyone who posts here.  Shit talk with Rthen in game and he's a nice guy, no conspiracies, no FBI, no CIA, just normal chit chat.<br>

But all in all your on the right track . Last night in POF i heard some grats and shit over /ooc not one snide comment, it was making me all warm and fuzzy &quot;down there&quot; and also made me realize your probably right. <br>
It was kinda nice not having the same old tripe spewed back and forth. So like i said in a previous post ,learn to separate the &quot;On the Court&quot; trash talk from the actual grudges and we may all just get along in the elementals. There's nothing wrong with some &quot; in your face&quot; competition just some people take it to far instead of letting it make them more competitive .<br>

<br>
We are a guild alliance - full alliance as in every raid is with the 3 membership guilds involved - even the night shift - we are bored what mobs are up raids like AL, AoW etc. We also tend to group together and such. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the only reason we are not a single guild is due to history and guild culture - DW is a more international guild, and the languages in guildchat tends to be Japanese and English with some others thrown in for good measure (you see Dutch and German from time to time). Forces and UB are both Japanese guilds, and have been in the game for years - they are more of a close knit group of friends with a few recruits added from time to time.<br>
<br>
The alliance works as to get to potime we need to be allied, but we keep our own identities as guilds - we kinda get the best of both worlds. Every guild member is as dedicated to making the alliance work as their own guild working - and I would say for about 85% of the time SR could be my guild as much as DW.<br>
<br>
I must admit when the alliance was first started I didnt expect it to work - but it does and it works well - if you can accept working 110% with another guild(s) and accepting orders / directions from raidleaders outside your guild I would recommend being part of an alliance to anybody.<br>

<br>
False!  You would think that people would learn by now that fighting on the Blast Furnace serves as entertainment.  Granted it's been fairly piss-poor entertainment for a while, there's not been a good quality fight in a long time.  Thankfully there are still those, like Nayl for example, who take this stuff seriously and feel the need to post as such.  If it weren't for such people this place could not give us even the small amount of amusement that it currently does. <br>
<br>
Thank you Nayl, and thank you for all of the little people with an over developed sense of importance that you represent.  <p>-Tain<BR>

Only diffrence is -1. We are not as far as Team Japan -2. Not as expeirenced in strategies as Team Japan.<br>

But one thing remains the same, without Familjen or Fyrelake Guardians we wouldnt of taken down some of the lower tier flagging targets without them. GoL use to be a small group of people and only recently due to some accomplishments and some people returning to EQ(God knows why?) that we have actually jumped in members drastically so we are forced to do what each other higher up guild is forced to do and reflag and regear and start back at square 1. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.bokuza.com/sigs/bok50.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=juviskystalker>JuviSkystalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/5/03 2:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3526.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.beldar.com/~jld/images/avatar01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is This Seat Taken?</span><hr size=1> Me and Anduran already have reserved seats awaiting us in Hell.
