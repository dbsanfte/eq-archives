comments until he is actually wearing a championship ring.  <br>
<br>
I think alot will depend on the coaching decision Gordon Gund makes for his team.  Assuming it's either Paul Silas or Jeff Van Gundy either will do well there, however i feel that Paul Silas would be more of a detrimental choice for the &quot;raising&quot; of a guy like Lebron.<br>
<br>
Saying he is the best &quot;wingman&quot; as you put it since Len Bias is very much a matter of opinion.  I could easily make a case for Grant Hill, Kobe Bryant and a few others.  <br>
<br>
Also you can't compare him to Chris Webber.  CWebb is very much a &quot;4&quot; and actually has an outstanding post game.  Why he doesn't go to it more often and settles for the 20 foot jumpers is beyond me.<br>
<br>
I think two things Lebron has &quot;yet&quot; to prove is his willingness to win.(I'm sorry but i don't care how much he can do or does, unless he is a winner at the next level he will not go down as the greatest.)  And the other is how well he will defend.  Training with last years Cav's team doesn't say awhole lot.  <br>
<br>
His jumper needs some work, although there have been guys of similar build that have come into the league with &quot;not the best shooting&quot;, Grant Hill and Magic Johnson are two guys that come to mind but there are quite a few others.<br>
<br>
The NBA(just like all professional sports) is about two things...winning and revunue.  Since winning usually brings revenue the two often go hand in hand.  Cleveland will have sell outs the whole year, both when they play at home and when they play on the road.  Depending on how well Lebron develops will determine future results.  <br>
<br>
I'm actually cheering for the guy.  I love to watch greatness and i hope he can evolve into that dominant winning player that Michael Jordan was.  Either way you look at it, he's got a daunting task ahead of him and alot of expectations on his shoulders.<br>
<br>
As far as some of the other comments about &quot;the guy not doing any work to get where he got to&quot;.  That's utter bullshit.  I've played with guys that played at the Junior College/D3/ and even D2 college level.  Guys that were 6'8&quot; with a great build and could jump through the roof.  However they never got any further then that.  I've watched those same guys play in shabby semi-pro leagues and sit at the end of the bench.  Getting to the level of competition that the NBA is at as well as other proffesional sports is all about hard work.  Hard work to get there and then learning a whole new meaning of &quot;Hard work&quot; once you are already there.<br>
<br>
P.S.  The NBA is about alot more then just isolation.  While isolation is a big part of the game there is far more to winning a championship then just having a guy who can isolate and having some good shooters who can knock down open shots.  It's about those role players being able to move without the ball, it's about having a solid team unity and alot of it depends on having a good all around defensive team.  Name one team that has won a championship that wasn't a very good or great defensive team.  MJ said it best...&quot;Offense wins games, Defense wins championships)  <br>
<br>
In fact as far as isolation goes i agree alot with something Tim Legler said recently.  So many games are going down to the wire lately and so many teams are getting horrible looks at the basket or not even any looks at all (Read: the philly vs. det series).  Run the offense a little bit.  The Bulls thrived off of the triangle offense.  MJ got so many great looks at game winners because of the triangle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quirtevans>QuirtEvans</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/24/03 7:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: uh</span><hr size=1> &quot;utter bullshit&quot;, huh?  You have no clue what you're talking about.  <br>
<br>
Darryl Dawkins went pro after high school, maybe you'd care to defend what a hard worker he was.  I think every coach and every teammate he ever had, in high school and in the NBA, would disagree, I think they would all say that the &quot;man-child&quot; never worked hard on his game in high school or in the pros.  That shouldn't interfere with your opinion that you can't make it to the NBA without hard work.  <br>
<br>
Did you know that NBA rookies, during their orientation, are given a video of &quot;can't miss&quot; athletic talents who were complete busts, because they never developed good work habits and didn't put the time and effort into their game?  They are given a video because none of these kids believe that some name they've never heard of could play ball the way they can play ball.  They think they are special, they are different, and that they are guaranteed to be All-Stars in their rookie year.  The video is part of the NBA's effort to convince these kids that it can happen to them, that they aren't guaranteed successes and that they have to work hard on their game.  It doesn't always penetrate, but the NBA tries.  <br>
<br>
The best example of wasted potential may be David Thompson.  He could jump through the roof, he had absolutely unlimited athletic potential, and he dominated in college.  He could have been one of the best ever, based solely on his athletic potential, but he never met expectations as a pro.  Why?  Because his work ethic stunk.  It wasn't that he worked in college and then stopped working when he got to the NBA.  His work ethic always stunk.  He was just able to use his exceptional athletic talent to outplay the hard workers in college.  That didn't work in the NBA.  <br>
<br>
The sad fact is that many 18 year-olds are drafted into the NBA today not on the basis of the hard work they have put in during their first 18 years, but on the basis of athletic potential.  NBA teams are getting better at identifying whether a player has the personal characteristics to be a success, but they still draft some people on the basis of athletic ability alone.  (So does the NFL, ever hear of Randy Moss?)  Some will pan out, others won't.  And the difference between the two will often be how hard they are willing to work, once they arrive.  Sometimes they come ready to work, sometimes they figure it out after getting embarrassed a bit, and sometimes they never get it.  <br>
<br>
Where does LeBron fit in all this?  I can't say yet.  Most of his natural gifts are not developed skills, though, they are gifts.  His court sense, for example.  Please, talk to a pro scout before you tell me again how hard he worked to develop it.  Any scout you talk to will tell you, that sort of court sense can't be taught, you either have it or you don't.  Magic had it.  Larry Bird had it.  LeBron seems to have it.  But he didn't earn it.  <br>

Lebron could be as good as Michael Jordan.  But you don't have to be in order to win.  In fact that is rarely enough to win. I realize most of you don't remember, but there was just as much hype (although less money) about Shawn Kemp being drafted right out of highschool.  He was going to be the next big thing.  Well, it doesn't always work out that way. One guy can't do it.  Even Jordan wouldn't have been able to do it without Pippen, or someone else to pick up the slack.<br>
<br>
A superior one on one player might be able to make that basket at the end of the game to win. <br>
<br>
A superior team player doesn't have to because you're not in that position when the buzzer sounds.  <br>
<br>
Lebron could even be that team player, but there's few enough other people out there who are in the league that it doesn't matter any more.  It's sad watching a game these days, and one person isn't going to make any difference. <p>-Tain<BR>

He still averaged 22 ppg for his NBA career and had his number retired a little while back in Denver.<br>
<br>
Don't know much about Dawkins but he had a 14 year NBA career.  <br>
<br>
Even still that was a different time then.  Weight lifting was not a big part of training.  Guys today are bigger and more physical then ever before.  <br>
<br>
I still stand by what i say about work ethics.  Some work harder and want it more then others.  Some guys work hard and then get lazy(I.E. Stanley Roberts) but usually you see their name disappear from the spotlight as soon as that is the case.  But my comment was based on Lebron's situation.  You don't get to where he was without working hard to get there.<br>
<br>
*edit* I'm not saying athletic ability has nothing to do with if a guy gets drafted or not.  It has alot to do with it.  My point is just because a guy is young, athletic and good don't assume he doesn't put forth any effort. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=altiari>Altiari</A> at: 5/24/03 9:06:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyntaro@thesaryrntavern>Kyntaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/25/03 12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> shaq</span><hr size=1> Shaq is THE perfect example this year in the game of how being lazy will cost you and your team. <br>

Those are just a couple off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
You know who usually makes the best overall players? Guys like Jerry Rice, drafted in the 7th round out of a little known school..lower mississippy valley state. Joe Montana, who was drafted late, because of weak arm strength, the list goes on and on. <br>
<br>
Until he proves he can hang with the NBA, guys who have been playing for more years than he has been able to walk or dribble a ball, then perhaps he will be given some credit. Until then I think Nike made a big mistake. Time to sell my shares in their stock. <br>

You're still missing the point.<br>
Someone who can make their own shot may be able to score a bucket when they need to.  That will win a few games, but it most certainly won't win championships. An individual contributer wins individual awards, which I'm sure his teammates are thrilled about when they're all watching the playoffs, instead of playing in them. <br>
<br>
Let's see how the league's top scorers are doing right now.  Oh!  Look at that, the top five scorers this season are sitting home right now, not playing.  They make lots of shots for themselves.  Guess it didn't help.  <br>
<br>
Being able to score when you want to doesn't make you a superstar.  Winning will.  There's a difference. <p>-Tain<BR>

<br>
YES you have to have teamates to win championships, yes you have to play defense we all know that, duh, but you MUST be able to have someone to break down their defender on a consistent basis. Every championshp team has at least 1. Saying the top 5 scorers are fishing right now is pointless, Kareem couldnt have done it alone, neither could Wilt or Michael, no shit. I'm not sure what your point about that was but anyway....<br>
<br>
Name a team that won a championship without a &quot;superstar 1 on 1 player&quot;....<br>
<br>
Here is your lesson pay attention Tain<br>
SACRAMENTO.<br>
<br>
Chris Webber takes 18 foot jumpers because he can and the offense they run is a double high post with Vlade, when that play is broken it goes to Chris in the post or Vlade in the post. Until this year Chris didnt have a solid jump hook or a go to move. That ALONE is why they havent won jack. Who was the &quot;go to guy&quot;? You know what that means?<br>
<br>
Nobody on that team can create their own shot consistently (Mike Bibby did last year and surprised everyone, not this year, teams learned and played him straight up) and that is why you always hear Charles Barkley say &quot;until Chris Webber demands the ball and takes the team on his shoulder they will never win a championship&quot; <br>
<br>
YOU NEED 1 ON 1 PLAYERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN SHOTS AND THAT IS WHAT LEBRON JAMES WILL BRING TO CLEVELAND. <br>
<br>
Too much EQ not enough real world there guy. <br>

What you're describing used to be a strategy.  One out of many ways to win.  Unfortunatly today it's become the only way the game is played.  <br>
<br>
Now I don't blame you, it's the only thing people get to see these days.  Now turn the clock back a bit.  Find some NBA games from the 60s, 70s, or 80s on ESPN Classic.  They're on all the time.  <br>
<br>
Larry Bird or Magic Johnson could have broken virtually any record they wanted to. Do you know why they didn't?  They didn't have to in order to win.  Would you argue that Bird and Magic aren't two of the best players to ever play the game?  Yet how often did their teams clear out and let them take someone one-on-one?  Here's a hint:  Not very often.  Why?  Because there are better ways to win.  <br>
<br>
It's fairly ironic, I'd suggest that the degeneration of the NBA is directly due to the greatest individual player that ever played the game.  Once Jordan started almost single handedly winning other people thought they could do it too.  The problem is there's only one Michael Jordan, and he didn't do it alone.  But kids coming up now think they can be the next Jordan, they think they're going to be the one to do it all.  It's just not going to happen.  <br>
<br>
Lebron may well be the next Webber, the next Barkley, the next Dominique Wilkins.  All that means is he'll be a great player, without a championship ring.   <p>-Tain<BR>

<br>
How do you know what, how long and who I've watched? I saw 9 out of 11 of Bill Russel's championship runs. Magic's game was absolutely NOT going 1 on 1, he was a passer in transition and hey get this when it was a half court set guess what he did? Give it to Lew Alcindor and get out of the way or wait for a rebound, if there was one. <br>
<br>
Bird just worked harder than others did and was a high percentage shooter and made great decisions. The Celtics were also stacked with Parish McHale Ainge and Johnson so 1 on 1 play by Bird was never necessary but hey guess what, when they needed points who did they give it to? Bird. The 5 Championships the Lakers won who was the &quot;go to guy&quot;? Hey theres that phrase again &quot;go to guy&quot;, Lew Alcindor. Someone who can score 1 on 1 at will. You getting this? Iso's forces defenses to make decisions. Let the superstar go off or let the roleplayers go off. <br>
<br>
Barkley and Nique didnt get rings because....Management and ownership didnt get them any help. Orlando is a prime example of how they are trying to NOT waste Tracy McGrady's talent and win a championship. They WILL win the East next year IF Grant Hill can give them 20 minutes a game. <br>
<br>
If you want to argue every point of an NBA game we could be here all day but you are still wrong in believeing 1 on 1 play is a detriment to an NBA team. It is necessary. LeBron James will bring superb athletic 1 on 1 talent to the Cavs. <br>
<br>
Dont forget and heres a punch right through your point about Jordan and where you are contradicting yourself, he changed the game and made it even more evident that 1 on 1 play can change the scoreboard and win championships. When you can flat out score on anyone it causes hell for defenses. <br>
<br>
Name a team that won a championship without a great 1 on 1 player? You still cant. You can go all the way back to George Mikhan.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tallaini>Tallaini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/25/03 6:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Make no sense</span><hr size=1> Hey guys... not to interrupt your basketball debate, but it is Larry BYRD.... not Bird.<br>

<br>
Larry Bird<br>
<br>
Enshrined: As a player on October 2, 1998<br>
Born: December 7, 1956 in West Baden, IN<br>
Height: 6-foot-9<br>
Weight: 220 pounds <br>
 <br>
In a storybook career that began in the small Indiana town of West Baden, where he led Springs Valley High School to the state sectional championship, and concluded with his number 33 jersey being retired by the Boston Celtics, Larry Bird enjoyed a legendary 13-year professional career with the Celtics. In 1979, when Bird joined the Celtics, he launched an era both in Boston and throughout the NBA that may never again be duplicated. At a time when the league and the Celtics needed a boost, Bird and fellow rookie sensation Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson provided the spark. By the time Bird retired in 1992, he held or shared 27 Celtics' records and had brought three more NBA championship banners to Boston in 1981, 1984 and 1986. On two other occasions (1985 and 1987), the Celtics reached the NBA Finals.<br>
<br>
A 12-time NBA All-Star and MVP of the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird was selected as the sixth overall pick in the 1978 draft. Following the draft, Bird returned to the college ranks for his senior season and completed a memorable career at Indiana State. Bird, who won the Sporting News, Naismith and Wooden awards as national college Player of the Year in 1979, led ISU to an 81-13 three-year record, including a 33-1 mark in 1979, the year Bird's Indiana State team lost to Johnson's Michigan State squad in the national championship game. Bird holds 30 ISU records, including most points (2,850), steals (240) and rebounds (1,247). He scored in double figures in 93 of 94 games, tallied 40 or more points 15 times and recorded six triple doubles.<br>
<br>
Prior to Bird's arrival in Boston in 1979, the Celtics had failed to make the playoffs for two straight seasons. His first season, Bird was named NBA Rookie of the Year and the Celtics advanced to the conference finals, the start of 13 straight postseason appearances. In Bird's 13 seasons, Boston won 10 Atlantic Division titles, had six 60-plus-win seasons and toppled the 50-win mark 12 times.<br>

<br>
&quot;Name a team that won a championship without a 'superstar 1 on 1 player'....&quot;<br>
<br>
The New York Knicks, 1970 version.  That team had Frazier, Reed, DeBusschere, Bradley, and Barnett.  None of them were the sort of player who could break a defense down one on one .. not even Frazier.  They won with great unselfish team play and with spectacular defense.  Frazier was certainly their leader, but he wasn't a one on one scorer, he was more of a defensive wizard and a &quot;true&quot; point guard (he averaged only about 19 points a game over his career).  Ask any knowledgeable NBA observer from that time, and they will tell you that the Knicks did not win by having a superstar break down the defense one on one and command a double team.  They won with team play and motion offense.  One of the great unselfish teams of all time.  <br>
<br>
I'd argue that the 1973 Knicks also didn't have a superstar one on one player.  You might that that Earl (the Pearl) Monroe was that sort of player, he certainly was earlier in his career, but that wasn't his role for the Knicks.  Monroe only averaged about 16 points a game during his tenure with the Knicks, hardly superstar numbers, and he wasn't their &quot;go to&quot; guy at the end of games.<br>
<br>
In fact, the Knicks' &quot;go to&quot; guy during the 1970s, at the end of games, was often Bill Bradley, a player renowned for being completely unable to get his own shot.  Bradley was a master at running off picks, and players like Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, and Jerry Lucas knew how to set picks to get him free for his shot. <br>
<br>
You know who else played for the Knicks during that period?  Phil Jackson.  Here's a quote from his official NBA biography: &quot;With stars Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere and Cazzie Russell, New York won not by featuring individual greatness but by maximizing collective achievement.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The team that comes closest to that model in today's NBA is the Spurs, but they do have a superstar .. it just happens that he's the most unselfish superstar in the NBA.  Tim Duncan is a throwback, in the best sense of that term.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=altiari>Altiari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:red;'>Misfit Tracker</span></span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/25/03 9:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.familjenguild.com/phishlogo.gif width=108 height=54></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Team Play</span><hr size=1> Don't forget Jordan existed in the NBA for six years before winning a title.  Kind of ironic that as soon as Tex Winter brought the Triangle to Chicago all of a sudden it was banner mania.  There is no doubt that MJ brought all of those championships to Chicago and he is the greatest player of all time.  But i think things may have been different had Phil Jackson(and staff) not been there.  A matter of opinion.<br>
<br>
As far as weather or not the league is worse off then it was years ago is also a matter of opinion.  The league can sell superstars, it's what our society thrives on.  The sensationalism of the greats.  I think that is very reflective of what we see when the NBA gets represented in the media.  The league wants to make guys out to be stars.  It brings in the crowd and makes the revenue go up.  <br>
<br>
Any team that wins though has to move the ball.  It's not only a one on one show.  It helps to have a superstar guy that can break people down but you have to have movement.<br>
<br>
The Spurs and Nets are both teams that pass the ball very well and fortunately for those of us who enjoy the NBA we are going to probably see those two teams going head to head for the ultimate prize come June 4th.<br>
<br>
On a side note i've seen Duncan and Kidd in person a few times from seats near the court.  It's amazing how much better they are in person.  What amazed me most was their passing ability.  Duncan's ability to pass out of the post and Kidd's court vision is amazing, the guy has his head up always looking to hit a teammate.  <br>
<br>
The teamwork and unselfishness is there, you just have to look for it behind the highlight reels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quirtevans>QuirtEvans</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/26/03 4:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Team Play</span><hr size=1> Yeah, the game does look very different from courtside.
