Pay, OR advertise as recompinsense. Fuck both.&quot;<br>
<br>
Folks, it's the artist's property.  They get to decide what they want if .. if .. IF .. they are willing to give you limited rights to use their property.  If they want to make you pay, and advertise, and attach a picture of your naked butt, and smooch a chimpanzee in heat on national television, all as a condition of using their property, that's their right.  Just as it's your right to decide the conditions are unreasonable, and you don't feel like doing that.  In which case, don't use their damn property.<br>
<br>
Your point of view can easily be reduced to the absurd.  Suppose they decide to charge $100.  You don't think $100 is reasonable, only $10 is reasonable.  Do you get to send them $10 and do as you please?  Of course not.  Just because they choose to make part of the price non-monetary, in the form of advertising, doesn't change the analysis one lick.  It's the artist's property, the artist can charge whatever it wants, and you can either pay it, or not, or negotiate.  But you can't just grab their work because you don't like the price or conditions.   <br>
<br>
I also find it very interesting, Ninen, that your &quot;take&quot; is that you'd feel entitled to grab the artist's work and mangle it whether or not it's right, or legal.  Perhaps there's some basis for TWC's rep as baby-killers after all.  <br>
<br>
Now that the entire e-mail has been revealed, Hayley has fallen completely silent.  Perhaps she hasn't seen any of this yet .. but given her deceptive and selective editing of the original e-mail, forgive me if I am skeptical.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arryalyse>Arry Alyse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/9/03 9:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3262.topic&index=262>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Fall of Frozen Spirits</span><hr size=1> Actually Quirt, thats not even the email in its entirity.  I am tired of the argument, tired of the lynch mob.  The people at EQPA have their donation that was made by me in faith, PRIOR to Ciara and zalf throwing a hiss fit.  <br>
<br>
In addition to that, the communication was between myself and another representative of that community.  We have had several email discussions, and have agreed amicably to not post one anothers communications on any forum.  Matter fact, that individual stated to me, that she asked her people to not post the email here to further exacerbate the flame.  <br>
<br>
I will state that that is an edited version of the email, and in order to comply with the wishes of said party, I will not make an attempt to dispell it.<br>
<br>
Regardless as to what lengths ciara and zalf and their puppet maneta need to go to try to make my life hell, they are but pixels and text in a virtual world.   It must be really sad to lead such a miserable existance that you have nothing better to do than to find new and amazing ways to attack, stalk and flame me.  <br>
<br>
Everyone wins this argument.  EQPA gets their money, Ciara gets to be right, zalf gets to be his typical asshole self and well, maneta, gets to just cut and paste forums repeatedly that no one is really interested in.  <br>
<br>
In your personal vendetta against me, you are all winners here!  Grats you on again getting Hayely yet again!!  Lets stay tuned to see what ELSE we can rip me apart for.  I for one, definatly cant wait!!<br>

<br>
I have no signature, on any boards, so therefore I have not only complied with their wishes, I have satisfied the hunger of the former FS vultures.  In addition I have learned fabulous volumes of information about copyright infringement.  <br>
<br>
I have attempted to make amends with EQPA for violating their user agreement, and I have removed that which was considered offensive.  I ask that you kindly refrain from additional personal attacks against my character.  <br>
<br>
Some one sent me a tell the other day, and asked me how it felt to be Saryrns most flamed female player.  I guess most days it feels pretty damn special to know that people are so interested in picking apart everything I do.  Other days its, rather burdensome because it makes me think.  Am I really this awful terrible person that people make me out to be?<br>
<br>
So then that leads me to think, do I really care what people like zalf, maneta etc think of me?  Will any of these people impact my life one week from now?  2 weeks?  A year?  The answer is no.  No they won't.<br>
<br>
I can only be true to myself, regardless of what impressions people may have of me.  I can only speak for myself and do what I feel is right with honesty and integrity.  Aha!  A flame opportunity!! Hayley said she was honest and had integrity!<br>
<br>
It has been argued time and again that I don't do the right or fair thing by my guild.  It has been eluded to that I steal from the guild bank.  I find it amazing that the only people making these accusations are those that felt unjustly treated by my decisions.  <br>
<br>
Let's take Zalf for example who doesnt want to pay the 15DKP for the H2H weapon off of AL.  Instead of 1) paying and looting he instead complains incessantly about the injustices of the pricing seeing as though hes the only one there that can use it.   Too bad, it rots.  I am accused of hoarding it for a twink! <br>
<br>
Lets take a long hard look at maneta.  This person whines and cries for days over a dozekar tear that she paid DKP for and wants a refund.  So sorry, so sad.  We all paid 4DKP for our Dozekar tears.  You want to use them, buy a MQ.  I did.  Instead, Maneta cries about the injustices of my decision by refusing to allow her the 4DKP credit.  Her reason?  She lost her DKP advantage and wants to buy things at the Burrower Parasite raid.  <br>
<br>
Am I an awful terrible person for 1) standing by the guild rules with conviction and not allowing this abuse of the system, or am I doing the right and fair thing by asking them to adhere to the rules?  I f asking them to adhere to the standard set forth and imposed upon the guild as a whole, then by all means, indeed, I will be the awful terrible.  <br>
<br>
Does it mean that because you have a bank account over 100K that you are a theif and are automatically stealing from your guild?  Does every guild leader fall under this suspicion?  Perhaps those considering me of theivery should take a hard look at the facts.  1) i share a bank account with 3 people.  Loot that is won in XP groups is split equally among the 3 of us.  Am I stealing from my fuild because I win a roll on an ornate pattern and sell it for profit as opposed to giving it to my guild?  Second, because I am a leader of the guild am I expected to give my droppable loot to the guild?  For that matter is it unjust to ask them to match the 80K offer from someone in another guild?  D and I can 1 group bot minis, that drop runes often.  Some of these spells sell for a fair amount of plat.  As the leader of the guild, do I have a responsibility to give rune spells to the members of my guild even if no one can use, or is not of sufficient level to use?  Or is it fair of me to sell the spells, to buy additional upgrades for myself and or the other 2 people I share an account with?  I can one group Halls of testing.  <br>
<br>
Does this imply that I am a theif for not giving all multi quests to guild members?  Is it not fair to sell multiquests that I have acquired on my own?  With the exception of Vainne, I cannot think of one tavern regular that would say with absolute conviction that they would expect to be able to distribute said lootages as they see fit if not aquired on a guild raid.  Don't get me wrong, I have several pieces of MQ loot avail for the asking.  I gladly and willingly give what I can to my extended family.  <br>
<br>
Where does one really draw the line on an acceptable level for the guild leaders bank account before they are named thieves? Does anyone actually have a concrete example as to how I profited from FS loot?  The answer, in itself is no.  I can think of *one* example of a misunderstanding that occurred that I can think of.  This happened after a Yelinak riad, and the person stated &quot;I wish to purchase the earring form the raid.&quot;  Confused, I said, &quot;For plat you mean?&quot;  Camped to a mule to check a raid target, got distracted and forgot to reply.  That earring now resides on Xariss.  I admit in my distraction, this could have been construed as unfair.  However in tells, the concern and confusion was resolved with the right parties.<br>
<br>
Matter fact, I can think of several examples, where I made it possible for others to purchase upgrades.<br>
<br>
2) FS does not get droppable loot other than just spells.  3) Spells that are acquired at guild raids are either sold to vendors or banked on 1 of 2 guild mules that EVERY officer has access to.  3) any and all droppable loot is rolled on for twinks, or DKP is spent depending upon the number of persons.  4) plat recieved from guild raids goes to pay for pearls, dots, and in many cases needed spells.  Case in point, F07 for a shaman thats no longer with the guild.  However, we did invest 20K to help them buy the spell.  example b) Sunstrike 30K.  Grats Wizard!  <br>
<br>
Let's also keep in mind that Aonodorus keeps many of the valuable spells and loot.  Funeral Pyre comes to mind.  Things like Dain cloaks happen to come to mind.  FS has an abundance of these.  They happen to be lore.  Hmmm lore.  That means 1 per character.  These types of items also happen to reside on guild mules.  Free for the asking for anyone in FS that wants!!  But alas, I dont scream that I have them, so indeed I *must* be a theif!!  <br>
<br>
I think perhaps the people accusing me of theivery are jealous and or bitter that they do not have the player resources available to them to farm said camps repeatedly.  Several people in this game are opportunists, and sieze the opportunity to make money.  Is this only allowed of you do not lead a major guild?  People like Anduran farm tradeskills and make insane profit.  Does TWC expect Anduran to give out said tradeskill product free as opposed to the current market value?  I think not.  Don't get me wrong, Im not saying that I don't share with my guild, I feel I give out much of my resources to better the guild.  I am of the attitude, if we cant afford it, let me help you get it.  All one has to do is ask.<br>
<br>
Seeing as though people are so quick to jump to conclusions, and make accusations because of their own personal feelings of injustice, I can only say this from my heart.  I am human.  I make bad judgement calls.  The signature was a bad judgement call. Maybe sometimes I don't think every decision through, but I am willing to admit that I learn from my mistakes.  In this case, I am really glad that I did learn from my mistakes.  <br>
<br>
No one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes.  If you feel you dont, take a long hard look, you're likely in denial.<br>

<br>
Hayley, Don't make it sound as though Aono ran off with guild loot.  He quit because of RL commitments... pressing family emergency type stuff.  I really wish he was still around to play wiith, but it seems unlikely that he will ever be back.  <br>
<br>
I dont mean this as an attack, but you keep making the same mistakes and you should have learned from them before.  Deleting and editing message board posts has been a hallmark of every leader in FS while I was a member and it has *never* been receivied well by the guild.   Being perceived as a dictator/censor is far more harmful to you than the actual root of the arguement in most cases.   To boil it down to this simple statement: Its not the mistakes you make that kills you but your handling of your mistakes.  Always defending yourself is not the best way to handle things, because you are not always innocent. <br>
<br>
That said...  You have often said there is one reason you still play EQ.  Why dont you drop the guild leadership role and just focus on that?  Drama is fun, its the primary reason I read the BF, but its alot more fun when its not directed at yourself. <br>

Once upon a time I had a sig.  I took Kyle from southpark, heavily editted the picture to look like a female erudite and I gave her a snake stick and a robe.  So.. would I be breaking copyright because I started with a southpark picture?  Nothing looked like the original but the style was similar. (which was the point of why I did it that way)<br>

<br>
Registered or not the images are the intellectual property of the artist. The artist decides if you can use them and how you can use them. If you admire an artists work enough to want to use it you should respect their wishes in how or if you use it.<br>
<br>
Most of the time it is extremely easy to get away with the theft of intellectual property. Its very difficult if not impossible to keep track of the images. Trust is involved. Artists do what they can to protect themselves but theft will happen. <br>
<br>
The dolling community is very tight knit. They share their work and most dollers can recognize and identify another dollers work. Especially the work of the truly talented. They police themselves and come down hard on people who steal from the artists.<br>

All I ever did here was ask you to stop Using the sig and do what was right. After all this bull crap you have done it. So thats a good thing. However it could of all been avoided had you just did what the rules had said to begin with. <br>
<br>
I don't play EQ anymore. Since this has happened I have shut my accounts off. I had planned on coming back to EQ after we had moved and got settled in (moving sucks btw). We didn't quit FS or bad mouth you when everyone else did in forums. Detah attacks me for no good cause (oh and its only been 1.5 months most of which you didn't raid anyway so accusing me of not being there was kinda lame Detah). So saying I am part of a lynch mob was blowing that way out. I only quit FS because. My access was taken away then given back all because I told you that what I felt you were doing with EQPA and Josies dollz was wrong.  All I wanted was for you to admit you did the wrong thing and make it right. Had you just done that 3 days ago instead of trying to cover it up and make yourself look good it would of been ok. I am glad you donated money to EQPA (even tho is &quot;was&quot; after the fact) its a very good cause. <br>
<br>
I want to say to EQPA how sorry I am all this happened had I not posted the link on FS forums this wouldn't of happened. I should of known better but I was hoping by my saying please abide by thier rules this would be avoided. <br>
<br>
EQ is no longer fun for me but Pixel Art is. So I am trying my hand at that for awhile. I guess thats why I got so upset when Hayley hacked up the dolls and didn't seem to care about the orginal artist. People don't realize the time and hard work that goes into making those little toons.  I don't have anything else to say on the subject really just respect people and what they ask when it comes to Pixel Art <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

No, Im flat out saying you have stolen from the guild bank to fund Team Virtual Detah.  Team VD for short.

<br>
First, Aono was still here when this happened and he and Nini were the ones making calls on DKP.  Second, you did not then and have never had anything to do with DKP because you have zero understanding of the DKP system except to use your position as officer and now guild leader to see who was going to get an item so you could then decide whether or not you wanted to cock block them.  You did it with the Tunare Belt; I was in the chat with you when you did it and even admitted to what you were doing, but Im sure you will lie again about that.  Third, pretty sure it was 12 dkp that I wouldnt pay and it was lowered to 9 dkp during the process and it was a dkp price that I still felt was too high.  So being the ultimate lewt whore I said &quot;hey I think this item is priced to high so Im not going to bid on it!&quot;  All lewt whores know thats the best way to get phat lewt; is to not even bid on it.  I said ZERO about it in raid or guild chat.  Anything said in there was by a large majority of other members saying an item like that should not be allowed to rot because our DKP system is fucked.  I said nothing in the public channels, my discussions were in a side chat with Aono and Nini the two that were actually making the decisions.  Fourth, never claimed you got it for a twink.  I saw the corpse poof I know where it went, it rotted.  <br>
<br>
So, another &quot;they are just mad at me for.....&quot; myth shot to hell since you had nothing to do with this decision at all.  Once again, my problem with you is that I dont like people who cant tell the truth to save their lives.  I dont like people who feel the need to try to screw over other guilds(trade windows for chain clerics anyone?).  I dont like people who will keep a position like guild leader for personal gain when they are only hurting the guild.  I dont like people who are completely fake.  You Hayley, are all of those.<br>

Glad Kida posted in this thread, because she is the one I thought of while reading this.  Do you realize how many 63+ spells FS has/had solely because of Kidas unselfishness?  Do you realize how many of those crafted earrings this guild has/had because of Kidas unselfishness?<br>
<br>
Everytime you go looking for a pat on the back for all of the things you do for the guild(yeah right) you should look at all that Kida did and you should be embarassed for yourself.  Is it something that is required?  No, but Team VD is probably the most selfish group within FS.  You wont drop one of your hydras to let a guildmate in need of xping into your little circle, you damn sure wont share anything you can sale, and even on multiquests you sure as hell think of profit before guildmates.<br>
<br>
Not its not required, but you sure as hell better not expect everyone to thank you for you unselfishness when you have shown none.  Plus a guild leader has an extra responsibility to look after the good of the guild first and their own bank account second.<br>
<br>
Again, anytime you start thinking how great and unselfish you are, look at Kida.  Then hang you head and head back out to the bazaar to sell you shit.<br>

Bullshit.  Like I said above, the next time you feel the need to post this bullshit look at what Kida alone did for the guild compared to Team VD.  Then STFU AND STFD.  BQ begged for months to have a regular group to xp with but Team VD is too leet to group with anyone else.<br>

So in Hayley Land, being shamed into paying $40 after being caught in a lie and finally shamed enough by an entirely impartial community(the PA community) to remove the sig altogether is called learning from your mistakes.  If you are glad to learn from this mistake, I guess all I can say at this point is, YOUR WELCOME because lord knows you would never have &quot;learned&quot; from it otherwise.<br>

You did this to Necole, and I almost believed for a second that you had peoples best interests at heart.  Fact of the matter is, you are the worst kind of person.  You live in a gutter of shit, and stir it at everyones expense.  I would try to dispell several of your opinions, but frankly you just aren't worth it.  I have wasted more of my time, efforts and energy trying to defend myself against the piece of shit that you really are, and frankly its beyond boring. <br>
<br>
I will say this. The entire time I was on leave, for a very real illness, I didnt receive one penny of workers comp.  Fortunatly, I worked my ass off in prior years to live off my 401K.  See, jackass, workers comp is gathered when you actually get *injured* on the job.  I had and still have other medical issues.  It's really sad that you take someones physical condition and use it as an opportunity to flame them.  This only serves to show what a disgusting horrible pig you are.  I almost feel sad for you.  However I can't find any sympathy for someone as pathetic as you.  <br>
<br>
Oh and fuck you.  I never eluded to the fact that Aono was a theif.  I simply said lets keep in mind that he HAS HAS HAS and KEEPS KEEPS KEEPS valuable spells and loot.  I ALSO said that if I need it, I know how to get it.  Stop trying to twist every god damned thing I say.  I never once implied that Aono stole anything. <br>
<br>
In addition to that, I have given several spells out, and yes I am aware of Kidas contribution to the guild.  Kida is the best kind of person that exists.  However, if I have a level 65 Druid spell, and the guild has no damn druids any where close to 65 (or any damn druids for that matter)  am I going to sit on the spell for months and let the market value decrease?  I mean honestly zalf, would you?<br>
<br>
I find it funny that you think that all of Dets upgrades are a result of thievery.  Ever stop to think for maybe just a moment that 1) we farm the hell outta stuff, 2) we share a 3 way bank acct, and 3) I tradeskill my ass off.<br>

<br>
Mistakes like:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Looting a Dain crown that was sposed to rot with an alt - if they crown is sposed to rot and/or be destroyed why loot it with an alt i ask?<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Making a certain ex-FS officer loot an item off the Itraer Vius so a certain FS monk wouldn't get said item<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Telling me to loot the range item off CT so a certain shaman wouldn't get (said shaman didn't want anyway haha)<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Asking a certain long-standing member of FS to stick around and help you spend your DKP before you left FS.  <br>
<br>
<br>
5) Dragons blood earring drops at Yelniak raid.  A certain rogue recruit wants to bid on it with the dkp he's made so far.  You say to him 'you got pp?' he says 'no, i want to pay with my dkp' (now this shouldnt be a problem, as recruits are often allowed to bid on items no one wants). After this you ignore him.  A friend asks Detah the next day what happened to this earring, he says 'it was awarded to Synamin.'  But you see, I was at that raid, so were many others - NO ONE got that earring.  Then you come on and tell a completely different story! How many times has this story changed Hayley?  And you couldnt' have been as 'confused' as you insist...the person who wanted the earring kept insitsting that he wanted to pay DKP for it. <br>
<br>
<br>
6) Abuse. The subject of abuse. Let's see...telling everyone that a certain shaman Detah xp'd with at one time was a whore? Trying to ruin her good name based on nothing but insane jealousy on your part?  And Detah...I guess he made a lot of 'mistakes' too. Like the time he threatned Lothomax with guild removal cuz Lotho simply wanted to help get a guild member flagged for tier 2 zones. (Was amusing since detah isnt even an officer).<br>
<br>
Of course, those of us who stood up to you and Detah are the 'abusers' in your eyes...I guess in Hayley Land, as zalf would say, it's a grave abuse of the system to question the status quo, even if it is  a corrupt one.<br>
<br>
<br>
7) You get a lot of runes/specs when you farm Bot/Tactics with Detah.  Yet you still insist on rolling on specs at raids when its obvious you don't need them.  And even if you did need a spell here or there, when you have 1million pp in your bank....I don't doubt that any spells you won went right to your trade mule to sell.  Meanwhile half the guild is still missing most of their spells.  Real good example of a guild leader who *cares* don't you think?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Speaking of trade mules, the new 'guild treasurer' is a farce seeing as how you run his mules anyway...he's just a figurehead for your own schemes<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Now, the 4dkp regarding the dozekar tear.  Riight...let's review shall we.  Before I bid on said item I ask Hayley if we will continue to farm HOT so we can complete the quests. She says 'yes, we will be in hot for months now.' Never happens. I ask if we can return to HOT to finish the quests, I get 'do it on your own'.  I get, and I quote 'we can't farm hot b/c ISENTARD is there all the time.'  Yeah, funny though how IsenTARD is doing better than FS now eh Hayley? <br>
 Now you think I wanted the dkp to get burrower loot..obvously you are referring to the range item detah's hydra got.  The item itself is ok, but not that big a deal.  You know what did bug me though?  The rumour that you told Detah to bid on this item so I wouldnt' get it.  Now seeing as how you had no scruples trying to cock block others on loot, and trying to ruin the female shaman's name - well suffice to say, I started to feel very unwelcome in Fs.  Cuz honestly, I wouldn't put anything past you.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And please, zalf ciara and I are merely the vocal ones...current membrs and many past members left precisely b/c of your and Detah's abuses.  In fact I remembre one ex-member saying &quot;Hayley embarasses me, always being flamed on the Blast Furnace, makes the guild look bad.'<br>
<br>
So you see, your problems started long before us, and will continue when we are gone.  You cannot play the victim forever.<br>

I don't understand what you guys are trying to prove, everyone knows FS is fucked up guild. <br>

You cannot change the past but your constant bickering is annoying at best.
