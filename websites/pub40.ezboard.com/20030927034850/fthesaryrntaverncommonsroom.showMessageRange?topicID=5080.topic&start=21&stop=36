During these last few years he became the brother I never had. I've lost count of the times we sat side by side playing this game or that on our comps. I have never been more proud of anyone than I was of him with the way he handled his condition. He was the pillar of stone from which the rest of us drew strength, not once uttering those words everybody asks &quot;Why me?&quot;. As far as he was concerned, it was &quot;better me than you&quot;. I can only hope to be half as brave when my time comes.<br>
<br>
  His graveside service was.... well, the words escape me. It was sunny and bright, with just the perfect amount of clouds and breeze. My best estimate was over 150 guests, from his old high school's football coach to his regualr barber to his family and friends. His father performed the eulogy, and damn what an amazing job. The kind of eulogy everyone hopes for, with tales of sadness, but also of the happy times. My first thought was now I know where he got his strength from, but in all honesty, I think it was the other way around. The father drawing from the son.<br>
<br>
  Matsu may have well been the most fantastically stubborn person I knew, but you always knew where he was coming from. Not once were you surprised by his words or actions, as he said what he meant and meant what he said. I wish to thank all of you who may have made his last few days just a little more enjoyable. <br>
<br>
  I will miss you more than the air I breathe my friend. I salute you, and thank you. Long live Sandfrog! <p>Darokk Seyz<br>

I thought this was appropriate.</span><hr size=1> One day a father of a very wealthy family took his  son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose of showing his son how poor people can be.<br>
<br>
They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be  considered a very poor family. On their return from  their trip, the Father asked his son, &quot;How was the trip?&quot;<br>
&quot;It was great, Dad.&quot;  &quot;Did you see how poor people can be?&quot; the father asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Yeah&quot; said the son.  &quot;So what did you learn from the trip?&quot; asked the father.<br>
<br>
The son answered, &quot;I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have  a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and  they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front  yard and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on and they  have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.<br>
We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this the boy's father was speechless.<br>
<br>
Then his son added, &quot;Thanks dad for showing me how poor we are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Too many times we forget what we have and concentrate on what we don't have. What is one person's worthless object is another's prize possession. It is all based on one's perspective. Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for all the bounty we have, instead of worrying about wanting more.. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Take joy in all you have, especially your friends</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Naval was an amazing person.  From the day I met him as a nooby shaman in great divide, to the many quiet PL sessions in velks, and Seb Naval was always very kind, considerate and giving.  <br>
<br>
In my 2+ years of eq, I have rarely met anyone as friendly, genuine and so willing to give their own resources to help another.  Naval always checked on me, and encouraged me keep fighting for what I believe in.  He never looked down upon me, encouraged me to keep my head high at times I felt I was at rock bottom.  Although we didn't spend much time together, the xp sessions owned, and i was always very entertained.<br>
<br>
I didn't know the extent of his condition, and it takes a  truly amazing person indeed to give so much emotion and energy to another when they themselves are not well.  I feel lucky to have known you Naval, and hope that you are truly in a better place, free of pain and hurt.<br>
