OK, here goes.<br>
<br>
A friend of mine recently was &quot;relieved&quot; of his 11.9K that he had in the bank of his main character. He logged in one day to find himself in the exact spot where he logged out (scarlet desert) but he had no money on his character, which was odd since he always carried some cash on his guy so he could always pay for KEI. He then proceeded to check his bank to find all his money was gone. Oddly and luckily enough, his gear was untouched (all droppable). After repeated petitions and emails to GMs he found out, via a GM reply email, that a log showed that his character on april XX (i cant remember the specific day) handed the character <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PIROTEOUS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> 11,900 platinum. A person he's never met, talked to, nor even knew existed. Nor would he just give a random stranger nearly 12k out of the goodness of his heart. He's not that generous. <br>
<br>
So I'd like to ask, does anyone recognize the name that I mentioned above? I know its probably a complete shot in the dark and the character was probably a level one that was made and destroyed within minutes but I have to ask. I think it's complete bullshit that things like this happen and nothing is done about it. So if anyone has any info or advice, feel free to post. <br>
<br>
PS: he has never given his account info to anyone, so anyone who was planning on replying to this saying &quot;you shouldn't give out your account info&quot; can stop right now. hell, i dont even know it and we've been good friends for over 10 years.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spyrit123>Spyrit123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/30/03 10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3231.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: does anyone know this hacking son of a .....</span><hr size=1> hrmm - brash's account got hacked too - gm's said they couldn't replace shit ( i guess being on legends gives you better security ) well anyways after being angry from losing blade of carnage, sceptre of destruction, cowl of mortality, helmet of rallos zek, boots of the storm, velium encrusted gaunts, amulet of necropotence, tear of the rainmaker, rough iron cog earring, arachnid antennae, faceguard of abrentos, 710k platinum and some other shit I was really pissed.

For those who dont know every item ever created in EQ except currancy is assigned a item code number and is trackable to the extent that the CoF that dropped off of naggy on may 4th 1999 that has had 15 owners each one is listed as having held that item it is branded to the item.. so this  I can take and trade to another char and not suffer is a crock becouse they can and do and will trace down thiefs...<br>
<br>
<br>
I know most of you will laugh at me saying this but.. HONESTLY dont share your info... you think you love someone they love you .. or they are your best buddy on earth since the day you were born.. or someone you hire to help you level or obtain items.. (some claim strip your account first for your security ect) this doesnt protect your account.. some of these folks actually believe your going to move it off one char on that account to another char on that account or you wont strip all chars on the account or what have you.. <br>
<br>
Run Virus scanners to check for things hiding on your system waiting to capture and nail and email out your passwords and other vital info...<br>
<br>
Sorry your friend was hacked.. it seems to be a vary RAMPID situation atm seems to go in waves.. be care change password often ..<br>

Not saying this is what it was, just some comments and some maybes to get you to scratch your head and think.<br>
<br>
Its also become popular to setup EQ websites that need &quot;member access&quot; to get to so called &quot;features&quot;. These sites are nothing but honey pots for hackers to get your email and information about you char( Logins , Server, Char names) Once you have supposedly &quot;signed up&quot; for whatever it is , maps , email message board , auction site. They hack you<br>
<br>
Personally i dont trust any EQ related site as far as security goes. Its far , far to easy to get information these days, then engineer social hacks to get more.<br>
<br>
Never use your eq login and password anyplace but eq thats it simply and sweet. Never use the same email you used to sign up for eq for signing up for anything else on the web also.<br>
Use charactors and numbers in random order for your passwords and usernames. Dont use WORDS!!! dictionary brute force attacks are easy to direct these days and becoming more sophisticated. <br>
<br>
 These are just a few things ,anyone else heard of any other way people are scramming now days??? <br>

The link was to a site that some schmuck had set up to look like SOE's login screen.  It wasn't difficult figuring out his scheme since the URL was nothing like a SOE address, but someone a little less paranoid (is it paranoia when they ARE out to get you?) could have been burned by the deal.<br>

Another that's been going around lately is an email inviting people to join the Guide Program.  All you have to do is email back with your character name, server, username and password.

That is not possible. The title is not part of the name but generated on the fly whenever you zone or log by counting AA's.

You know that when you delete a charecter all corpses for that charecter are removed right??<br>
