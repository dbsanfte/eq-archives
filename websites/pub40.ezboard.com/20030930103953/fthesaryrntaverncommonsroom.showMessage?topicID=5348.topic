<br>
Just got my power back about an hour ago, and thought I'd start a thread.<br>
<br>
I was asleep when the power went out.  I woke up to the 18th century.  I had planned on spending the night playing EQ and cruising the 'net.  Obviously I couldn't, and I couldn't get to sleep as I had woken up just a few hours ago.  So I pulled my portable fire pit (a metal container on wheels) out to the end of my drive way and started a fire with some fallen branches that have been piling up in my back yard.  I tended the fire all night, and chatted with my neighbors (many I had never met before) as they walked around the neighborhood (obviously as bored as I was).<br>
I was tending another fire on the second night, when I heard the people across the street start to cheer.  I looked around to see many house lights and street lights coming on.  I pulled my fire up the driveway, and left it to burn out over the night.<br>
Now I'm sitting at my computer satisfying my internet jones.<br>
<br>
.<br>
<br>
Was the population on the EQ servers noticeably lower than usual these past couple of days ?<br>

<br>
I mean I did want a day off from work anyways, but wow, that was impressive.<br>
<br>
I was in the fire stairs smoking when the lights went out. Cursed the building's management and went back into the office, to discover that everything--phones, everything was out. Saw the street lights across the street were out too...We all sat there for an hour listening to the battery radio until our horrible boss let us go.<br>
<br>
The streets were full of people, had to walk down 20 flights in almost total darkness, (nice fire code)---walked from 27th and Park to 106th and Lex, where I have some friends. People were handing out ice cream and shoes and getting drunk in sidewalk cafes. And walking, alot of walking. Caught my breath there, and then it got dark. Really dark and I realized that to get home I'd be walking in the dark through Harlem...so I caught a bus. No one on the bus knew where it was going exactly, but it was going north and we all needed to do that.<br>
<br>
Phones were out so I couldnt reach Synn...finally got home, in our neighborhood people were sitting on the sidewalks lining them with candles so that everyone could see. Someone was playing guitar.<br>
<br>
Synn met me on the corner--he was wearing his mountain climbing flashlight thing on his head, was very cute. We drank beer and went to sleep...woke up to the fan blowing again at 8AM...<br>
<br>
So what happened with all of you?  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanmers>kanmers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/16/03 10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5348.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Great Blackout of Aught-Three</span><hr size=1> muahahahahahahaa /huggles his hydroelectricity  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.calgaryplanet.com/idiot/jerk.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stalpus>Stalpus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 956<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/16/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5348.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Power was out for two hours.

When the power went out, I was ICQing with guildies and getting dinner started.  Shortly after that, the water supply went down also.  (I had already started getting water collected though once I heard how widespread everything was on the radio. Thank you WJR-AM!)<br>
<br>
My neighbor and I went on the search for ice and succeeded at the closest gas station!  <br>
<br>
We did a lot of grilling with our neighbors and broke out the scrabble board!  <br>
The worst part was lack of running water.  Even though we are back up on the public water supply as of 3pmish yesterday, we are on a boil alert til Wednesday (or so?) as as the water treatment plant(s) aren't yet at full capacity.<br>
Power came back up around 9pm, just as we were hooking up my parent's generator to the sump pump and fridge. (They got power around 4pm and got their water back up about 8pm.)<br>
There is no joy greater than bailing out your sump when the rain starts coming down in torrents. *sighs*  Heh, even having a back up sump which uses the city water supply to help it work would be useless.  Oh well, basement is dry though! <br>
<br>
One thing that just cracked me up yesterday when listening to the radio was the Mayor of Detroit's press conference. (paraphrase) &quot;I would like to persuade people against using the term 'looting'. Those who are breaking into party stores and stealing 40 ouncers are committing larceny.&quot;<br>

It was kinda fun trying to find some department store open, to buy last minute things for the wedding.  Upon hearing a Walmart open, we rush there &amp; get halfway through our shopping when the power goes out.  This is followed by hordes of security with flashlights roaming the aisles to prevent people from stealing anything &amp; to direct people to checkouts, before the backup juice goes out in 5 mins.<br>
<br>
The worst part of the whole blackout was myself &amp; some friends had planned to do a bunch of gambling at the Casino.  It was closed the whole weekend!!!

In Taddousac that evening we ran into an anglophone who said she had heard on quebec/french radio there were power problems in New York City and Western Ontario. When it came time to pay our dinner bill, I was told they could not take my Amex card due to some problem (or so I think they said in broken english). When we got back to our motel room, CBC was doing enteded coverage of the blackout and we quickly learned it had hit Toronto.<br>
<br>
I did not get home until Saturday afternoon, by then the lights had been on for some time, and all the stuff in my freezer had either never thawed much, or refroze quickly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
