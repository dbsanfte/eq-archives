Why do you whimper like a lowly pup, Grenix?” he snarled in the barking, growling tongue of the gnolls. Looking down, a battered and bloodied Grenix lies before him. “My Lord SanRe! We are attacked!” Grenix says as two gnoll guards pull him to his feet, “Ambushed we were. A band of apes from the northlands, they moved like the wind and were upon us in an instant. My patrol…slain. I barely escaped the animals. We must prepare ourselves! An attack is surely coming!”<br>
SanRe’Rexsa let out a low growl, “Once again the weakling Sabretooths fail to keep the northerners at bay.” Pointing his spear at Grenix he snarls, “Grenix, you will prepare the camp for a possible attack. I will gather a war party and hunt down these savages myself.” Grenix looked up at the Mucktail chief with a fearful look. “Y-y-yes Lord SanRe. Of-of course.”<br>
<br>
Kirisula crouched behind the brush to catch her breath. Three gnolls lay dead in the clearing ahead, their bodies wracked by destructive magics and physical blows while one more remained living, searching her out. Droplets of her own blood stained her armour from the wild clawing and gnashing of her victims, but for the most part her armour held true. Grasping the talisman about her neck tightly, her symbol of devotion to the Tribunal, she quietly chants her pleas to the spirits to lend her their strength and prowess. “Curse my luck,” she thought to herself, “one of the mongrels has already escaped me, I can ill afford to allow another. Master Jinkus would have chastised me for my carelessness.”<br>
With her totem staff clutched tightly in her hands, Kirisula rose to her feet and unleashed the power of the Tribunal. The gnoll howled as his veins seared with pain from the venom suddenly coursing through it. Leaping over the brush, she charged at her foe with the swiftness granted to her by Grandfather Wolf. The enraged gnoll, overcome his pain to meet his enemy’s charge, furiously lashing out with his claws. Kirisula leveled blow after blow on her victim. Sensing the end, the weary, battered gnoll lashed out for one final attack but was stopped short as a heavy staff came crashing down over top the gnoll with all the might Kirisula could muster. Bone cracked as the gnoll slumped to the ground.<br>
<br>
SanRe’Rexsa sniffed around the body of one of his tribe. “They’re near. I smell the monkeys’ stench.” Gazing out across the great plains of the Karanas, he gave his orders to his patrol, “They most likely hide like cowards. Each of you will search in a different direction. When you find them, return to me and I will hunt them down myself.” His warriors growled their acknowledgement and proceeded out across the plains. “The enemy would never attack a full patrol but rather look for isolated targets. After all, its what I would do.” SanRe thought to himself. “Its unfortunate I must sacrifice one of my warriors to draw them out but it is a price that must be paid so that I my repay these barbarians in blood.” SanRe sat himself and began his chant of barking and howling as he traced runic symbols into the ground to divinate the location of his prey.<br>
<br>
The gnoll warrior let out a final howl as he fell, a layer of frost covering his fur. Kirisula stood over another defeated gnoll. She had felled many a gnoll but finally exhaustion had set in. Her muscles burned from the endless fighting and combined with her wounds, a heavy toll had been taken on her reserves of strength. “Glorious Tribunal, as your hand I deliver these souls before you for your righteous judg…” Kirisula gagged as a clawed hand clutched her neck. Feeling the claws dig into her throat, she drove her staff behind her, catching the assailant in the midsection and loosening its grasp. Turning to face her foe, a gnoll stood before her, more fearsome than any she has ever laid eyes on. He was decorated with talismans and trophies taken from his fallen enemies. She had attracted the attention of the Mucktails’ chief and witch doctor.<br>
Kirisula and SanRe’Rexsa circled one another slowly like a pair of predatory animals, eyes locked on one another’s gaze. “Northerner, I have such a horrible death planned for you. Where are your comrades hiding so I may tear their hearts out as well?” asked SanRe while leering at his opponent. “It is only I.” Kirisula replied, “The corpses of your kind littering the Karanas are by my hand alone. They will atone for the suffering they’ve caused, as will you and all your kind. This is my crusade that I carry with the blessing of the Six Hammers.” SanRe let out a snarl “You are blinded your faith in your worthless god, ape. He will not save you. You will die now, but not before you suffer.” SanRe let out a howl and lunged at Kirisula, his claws cutting deep, rending her armour and opening large wounds. Kirisula answered with blow after blow from her staff but it other than grunts of pain, seemed to do little to stop the onslaught. SanRe swung out with the back of his fist, sending her sprawling. Instead of driving his spear for the final blow, SanRe called down the powers of his own savage god. Terrible pain shit through Kirisula as the very magics that she used on her enemies were being used against her. Barely able to rise to her feet, SanRe shoved her back to the ground with butt of his spear. “I promised you a painful death. How is it to feel your life slowly slip away, helpless to prevent it? Why isn’t your god saving you?”<br>
Kirisula could feel herself get weaker and weaker. SanRe’s assault was taking a greater and greater toll. Thinking to herself, “It can’t end now. I thought I had only begun. No! Great Tribunal! I beg of you, show me that my crusade is just and lend me your strength.” Marshalling her last reserves of strength, she rose to her feet and cried out another prayer to her deity. SanRe stepped forward to again strike her down but was unable as the earth grasped at his feet. Continuing her chant, Kirisula watched as SanRe struggled to break free but could not. He howled with rage as he saw his once helpless victim disappear. He could hear a fading voice saying “this battle has not ended…”<br>
<br>
Kirisula’s wide-open surroundings quickly changed to the stone walls of Highhold Keep. She collapsed as its residents approached, surprised at her sudden appearance. A priest recognized her as belonging to a large group of adventurers that had arrived recently to help in the Keeps’ defense and begain tending to her wounds. “This battle has not ended.” She said as her eyes closed, finally overcome by exhaustion and wounds.<br>
<br>
“Weakling! Coward!” SanRe’Rexsa barked at Grenix Mucktail as he flung him to the ground by the throat. Grenix wanted to make an excuse but could only find himself whimpering and yelping. “Ambushed you were!” SanRe continued, “But there was no raiding party! There was only one! One!” SanRe was enraged. He pinned Grenix’s chest with his foot, holding the tip of his spear at his throat. Grenix shivered as contemplated his fate. “I would tear out your throat for the humiliation you have brought myself and our tribe.” Just as SanRe was to kill Grenix, he paused when a thought crossed his mind. “Rise to your feet, whelp. I will grant you one chance to redeem the tribe’s honour. You will lead our next attack on the apes in the mountains. You will knock down their walls, and amongst the heads you return with will be that of the barbarian. If you fail, your head will decorate my lodge.” SanRe snarled at his lieutenant. “I am merciful. I will not send you on a suicide mission. I will send our strongest witch doctors along with our force. You yourself will carry one of our sacred weapons onto the battlefield. This is your one chance to redeem yourself Grenix.”<br>
SanRe’Rexsa returned to his hut. His plan was a risk. But risks needed to be taken. Grenix was a coward, but he was clever. Perhaps SanRe’s display of both trust and contempt towards Grenix would give him enough incentive to succeed against the people of Highpass. Perhaps finally the unconquerable Keep would be conquered and he lay claim to it himself...<br>
