<br>
A whirl of wind swept acrost Jayla's cheek as her eyes drew open, whispers from all around as the dark sky watched over her motionless body. She pushed herself to a sitting position her mind clear and all memories of the last couple days unreachable. The ground below her soft and full of life, she felt a strong sence of spirit as she blinked in contempt. Thoughts of where she was and how she got there racing through her mind, her vision uncorrupted and for the first time since childhood innocent. It was a feeling many would pay thousands of platinum to feel and others ten times the same not to. "Where am I?" she whispered, answered by the crackling branches from the bushes around her and the playfull laughter echoing through her head. Effortlessly she rose to her feet grasped the ground and her body stood upright, her weight had seemed nothing and every move she made appeared in slow motion. "Am I.. Is this..?" the confusion more then appearent but not bothering the Druid in the least. It was almost as if nothing mattered here, her whole being was just a cartoon drawn by the most expert artist. She looked to the sky arms spread out "Sombody.. Answer me" her voice strong and echoing through the forest around her. "Jayla..." a deep soft voice seeming to come from every direction, she dropped her arms and looked intensly in every direction anticipating her caller. "Jayla..." It spoke again this time louder and spread at an even deeper distance. Her eyes taking in every motion as the wind hurled itself through grass, swinging branch after branch.. The leaves of the surrounding bushes rubbing together creating the most natural sound. Loosing all sence of reality by this time her mind telling her to ready her weapon and prepair for combat but her heart holding her from any such action keeping her arms relaxed to her side. "Who are you? Where am I?" she asked in desperation again answered by laughter from all around. "Jala Spiritwalker..." the mysterious voice surrounded her, "In heart you have chosen the road which will lead you..." she lowered her head giving up on the location of the voice.. "But ones heart only walks the road chosen... When paths meet and fates collide... Jayla... There you find the truth..." She closes hers eyes as the words tail off and become one with the howling wind, a wave of mist covers the ground and darkness sets in momentarily broken by a flash of light so bright it would blind the sun itself... <br>
<br>
~A man dressed in attire fitting of a noble staggers toward a child playing innocently in the dirt, exhausted he allows his legs their freedom and collapses to a slumped possition next to the child. "Ahhhhhheewww" the normaly well mannered man yawns "Papas beat child, what kind of feast is your mother preparing for us?" he asks the child, she shrugs uninterested as she continues about with her meaninless toying. "Not even a hug for your papa? Jay?" She smiles up at her father giving him a quick hug and turning quickly back to her priority. He pats her on her head a couple times, then removes his chain head piece and places it on his young daughters crown laughing as the weight alone almost knocks her to the ground. "Well kid, papas going to see what's for dinner, you finish up here and get yourself cleaned up, you hear?" she nods as her father struggles to his feet, his old worn knees popping a few times. She adjusts the chain helmet to clear her vision as she looked back at her father...~<br>
<br>
Her sight returned as quickly as it had gone, "Papa?" she uttered placing one hand on the chain helmet she had worn proudly through so many years.. "So this is.. I am.. But how, why?" the questions of her fate numbing her mind as her heart sank. "And if this is.. I'm so confused!" She had begun to walk aimlessly through the land pondering the reasons that her life would be taken at such a time where there was so much more to do and see, it began to all run together for her. "If I'm de.. dead.. What is this place?" she looked around as the rumbling in the bushes continued as did her mind wander..<br>
<br>
~The man kicked off his boots as he entered through the modest doorway into the tiny house he had helped build with his own sweat, he slithered out of his heavy tunic hanging it to the right of door as he continued his mission to the dinning area. "Baby, I'm hope!" he said merrily as he entered the kitchen. The most beutifull woman stood at the hard wood counter humming a tune as she prepared the nights meal, she turned her head with a smile as her lips met her devoted husbands with a warm welcome. Not one of many words she continued with her work keeping in perfect rythm a tune that was all to familuar in this household, the man went about washing and drying his hands as he admired his wives work. The stage had been set for the perfect dinner, one that was quite routine these days as the family sat around the table led in prayer by the mother of the house.. Little did Jayla know this would be last sitting as a family, her father who had instilled more lessons and values then her young mind was able to comprehend at such an early age, he was well known and respected not only in Kelethin but through out Faydwer. Her mother spent many evenings at Songweavers playing along with the Kelethin bards, she also was well known and Jayla through her teen years hated this. It was her feelings that her mother should spend more time at home in her father's absence, she felt that her by continuing on with her life her mother was betraying the man who gave them the world and this eventualy tore them apart.~<br>
<br>
The memories she had were very selective and clear as day, her mind continued to back and forth as her legs carried her further, the wind strong but calming kept her in perfect balance. Every step she took she could feel her feet tingle, what was so special about this land? At the moment she couldn't have been more relaxed she her the cry of pain in the distance, a writhering voice longing for aid. Her heart told her to rush to the sound with the spirit of the elder wolfs on her side, but deep down she knew better.. She tried to turn back but as she did the wind shifted at an extreme speed forcing her to keep going, she slowely made her way hiding behind trees the cries becoming louder with every step. Was then she saw the most hideus thing she had ever witnessed, the skies lit up with storms the wicked laugh of the skeletal being as it layed painfull blow after blow showing no mercy. She got closer ducking behind the cover of a bush, the creature wailed out in agony as the Ogre's sword dropped heavily into it's flesh. Was then in the background, her own kind, one in the form of a wolf, the other standing proudly with his arms crossed as he watched these evil beings destroy and rape this creature of life. They stood there no shame evident as they casted condoning nods, shouting out words of encouragment. Didn't take long though valiently the creature faught it had no choice but to fall victim to the overpowering force. The Ogre kneeled before the corpse, as proud as could be as he ripped the pendant of it's lifeless neck and waved it at the proud eagre ranger waiting patiently. The Ogre noded in agreement as words where exchanged, the Ranger quickly grabbed ahold of the pendent admiring his new posesion as the group vanished into a purple rift. The area was clear at last she rushed to the fallen creature dropping to her knees at the side of the beaten corpes, she had no knowledge of what it was but in felt compelled to it like a magnetic force. She placed her arm under it's blodd soakened head cradling it like a child, she bacame lost in it's empty eyes and for a moment she felt the pain it had suffered rip through her body, she quickly lost contact as she fell back weakened by the experience. Tears had begun to form around her eyes as she questioned her whole being in one quick moment life even in death was not worth living..<br>
<br>
~"Quto! Get back here!" she demanded as she chased like children do, in her eyes she was grown it had been time that seperated her from her home and family. "Come on Jay!" he replied keeping steps ahead of her.. What Jay saw in Quto was a reminder of her father, he had several years on her and like a dumb child she felt helplessly attracted to the promising Ranger. Although he had a fiancee she continued her quest for his heart, a cause that she couldn't win but stubbernly she refuse to quit. "Just a little further, you can make it." his words alone was enough to keep her running for days without rest as the two finaly reached the river in plains of Karana. The stumbled to the ground just in time to watch the sunset, it was something they often did and this time like none other in the past she reached her hand over to his, and like every other time he quickly pulled away. In many ways this kept her wanting more, it was a solid reminder of her father's loyalty and something Jayla looked forward to more then the beuty of the sunset.~<br>
<br>
When her eyes again were open the body that had fallen before her was gone, it was like nothing had happen, but the tear streaming down her cheek reminded her that something had happened. "So what now? Where do I go from here?" she begged for answers, she couldn't just roam the land with no meaning, not a single hint of direction.. "I know you're out there.. Answer me! Answer me!!" Her tears ran down her cheek at a rapid pace as she sat there helpless, nothing seemed to be happening, was as if the world stopped. Lost in her own self pitty, not even the wind was there to keep her spirits alive, the bushes no longer ruffled, there was no laughter in the distance.. The ground beneath where she sat, crying, sulking in her own self pity was hard as a rock. "Please, if one more chance you give me I promice I will make amends.. My lord, Mother Tunare.. Hear my prayer and give me direction.. I will never again forget what you have given me if one more chance.. Is all I ask.. One.." she relaxed her head on the ground behind her as she stare blankly at the sky high above. "Jayla.." the deep voice once again emerged from the silence. "You know the way child.. In your heart.. You know the way."<br>
<br>
"What does that mean?! Who are you and why are you playing with me?!" her frustration had gotten the best of her and all she could do now was give into her worn eyes as they softly close. "One.." she mummbled as the world she had created in her head once again called her into her rightfull place..<br>
<br>
