<br>
Seani, not going to fight with you on guild charters or crap, but fact is, we can't zerg with 70+ people, especialy so late at night. That in no way means we don't have a right to aten just as much as you guys do. If every single mob in VT was ment to be killed before aten, then they ALL would have a warder linked to em. <br>
<br>
I think we only fucked up a warder spawn once, when we killed tvk but pretty much lost all our tanks due to logging. If we can't kill tvk (prolly the toughest part of the run because of the number of mobs to kill and then either breaking tvk or his guards away) then we dont despawn any warders. If we kill tvk, then as shown by last night, its just a matter of time to kill aten.<br>
<br>
Anyways.. im pretty sure nobody in twc was cursing and saying &quot;Damn ToS! Why did they have to leave the rest of the mobs up, why couldnt they kill them ALL!&quot;<br>

I was there on the night in question.  It happened a few days before this post was started, not sure what took so long.  <br>
<br>
We were in Kael killing Vindi when someone said Statue was up, we repositioned ourselves and killed Statue, meanwhile calling on GoL to help us finish the cycle &quot;WE&quot; started (not TWC).  GoL shows up as we are finishing up Statue and we regroup for Idol.  Now 50+ TWC members are in zone and we are now given 5 minutes to pull Idol.  First question...Did TWC kill Statue? NO...so Idol is not yours to pull.  We pull and kill Idol, we pull and kill AOW.  Done deal.  All the while TWC is hovering waiting for us to wipe so that they can come kill and loot AOW.  But wait, AOW is gimp for TWC.  Second question...why is TWC even in Kael if AOW has gimp loot?<br>
<br>
Yes, I made a /ooc that AOW was dead and that TWC can now leave the zone.  Reply was  &quot;Stop Bragging about AOW..he is gimp&quot; or something to that effect.  I replied by saying that &quot;Why are you here if AOW is gimp&quot;  I was told &quot;We are doing quest turn-ins&quot;  SO..now it takes 50+ members of TWC to turn in quest items in Kael?  And all in the arena part of the zone? <br>
<br>
I have nothing against any other guild on Saryrn, but if guilds are gonna rush or jump a mob because they want thier &quot;gimp&quot; loot, then that is when i get bothered.<br>
<br>
Nandarie...i can give a rats ass what mobs you kill.  You can take the Emporer in Ssra, and any other mob TWC raids, and stick him where the sun don't shine.  You are not going to put me down because you killed Mob Z, and I havent gotten to Mob O yet.  I may get there eventually, i may not.  It doesnt really matter to me.  I play to play, not to make myself out to be something im not in real life. <p>Turklander Tanksalot 65th Overlord of Rallos Zek</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seani>Seani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 621<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/23/03 7:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Garbhad says, &quot;Name one thing I fabricated&quot; -- You were fabricating when you said we were breathing down their necks.  Reality is that the two guilds were on opposite ends of a zone that takes 2-3 hours to move through.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know of at least 1 person who was sent a tell asking if they wiped yet.&quot; -- Would that still amount to &quot;breathing down their necks&quot; if those tells were sent from another zone?  At least this person you speak of wasn't so stupid to make an issue out of it, like you have just done.  And once again, I'll remind you that our two guilds were as far apart from eachother as two guilds can be in that zone.  They were done with aten by the time we were barely through TVK's room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who cares if they leave shit up&quot; -- I care.  When spawns are spread out the zone is not worth raiding.  When warders are fucked up it forces you to deal with the GMs to raid at all.  I care about raid zones that can and should be worth raiding but are not viable targets due to others' poor performance which happens to be allowed due only to unearned advantage.<br>
<br>
&quot;If they want to leave something up, then so be it.&quot; -- Um, I'll give a big Fuck No to that one.  If they leave stuff up then others are damn well entitled to go in, just like we did.  How long should we wait?  What if one of them fell asleep at the keyboard in atens room, how long before we can start breathing down their necks to kill mobs they passed up hours ago and aren't going back for?  What if all 33 of them do?<br>
<br>
&quot;But to go in before is just a bad judgement call.&quot; -- Obviously our judgements of the situation differ.  Given that you weren't there and I was, and that you're only still talking because you are trying to gracefully step down from the stupid position you put yourself into in this thread, I think i'll go with my judgement if that's A-OK with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;you guys had no reason to be there other than to &quot;hope&quot;&quot; -- I already told you, NOBODY FAILS to aten, not even ToS.  The encounter was obviously designed to be un-losable to anyone who can fight through the other mobs. <br>
<br>
&quot;They win don't they&quot; -- I didnt say they didnt win.  Didn't I say multiple times already that they succeeded?  So what are you rambling on about here?<br>
<br>
<br>
Bygzalf says, &quot;'The War Councils Might Makes Right' rules of engagement&quot; -- No I already explained, our rules of engagement are known as First In Force.  That was like the 3rd sentence in my previous post.  I think Might Makes Right is our philosphy, or our charter, or maybe its just roleplaying bullshit--definitely not our rules of engagement though, I can personally assure you of that since I do in fact define our policy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if you treated guilds that arent to your level yet with more respect, the guilds that you are lagging behind would treat you with more respect.&quot; -- First, I see no connection between your hypothesis and your conclusion.  Second, I don't see what disrespect has taken place.  In fact, contrary to the idea that we treat nobody with respect, the policies I outline above state exactly how and when respect is given out, and we follow them pretty evenly.  The only thing that wasnt given to GoL/Fam by TWC in this incident was pure charity.  <br>

Timeline:<br>
1. Familjen zones into Kael and kills Vindi then shortly after kills statue.<br>
2. Fam calls GoL to help with idol and AoW<br>
3. TWC zones in<br>
4. GoL arrives and gets with Fam<br>
5. Fam/GoL sends monks out to get idol<br>
6. Fam/GoL pullers are amazed when they see idol is not as his spawn and they going running around the zone looking for him<br>
7. TWC puller who STOLE idol died on pull.<br>
8. GoL/Fam pullers find idol and take him back to awaiting raid.<br>
9. Idol dies, Raidleaders get ahold of GM to come watch so their is no further incident<br>
10. TWC hovers to see if we wipe<br>
11. AoW down.<br>

<br>
was this lame? Yea.. but I dont hold grudges with many guilds, like us with FoTC and AoW incident, every fucks up sometime.. but for them to flame us over the FoTC incident when they were no way involved is lame, and i think many people said in that thread that coming from people in a guild that does it constantly, yes constantly as in the two incidents the other day with AoW and VT.<br>

If we didn't do any of the work, then there weren't any normal mobs up, and I for one don't remember strolling through VT - everyone in VT atm knows that clearing is a pain, and with one gating mob can be quite a bit of work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Does it really matter?  The only way it matters, is if they died because someone from TWC said hey this is wrong just eat the death and stop pulling.  If that is the case then say so.  Making the right call late in the game is better then not making it at all. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, your pullers shouldnt have been pullers in the first place.  You had no claim to this mob other then to be assholes.  I hope someone dispelled the pullers or found some other way to remove them from somewhere they shouldnt have been.  I hope the GMs actually made a right call and punted any TWC that aggroed the mob.<br>
<br>
Would be totally different if you had a claim to the mob, but you did not.  So dont come in here trying to act like you were the ones that were wronged and that poor little TWC was mistreated.  You shouldnt have been in the zone much less pulling, so anything that happened to you while there is tough shit regardless of what the pnp says.  <br>
<br>
It was a chicken shit move.  They spawned the mob and had the force to kill the mob regardless of what the TWC experts thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bokuza1>bokuza1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/23/03 9:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> no clue and really dont care, you tried to steal a mob you had not right touching since you didnt start the sequence and the raid who started it was still in full force.<br>

Anyone who has ever been to this zone knows that there's a good 3-6 hours (varies with more/less dps), even with coth to everywhere possible, between zone-in and AHR. TWC was, I am sure, waiting to move to aten blobs/dxt/dxv or whatever we skipped on our way to the boss. Who the fuck cares? We have done the exact same thing, went and killed mobs they for some reason left behind, hell even the gimp twins on occasion if nothing else is up, the only difference is TWC's prime raid time pretty much starts when ours ends. Why should they sit around with their thumb's up their asses in PoK waiting for every single Titan to leave Vex Thall? Makes more sense to not waste time and start forming at zone-in doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Second, the only /ooc of any kind during this whole time was one of our guild members singing a Swedish song to keep himself awake. I've never seen anyone in TWC (ex-members excluded) /ooc some lame ass bullshit to another raid force in zone, even the infamous Bdaan, and even if he did spam something, I can guarantee you that it would be more intelligent and well-written than the majority of the people that post on these boards.<br>
<br>
Third, Seani, I'm not going to flame you, I just want to ask this. If we are &quot;fucking up the warders&quot; so much, then why don't you take your guild and go kill RZTW so you can go farm better shit? I know you've tried and failed (once or twice can't remember) but I've seen your raid force and I know that TWC has a ton of skilled players, so what's holding you back? Why say that we are undeserving of access to a zone that we got into exactly the same way you did? It's not our fault that Sony in their infinite wisdom designed a zone that can be fucked up so easily. I could see if we were blowing a spawn on purpose just to cockblock your guild from doing anything in it, but we have not and will not ever do any of that pussy shit. You want an apology? OK, I myself am sorry that we can't kill aten blobs because it's 5am in Europe and 90% of our members have to work in 1 hour.  I'm sorry that we wiped on a mob, I'm sure that TWC has never ever ever wiped in VT before.  <br>
<br>
I guess people just like to bitch, though. I'm just glad I am not on veeshan where there's 5+ guilds at every stage of progress possible creating a fuckfest in all raid zones at all hours of the day.
