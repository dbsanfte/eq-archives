<br>
Somehow I managed to slip through the ropes and get chosen for beta. I'm really hoping it will be something to stick with after beta. If not at least good enough to keep me til WoW. I'm all about the PS2 MMOGs though cause my PC is getting a little too old to handle the outrageous requirements of games these days. I never even got to turn on a luclin model. (not that I was missing much). I'd like to see some more peoples though making the great PC to PS2 exodus cause playing with the &quot;fuck you phat lewts&quot; (EQOA) kids gets a little too much handle.<br>
<br>
Anybody else on the beta team? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=snufffilmjenkins@thesaryrntavern>Snuff Film Jenkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/23/03 9:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3271.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Final Fantasy XI</span><hr size=1> Check this e3 report of it out. I wasnt aware that ps2 and PC versions would be on the same world. This just gets better and better.<br>
<br>
Final Fantasy XI (mmorpg) <br>
<br>
This game looks to be the game I will play for a long time. Visually the game looks good, the character design especially. One of the major features that really makes this game #1 on my list is that the PS2 and PC versions both exist in the same world. This means you can play on PC or PS2 and interact normally with users on the opposite platform (/cheer Jade). <br>
<br>
Max group size: 6 <br>
(You can link up to 3 groups so you can basically have a group of 18 people) <br>
<br>
Max level: Looks like the max level will start at at least 60 but might be 65 by the time anyone gets to 60. Going up in incremients of 5. Since FFXI allows support jobs, your support job max level is half of your main job current level (so level 65 main job would allow level 32 max support job). <br>
<br>
Starting out: Beta starts in June probably, sign ups for beta are over, release is probably late this year. <br>
<br>
Main/support jobs: basically a job in FFXI is a player’s class. FFXI allows for a support job as well as a main job, you can change jobs at any point from your house (basically at the nearest town, because you can have temporary residence in most towns). Your support job max level is half of your main job current level. There is only one character per account, so instead of creating an alternate character, you just change jobs (starts you out at level 1 if you haven’t used that job yet). <br>
<br>
Could you have one character that was max level in all jobs? <br>
Yes, it would take a long time and a lot of work but it would be possible. But remember, you can only use abilities and spells of your main job and support job at whatever level they are at, so if you had level 60 black mage and you put that as your support job, it would only allow you to use spells/abilities up to half of your main job current level. If you had level 60 red mage but your main job was warrior and support job was thief, you would not be able to use any red mage spells. <br>
<br>
Starting jobs: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage <br>
<br>
Special jobs (you must unlock these jobs by getting to some level with the starting jobs): Paladin, Bard, Beastmaster, Dark Knight, Ranger, Summoner (this list is incomplete, some other possibilities are ninja, samurai, etc…) <br>
<br>
Travel: (this is a big thing for me, I don’t like to endlessly run around a world that is too big, I like to get to where I’m going quickly and get to the fun) <br>
<br>
Long distance: Airships and ships <br>
Travel in this method is slow, it can take up to 15 minutes to get from one city to another via airship, I don’t like waiting that long. <br>
<br>
Short distance: Chocobos, Increased run speeds, warp self or party to home point, port out of a dungeon <br>
§ Chocobos: Buyable, users can also raise them, and they may also be rentable. Travel on a chocobo is fast; it would likely be a good method of getting from a town to the place you want to hunt. <br>
§ Increased run speeds: I only saw a thief able to do this, but he was running incredibly fast. There may be spells to do this but I didn’t see any in the White mage or Black mage spell lists. <br>
§ Warp I and warp II: Black magic, looked like these spells are not aquired until after black mage level 30 (meaning you would have to have black mage as your main job in order to get this). Warp I is like a common gate spell, it ports the caster of the spell back to his or her home point (bind point). Warp II ports the caster’s party back to home point (I am not sure if the entire party goes to the caster’s home point of if they each go to their own home point). <br>
§ Escape: Black magic, not sure what level, ports the caster’s party out of a dungeon (handy for when you get to the bottom and want to leave). <br>
<br>
Zoning: There is zoning in FFXI. That means that when you travel from one area to another, the screen will go to a loading screen to load the next area. There are also some areas where you will not actually travel the distance required to get from point A to point B. For example, if you area heading towards a town, you may get in range to see the town, but you will zone into the town long before you actually get there (kind of nice, cuts out unnecessary running). <br>
<br>
Death: Death in FFXI results in experience loss and probably allows you to lose a level if you die shortly after going up a level. At level 60, the xp needed for next level was 20,000 at the time I had 15,078 after dying once I had 13,478 (about 12.5% of level lost). Seems like a lot of xp to lose for one death so I would say this is a drawback to the game. <br>
<br>
Resurrecting: Once you die your character falls to the ground. You can still move the camera and look around. There is a timer window that appears once you die, counts down 1 hour. You also have the option to respawn at your home point. Items, Raise, or Raise II can be used to resurrect a player that has died. I am not sure if you get any xp back or perhaps you don’t lose any if you are resurrected. <br>
<br>
Items/Equipment: Weapons work based on damage and delay so some weapons will strike faster than others, and weapon damage will probably vary a lot (I prefer this, the complication of a game like this makes it more fun, if its too simple its boring). <br>
<br>
Example: Level 58 knife, 21 damage, 176 delay <br>
<br>
I timed a weapon with 529 delay and it took about 9.01 seconds between swings. <br>
<br>
Armor has basic DEF stat and all equipment can possibly have special stat modifiers like +5 strength for example. <br>
<br>
Many items like potions and phoenix downs are in the game as well as food which can be used as a healing method (although probably not as effective as actually having a healer in your group). <br>
<br>
Fighting: fighting is pretty similar to most mmorpgs. X to target, X again to bring up the battle menu, X again to select attack or you can select to use a spell or ability (this is slightly more complicated than other mmorpgs but keep in mind that this game is a lot more complex) <br>
<br>
Magic: Your don’t have to memorize spells that you want to use, you can use any spell that you have as long as there is a target for the spell and you have enough MP. <br>
<br>
MP regen: Regaining MP is done commonly by resting. It does take awhile and it is something that many players don’t like, there are things that will help out MP regeneration like MP drain spells, convert HP to MP spells, items, and item abilities. <br>
<br>
Spell interrupt: Moving while casting interrupts spells. Not sure if being attacked can interrupt spell casting but it’s a good possibility. <br>
<br>
Spells that end in aga are area effect spells. The spike spells are damage shields. Spell names my change for release, and this list may be partially incomplete. <br>

<br>
Kill Stealing: Not gonna be a problem in FFXI, once a monster is engaged, players outside of your group or linked group (up to 18 ) will not be able to attack (not sure how this will work against uber mobs that can kill 18 players with ease but I am sure they will do something to make boss fights work if they haven’t already). Players outside of your group can still heal and buff people that have engaged a target (not sure if you could debuff the monster).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showPrevMessage?topicID=3271.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showNextMessage?topicID=3271.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3271.topic&index=1><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=3271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=3271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
