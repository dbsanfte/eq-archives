While I would agree that if this took place in his city that it would be in the city's best interest to help him out, that is not the case here.

Lake St. Clair is about 30-40 miles NE of the city of Hamtramck.  However, if I'm remember correctly the City of Hamtramck is &quot;gifted&quot; nearly 47% of all of their civil services budget through a joint contract with the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan.  Let me research a little and I'll find the exact numbers.  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah... and instead of looking into issues like this, the State House of Representatives were busy on Wednesday with more important issues, like meeting to pass a bill that now allows Ted Nugent and his band of merry marksman to hunt the song dove in the state of Michigan. <br>
<br>
Yes, there was a rally.<br>
Yes, Ted was there.<br>
Yes, this was reported before the story about the benefit scheduled to build a relief fund for this officer on the evening news.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zenlaispentarrah>Zenlais Pentarrah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/6/03 11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3651.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some pretty sad shit</span><hr size=1> Am I the only one that thinks the men that the cop saved should help pay for...er...saving them?<br>

However, that does not make that persons employer liable for anything that may happen during the course of the event.  As for the police officers duty and requirments...  You cannot REQUIRE a person to work while not being paid.  It's called slavery.  I know there are multiple exceptions to this rule(like the military).  But in general if I was forced to do my job for 0 pay regardless of the nature of the work I could sue the fuck out of my employer.  Ask Wal-Mart.  The fact that the employee is a police officer and the situation is emotionally charged obviously skews the x's and 0's of the matter, but really it's no different than an auto mechanic being told that anytime he sees a car broken down on the side of the road he is REQUIRED to stop and fix it for free.  If you say ok well this only applies to police officers, well now your discriminating against police officers.  You just can't do it.   Well, you could do it, but sooner or later your going to do it to the wrong person and they are gonna sue the fucking shit out of you.  Also, I am not a cop.  I wish I could say my career was as noble,  though I'm glad it does'nt pay the same.  I know a cop who plays EQ on Saryrn though(err used to).  Maybe he will respond with his expert opinion?

<br>
Not exactly 0 pay as he was employed and collecting a check being employed as an officer. We expect alot of our police officers in this country. We raise our kids if ever in trouble or lost to find one, do we need to start telling them be sure to find a police officer who is on the clock. I've worked at many businesses where we give police officers discounts we don't go by whether or not they are on the clock. If I was held up with a cop nearby in or out of uniform I'd be keeping an eye on them to see what their step is.<br>
<br>
We expect all this of them as part of their job and they often come through for us as this guy did for the people in danger. Its not as if we're talking about some building inspector working for the city, cops deserve to be taken care of for putting themselves in harms way both on and off duty for the protection of our citizens.<br>
<br>
I'm not positive if cops are wage or salary but I think wage. If thats the case they should be salary. Unlike working at Wal-Mart, Loch Divine, salary jobs you're paid a set salary no matter how many hours you work or do not work and its not slavery. Sometimes this means working 1 day a week(if you can get away with it) or working 50 hours a week without overtime pay. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fammadenflycaster>Fammaden Flycaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/7/03 9:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3651.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We raise our kids if ever in trouble or lost to find one, do we need to start telling them be sure to find a police officer who is on the clock. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hey dumbass how the fuck will the child know who is a police officer if he is NOT on the clock? (not in uniform)<br>
<br>
I have news for everyone, off duty police officers are DUTY BOUND to assist in matters of public safety to the best of thier ability. Obviously if your wife and children are with you or you are witnessing a five man armed robbery, then it might not be wise to respond as a hero, but you have to take the best action available to you at the time.  Most officers carry their sidearm, cuffs and badge with them at all times while in their home state for this reason.  <br>
<br>
As far as salary vs. wage, they get a certain salary but they also get compensated for working overtime, in pay or compensatory leave. This is government we are talking about not some corporation where you get the same salary for a 40 hour week as you do for the 80 hour weeks when there is a deadline to be met. <br>
<br>
I really dont know anything about Canada, but that guy better at least CALL for help in the U.S., depending on the situation and what justification he had to do more or less to assist. <br>
