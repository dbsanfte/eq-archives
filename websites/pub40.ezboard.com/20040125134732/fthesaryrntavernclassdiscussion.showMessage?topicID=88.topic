I am very unhappy with the post 50 cleric spells and roles.  I am not writing this as a flame or class envy or because I am looking for a power up.  What I am suggesting is small alterations to several spells, or at least a couple.  I am NOT asking for clerics to become great soloers, take the place of any other class, or anything that would alter the role or real power of the class.  I would appreciate a response to the points, since I can't seem to find one anywhere.  This leads me to think Verant doesn't play test the cleric much as a class, I hope I am plain wrong.  I also really do hope that some spells I don't have yet have been really misrepresented to me by my elder clerics.  Please correct any glaring errors.<br>
<br>
Level 50<br>
Improved Invis to undead, not live yet should be in Velious.<br>
My take: Good spell addition, tracks along with the class, however, I haven't used invis to undead in about 4 months, everything my level or near it sees through invis to undead, or is mixxed with live monsters, so its useless.<br>
Suggestion: Raise the level that invis to undead works on to mobs 54 and lower, possibly with a check on the casted level of the spell for effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Level 51<br>
Death pact<br>
My take: Totally worthless.  After over 200 casts, never once seen it work.  True I don't let my team get that close to death often, but it has happened about 20 times, and it did nothing.  I am told by others it will heal 200 just at death.<br>
Suggestion: Why not have this heal 1/4 of their total HP 50% of the time?  Go 25% and I might still use it, but doubt it.  Or, give them a rune effect with a 500 hp damage absorbing shield? <br>
<br>
Dread of night<br>
My take: OK spell, never loadeded, never used, it does fit in with the class I guess.<br>
Suggestions: Not much utility in real play, be nice if did more or cast faster, but may be unbalancing.<br>
<br>
Remedy<br>
My take: Good spell.  Always have this ready along with CH.<br>
Suggestions: Would like more faster cheaper, but its a fair upgrade spell.<br>
<br>
Sunskin (Group invis to undead)<br>
My take: OK spell that falls inline with the class.  Never found it, wouldn't use it if I did.  If I was in Guk, probably would.  <br>
Suggestions: Make it fixxed duration, make it more useful by working on higher level mobs.<br>
<br>
Level 52<br>
Heroic bond<br>
My take: Excellent spell.  I actually keep this one loaded a lot of the time too.  I know it was a Verant mix up that gave us this when we got it, glad to see it was kept as is, since it is a reasonable upgrade spell.<br>
Suggestions: Wouldn't dream of tampering with a defining spell like this.<br>
<br>
Heroism<br>
Ditto heroic bond comments.<br>
<br>
Upheavel<br>
My take: Used it once 3 months after I got it to see if it worked.  Never found a utility for it in normal game play.  I agroed half the zone casting it, and no way I could get this off with a level 25 warrior hitting me.  It is an upgrade that tracks with the class.<br>
Suggestions:  Lower the cast time OR the mana cost and it would actually be cast once in a blue moon.<br>
<br>
Word of vigor<br>
My take: Tried it for a full day trying to figure out what to do with it.  I was grouped with 5 others and all were melee/tanks spreading out the damage.  Totally useless even in that case, even in Kedge.  Waste of a slot to ever memorize this one.<br>
Suggestions: Half the mana cost and if I was grouped with 5 tanks in the water weilding heavy weaps and spreading out all the damage evenly, and I might actually load it up.  Alternatively add a cure disease/poison/dots effect and I can see using it in the planes maybe.<br>
<br>
Level 53<br>
Annul magic<br>
My take: Decent upgrade to past spells, tracks with the class.  Never use it accept to debuff for buffing on raids.  Could use it to remove damage shields, but too busy healing.<br>
Suggestions: Make all in this line remove effects from the bottem up.  Never use it really.<br>
<br>
Divine light<br>
My take: Really tried to use this spell, doesn't work.  If you need a small heal use remedy, if you need a big one use CH.  Not worth losing a slot for this spell.<br>
Suggestions: Half the cast time and make it heal over time, and I might cast it on monks just as they go to pull.  Otherwise, not useful.<br>
<br>
Yaulp IV<br>
My take: Haven't used this line since level 12 I think.  Used it once to see the stats.  Clerics can't melee whats the point?<br>
Suggestions: Make this line castable on others.  I can see tanks begging me for this, if you don't melee a LOT no point to it at all.<br>
<br>
Level 54<br>
Reckoning<br>
My take: Tracks along with upgrade to our DD.<br>
Suggestions: Clerics should be at the low end of DD casting in general, and this spells makes damn sure we stay there.  I wouldn't suggest a major change, but lowering the recast time I think would be in order, also, it is resisted a LOT more than other casters main damage spells.  Should maybe have a short stun component.  If I strike a monster with holy power of reckoning from the great Bristlebane, I would expect it to stun him a bit, even if the damage is half all the other casters.<br>
<br>
Symbol of marzin<br>
My take: I honestly only recently started using this buff.  At 11 pp a cast it is not cheap, but I firmly feel its worth it.  Problem is after a month of using it regularly I find that I am totally flat broke.  <br>
Suggestions: I don't like that cost, but its a buff that probably should be expensive, I don't want something I use messed with though, so no suggestion here.<br>
<br>
Unswerving hammer of faith<br>
My take: OK here is a rant.  This thing is a joke.  I am dumbfounded that any programmer with an IQ over 20 thinks this spell has any use.  It costs over double reckoning, lasts for one npc and then poofs.  Can't buff it, heal it.  I know it was nerfed, never was clear why.  I can not see this 100 hp pet, even totally buffed being unbalancing.  You can't command it.  You guys really goofed this.  Now I see druids getting a pet that actually works.  That leaves wizards and clerics the only non pet casters, and I would rather have never seen that spell at all then see it as it is now.  Way over nerfing bad Verant :P.<br>
Suggestions: Un-nerf it so it can be buffed and with death pact MIGHT live through a fight.  Alternatively, give it an hour duration. Another alternative, on poof it returns 3/4 of the cast cost of mana back to the caster.  I would really like to see this 'fun' spell work in some way.  Can't you at least let it just have a fixxed hour of life and accept buffs?  Or let it be cast, buffed, and not have to be cast at a target?<br>
<br>
Level 55<br>
Banish undead<br>
My take: Never would use it.  Other DD better.<br>
Suggestions: This spell should do 50% more damage.  Clerics good at battling undead? Not with this line of spells.  ALL other casters can do MUCH more damage to undead than we can cheaper and faster.<br>
<br>
Fortitude<br>
My take: Useless.  No use for the spell.  Costlier than hero.  <br>
Suggestions: Take it out or increase the hp and ac buffing along with the spell cost.<br>
<br>
Stun command, supposedly in Velious<br>
My take: Not sure, look forward to trying it.  If it does whats reported, could be a decent supplemental spell when the group is tank low.<br>
Suggestions: Holding off till we see how its nerfed.<br>
<br>
Wake of tranquility<br>
My take: This whole line is garbage.  It gets me killed more than it ever helps.  1% of the time this line gets resisted and nothing happens, 49% of the time it gets resisted the npc attacks, and the other 50% I agro everything in shouting distance.  <br>
Suggestions: Make this spell NOT agro if resisted, then I might try it out again.  <br>
<br>
Level 56<br>
Banish summoned<br>
My take: Useless line. Never use these at all, never have, though I tried.<br>
Suggestions: Replace this line with upgrades to summon food and water, or cure diseases and poisons, anything would be an improvement.  If we are to keep the line, the damage should be upped by 50% at least.<br>
<br>
Mark of karn<br>
My take: Useless.  Supreme nerfing in action heh, take something useful and nerf it to useless.<br>
Suggestions: OK I disagree with the nerfing of it at all, but I'll proceed from the attitude that as was is not acceptable.  Make the recast time instant, a 5 minute recast time on this makes it useless in all situations, even without the other nerfs.  Lower resist rate, after observing level 60 clerics trying their best to get this to stick to greens, just doesn't happen much.  Resist should be halfed.  Here is the sum of the suggestions, make it instant recast, lower resist 50%, to trade off for those, make it only heal half what it does now and double duration.  This will make it only next to useless, and I would load it up on a few high end npcs.<br>
<br>
Paralyzing earth<br>
My take: Decent upgrade to the line. <br>
Suggestions: I think root will never work the way players would like, and lasting through one damage spell would be nice.<br>
<br>
Reviviscence<br>
My take: Looking forward to it.  Its a class defining spell.<br>
Suggestions: Less cost would be nice.  All things considered, I would rather see it not altered and I'll work on the epic weap.<br>
<br>
Level 57<br>
Aegis<br>
My take: Won't use it, too costly for too little.<br>
Suggestions: The ac line in whole is WAY too costly for clerics.  Enchanters get spells almost as good for 1/6 the cost.  I have started to just ask the enc to ac buff everyone.  This spell should cost at most 100 not 450 mana, alternatively make it group buff.  I suspect either this or Bulwark is a mistake.<br>
<br>
Bulwark of faith<br>
My take: Is it 48 or 38?  I can see using it if its 48.  Still should be less costly in mana.  If it costs 50% more mana, but was group I can see using it.<br>
Suggestions: Make it group buff, but raise the cost 50% for trade off.<br>
<br>
Trepidation<br>
My take: Reasonable upgrade to the line.<br>
Suggestions: Better not ask for any changes, though the cast time is a bit slow.<br>
<br>
Word of restoration<br>
My take: Don't see using it much.  Remedy or CH is good as it gets on heals.  Since it does cure some and heal group, I suppose its a decent upgrade, but way too costly in mana to be used often.  Wasted slot mostly.<br>
Suggestion: Half the cast cost.<br>
<br>
Level 58<br>
Antidote<br>
My take: Decent upgrade to the line.  <br>
Suggestions: Be better as a group spell.<br>
<br>
Enforced reverence<br>
My take: An upgrade I guess, but man 24 second recast ack makes it useless, 240 mana cost and does 250 damage heh this one is useless.  Use ANY other stuns 2 times instead, poor poor upgrade.<br>
Suggestion: Half the recast time, half the cost, it might then get loaded up.<br>
<br>
Naltrons mark<br>
My take: A defining spell.  Goes in the bag with CH, Res, Heroism.<br>
Suggesitons: Wouldn't dream of it.<br>
<br>
Level 59<br>
Celestial elixir<br>
My take: Useless.  Heal over time, hmm CH much better, no point.<br>
Suggestions: Go ahead and make it CH over time, alternatively, half the cost.  It is also kind of buggy.  Replace this with an upgrade to DD.<br>
<br>
The unspoken word<br>
My take: Useless, but I guess an upgrade.  This line isn't very useful from start to here the finish.  Resisty like crazy and weird agros when used from huge distances.<br>
Suggestions: Trash this line and replace with anything else.  Alternatively, make it resisted less, might get a slot for killing greens en masse.  For 59, you think you get somehting nice though and usefull, guess not.  Maybe replace with a DD upgrade.<br>
<br>
Level 60 WOOHOOO <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Aegolism, supposedly Velious spell?<br>
My take: Looks good, makes 60 something worth shooting for.<br>
Suggestions: Upgrade to the line, why add a cost component?  Clerics are poor enough.<br>
<br>
Banishment of shadows<br>
My take: I honestly don't know really, I am told this is a useless one too.  Costs 60pp to cast and poof goes the body?  No point, I don't want to banish, I want to kill.<br>
Suggestions: Make it a real upgrade in the line, double the last DD to undead spell with no cost in components. OK again, where is the DD upgrade?  Level 60, can we get an all purpose DD upgrade instead?<br>
<br>
Divine intervention<br>
My take: Useless as is.  Costs 10pp (more pooring of the cleric), doesn't stack with many spells, everyone says useless as death pact, just costs more.  <br>
Suggestions: Same as death pact, why not have this heal 1/2 of their total HP 75% of the time?  Go 50% and I might still use it, but doubt it.  Or, give them a rune effect with a 1000 hp damage absorbing shield? <br>
<br>
Word of redemption<br>
My take: Useless.  I need to CH my entire group? When it comes to this you are screwed anyway.  I have 12 seconds to do it?  If I am in a situation where I HAVE to spend 1100 mana to CH my entire group, I don't have 12 seconds to cast it.<br>
Suggestions: Half the cost and time to cast, and I might use it to heal the group after a res, or fighting a boss, if I can find a free slot and somehow manage to make mana out of thin air.<br>
<br>
OK thats it.  Spell by spell suggestions that I have heard from many many other clerics.  The silent core of the group.  The non power player, the servent of the group, that understands without the group, they are useless as a fish out of water.  I would never dream of every suggestion ebing implemented, but can we get a response point by point?  I would hope 3 of the spells may get revised and would ask for the pet, Mark of Karn and the DD general purpose be looked at closer at least.  The pet just so there is one post 50 spell I can have fun with, Mark of Karn, because I was such a great idea gone totally bad, when it didn't have to be, and the DD, because we are a caster class, and need to have some offense, at least half as good as the other casters.  I would suggest upgrades to some lines totally ignored post 50 as well.  For example, summon food and water upgrades to summon more, as well as changing water to wine?  Or maybe a spell that multiplies food and water and alcohol from 1 to 20?  The summon hammer, summon one that we can give to pets and players alike that does DD to undead?  Make yaulp castable on others?  Berserker str line types, increase stats other than str at top levels?  <br>
<br>
Thanks for your consideration, I spent doznes of hours collecting this information and putting it together, please be kind.<br>

And I find that there's enough time to DI three people &amp; engage a uber-mob with enough time for it not to wear off (10 mins).  It heals 100%.  Aegolism is all the Cleric buffs stacked into one buff with a reagent.<br>
<br>
In my groups Clerics get 100% or 95% of the stones.  Use them to buy your reagents.  If you don't hang with people who hook you up like that then get new friends.  Life for a Cleric is hard making 2000pp trips to the store every week or so.  Oh &amp; the cost for DI is 20 some odd PP cause it uses two emeralds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udraxxa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draxx A</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=eq000087 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(2/7/01 6:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: suggestions for cleric spells, any thoughts?</span><hr size=1>  some people dont know that we spend so much on gems for our spells. on average 2000-3000pp a week is easy to obtain at your local merchant.<br>
 yes i recieve about 70-90% of the gems from exp camps. and yes that does cover the cost in most case's.<br>
<br>
  i figure i walk around with a 10 slot back back full of peridots, and a 10 slot back pack full of pearls(for death pact and when the mage forgets his pearls),jasper(only a 20 stack(for when a pali runs out),emeralds(for devine intervetion= when you know the puller has a 90-100% chance of not making it back with the mob), and star rubies(BOOM=undead gone but no exp).<br>
