The point is that She came in, and used her level to bully someone out of the way so she could camp it with her high level character. And the fact that she was a total bitch about it proves her character even more.<br>
<br>
Mister no outdoor camps, if your little 30 necro or cleric were camping this mob, and I walked in with my monk and threw down a 300 thunderous kick, and quadded for 250 and killed your mob right in front of you, would you sit there and say &quot;Oh well. It wasn't a camp anyway...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yea sure you would.<br>
<br>
2 nights ago Verucca and a hydra came into Velks and /OOC camp check.    One of my guildies was at BW and he said BW.   45 sec later, she parks herself right beside him and starts pulling mobs IN his camp.  <br>
<br>
Illegal by SoE terms? no not really. They have &quot;play nice rules&quot; to cover it, but it's not enforcable. It is however unethical by most people's standards.  How do you &quot;share BW with 8 people? you can't.  <br>
<br>
Read a little more of the thread and realize I started playing the day Kunark came out. I'm far from a newb. I'm just letting as many people know about this person as I can. Hopefully someday people will stop following her and she'll quit the game. <br>

I was there with her, Detah, Lumeni, and a number of others for many of her attempts. Razoo was only one of many others working the spawn at the time, in fact i believe the 6th or 7th spawn after she bgan camping it.<br>
<br>
The whole first few were a running battle with HnE trying to get a clicker for Icetoad's hydra. Quite frustrating really, memory is a bit fuzzy on the whole thing, but eventually it was agreed she'd get him his, then he'd help get her hers, one or the other. Alot of it hinged on who could get the bigger number of MBing wizards. Whichever way it worked, she got gipped on her turn in the agreement by another getting it. Which is why it was such a big deal with the SG thing.<br>
<br>
Eventually Calystah's clicker was gotten by a guild raid of the entire FS force, I distinctly remember doing port runs to there, and a few posts on the board since Arry/Caly was only a recruit or trial at the time in FS. As we ported into skyfire that time, there was no other competition with a force, it was a very clean kill. <br>
Her ragefire camp was more painful than anyone elses ive known since it was moved to skyfire, and I was there for most of it. <br>
<br>
Flame her for other things if you wish, but dont hit her on Ragefire. Hers was as painful as anyones, and more people griefed her over it than she griefed. IN fact she helped a good number with the camp afterwards because of her own. Believe it or not, Arry has done many GOOD things for people on this server as well as bad. <br>
<br>
First time I met her was her giving me a necklace and spell back in NFP when I was trying to find the spell. She gave it for free. She helped me camp Phinny 5 million times until he dropped my Blue Crystal Staff for my epic. Her and Argin used to take small groups of FS out to WW/HoT to farm armor and tailsmans for them. Hell, half the gear im in even now I still can look to Arry for helping me to get.<br>
<br>
She took FS from a time when it was floundering. I, admittadly, left at this time rather than trying to help stick it out. After Necole and crew left that first time I and many others thought the guild was dead. Arry helped pick it up and actually MOVE it forward for quite awile. She pushed FS into NToV, AoW, Ssra, The Deep, and numerous other places it never went before she started helping lead it. For this, credit to her is DESERVED. <br>
<br>
Certainly she has a short temper, a relationship with another that some view as improper, and is head of a guild that has lost many of its old playerbase. Her personality can and will get her flamed, but for god's sake if you're going to flame her do it for something flameworthy. Alot of people on this board bandwagon the flames for no reason other than trying to look cool.<br>
<br>
To this specific incident, I dont really have any true perspective on it since I dont know jack about the area or the camp, so I wont comment. Also, none of my comments are meant to be directed at any specific person.<br>
<br>
My statements are my personal views only, and are not related to my guild, so take them as personal views.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
I've heard this so so SO many damn times in eq &quot; there are no such things as camps &quot; This is for the fact that guides/gm's dont want to deal with people being &quot; ks'd &quot; on mobs, but then again people do it all the time anyways, for example look at Phinny... spend a week in kedge and you can see how nasty it gets (worse then lodizal) people just come in with their hydra crews now and take out the mob, even if people are waiting at ZI or at the hall to pull phinny. Its mainly just about respect to others, and if you care to wait for another day/time to take out that enemy, or you can wait for a different day when its not as camped or not camped at all. Our big examples of these bad camps = lodizal,rage,phinny, luggald broodmother...dont think I can name any others that are ks'd alot, and even rage was changed because of all the clerics pissed that they spent 12+ hours camping a mob and then someone comes in and just sits ontop of them and proceeds to kill the enemy heh. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqenc2000.com/froggerX2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

 Sony says theres no camps so they dont have to deal with the drama day in and day out. We as a community say there are, and that they should be respected. The fuckin end. Whats so complicated? The only people I hear crying about no camps are asses that take camps from other people.<br>

No offense, but thats BS.  Aono was the one pushing FS forward during this time.  A lot of people left when she took over the first time Necole left and almost everyone left when it became apparent Aono wasnt coming back anytime soon and she took over the second time.  She has never been the leader of FS when they made any advances only during the times of mass exodus.  Theres a reason for this she just refuses to see it.<br>
<br>
Aono is the one that deserves any credit for moving FS forward.  Hayley deserves the credit for royally screwing it up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kida@thesaryrntavern>Kida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/27/03 9:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3330.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire</span><hr size=1> Thats not entirely true zalf, aono was given guild leadership the second time necole and crew took off.

Shortly before Fs killed Aary for the first time, necole and crew joined back again. Its hard to say who is responsible for that, I would credit it more towards hayley though than necole. <br>

When necole left a second time, she left it in aono's hands and he pushed aow, ssra and the deep.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loftel@thesaryrntavern>Loftel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/27/03 9:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3330.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hah</span><hr size=1> To whatever monk threatened to ks me lol..gluck , feel free to hit all my mobs you want to hun, I don't mind a little out of group dps, however crappy ur monk's dps might be &gt;&lt;<br>

<br>
FS killed archlich only in ssra right?<br>
<br>
FS killed aow 2 or 3 times?<br>

<br>
This was also made possible b/c FS had recently merged with shivans fury and they finally had the numbers...she yelled and screamed at us for two days - had the guild spending 12+ hours at the pc every day cuz we kept failing aary.<br>
<br>
<br>
After Aono took over he worked his ass off tracking spawns.  I remember spending 6 hours a day with him in ssra waiting for pops...<br>
<br>
<br>
People followed Aono b/c they liked him.  With Hayley, and the aary thing, it was more out of fear/coercion.<br>
<br>
I originally thought that Hayley was just misunderstood - that she really was a wonderful person and that everyone had her wrong b/c she was an 'aggressive female'.  So I made friends with her, and tried to understand her.  I guess my opinion changed after her campaign of hate against the girl who xp'd with Detah - and numerous other shady things all mentioned in the other FS flame.  I still believe she has a good side, it's just buried down there.  And she is blinded by her love for that little schmuck named Detah.  Her priorities are all screwed up - EQ loot and acne covered teens should NOT be the main focus of anyone's life...<br>

This was Zenger Camping THO and BP days on end learning his pop schedule then seeing what guilds killed him at what time, and Stormseeker pushing to get the raids done.  Storm pretty much rallied the people to go as they had never taken them out and was a big acomplishment.  Hay cought up after everyone was past the inviz bridge.  Was the general consensus that FS couldnt be led across the invizible bridge.  Only death was myself the first raid when my cat decided to help me out by pushing my left and forward arrow so I ran off the bridge =) GO SPOT!.<br>
<br>
They did THO and BP atleast 2 times that I am aware of, which is where Xedia got his 2nd loot since he joined in december (I think that was when Shivians joined) and was called a loot whore.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
Aono, camped SSRA 24/7 for like 2-3 months.  He has used my character to camp AL, Rag1, XTC and Cursed cycle.  He had a big push to camp Kael for statue/aow, which ended up allot of thurg armor dropping and allot of just sitting hoping for Statue to pop.  <br>
<br>
Hayley couldnt push but so much being that she was back at work and didnt get home till 8:30 est or thereabouts, where many people didnt want to start raiding at 9pm just to log in an hour when they needed to go do ther things before they retired to bed.  This was about the time that Aono started to decrease his online time, and then eventually stopped when his father had some heart troubles.  <br>
<br>
Times for raids slipped and slipped and people wouldnt log in unless a raid was called, but noone wanted to call a raid unless there was enough online to call one.  <br>
<br>
Which came first the chicken or the egg type of situation.<br>

I never threatened to KS you. I was just making a point about your lame no camp statement.  And until you know me, you really can't make comments about my crappy DPS. I do ok for a non ebayed 61 monk. I obtained all my gear by not KSing and camp stealing from other people. I'm not the best monk out there but I have integrity, and everyone who knows me, knows that about me.   Again, I didn't come here to talk about my DPS. Another thread hijacked by a jackass.<br>
