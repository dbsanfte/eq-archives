First of all it is an agreement between players- not some enforcable rule<br>
<br>
Second of all ToN has stated they are out of the rotation- so not bound by said agreement.<br>
<br>
If ToN has shown respect to others by asking what they were doing etc- it is just politeness- not some implied agreement to some non enforcable agreement.<br>
<br>
If we decide to ever do Ntov or RoV we will do so regardless of any agreement between other guilds on the server- So will HNE and OOP and more likely than not TWC. Chances are that this will be a rare occurance.<br>
<br>
If other guilds don't need to agree with this rotation- why should you go off and flame ToN for going after VuLak and disregarding &quot; Diplomacy&quot;  . There is no statemanship involved in maintaining this agreement :-P<br>

<br>
   I'm deeply sorry if we truely offended you folks.  That was not our intention, nor do I believe it was ToN's intention to 'roll over' you.  Unfortunately this is something that should have been discussed previous to ToN leaving the NToV agreement, or at least announced before it became an issue, that ToN considered Vulak to be 'open game' whenever he was up.<br>
<br>
  When the NToV agreement was written I truely don't believe that Vulak was considered to be a part of it.  Vulak is an entirely different scale of mob compared to the rest of the game.  Requires more force, better discipline and generally higher level toons than anything else in ToV.  Just because the RoV is located in NToV does not make it by default part of the NToV agreement, just as Eashen and Ikitar are part of NToV but not part of the agreement.  That agreement was formed to keep guilds from &quot;stepping on each other toes&quot;, allowing one guild to roam free in NToV while others went after targets in rougly the same difficulty tier outside NToV.  Just as Eashen and Ikitar are &quot;easier&quot; than the mobs past Aary, so is RoV &quot;harder&quot;.<br>
<br>
The point is that RoV is a different scale of encounter.  This isn't justification of ToN's actions as a guild, just personal sentiment.  However I felt the same way before ToN even left the rotation (and note that ToN had not been taking our listed turn in the rotation for at least two cycles before we formally left).<br>
<br>
It seems like the biggest issue that folks are having is that this time through ToN leadership didn't ask for the all clear well in advance of heading in, thus we were not told before gathering that Isen did not want us in there.  As far as this is concerned, all I can say is that us asking in the past does not necessarily set precident where we have to ask every single time.  I am sorry that our past actions led you to believe we would &lt;always&gt; ask permission first before moving on the RoV  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In this forum all I can say is that, if a member of ToN told you to &quot;Fuck off&quot; then I can say, with 100% assurance, that it had nothing to do with either Isengard or this disagreement with them.  It had far more to do with so many members of ToN being conditioned to tell you to fuck off whenever they see you due to the exact same sanctimonious tone you have presented here.  ..... stopping myself from saying more. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=128762"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mchsi.com/~graul/PorennSigFinal3.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:large;">65th level Transcendent</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tonsaryrn.com"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;font-family:times;font-size:small;">Travelers of Norrath</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arryalyse>Arry Alyse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Tavern's most flamed female</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/17/03 2:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3484.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> The fact is that other guilds showed respect to ton in the past.

<br>
Porenn, I am sure this will be moved to TBF shortly.  If at that time you feel the need to rip me apart for having an opinion, so be it.  No where have I stated that RoV IS part of NToV.  I have stated that it is not within FS grasp, we will not attempt it, and that we will not blow it to screw over another guild.  I have also stated that we would like to finish clearing NTOV before another guild comes in and kills remaining pops to kill RoV.  I do not feel that this is an unreasonable request.<br>
<br>
We do not doubt the difficulty of RoV, nor do we invalidate your desire to pursue it.  I was asked to mediate when your guild refused to compromise.  That resulted in a &quot;fuck off&quot;  Whether it was warranted now, or because that individual holds grudges for things that happened over 1 year ago, I do not care.<br>
<br>
I nor my guild, has done nothing of questionable, or unfair game play in almost 1 year.  Mistakes were made, perhaps forgiven, never forgotton. To hold it against me, and continue to judge me is your problem, not mine.  Some people will see the good in others, some will see the bad forever.  What you choose is ultimately up to you.<br>

<br>
Under the NToV agreement, NToV has been interpreted to mean as Aary and beyond. I recall having seen it referred to as such many times. The agreement specifically references Sontalak, Ikitiar, Eashen as not being part of the rotation because they are before you get to Aaryonar. Ring of Vulak (RoV) is beyond Aaryonar. In order to do RoV, you have to clear the Lords and Ladies so they will not be summoned to aid during the fight. That makes clearing NToV an integral part of doing RoV successfully. <br>
<br>
There is no precedent that it is not part of the rotation. In fact, every time ToN has wanted to do RoV during Isengard's week, they asked first whether we were going to do it. The first time this happened, Tose asked the for the conversation to be logged so that he had a record that Isengard said it was fine for ToN to do RoV during our week. Every time after that, although I am unsure if the conversation was logged, we were still asked first. So to us, the fact that the person who led the rotation (via his raid leader) came to us and asked if it was okay for them to do RoV during our rotation week, implies that it would be not okay for them to do it without asking. This strengthened the idea to us that RoV was in fact part of the rotation and during our week, as long as we held to all other rotation rules, we would have no competition for it.<br>
<br>
Summary: <br>
(Aary and beyond = NToV) + (RoV = Beyond Aary) = RoV is covered under the rotation agreement. <br>
<br>
<br>
I like the NToV rotation agreement. Our guild likes it. The agreement succeeds or fails based on a mutual respect and understanding of the guilds on the server. Guilds that leave the rotation understand that by doing so, they cannot go back (&quot;gifting&quot; issue addressed below). Granted, most that leave don't want to go back because they have bigger fish to fry. Guilds that leave the rotation should understand that by doing so, they cannot go back unless they wish to rejoin the rotation. Being out of the rotation has as much responsibility as being in it.<br>
<br>
Guilds that want into the rotation understand that they need to work with a rotation guild to be allowed a chance to kill Aaryonar to prove they are ready. This starts them out in a cooperative relationship with at least one guild in the rotation and hopefully that relationship gets built upon. <br>
<br>
<br>
So if RoV is part of the NToV rotation, which Isengard believes it is: <br>
<br>
How long does a rotation guild have during their rotation week to complete Vulak ?  The same amount of time as they have to kill any other dragon there.  As long as Aary is killed within 24 hours and as long as you don't leave the zone with mobs up for more than 48 hours, NToV is yours during your week. It doesn't matter if you spend 5 straight nights wiping to it as long as you are there trying. If you go raid something else, or if you leave for 48 hours, then its FFA and anyone can go in. Those are the same rules as the rest of NToV.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Gifting&quot; RoV to another guild - this is where I always get fuzzy because truthfully, gifting doesn't bother us. As long as we are part of the rotation, we get NToV every 5 weeks or so. We don't much care what happens there in the other 4. If Inconceivable wants to let another guild use their week, who cares. All we care about is what happens during the week Isengard is there. <br>
<br>
No guild in the rotation has ever complained to us when ToN did RoV during our week in the past, so I do not see that it should ever be a problem in the future. That to me, is how it should be. If another guild takes the initiative to approach us and say &quot;Are you doing RoV this week?&quot; and we aren't, then why should anyone get their panties all in a bunch about 'gifting' ?  There are just more important things to worry about than that. <br>
<br>
Isengard will always go through the procedure of asking the current Rotation Guild if RoV is FFA in the event that it isnt our week. We believe the NTOV Rotation to be a SERVER wide agreement, not just between a few guilds.<br>
<br>
<br>
So a final summary of Isengard's stance here: <br>
<br>
Ring of Vulak is part of the NToV agreement. To be able to uphold the spirit of the NToV agreement, you cannot do RoV without checking with the rotation guild in NToV that week. It is Isengard's stance that it does not care if a guild passes on RoV and lets another guild do it. Further it is our stance if you raid another mob or leave for 48 hours with stuff up, RoV becomes FFA along with the rest of NToV.  <br>
<br>
We completely understand that the NToV agreement is only as strong as server support of it. Our stance is that the rotation is a server wide agreement (not just between a few guilds) meaning that there are guilds INSIDE NToV (in the rotation) and there are guilds OUTSIDE NToV (not in the rotation). Those outside have as much responsibility to follow the agreement as those inside; meaning they must not violate any guild's rotation week because they're bored or whatever, without asking first whether it is ok. <br>
<br>
Thus far, it has the server support and we would not like to see that change. Our time in NToV is coming to an end soon but we hope to see the rotation agreement stand strong because it is one of the few positive examples of guild interaction left on the server.  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=255219" target="top">Mistress Azoicia Deviante</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

To Vainne: I think your questions are answered above. <br>

To Porenn: You and I disagree. Eashen etc are not part of NToV because of their location (before Aary) not because of their difficulty. <br>
<br>
To ToN: We do not want to argue or create animosity. We want clarity on how RoV will be handled in the future, and the ramifications of an agreement effect the rotation so it should be a public discussion. <br>
<br>
To Saryrn: We did not ask Hayley to 'mediate'. We looked for the rotation leader online and they were not. We looked for GLs of other rotation guilds online and saw Caly and asked her opinion on whether RoV was part of the rotation. What she chose to say to ToN after that was done of her own accord and not at our request.

You guys are fighting over loot you guys can't drop anyways.<br>
<br>
Realistically... by the time you're ready for RoV, you've outgrown the rest of NToV.<br>
<br>
And it's not like ToN hovers over RoV and does it the second it spawns... heck it's the first time we've done it in a month, so don't make it seem like we robbed you of a once in a lifetime opportunity.  It's been readily available (and gone untouched) for most of the last month.<br>
<br>
Also, Ring of Vulak went what, a year before anyone did it again after HnE had last done it?  TWC skipped it, Familjen skipped it, Titans skipped it...  Heck, if ToN hadn't started doing it again and breathed some life back into it, I really doubt it would show up on any of your radar screens anyways.<br>
<br>
In any case.. I doubt we ever go back to ToV again - most our guild doesn't seem to like doing it anymore because it's too damn long of an event for what to us is just &quot;ok&quot; loot (although there are some unique items there).  At best it's a &quot;we're bored out of our minds&quot; raid. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71154" target="top">Shagz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
The 24 hours after the last dragon is dead rule, suggested by Grendalkan, seems perfectly sensible. <br>
<br>
It recognises that a guild has cleared NToV- which is after all necessary- and may want to have a go at RoV the next day as a finish to their NToV week. It also recognises that clearing NToV does not equal killing RoV, and guilds actually capable of killing RoV may decide they want to do it from time to time. <br>
<br>
Such a rule would work to avoid this kind of incident in future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pelagia>Pelagia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/17/03 8:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3484.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ToN awash</span><hr size=1> The fact of the matter is this: Isengard cleared NTOV in one day with the express intention to do RoV the next day.

I wasn't wearing my tinfoil hat so I must have missed the transmission. You weren't in the zone. You scheduled on your guild boards? In your motd? Sorry, I don't read those. Again, I use my analogy--I've been scheduling MM in my head every three days for two weeks now. And I keep missing him because someone else gets there first. Oh well.<br>
<br>
You've never done it. I'd be thrilled for you to do it, and I think you're nuts to want to share it with the 5 other guilds that can't kill it, instead of having a shot every week if you like, but ah well. Shoot yourself in the foot because ToN is so mean to you. Go ahead.<br>
<br>
Hayley, do correct me if I am wrong, but that week we did Vyemm, etc...wasn't that one of the weeks that FS was holding an open Ntov raid because they didnt have the numbers to clear the zone by themselves? When it comes down to that, if you need outside help, should you be in the rotation at all? Apologies if I am wrong, but that is the rumor I heard.<br>
<br>
Its cnovenient that you show your outrage now too isnt it. That was about two months ago, wasn't it? Where was your complaint then?<br>
<br>
Again, you all are slow, so I reiterate:<br>
<br>
You are upset that we did the same event we've been doing forever.<br>
<br>
You'd rather have us back in the rotation than race us to Vulak. I'll vote for that, if only to inconvenience you for your idiocy. That will give you a six week rotation instead. Perhaps I can convince ToS they want to do it more as well...and hey, I think OOP and TWC should get it done too...that's an nine week rotation, and everyone's pets are happy!<br>
<br>
I do think that perhaps we've been wrong to give you some courtesy. This, then is the repayment, a pack of bleating lambs self-righteousness about a mob that they can't even kill.<br>
<br>
You can't walk over a guild to a mob that they can't kill.

<br>
None of you have. <br>

I don't mean that as a slight, just a fact.<br>
<br>
Your logic leads to ToN rejoining the rotation...and since we dont want the mobs, I guess we'll open &quot;our&quot; week to guilds wanting to join the rotation. Your logic leads to any guild that wants Rov to joining your rotation, and the more guilds that are in the rotation, the less time you will have in Ntov and with RoV. But this is what you want??<br>
<br>
All you would have to do now to get RoV is get to it first.... We hadn't done it in a month...that isnt a hard thing to do. ESPECIALLY since our guildleader is nice enough that you can discuss your intentions with him BEFORE we get to the zone.<br>
<br>
For the last six months, all anyone needed to get RoV was to beat us to it. ToS has done it once. Otherwise there has been no competition. None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. But somehow all this time we've been taking it from you?

I hope those in the rotation find a reasonable solution to RoV and the NTOV agreement.

Our first trip to NToV our members started asking about it. I believe that was before you had ever done it. <br>
<br>
Shagz and Vainne - You have not had RoV uncontested, What you are failing to recognize (even though I think I explained it somewhere before in this thread) - we have tried it twice. On both those weeks, ToN asked us if we planned to do it. We said yes, and ToN stayed away. You did not show up anyway and do the FiF thing, you showed respect that it was our rotation week and we had right of first refusal on RoV. <br>
<br>
No, we have not tried it on weeks that are not ours. Why ? Because I think you seriously need to have your heads examined if the idea of going to NToV when its not your week and clearing all that crap to get to RoV is fun. If that is what you choose to do, so be it. It is not what we choose to do. We choose to attempt RoV during our rotation week when force and motivation allowed. <br>
<br>
Vainne - Please read what I posted as our stance on RoV. We don't think you have to be in the rotation to do it, we just think you have to ask the guild whose week it is before going in. Just ask one simple question to show you respect the rotation. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, I guess if we want to do RoV, next time we go to NToV we leave one dragon up.  If you are saying that you respect the rotation but believe RoV to be not of it, then you would not go kill that dragon. So, in the situation we have now, we would clear in one or two days but leave a dragon up, then go back the next day kill that dragon then do RoV. <br>
<br>
But my God, its just plain silly to force us to that point.  <br>
<br>
I would prefer to see guilds act with a simple common courtesy and if it is not your rotation week, whether you are a rotation guild or not, just ask the rotation guild first. The list is pinned here and the schedule. I bet if you find any member of any guild that is in the rotation online, you could ask for an officers name and find out whose week it was within a few minutes. <br>
<br>
Is that so incredibly hard?  One simple question to show you respect the rotation.  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=255219" target="top">Mistress Azoicia Deviante</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
We have no plan to do ring of Vulak anytime soon because we did it once and found it to be very boring and also because many people were pissed to screw their dragon faction for nothing.<br>
<br>
I am not saying we won't do it again if nothing is left up by &quot;USA locusts&quot; that are ravaging 80 of the mobs. <br>
<br>
We are out of ntov rotation and not bound by it, we were thinking that ring of Vulak was not tried by rotation's guild. I hope next time we do RoV (if next time), we don't interfere with other guilds plans and maybe we look at rotation calendar and ask if RoV is planed by rotation guild.<br>
<br>
If you are planing to do ring of Vulak, feel free to send a tell to any ToS officer so we know it. <br>
