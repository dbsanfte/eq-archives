And you know, trolling your ex guilds boards, 3 weeks after you left is just relaly kinda pathetic. The way that you and Zalf stalk my posts, comment on everything I say is absurd.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually if you put your real world glasses on, youll notice I havent had shit to say about you or too you in a long time.  It wasnt until you attacked a friend of mine for pointing out what a lieing sack of shit you are that I felt the need to post again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zalf's posts are removed, as he has been advised several times that they will be. He is not a welcome member on our community, by the leadership or the core of the guild. It is also absurd the lengths this person will go to to create new user names and reset his IP, go to friends houses, work, etc. Just let it go. It's not healthy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, a mind is a terrible thing and Ive been telling the people here at work that its not healthy for me to be here for years.  And I can see how the idea of going to a friends house would frighten a shutin like you.  Cybering is sooooooo much healthier then actual physical contact anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's obvious you just want to try to drum up crap about me for whatever personal adrenaline rushes you get from it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Humor and entertainment at your expense, nothing more.  You lie so much and screw your guild around so often it makes for good/easy entertainment.<br>
<br>
&quot;At the risk of making myself look defeated, just back the hell off. Being the center of controversay gets old after a while. I haven't done anything to you, I don't even really talk to anyone in EQ anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet you feel the need to remain defacto guildleader of FS and hinder its rebuilding.  And you feel the need to make sure you still have full access to the guild bank even after your honesty and integrity has been trashed to the point your current guildmates suggest the guild bank needs to be taken away from you. And you feel the need to lie everytime words come from your keyboard.  Amazing isnt it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can't you just move on and find another target? Flaming hayley is so last season.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh you sell yourself short, flaming you is like wearing white it never goes out of season.<br>

Now why would I be removed from the Board Hayley last time I check I was still a member of the guild. I did nothing to be kicked out or to lose my access to a Guild I belong to. I find this all very interesting. Taking access away becuase you feel like I have hurt you in some reason well hmm that shows your true colors. You take care now and lets hope all your dirty little secrets don't come out. I am sure Detah wouldn't be to happy about them!  <br>

intellectual property<br>
A product of the intellect that has commercial value, including copyrighted property such as literary or artistic works, and ideational property, such as patents, appellations of origin, business methods, and industrial processes.<br>
<br>
terms of service<br>
(TOS) The rules laid down by an on-line service<br>
provider such as AOL that members must obey or risk being<br>
&quot;TOS-sed&quot; (disconnected).<br>
<br>
With these definitions in mind I visited these two websites.  Only one anywhere has a copyright symbol.  It is a copyright in reference to the actual copyright that SoE has on Everquest.<br>
<br>
Quote  <br>
EverQuest © 1999-2002 Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.<br>
Site Hosted by RackNine.com<br>
All images on this site are the collective property and original creation of the EQ Pixel Army and are protected under<br>
copyright law. The work you find here may not be copied or altered without express permission of the artists,<br>
except as the Terms of Use allow. Redistribution and/or direct linking are strictly prohibited. <br>
<br>
<br>
Nowhere, could I find that these people, group, or organization actually had its own copyright.  Which I might add, it says nowhere that these people actually got approval from SoE to use the copyrighted material.  Which they are using the name Everquest, characters, concepts and designs that are copyrighted and altering them and trying to redistribute them as their own product.  Intellectual property from this definition is a broad term for all kinds of copyrighted material.  Not some distinct concept in and of itself as the Terms of Service try and make it out to be.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my next point.  From this definition the only group or organization that can impose a terms of service on its users is an organization to which you pay for and they provide a service to you.  If you abuse their service according to the Terms of Service, they can remove you at any time, because they don't have to provide you with the service they do.  Internet providers have a Terms of Service, and so does SoE which provides us with Everquest.  Both of which are services that are paid for.<br>
<br>
All of that brings me to my conclusion.  Basically to my understanding, these people can't make or even enforce a terms of service or even try to say that their material is copyrighted, because they do not have an official governmental copyright or patent.  Just because someone makes something and puts it on the internet doesn't make it their intellectual property.  That someone would have to get a copyright on their product, service or whatever.  This use of intellectual property and other terms sounds like it's trying to come off as some legalize mumbo jumbo the average person wouldn't understand.  Just because someone says that something on the internet is their intellectual property and they have special rights to it doesn't actually make it true.<br>
<br>
Final point, I am not a copyright or intellectual property expert.  I took some time and tried to perform my own research to the best of my ability.  Any website I visited said that the issues of jurisdiction and enforcement of law on the internet are gray at best.  I may be wrong and have incorrect information.  If someone could show me to a website that fully explains self-created, non-copyrighted, intellectual property rights to the creaters of such intellectual properties, I would be very appreciative.  <br>

Oh and Detah you are missing the point  they asked her not to do she hit the agree button basically saying she wouldn't. She lied about asking permission she lied about Donatining Money. You can see my point!! Those people put a lot of hard work and time for her just to try and pass the stuff off as her own. which she was doing and I don't want to hear any of this BS about how she hadn't had time she was using a simlar sig with the same hacked up dolls on it. I have no beef with you Detah you have always been nice to me and I had none with Hayley untill this.  Taking my access away from a guild in whcih I still belong to is very lame. <br>

Learn to stop lying You know My access was taken away and then you gave it back. I don't need to &quot;prove&quot; shit I know and you know you didn't. GO ahead and Guild remove me and all my chars this is not worth it . All I did was ask you do right something you did wrong and you start name calling and acting like a Freak. This has nothing to do with the guild or all the crap that is going with it you did something that was wrong and don't even seem to care. Life goes in your little world. <br>

Not because they have a legal right to take her to court and have her flogged in public, but because they clearly stated that they didn't want people to take the artwork, customize it and then try to call it original...which is exactly what she did...she even said so in her posts...<br>

<br>
I'm fairly certain that copyright is implied for unique works.  The act of registering a copyright, patent or trademark is most important for establishing a greater legal protection of your rights to your creation.<br>
<br>
For instance, if I post a unique work of fiction to this board and don't specifically state that anyone can use it for whatever they want, then you would be violating my copyright by publishing that story for your own gain, even if you credited me.<br>
<br>
Things get a little more difficult to deal with on the internet, because messages are often copied and archived, which would technically be a violation of copyright.  There's also the matter of 'fair use', which blurs the lines even further.<br>
<br>
Or... I could be completely wrong, which is why I work with computers and not copyright law. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5948">Duke Krazaak Crushbone</a> &lt<a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a>&gt<BR>

Hayley,<br>
<br>
While the signature that you created is indeed attractive, it is in violation of the terms of the EQ Pixel Army. I urge you to visit our forums at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqpixelarmy.com/phpBB2">www.eqpixelarmy.com/phpBB2</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> to get more information about our terms, particularly the Guidelines for Use and Guidelines F.A.Q. that appear in the Basic Training area. <br>
<br>
I do not have record of your donation, or any donation for $40 for that matter, so I think you might need to cancel any payment that you sent or investigate the source to which you sent it. Regardless, donation does not grant a user the right to edit material that is protected from editing by our guidelines and terms of use. <br>
<br>
I also do not have any record of myself or my moderators communicating with you to allow this form of alteration. I also suggest investigating the honesty of any individual who told you this would be okay and thanked you for your donation, because it was not me nor either of the other two folks who handle our email communications. <br>
<br>
If you (or anyone else) need/s to contact me further about this, please email me personally at [EMAIL=Neilani@hotmail.com.]Neilani@hotmail.com.[/email]  I apologize for the intrusion and also for any confusion about our terms.  I don't want to partake in a flame war, so I'd like to continue any other necessary communication in private.<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
<br>

Dont worry Hayley I know your answer already.  Let me see if I can use my best Frau Farbissina voice and answer for you.<br>
<br>
Hayley says,<br>
<br>
&quot;LIES!!!!!!   ALL LIES!!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now run and try to hide more ENTIRE FREAKING FORUMS to protect whats left of your hard earned reputation.  And no the &quot;I didnt have time&quot; excuse doesnt hold any water at all when you used the same stolen dolls in your previous sig for MONTHS without listing the credit where they came from.<br>
<br>
As stated above, it isnt about legality or getting sued, its about doing whats right.  Or in your case, not doing whats right and LIEING YOUR ASS OFF when you get busted.  Yeah, you are perfect material to lead a guild.<br>

In addition to that, giving credit at the pizel army in the form of a $40 donation I believe certainly helps to compensate the artists for their hard work.<br>
<br>
Combining avatars from Josies dolls and the armor from Pixel army I creatd my own version of EQdolls. Utilizing both these tools I felt I came up with something unique. It took me about 4 days to get the desired look.&quot;<br>

<br>
From your original response to Ciara, you are actually saying you didn't plagarize or violate their terms of use by trying to assert that your sig is your &quot;own creation&quot;, that modifying the art by lengthening someone's hair, adding sparkle effects, etc. makes it your &quot;own version&quot; and &quot;unique&quot;...it isn't until your later posts that you try to put the blame on Ninidir for posting your sig while you were afk at work...if you're going to lie about something, at least make sure you're not contradicting something you actually put down in writing earlier...again, this kind of &quot;pixel theft&quot; may seem like a tempest in a teakettle, but this whole thing really says alot about what kind of person you are...<br>
