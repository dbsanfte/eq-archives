Some like to sit for hours and cast KEI.  Some don't.  Some will spit on you if you ask them.  Some will respond to tells, some will ignore them.  Some will send tells if it gets /ooc'd.  Some ignore everything.  Some will cast of guildies, some charge everyone no matter who it is.  And some MGB Kei or cast for free to any who ask.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I know there will be some people, chanters and recipients both, who disagree with my actions in respect to how I cast KEI.  That's OK.  Saying I casued the war was a bit much though.  Some smart alec even called me &quot;Osama bin Hildiebut&quot; which I guess would have been funny if it was supposed to be &quot;butt,&quot; since body part jokes are always cool.<br>
<br>
Pre-PoP, a chanter could earn a decent living sitting in the nexus or bazaar and casting KEI.  It was 100pp, or 50, if you got a really cheap chanter.  It was for &quot;donations&quot; but that was the standard amount given.  A few..VERY few...people, on corpse runs, or recently dead, would indicate they couldn't pay.  But if you grouped them up with the rest of the payers, it wasn't that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
With the release of Plane of Power, something odd happened.  &quot;Donations&quot; went down.  Way down.  I think I must have missed whatever happened...I didn't sit and cast KEI very often unless I was desperate for porting money or food or dots or whatever.  I did..and do...get tells all the time from people asking for kei.  Sometimes I cast, sometimes I don't.  It depends on what I'm doing, where I'm going, etc.  But I noticed a trend.  The average donation is now around 10pp.  Some do still donate 50pp.  This gets dragged down by the multitudes of 2pp, 3pp, 10pp, and free kei moochers.<br>
<br>
So I came up with a couple of things to keep me entertained in the event I got stuck being the only 60+ chanter in the zone.  Sure, I'd cast kei...come hail me.  And I made 2 pages of macro buttons that indicated I am an NPC in a sort of &quot;Put your money in the slot for kei&quot; kind of way.  I enjoyed it for two reasons:  one, I was sort of a piece of &quot;living art&quot;...as an NPC, I strove to illustrate the cold nature of the vending machine mentality, to flaunt the selfishness of those who wish my buffs for the good of their character while conveniently forgetting I play a charatcer of my own.<br>
<br>
The second reason I enjoyed it was because it tickled me to death watching newbs try to figure out what the hell the brackets meant. Lots of times they just gave up.<br>
<br>
Didn't matter to me, I wasn't trying to intice them to buy KEI.  You hail me, you get the message.  If you have something to say, say it.  I'm not going to read your mind.<br>
<br>
With the long path of tradeskilling only about halfway behind me, the soothing clicks of my kiln would be frequently interupted by tells for kei.  Even when I said yes, and even it it was for free, more than half of the time, the people would ask me to come to the bank or the nexus or the pot stone because they could not find the pottery wheel.  Look at your spiffy LoY map, says I.  I do not have LoY, says they.  Or I cannot find it, or it's too cramped...etc etc etc.  All in all, even casting KEI for free if they came to me became too big of a headache. (And no, turning on /role didn't help.  I dunno if they sniff me out or have my name on rolodex or what.)<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, a price fix is in order for KEI.  If other chanters want to help, great.  If not, that's fine too.  I could care less, actually.  If you charge less than I do, then YOU get bugged for KEI, and I get left alone.  I win both ways.<br>
<br>
I am getting level 11 people whining that they can't PL without KEI, and yet they can't cough up 20 to 30pp.  Not casting KEI on low levels charatcers like these might actually force them to learn how to play their character, instead of relying on buffs that are 40 levels out of their range.  I have my doubts as to whether they'd actually make it to level 60, but what if they do?  It's going to cause all sorts of problems with their guild and their groups to find out that all of a sudden they just don't have the mana regen they are used to.<br>
<br>
I rather think that, instead of hitting 60 or 65, they'll have an army of level 30s or 40s and can't figure out why progressing or getting into xp groups is so difficult.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to KEI.  My new solution is to only cast KEI for 100pp again.  You don't want to pay it, fine.  Dont.  I dont care.  It's not your money I am after.  I am in PoK to use the silly tradeskill containers that I HAVE to use in that zone.  You want the buff, you're showing me you REALLY want it.  If you have 100pp to blow on KEI, then you probably know how to play your character, and you recognize the worth of my buff and my effort.   It is not a donation. It is a fee.  Not for my mana or any components.  For my time.  From taking the time away from everything else I was doing and casting it on you because YOU asked for it.  I'm not /oocing becuase I want people to take me up on it, I'm doing it becuase there is NO-ONE else in all 3 Kei-zones doing it, and I am giving you this opportunity to have kei where I would otherwise just ignore you.<br>
<br>
My /ooc:  Casting KEI for 100pp only.  Send tells for location.  Yes I am serious, and no I don't care if you can't afford it.<br>
<br>
This of course, caused a nice KEI flame war in PoK.  Which by itself was amusing and justified the time it took to make the hotkey.<br>
<br>
I was called all sorts of dirty names.  Don't care.  If I had kept quiet and didn't give them any opportunity for KEI at all, would I have been a better person?  I got told what nice people all of them were, how they sow and rez and port for free...as if KEI was the only thing useful I have in the game!<br>
<br>
I contribute to the game in other ways, giving and helping...it's not MY fault they aren't in the zones I buff for free at.  I go to the Oasis, G'fay, EC, WC, Ro, GD, Neth Lair, Marus Seru, and other places, frequesntly, and buff for free.  KEI, runes, haste, the whole works.  Sometimes I can even drag shammy and cleric friends with me and we set up a little buffung station.  I have been known to give away prizes for common drops, and I have made newb jewelery by the dozens and scattered them around the zone.<br>
<br>
There is also the combines I do...for free, or for VERY nominal fees, the quests I help with when noone else will, the people I can grab for help when someone else needs it...Just because I am charging YOU for a buff you probably don't need in the first place does not mean that I am some kind of sick, selfish sadist.<br>
<br>
So this guy, during the ooc flame, tells me that I must be an American, and that it's chanters like me, an American, worried only about money, that is the cause for the war in Iraq because the war is about money.  (This is what he said.)  At which point his buddy chimed in with the &quot;Osama bin Hildiebut&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
And for anyone still reading this...I made more money casting for 100pp each than I would have during the same amount of time doing it for donations and getting 2pp and 5 gp from level 3 frogs.  AND I got 10 stacks of combines done in the meantime.<br>
<br>
K, done venting.  Thanks for watching.<br>

Its done more to imbalance the game than any other single factor I can think of.  <br>
<br>
Second off, you have every right to charge what the traffic will bear.  But I always found the idea of chanters charging 100pp for a buff offensively greedy.  Of course, a pretty high percentage of Enchanters I've run across are offensively greedy, so I guess that figures.<br>
<br>
Doesn't surprise me at all that the level of donations for KEI has plummeted.  Market forces at work.  I don't think I ever pass through the nexus without seeing at least one, and usually two or three of you guys ooc'ing for donations.  Far as I can see, there's a steady stream of customers too.  <br>
<br>
I do like the npc dialogue thing though, a lot.  Think I'm gonna come up with a few for the next newb who asks me to buff them. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366694">Nayl</a>

When I am hanging out in nexus doing ports/punts, I really find it amusing that the people come running there, acting like a bunch of meth heads needing a fix. Jack the prices up on that stuff! I would love to see the whining it would cause. Maybe that would put an end to all the greedy-assed quad kiters who come in and ruin my lazy, single pull camps that I have found.<br>

Why do people b!tch about prices anyways? You offer a service/item, you set the price.

<br>
That was all well said.  My only confusion is trying to reconcile this reasoning with what you said on the Groo thread:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You didn't, perhaps, sell an item for way more than it was worth, or ever take advantage of someone who didn't know what an item he was selling was worth?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It's important to note that this example appeared in a list of wrongdoings.  Why is it wrong for someone to sell an item &quot;for way more than it [is] worth&quot;; but not wrong to offer a service for a fee that is way more than it is worth.<br>
<br>
You can argue that it's up to the seller to decide what to charge and if the buyer agrees, then it is a fair deal.  If so, you invalidate the notion of the price being more than the item/service is worth.  This reasoning seems very logical to me; but I don't see how you can believe in it and still have made your example on the other thread.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, to support that example, you could argue that the value of an item is whatever is commonly accepted.  (&quot;It usually sells for 5k and you sold it for 10k, so that's wrong.&quot;)  Taking that stance would kill this rant, though, so I wouldn't think that you would want to do that.<br>
<br>
Can you clarify for me what the distinction is that makes the item case wrong and the KEI case right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Night-blind Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2403<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/6/03 11:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3209.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War All the Time</span><hr size=1> I was reprimanded in guild for trying to reason with a level 11 cleric who wanted a kei in pok (whilst on a cr).

It is entirely true that it was not my place to mouth off in ooc to him, but I was trying to strike a blow for freedom and alla that.<br>
<br>
My alts can't get groups, half the people I meet who are 60 plus can't play their classes, and while the game is alot of fun right now for me personally, I cringe when I think what it must be like to level an untwinked character in this brave new world.<br>

Personally I think chanters should just refuse to kei anyone green. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hildie>Hildie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/6/03 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3209.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War All the Time</span><hr size=1> Andvari...I'm not sitting there doing it.  I don't want to do it.  That's the point.  I gave up standing around and casting KEI almost immediately after PoP because quite frankly farming spiders for silk would be more profitable.  I have offered to stand and cast a couple times when people get deperate in the off hours when there aren't any other chanters casting.  From these few times, I learned what the new rate was.  I will be casting kei from now on only on a select few or those who can afford it.  I may do my NPC text and cast for less if the player will play along.<br>
<br>
I'm not whining that my source of income has dried up.  I've never used KEI as income.  To me, the donations or fees a character gives is a show of respect for the buffs and time the person took to cast.  When there are no other chanters in the zone, I get interrupted from my current task with tells.  Yes, I could go afk, or ignore them.  I'm going to give this alternative instead.<br>
<br>
Chichester...I think this point was raised in the Groo thread, but I cn't find it and can't remember if I actually posted my response or just gave up.  I'll address it now.  When I said selling an item for way more than it wsa worth, I did not mean it was intristically evil of a person to do so, just that there are times that everyone does something for themselevs that they may not be proud of.  And by &quot;More than it is worth&quot; I didn't mean you were reselling an item for 200pp more.  With the bazaar, it's much easier to get a price check on something, so I'm not sure if if it's even possible anymore to swindle someone with half a brain.  Any one who buys that flask of water for 1 million plat, for example, deserves whatever they get...although if a person has a million plat, they probably know better.  <br>
<br>
In my own mind, I was referring to the day right after a patch, when focus effects were added to items.  I had been trying to get rid of my ODS for weeks.  I was told it was worth 1k.  I couldn't find a buyer for the life of me.  Day after patch, I do an /auction, and a guy offers to buy for 1k.  That's great, I'm thinking.  So I sell it.<br>
<br>
The agrument can be made that he didn't know what it was worth either, honest mistake, yadda yadaa.  Except that I watched him /auction it not 10 minutes later for 20k. So I was gullible for not knowing the price of my goods.  Maybe my fault.  If that guy hadn't purchased it, someone else would have.  Whatever.  It still felt like someone had kicked me in the stomache.<br>
<br>
And now, for how all that relates to selling KEI...100pp used to be the going rate.  I'm not trying to swindle anyone out of thousands of plat.  If a character doesn't have the money, then they can learn to play without it.  If they do have the money, then they probably know what the buff is worth.  And again, as above, I am not trying to pimp out my KEI at 100pp to everyone that shows up.  I don't expect...nor do I WANT everyone to pay that much.  I'm trying to weed out those who trying appreciate the buff, from those who think KEI at level 5 is as necessary as visiting your guild trainer.<br>
<br>
So no, I don't think I'm trying to put anything over on anyone.  If you can pay it and want to, you know what you're getting in for.  If you can't afford it or think it's too much, then go bug someone else.  That works just as well for my purposes.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.familjenguild.com/dspMember.php?Name=Hildie"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.familjenguild.com/images/logo/hildie.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am now an NPC.

I also don't understand why the word &quot;swindle&quot; enters into your argument either.  Whether or not the going rate for KEI used to be 100 pp, there's no swindle in stating any asking price you want and responding accordingly.  Just like a guy selling an item &quot;for more than it is worth,&quot; there's no swindle and nothing that should make the seller feel ashamed.<br>

<br>
I changed my bind to what was a nice quiet spot in PoK a while back.  The bank is nearby without zoning, and there are plenty of supplies for tradeskills.  I mainly did it because I started to find it aggravating to have 3 /tells for kei hit me as I zoned in from dying.  Half the time these people would need me to group them to be able to cast on them.  They got pissy if I wouldn't leave my group (or raid) to give them kei.<br>
<br>
Andy, I'm sure you go out of your way to do things for people, you're that kind of person.  That's one of the things I like best about you.  Hildie has also done that.  I've done that.<br>
<br>
That's different than casting &quot;whim&quot; kei's.  Lately, I've just answered &quot;no&quot;, with no explanation.  Explanations have only gotten me daemonized in /ooc or told what a &quot;bad&quot; person I was.<br>
<br>
The KEI market is serviced by a lot of enchanters better setup for this purpose.  They've spent the aa's to have &quot;extended duration&quot; KEI and whatnot.  I'm not complaining about what I get, I just am not interested in the market.  You get a better &quot;product&quot; from them, please /hail them or /tell them, etc.<br>

I can't zone into PoK, Nexus, or the Bazaar anymore without some level 13 frog asking for Focus/Agi/Sta/Regen/Haste/SoW/Acumen.  Makes me wish I'd never bought the group versions of any of those spells.  It's a huge waste of time for the 10pp (if I'm lucky) donation, not to mention... well, it promotes gimpness of the lower level players.  <br>
<br>
The only way things are gonna get any better is if they do something to truely level restrict these spells.  <br>
<br>
Now granted, I'll occasionally buy a KEI if I'm tradeskilling, or maybe if I just wanna be lazy with the torpor/cann buttons in an exp group, but I sure as hell can live without it.  And luckily, there are still plenty of higher-level players around who can play without it, as well.  But soon enough we're going to be overrun with people who don't know how to play without the &quot;training wheels&quot;, and every zone is gonna' turn into KC circa summer 2001.  <br>

I think KEI has unbalanced the game quite a bit. People can now sit back and nuke, root, dot anything to oblivion and have mana to spare, but they will really hurt when it comes time to know their class in the long run. <br>
<br>
As far as the prices go, charge what you want. For the chanters that DO sit in the nexus or POK and /ooc Casting KEI for donations, don't whine about the DONATIONS you get, but there isn't anything wrong for setting your price on it. Those that want it will pay, those that think that price is far too expensive, won't. Simple as that and if they don't like it, so what?

<br>
The thing that pisses me off the most is when I leave my Spot in one of the PoS camps from hours of kiting to refresh my mana buffs in Nexus and i /ooc donating 100pp for KEI, 100pp for PTo9. Then I get some lvl 15 tool deciding to add on a comment of ....<br>
<br>
&quot;Ill toss in an Extra 10!&quot;<br>
or<br>
&quot;He's paying for me too!&quot;<br>
<br>
Pre-PoP, I was paying far more for KEI than i Should have. When i was Quadding for Exp and loot Id pay upwards of 500 if thats what it took. I still donate no less than 50, almost always more than 75.<br>
<br>
Then theres my issue of how it involves game play when stuck for 3 and a half hours on a lvl 1 Newb. I know that they try and balance the classes as much as possible at most of the levels. But how does it affect mana based classes as opposed to the melee based? Then again, your going to end up with every DPS caster not knowing how to manage aggro or mana pools for encouters where they dont nuke for 20 percent of the mobs life. Some options?<br>
<br>
1. Scale the KEI down to hold for shorter time periods on lower and increasingly lower levels. Say, it only holds for 15 minutes on a lvl 1, and increases by 3 minutes per level, maximum, with the Extended benefits being scaled down as well.<br>
<br>
2. Set a Minimum level for the buff to hold on. Wether it be as a level comparative to the caster, or as a set required level for the target to be, such as i believe a few cleric symbols used to be??<br>
<br>
All I know is im extremely sick of playing alts in groups only to have the lvl 15 - 30 cleric,mage,wizard, etc.... leave to get a KEI and not come back for 30 mins and have to go back each time they overaggro and die. I do truly miss the nostalgia of the way the game was during the Kunark area. Exploring in wide open zones such as Burning Woods, which only had about 7 - 10 people in it, and seeing that many giants in the same area at once, Lol. Lately, Ive just hydraed in empty dungeons trying to hide.<br>
