How stupid are you, Vendric, really?<br>
<br>
Is there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> person in OoP who realizes that if we really wanted to stop you from being in the Elemental planes, you never would have even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>seen</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Rallos?  Are you honestly that daft?<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek drops the only EB weapon in PoP so far.  As I recall, OoP has been very fortunate with Bloodfrenzy drops; however, HnE has not had that luxury.  Our sole option for upgrading EB weapons for warriors is Rallos Zek.  See if that can sink in a little before making up more cockblocking theories, Vendric.<br>
<br>
Let me review what happened :<br>
<br>
OoP and HnE go for the same mob.<br>
OoP runs up and camps in the hall (my, flashbacks to Emperor and Ssra in general), and claims they have force to go, first.<br>
HnE says fine, if you have force, go in 15 minutes.<br>
15 minutes turns into 45.  OoP still has not begun the event.<br>
<br>
At this point, in Ssra, with Antryg, I said fine, and turned over far too many times.  The fact that I was far too generous now shows in a repeat of this behavior in PoP.  The same thing you would do, and have done, to any other guild on this server, and called yourselves justified, makes you the victim in this case.  I don't buy it, most of your guild doesn't buy it, and no one on the server is going to buy it.  If just once, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>just once</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, OoP actually went for a mob/event when they said they were ready, I might respect their claims a little more instead of demanding proof of ability.  I'm sorry that all you newer OoP people have no idea what I'm talking about, but this has been a long-standing tactic of OoP leaders, especially when Antryg and Boggrak aren't around, to stall for time.  I will not tolerate it in this expansion.  I will move past you, I will run you over, I will do whatever I feel like it until you finally show some respect for force and don't just sit there with your thumbs up your asses and expect me to leave.<br>
<br>
Who the f<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->uck do you think you are to say we're trying to cockblock you when you're sitting in a hall with one of the trigger mobs mes'd?  Who do you think you are to tell another guild to go away when you're not even ready to fight?  You have complete idiots like Esclava posting screenshots of a wipeout you caused (and don't, Vendric, insult yourself any further by implying Durrlok and others magically got Voice of Thule on their own).  You have complete, god damn retards like Opale casting mem blur on Rallos Zek, because you can't control your own guildmates.  (Please insert the comment about Ghar, who did whatever he did 2 years ago when I wasn't even an officer yet.  Please do... it makes your side of the argument so credible when you have no more recent events.)<br>
<br>
I'm curious, too.  One of the quotes from Nanan to Ainian was something along the lines of, &quot;I think we should leave, but the guild is going nuts.  We don't run a communist (yes, folks, I don't know why he picked communist, either) guild like you do, we can't make them do things.&quot;<br>
<br>
This from the same guild that insisted DKP shows you don't trust your officers' opinions.  Let's all laugh a few, eh?<br>
<br>
So both guilds go up there, and it's a clusterf<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->uck.  This is to be expected.  OoP will not move despite not being ready, and I don't feel like just rolling over.  Both guilds reset, both guilds wipe out.  Both guilds rush back.  Who holds their guild back to avoid another mess?  Oh right, it wasn't OoP, the valiant, the brave, the noble, the respectful.  OoP, victims of the server when things don't go their way, rushed up.  Fine.  HnE stays at the bottom of the stairs while you set up.  We wait patiently while I hear excuses of how the raid is split up, of how you wiped out becuase of us (and yet, we're still ready before you... again), of how you can't possibly be ready to trigger yet.  We move to the top of the stairs, keep the halls nice and clear in case you fail, but do not touch or interfere with your event in any way.  OoP f<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->ucks up, loses to TZ, and what's the immediate story?<br>
<br>
You made us lose.<br>
<br>
We kill TZ.  We kill VZ.  We kill fake RZ.  I told an OoP officer if any OoP touches the Warlord, you will never fight him unmolested.<br>
<br>
Opale decides to take it upon himself to mem blur the Warlord during our fight.  Opale has cost you any hope of ever fighting him without adds pre-spawned or without interference.  Make sure you thank him.<br>
<br>
I don't have to tolerate a guild that can't control it's members.  I don't have to tolerate a guild that doesn't understand &quot;First in Force&quot; means you're actually ready to go before others are.  I don't have to, and I won't.<br>

As for the problems with TZ aggro, we had more then one wiz say they had VoT cast on them and at least one chanter pet was Highsun'ed back to its bind point to try to cause a train during TZ.

After that time we give up waiting for WoOP's leet mob camping tactics and pull there trigger mob to start the event.<br>
WoOP's starts to memblur or use sk agro spells or what ever the heck they did, to wipe us.<br>
Next we  both race back up but Hne are told to stop buy the officers and WoOP's precieds to wipe there 75 man crew to TZ  with no interference and not 1 HnE member around them(not even lasting as long hne w/a guild trying to wipe them).<br>
We let the event restart and go to trigger the real RZ.<br>
With the real RZ poped we go to arena and fight him w/Opale casting memblur on RZ makeing him run at are clerics.<br>
Opale dies we kill RZ and that about sums it up.<br>
Real sad you cant even wipe a guild properly on a mob like RZ when you try let alone kill the mob.<br>

Must be nice to have things work out like that!  Nothing says, &quot;We had enough to start the script in the first place&quot; when you lose with more!<br>
<br>
Respect is a two-way street.  You see if you can figure out why I don't respect under 50 OoP as enough force to start the RZ script when you lose with 70ish, and why I am forced to make demands that if you really have force to start, because I just can't trust you to not be stalling.<br>

The reason given to me last night why you wanted him dead was &quot;even though we haven't killed him in a long time he is great loot and we suddenly decided we need his loot every 3  days now&quot;.<br>
<br>
Not we need flags or some other reason that makes sense. I know you guys never thought we could get RZ to spawn you kept telling me we needed to do VTa bit to get this far. Over and Over we could never get this far. If it was just loot you would have kept him dead, if you didn't care about us getting flagged you would have let us get flagged once or twice then went back to killing him. <br>
<br>
We got this far and now all of a sudden your @#%$ blocking us at the last minute before you have to share loot in the elemental planes. This upset people who did things they shouldent have.<br>
<br>
Just stop acting like your not half guilty too and when they do @#%$ they shouldent don't act like your not partially to blame foir turning a nice happy world into the crap it is now. You guys helped to make this @#%$ pie enjoy eating it with us.<br>

Yes, Balith, I'm sure with your extensive knowledge of the Elemental planes and ability to check what mobs were and were not up, you were able to determine we could not possibly target RZ for loot because of all the other loot mobs were not actually up.  It was not possible that the good loot-droppin mobs in the elemental planes were not up, because this is something you obviously researched before making your claims.<br>

I don't know who your friends are, nor do I care.  The &quot;opinions&quot; of guildmates on why we do or do not do things does not necessarily reflect the actual reasons.

<br>
If it was just cockblocking, we would have kept him dead.  Much like having told OoP that, in my opinion, VT was the best loot per hour they could get, we try to get the most loot per raid possible when not just trying to advance.  That means Plane of Fire, mostly.  If PoF mobs aren't up, it's whack random mobs that have stuff we want or try to get past new things.  See if you can figure out whose mob we decided we wanted loot from last night, and please come up with your justification on how being left alone trying RZ numerous times in a row means you are entitled to keep trying the mob until you succeed.<br>

<br>
You speak ignorantly.  The real loot to share is in the Plane of Fire, and for access to that, you need to kill Sol Ro.  Aside from that, the mobs in the elemental Planes respawn fast enough that I am not all that concerned about sharing with OoP.  I'm sure you can make up your stories in your mind about why I do or do not do things, or you can go on what people who don't actually affect HnE decisions think.  Maybe, just maybe, you might put a little more thought into your beliefs about what happens and find out all the details of the whole picture instead of relying on your narrow view.<br>

There is a REASON it takes your guild so long to clear the pitifully small number of mob needing to be killed in order to trigger this script, Vendric. Hell, you lose up to 6 people per pull. And most pulls there are 2 mob max. Pathetic. Next time both our guilds mobilize for the same mob, save yourself the inevitable embarrassment and just leave. <br>

The biggest mis-assumption here is that OoP was stalling. We just started the encounter this week (3 nights in a row). Making progress but slower than we should be, imo. First night was learning what hapens in the script and figuring out how to fight the first zek. Second night was getting him dead and the other zek and then finding out how fake RZ pops and what happens there. Third night was getting that dead and finding out about real RZ and what happens there. Last night was hopefully the night we got a good fight on RZ. Every night we have done this the setup has always been the same and while it is a bit faster than the first night it still takes us a round of respawns to get both named triggers into camp, then kill repops for the zek fight areas then kill triggers. That is the same thing we were doing last night (backpulling the second named to mes and waiting on fight area repops to clear before triggering). Just take a second to think about that and see it makes perfect sense and let that part of the argument go. Im sure HnE knowing and having more practice at the encounter can do this fast enough that you dont need to wait for fight area respawns but we're not at that point yet. This was not a matter of hours as one person posted above...it was one extra set of respawns we needed to clear.<br>
<br>
So you assumed we were stalling but we werent. Everything after that was just stupid. Breaking our mes, dotting mesd mobs, forcing the trigger, wiping both guilds, etc....it was stupid. If the SK taunt thing was happening on our side....stupid. If opale was blurring RZ....stupid and should be suspended. Burst sitting in pit...stupid. Everyone knows what is wrong and right. HnE just needs to admit they messed up a few things too. Coming to RZ the night after we finally got real RZ popped was silly (coincidence that is was then you all the suden REALLY wanted a new EB weapon...yeah right). You forced a confrontation and didnt offer a viable solution other than a race and breaking our mes's and forcing both guilds to wipe. You should have talked to an OoP officer, realized we would get to the trigger mob first and sat back at zoneline and taken over if we failed. Once we failed (huge choke...pitiful) we left and you got the script. It should have been that way from the start.<br>
<br>
Now just please do us all a favor and sit back a second and realize what really happened last night and both sides do it different next time.<br>

<br>
Oh, and Balith, you were one of those who weren't in OOP when they were given leeway during the Emp attempts, right?<br>
<br>
Num stated our reasons for killing RZ last night.  Last night I told you several times that I have no influence over what we kill and that we still needed his loot.  Before you talk to me about us not thinking you were capable of getting to RZ, need I remind you about your own admission of the same?  How you complained that your officers were poor leaders, how you should have stayed in VT a while longer, how most of your new recruits were talentless n00bs?<br>
<br>
Now, of course, since if I had logs of that conversation, they're not proof since they could be fabricated, and since you'll just deny it, what I say is your word against mine.

Running up with high 40's, low 50's when you know that isn't &quot;force&quot; for you guys is what shouldnt have happened. You guys had 6 clerics on and 1 decent warrior at the time you ran up. That isn't force for a guild that has failed with 90+, clerics, wizards, warriors galore, it's called stalling. Then more came on and more and eventually, you had a staff.

<br>
A lot of us don't have respect for OOP cause of the gimp s.hit that you guys pull every time there is a race. Look back on history and see how many times we have had conflict, not often, and look back and see how many times HnE has come to the negotiation table and backed down in many cases, very often.<br>
<br>
Don't be asking Num to re examine his respect, or any officers in HnE to be doing that. None of the officers in HnE go out of our way to waste hours and hours fighting with OOP, but we know when we are getting f.ucked, and then we don't appreciate it very much. And last I checked, the officers in HnE still call the shots whether the guild gets pissed or not. We are as you guys put it a communist guild. ( Actually we are more like a military dictatorship )<br>

We opened the dialogue last night and you guys ran up with out force and then blame us for being pissed about it?

I could honestly care less what the HnE policy on threads on the BF is. After the stunts your circus clowns pulled last night you damn well should have expected a BF thread over it. It has been stated umpteen times in this thread that elemental mobs of interest were not up last night. If we wanted to cockblock you we would have after the first night you tried RZ not the third. If you are so nieve to think that we are going to kill RZ every time it pops than you have another thing coming.<br>
<br>
    OoP had run up and planted themselves in that hall since you had about 12 people in the zone fearing we would get force before you did, which inevitably happened. We gave you 40 minutes or whatever it was once you planted yourself in that hall to start the script which you had not. You were planted next to 1 named with the other named untouched. You were not 2 minutes away from spawning the script when we arrived. At no point in time did we dip to the pathetic level of several of your members casting spells on our members to cause a wipe.<br>
<br>
     We did take the 1 mob you had mesed so we could start the script after your 30-40 minutes had expired. Even after the mass clusterf-uck caused by you casting hate on our casters we gave you an UNMOLESTED attempt in which your 75 or however many wiped to TZ. You have no leg to stand on here. Even after you wiped your as.s clowns went down to arena and attempted to wipe us again by casting on our mobs. <br>
<br>
     You want to talk about respect? At no point last night did your garbage patrol show any sign of respect to us. We could have moved up to the hall with our 12 people like you did but we didnt. We backed off and gave you time to spawn it which you didnt do. We then spawned it. End of story. Case closed.<br>
   <br>
 You also need to understand that by pulling this stupid crap that you are only digging the hole deeper for yourselves? We arent the ones that need RZ to advance.
