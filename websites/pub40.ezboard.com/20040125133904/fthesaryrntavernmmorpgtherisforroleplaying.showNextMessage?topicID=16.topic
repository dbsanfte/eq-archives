Berserker Lord from the North!!!&quot; I shout, the sound of my voice echoing throughout the temple.<br>
                            I had come though the plains of Karana, though the runoff lake of the Rathe Mountains, to the swamps of the<br>
                            ugly trolls to this place of evil. This was the ancient temple of Cazic Thule, the God of Fear. <br>
<br>
                            I had ventured here in search of my fellow members of the mighty guild, The Sons of Steel. They seemed to<br>
                            have found this place and had been fighting what seemed to be an endless hoard of lizard men and there foul<br>
                            pets that thrive in this place. &quot;Atty! (As I had become known)&quot; Several shout went up in the place, and<br>
                            within minutes I found my trusted freind Treman, dressed in full green for the jungle envirment he was<br>
                            adventuring in. &quot;The group has fought their way into a cavern. I was sent up here to get you.&quot; He explained.<br>
                            Upon closer inspection I had noticed that Treman was soaked, and he has several wounds, it looked as<br>
                            though something tried to eat him. <br>
<br>
                            I made my way after the Ranger, he kept looking back at me, do to my armor I was making allot of noise,<br>
                            but the few lizard men I saw looked weak and when I looked at them they shrulked into a shadow or a corner.<br>
                            I had nothing to fear of these little monsters, the disciples of the god of fear, indeed! Treman lead me to<br>
                            a guarded opening. The lizardmen that were here did as the others had and let us pass. Tre gave me a look<br>
                            and dove in, I had swam the fridged river in the Tundra near me home, so I had become an adept swimmer.<br>
                            As I jumped in I thought I could hear the lizardmen guards making some sort of noise, almost like a laugh...<br>
<br>
                            I had followed Treman though the murky waters. There were a few bodies of alligators there. I suppose that<br>
                            was what was chewing my friend. We surfaced some time later, I looked around the cavern. It was been set<br>
                            up deliberately like this, so that you needed to swim into it. No human would make a temple in this manner,<br>
                           but the followers of Cazic Thule would. Tre lead me up an old latter. It creaked under the weight of my armor,<br>
                            and me but held fast. <br>
<br>
                            At the top were a few of the other members of my guild. Grout, my dwarven cleric friend. He was tending to<br>
                            the wounds of Joll, his gnomish wizard friend, they were almost brothers. Joll has a tendency to upset the<br>
                            creatures with his spells, and they try and go after him. Standing in a dark corner was an old friend of mine,<br>
                            Slinks. When I met him he was but a fledgling summoner, or so I thought. It turned out that over the course<br>
                            of our adventures he had become a necromancer, and cast many evil spells of the dead. He made us all uneasy, but he has known him for so long that he presence was tolerable, his monster undead he summoned, on the other hand, was not. Lastly, watching the Hallway and the stairs down was Hulack, the human soldier. <br>
<br>
                            With the group formed and ready to move, Slinks informed me that he had 'found' a map of this temple. It<br>
                            seems that Cazic Thule himself was represented in an Avatar on this plane. We where at the outskirts of the<br>
                            temple and were going to be moving in. Hulack informed me that he has seen some lizards down there, moving<br>
                            about. After several spells were cast by Grout, we moved out, feeling braver and with more valor. It was a<br>
                            good thing, we could use all the extra help we could get.<br>
<br>
                            We moved down the Hallway, encountering a Lizard on the stairs. Treman and I where the first to fall on<br>
                            them, Hulack pushing though us to get to the next foe, all the while the Lizards hissing in there own tongue.<br>
                            More of the foul monsters moved up to where we where. Joll and Slinks, blasting away, Treman with his Short<br>
                            Sword of Morin, Hulack with a huge axe he found in the depths of a dungeon to the east, and I with my<br>
                            mighty Langseax of the Wolves. The monsters were well equipped in their own right, with faster and deadlier<br>
                            fine steel weapons. The fight was long, and not without cost. Our wounds were deep, and Grout was<br>
                            overworked with healing us, to the point where he had become lightheaded and need to sit. During this time<br>
                            Treman had been cut off form Hulack and I and was swamped with the enemy. We had fought our way to<br>
                            him, I grabbed his body before the creatures could mutilate it, and dropped it next to Grout, as Hulack and<br>
                            Joll finished off the remaining few lizardmen and their alligator allies.<br>
<br>
                            Grout had become high enough to his god to be able to resurrect an ally from the dead. It took some time,<br>
                            but he did manage it after much praying and ceremony. I, not one to sit around for this sort of thing, took a<br>
                            better look around. It seemed that the pile of Lizard bodies behind us were the whole of the entrance guard,<br>
                            leaving the next few rooms open. Slinks then crept up on me. He has his map out. He pointed down a few<br>
                            narrow hallways, though several identical rooms. We are in the right place, he exclaimed. I just nodded.<br>
<br>
                            With Treman back, though completely white and fairly sickly looking, we were able to head out. Hulack took<br>
                            the lead again, being the smaller then I, and more able to maneuver in this place. We moved though the<br>
                            rooms, the pools of stagnate swamp water smelling worse and worse. We finally came to what Slinks said was<br>
                            the entrance room to Cazic's Temple. The door was closed, but there were no guards at the entrance to it.<br>
                            The time for subtly was over, as I kicked the door. &quot;In the name of Rallos Zek I come to wage war upon this<br>
                            place&quot; I shouted, the room exploding with movement. The Lizardmen guards, not accustom to invaders getting<br>
                            this far, were in complete shock. Joll blasted the room with fire spells, at the same time Slinks let off his dark<br>
                            magic, the lizards closer to us screaming in agony. We waded into their ranks, killing all of them quickly and<br>
                            easily, with barely a scratch on anyone. <br>
<br>
                            The next room was the temple itself, and was sure to be filled with the Avatars minions, along with the<br>
                            Avatar of Fear himself. No doubt he knows of our presence and is setting up an ambush. I stood by the door,<br>
                            Hulack and Treman next to me, Slinks and Joll ready with what spells they had left, and Grout and his healing<br>
                            touch ready for battle. This is it...<br>
<br>
                            I smashed the doors to the temple open my shoulder and sent the door itself into a lizard defender, stunning<br>
                            it. I felt the blasts of the lizard casters, their magic having a diminished effect on me do to the protections<br>
                            placed on me before combat, but I still felt their bite. We hit the first monsters and cut them down, our<br>
                            charge had been furious and the lizards hadn't come into contact with the bloodlust of a Berserker Lord<br>
                            before. Now they will learn.<br>
<br>
                            The room filled with magic of all kinds. The heat in the room was intense. Though the Lizards had had some<br>
                            time to set up a defense of their master, they had been cut and blasted so quickly that they could no longer<br>
                            function as a team, and their command was breaking down quickly, as many of them broke and ran. That's<br>
                            when the Avatar showed itself. <br>
<br>
                            It was a giant monster, looked like half troll and half Lizardman. It had huge claws on it hands, and it seemed<br>
                            to move and an unnatural speed. It sent its guard to fight us. Its bodyguard were much better and tougher<br>
                            then the priests and worshipers of this place. We were fighting them and they had tied us up as the Avatar<br>
                            assessed our abilities. It moved around the main fight, to where Joll was. I saw the thing moving at the<br>
                            caster, and knew if I didn't do anything Joll wouldn't see the end of this fight. I bashed the bodyguard and it<br>
                            fell over, stunned, I stepped on it as I charged the monster. It turned to me, an evil look in its eyes. <br>
<br>
                            Then it hit me, like a lightening bolt down my spine. It was that most painful experience I had had up to that<br>
                            point. Grout then yelled at me, &quot;It's using the bastard powers of the shadow knight&quot; I slammed into it with my<br>
                            body, a tactic I used against most casters. but this one was just to big and shrugged off my attacks as if I<br>
                            was a fly. It lashed out with is claws, hitting me at an incredible speed. Its claws, though not digging deep,<br>
                            did open multiple wounds on me in just one pass. <br>
<br>
                            I stepped back, this was a monster to reckon with, I also knew I was badly injured. I felt the berserker blood<br>
                            fury opening in my mind, trying to escape. It hit me once again, as I reeled back. My eyes turned red, 'This<br>
                            thing in front of was going to die, and I was going to kill it!' raced though my mind. I had found the berserker<br>
                            fury. I lashed out to it, with brute force and power, cleaving into it. <br>
<br>
                            It hit me repeatedly, covering me with many tears, almost to the point where it had cut to bone in several places. I hit it over and over again with my sword, swinging like a wild man, without any finesse or style. I was losing blood fast though, and it seemed that I couldn't get help from my companions, they where wrapped up in the fight with the bodyguards. That's when a new group of adventurers came out of nowhere. <br>
<br>
                            They hit the ground and were on top of the Avatar quickly, as one of them healed me up with the righteous<br>
                            and holy power he wielded. The avatar when down, and my mind cleared, the blood rage flowing out of me. I<br>
                            saw that they more members of the guild, they had heard the fight and couldn't find the way in, so they<br>
                            fought though the upper temples, finally seeing us though the hole in the ceiling. They couldn't have timed it<br>
                            better, I thought.<br>
<br>
                            With the bodies of the enemy piled up in the room, their valuables piled up, the weapons would get us a good<br>
                            price in that foul human city of Freeport I looked over the avatar himself. Its claws where sharp and fast,<br>
                            with some help from the ranger I fashioned them into a claws for my own hands, the leather binding them<br>
                            form the avatar himself. These will do, I thought to myself, they will do well...<br>
