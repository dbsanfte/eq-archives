Wellll with DKP you can leave them in, if they're good people who want to raid but cannot, they just almost never get loot.  If you never &quot;feel like raiding&quot; rather than you just cannot because of RL, that's a little different.<br>
<br>
You can be a social guild that has a large portion which raids regularly, just that eventually those people will get sick of the players who log on but don't feel like raiding, and leave to join the guilds full of people who &quot;choose to&quot; raid all the time.  I don't know if you'd call that stable, but to me that goes against what the original poster meant to achieve.  All it takes is a few of those times where you have like 80 people on, 40 of those being hardcore players who want to do a raid that takes your guild 60-70, and not have enough of the casual people want to go (yet be online), and the hardcore people take off.<br>

<br>
     Thats the biggest problem you run into?  Hmmm riggghhht.  I think not, in fact I would'nt even rate it in the top 10 biggest problems.  The biggest problem in a dkp system is without a doubt pricing items fairly.  As far as &quot;throwing casual players a bone&quot;, if you did you would be undermining the entire concept of the system.  The system was born in order to create an impartial and unbiased representation of each players contribution to the system.  You can't just bend the rules and throw somoene a bone.  A player who understands the system will know and accept the way things are going to be when they cut their playing time down.  No one should need to throw them a bone.  In a guild like HnE there are other attractions to being in the guild apart from loot, like content that would not otherwise be seen by the player at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ultimately, the hardest part is keeping everyone happy. If your hardcore players feel like they're spinning their wheels , then they're apt to start questioning why thy're carrying the casual players along instead of just joining a hardcore raiding guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Again I would have to disagree.  If that's the hardest part of running a guilds dkp system then your doing something incorrectly.  If the system is fair and unbiased people should be (and have been) happy with it without any work (directly towards contentment with the dkp system) from the officers at all.<br>

<br>
Actually, he misinterpreted both.<br>
<br>
My point wasn't about running a DKP system at all, it was about DKP not being a suitable loot system for a guild made up of both casual and hardcore players.<br>
<br>
DKP works for guilds like HnE because the majority of the guild is hardcore raiders and they are rewarded for their participation.  The few casual players in such a system are content with the (quite good) scraps they pick up and if they're undergeared, they don't really impact the overall performance of the guild.<br>
<br>
In a hybrid (casual/hardcore) guild, a significant percentage of the member base are casual players and therefore would be slow to accumulate DKP.  Heavy raiders would be in a position to buy the best items while a larger group of casual raiders either buy up lesser items or hold out for long periods of time hoping to buy one valuable item.  The net effect of that, is your well geared hardcore players and sub-par geared casual players.  Those sub-par geared players have much more negative an effect on the overall power of the guild than 1-2 casual players would have on a guild like HnE.<br>
<br>
Once again, this really only applies to a guild which is trying to advance in new content, a casual guild which is content to raid older content can obviously be successful with smaller numbers.  A guild like that though to lean more towards the casual side and not attract as many heavy raiders. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5948">Duke Krazaak Crushbone</a> <<a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a>><BR>

That's why I don't think pricing items is the way to go. Instead, a silent auction best determines an item's true value, with &quot;ties&quot; broken on total DKP.<br>
<br>
With a bidding system, people never feel like they over-paid - they were the ones who bid. Also, in some sense it is need before greed. If I have a (made up numbers for simplification) 10 AC bp and someone else has a 30 AC bp and a 50 AC bp drops, it means mroe to me than it does to the other person. So I may bid more points than the other person, because I want it more. But if this second person also wants it badly, and they bid the same price and have more DKP, then it appropriately (in my opinion) awards the item to the second player. My fault for not participating.<br>

That's why a guild that doesn't focus on raids will never be able to do any of the bigger content. It's not really related to DKP though, you'll have the exact same problem with any other loot distribution method. Except perhaps for pure random rolling, but see how long that works.  DKP simply ensures the most unbiased method.  The fact is people who play more deserve to be rewarded more because they ARE contributing more to the guild than someone who plays once a week.  You don't get new equipment just for logging in, you have to do what it takes in order to earn it.  People who get upset that others who play more and contribute more get rewarded more are idiots.  They'll get rewarded as soon as someone institutes the EverQuest welfare system, because that's exactly what they're looking for.  Free handouts. <p>-Tain<BR>

You're quoting me to make my point, btw.  Yes, it is possible to make a hybrid guild that raids end-game content, but it's probably one of the most difficult and frustrating guilds to run.<br>

<br>
So when I buy the first 50 AC BP for 20 DKP one day and then the next day someone buys it for 10DKP you dont think I am gonna think I overpaid?  The net effect would probably be the lowering of all prices accrost the board since no one in their right mind would bid for an item the first 5 times it dropped for fear of overpayment.  I researched bidding systems also and I think they suck ass.  They are subject to outside influence.  Like player A knows that player B wants an item so they intentionally run up the bid price.  Even if the player did not do it intentionally the other player may feel like they did.  Just like an officer loot distribution system where everything may be fair and the player still feels cheated.  Everyone should pay the same.  An item is not worth double dkp just because you got it 4 days before someone else and while the player may initially pay the ransom I promise you when the newness wears off and they just realize they paid 2 weeks more dkp than the next person they are gonna come back and be pissed.<br>

<br>
First, if your guild has these problems, you have deeper issues than a loot system, I think. Second, though - it's a silent auction so there's no &quot;running up&quot; the price. <br>
<br>
&quot;An item is not worth double dkp just because you got it 4 days before someone else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why not? It may not be worth it to *you*, so you can wait four days later (although if it's a nice item, the price won't drop for a while). Supply and demand determine price, not some dictatorial decision passed down from on high. <br>

I don't think it is possible to have a strong raiding guild and at the same time a strongly casual 'friendly' guild.  The goals and all the things towards meeting those goals do not mesh.  Besides the disparity that will grow between the groups in equipment/experience/ability will cause the raid group to be incompatable with the other.  You can drag along a level 56 to Time.  Even 2 level 65s can be very different because of AAs and items.  Eventually you have to choose a path.  <br>
If you stay too casual, then members will come in and leave as they get bored, or wish to move to other parts of the game.  Then those raider folks will eventually get tired of getting strangers epics while they haven't seen a decent upgrade in several months.<br>
If you go too hardcore raiding, you have to cycle in new uber wannabes because of the burnout or boredom.<br>
If you try to go right down the middle, you can float along a while, but then you have a numbers problem.  If you raid say 3 days a week, your casuals will argue over which 3 days and what time, because they only have 10 hours a week to play.<br>
You can have a casual group inside a raid guild that uses DKP, but they will probably either leave soon out of frustration, or ramp up their play time to catch up.  <br>
A raid guild must also focus its efforts on doing only what will best advance the guild.  Little time for quests.  No time for ego baby sitting.  <br>
Best to pick a goal, then find a guild that shares it.  If your goals change, change guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lochdivine>Loch Divine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/18/03 5:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5270.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> If you think you can comprise a guild of 100+ people (total in order to have a sure 70 or whatever is needed now on everyday) and everyone will like each other and no one will be childish and try to fuck someone else is just naive.

<br>
Nope, it's impossible to run. In order to do the highest end stuff you need a lot of people equipped in high end equipment.  You don't get 100 people in top gear by doing things casually.  You can have some people with some of the best stuff in the game.  That's not enough though, you need a LOT of people equipped with the best they possibly can.  You can have a successful guild, but you will never, ever be able to do the top encounters because you simply won't have enough people equipped well enough to do it.   <p>-Tain<BR>

<br>
We've actually been alot more stable than any guild I can think of since the Laurri coup, with the exception--perhaps--of your own.<br>
<br>
I do not however think we can continue to describe outselves as &quot;casual&quot;--we are friendly, certainly. But many people work way too hard for us for that to be casual.<br>
<br>
I am not one of them, but I do recognize that without them I'd be lfg in sebilis. Which would be lonely since there is no one there.<br>
<br>
A few points in general:<br>
<br>
1.) Loot to the casual player. In my experience, which is pretty much casual (more than it should be lately:P), there's plenty of loot to go around. Perfectly nice things go up for grabs often enough that it isn't hard to equip decently raiding like twice a week. (Although the guilt factor of not doing more is something to consider.) People who whine about that...would be whining about something else if not that, ignore them.<br>
<br>
Sure, you're not going to see the best drops first--but if you are patient, you will see them. <br>
<br>
2.) Sharing the load. No one can do everything all the time or forever. Everyone needs to take time off at some point. Your guild must have the flexibility to realize that, and the ability to share responsibilies so that no one goes insane.<br>
<br>
3.) Trust. Well, obviously...<br>
<br>
4.) Realistic expectations. Everyone wants to conquer the world, someday--but you can't start doing Talendor and expect to be in Plane of Time in six months. Be proud of what you can accomplish and the rest will follow...and it is pretty neat when it does. I always get misty-eyed remembering our first Aary kill... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3244<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/22/03 4:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5270.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;We've actually been alot more stable than any guild I can think of since the Laurri coup, with the exception--perhaps--of your own.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
