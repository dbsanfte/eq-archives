Kaluian may no longer wander the lands of Norrath.  A number of reasons, really... [Warning: This may turn into a rant.]<br>
<br>
1.  Sick of the Stealth Nerfs.  Verant, if you want to nerf us, say &quot;We are nerfing this song because it is overpowered.&quot;  Tell us the truth.  DON'T say &quot;We apologize for the accidental problems with Chains.  The song will be returned to its proper state shortly.&quot;  If you think Lullaby is a level 30 and under song, FUCKING TELL US.  DON'T BEAT AROUND THE GOD DAMNED BUSH.  It has been MONTHS AND MONTHS since GZ's test.  Never once were we told &quot;The song is not intended to be efficient post 30.&quot;  Never mind that this explanation doesn't even make SENSE:  ALL BARD SONGS DO EITHER ONE OF 2 THINGS- 1.  Grow in power as the bard levels.  2.  Are upgraded when the bard obtains a reasonable level.  Lullaby does none of these things.  It is OBVIOUS that despite what Verant claims, NO-ONE in-house plays a bard.  No-one in house even understands basic bard issues.  Our songs have been made useless one at a time:  Our resist buffs, because of the bug where if you exceed 255 resist, 255 is SUBTRACTED from your resist.  Our Mesmerize/Lullaby songs, by the adding of a secondary resist.  Our DoT's were hit hard by the druid nurf, as we have no way of parking mobs- if we wish to solo with DoT's, we are stuck with snaring or running quickly from them.  Of course, now our Haste Songs get hit as well- no longer can we come NEAR the haste buff of another class.<br>
<br>
2.  The worthlessness of our class.  Fact is, bards are good for one thing- pumping mana.  I've looked through EVERY SINGLE SONG I HAVE- which is 51, all told.  I can only think of 1 that has a significant use in a group- pumping mana.  Our attack buffs are good for nothing but stats.  Pity stats are basically useless anyway.  Resists?  Bugged.  Psalm?  9 damage?  Useless against 12k+ HP mobs.  Charm?  Takes me over a full bubble of mana to charm a 2-mob pull in Sebilis.  In many locations, root-planting is a far superior alternative.  Our melee has degenerated in comparison to other classes post 50.  Fact is, we're mana batteries, nothing more.<br>
<br>
3.  THE FACT THAT KUNARK IS A PIECE OF CRAP.  This is easily the most ill-created expansion Verant could have thought to create.  They gave us dungeons more designed around &quot;doing&quot; them than about getting experience in them.  The one &quot;exp dungeon&quot; (Karnors) is basically unplayable, because piss-poor pathing creates horrific trains.  Mobs gating is another shitty idea, in the Verant style of &quot;Make them cheesy instead of Hard!&quot;  Examples:  Dispell, Fear, CH, Gating, Trakanons Touch, Mobs in VP &quot;reality warping.&quot;  The other 2 50+ dungeons (Sebilis and Charasis) require a well-built group, with an enchanter, a cleric, and an evaccer.  For almost all locations in these dungeons, a tank is needed as well, possibly 2.  This leaves remaining classes (bards, necros, mages) scrambling for one spot.  Not to mention that these zones require significant travel to get to and significant work to even enter.<br>
<br>
Going out to dinner with friends, I'll finish post when I return. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukaluianismyname.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaluian is my name</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/19/00 7:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sighs*... has it happened?</span><hr size=1> I'm back from dinner.  Yes, it was good.<br>
<br>
Anyway, continuing with point 3.<br>
<br>
... Significant Work to even enter.  Not to mention breaking a camp in one of these zones requires a significant time investment.  For example, a typical crypt break-in- <br>
15 minutes:  Wait for group to form.<br>
3 minutes:  Buff everyone up.<br>
5 minutes:  Kill everything up to rock 3-spawn.<br>
3 minutes:  Med at rock.<br>
7 minutes: Clear from Bridge to Temple.<br>
3 minutes:  Med up.<br>
5 minutes:  Clear first 2 undead rooms.<br>
3 minutes:  Med up at stairs prior to Crypt.<br>
5 minutes:  Clear room behind us and roamers.<br>
3 minutes:  Med up.<br>
4 minutes:  Kill both Imperial Crypt Guardians.<br>
2 minutes:  Med up.<br>
TOTAL:  53 minutes.  This is if we are lucky and there are no unexpected delays and doesn't logically happen.  Before Kunark, people complained that &quot;Unless you have an hour or more, there's nothing to do in this game.&quot;  Look above!  Now, an hour will simply GET YOU TO A SPOT- let alone getting a solitary PIXEL of experience!  Hell, back in the good old days, it would be something like:<br>
Log in.<br>
1 minute:  /shout XX Bard looking for group.<br>
1 minute:  Soandso tells you &quot;Hey, the Magi could use a bard.&quot;<br>
1 minute:  Get invis undead (not really necessary).<br>
1 minute:  Run to Magi.<br>
TOTAL:  4 minutes until I'm off and getting experience!  If I camped Freeport, add 7 minutes for the run.  If I have trouble finding a group, add 5 minutes.  During these 5 minutes, I can easily solo mobs at live zone line area, getting more exp than in the full hour in Seb!<br>
<br>
The game has changed, and not for the better.  I have commitments during the day, and can't afford to stay up very late.  I have about 4 hours to play on a typical weekday.  This is not enough time to form a full balanced group- cleric preferably, but sham or druid can work- enc, evac, tank or 2, and me.  Since there's just about no way to get down to a camp in Seb/Charasis, unless you're a monk or rogue, the old zone in and shout doesn't work anymore.  Frankly, Kunark is a joke.  The only times I can hope to even group with my friends are weekends.  Oh yeah, and...<br>
<br>
CLUE TO VERANT:  OUTDOOR ZONES ARE BORING AS ALL HELL!<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but I'm a dungeon crawler.  The method of &quot;pull/fear/snare/fear/snare/fear/snare&quot; doesn't work for me.  I can solo just as well as any other class, but I would rather not.  BAH!<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I have created a wizard, who I may or may not play semi-seriously.  We shall see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ulyrniajongleur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lyrnia Jongleur</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/19/00 10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sighs*... has it happened?</span><hr size=1> /em nods at Kaluian<br>

Unfortunately you're very right.  Which is why about 50% of the high level bards are in the process of (if they haven't already) retiring.  We are an AWESOME class 1-50.  After that?

Funny how pretty much every Bard who used to disagree with me both here and on Veeshan now is bitching about the same things.<br>
<br>
Wether or not I continue playin my Bard depends on something completely different than if we suck or not. Personally, I think we need to rethink how we play kinda like Rangers had to. Seems to work for alot.<br>

It's getting old.  <br>

So yes it brings me some kind of satisfaction.<br>

As for the Ranger comment.. not really. It has to do with controllin agro by maybe waiting a couple of secs before going in and a lot of other things. Ask Wenke, he is a master at it.<br>

In answer to the subject line question, I don`t know.<br>
<br>
Here is a typical EQ night:<br>
Log in. Tell the guild hello. Ask if anyone needs a bard in Seb, Karnor, DL, whatever. Greeted with the usual sound of crickets chirping, I fall into conversation with my friends. I get a sow, and kite a few mobs. However, kiting for 4 hours and watching 2 pixels move on my experience bar is disheartening, and more importantly, not_fun. After a few mobs, I usually log off. Maybe log on Kaluienne and check the auctions in Freeport. Maybe log onto another server and visit my friends. Log off and check a messagge board or 2. Log back on and ask for a group again. Log and go to bed, go to eat, go to a movie, whatever.<br>
<br>
I`ve also become disheartened with my class in general. No matter what anyone says, I`ve become convinced that the bard is now nothing more than a mana battery. Perhaps in solo, duo, or small group outdoor situations, a bard is a great addition. Actually, there is no perhaps- a bard IS a great addition to a group. However, that is not where I want to play the game. My game is played in dungeons, in the midst of danger, and on raids. What role can a bard play there? Before the expansion, I could do a great deal. The old saying goes &quot;jack of all trades, master of none.&quot; Before the expansion, I was an OK tank- some Guk camps I could tank. I was an OK healer- if a group could survive the fight, I could heal them up quickly. I was an OK enchanter- I could do crowd control on a pull of 3 mobs, sometimes more. My haste buffs made the warriors swords speed up, my debuffs made the monsters fists slow down. All and all, I was not indispensable, but I was useful and helpful in a group.<br>
<br>
What about post-expansion? I can`t tank shit. Send me into Sebilis or Karnor and try to ask me to tank ONE mob. Hell, send me into DL and ask me to tank one mob! I`m a WORTHLESS healer- name one group that survives a fight without needing a heal. Even if they do, my heals take so long to work it`d be multiple minutes between fights. I`m a shitty enchanter- I can do a half-decent job in Karnor, but in Seb? Chardok? Hahaha. IF you pull 2, then I can do crowd control. For 5 pulls. The new charm is limited by mana use, and controlling one creature for a fast Seb fight takes a bubble of mana- and clarity, manasong, med does not effect me. My haste buffs no longer makes swords swing faster- Haste Buff + Haste item bring you to the haste cap. The addition of the stats is worthless. My haste debuffs aggro mobs through walls, are heavily resisted, and are a massive taunt. Even if they weren`t, a host of other classes can do a better job. My melee is a joke.<br>
<br>
All I have left is my mana. Excuse the phrase, but fuck that. I always told myself I would not be a mana bard. There is so much more to playing a bard. Bards can do so much more for a group... well, the time has come. We can`t. My use in a dungeon is often limited to &quot;sit your ass down and play manasong.&quot; <br>
<br>
Soo... thanks for the pie Andy, but I'll just eat it- I hope you're a good cook ;-)<br>

<br>
Your posts and comments stated that bards were 'worthless' and that you no longer enjoyed them.  We merely stated that they weren't worthless.  This was before:<br>
<br>
1)  Chains nerf was declared &quot;as designed&quot; after having been told it would be fixed.<br>
2)  Mez was declared &quot;as designed&quot; with a 70% resist rate<br>
3)  Haste bug was fixed, effectively reducing the power of bardic haste songs to near worthlessness in any multi-group raid that contained an enchanter.  Formerly a group with an enchanter (and using haste items) could have the bard do hastes and be just as effective, freeing the enchanter to do other things, this is no longer true because they fixed this bug.  A group without an enchanter could be very effective with a bard if they had haste items as well.  The bug fix is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a bad thing, just one more thing which makes bards less effective than they once were.<br>
<br>
All 3 of these things have become true after your initial complaints about the class.  You can't sit there saying &quot;I told you so&quot; when most of us were already unhappy but sitting it out hoping that the issues above would be fixed, or addressed, in a way not to harm bards viability as a class in the upper levels.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  Yes, when you posted bards weren't &quot;as good&quot; as they had been pre-50 but, now, after the latest series of announcments and patches by Verant bards are even LESS effective thus causing many who were near, or on, the fence to jump over and decide that it's no longer worth the frustration of being a bard in the post-50 levels.  I still think bard is the best class, hands down, pre-50.<br>
<br>
So, no you didn't &quot;Tell me so&quot; you merely predicted, correctly, what would happen.  I'm sorry you were right, but you were.  As Kaluian said, many of us had our frustrations with the class long before you ever posted but kept it to ourselves or our guildmates longer than you, that's all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

We knew we sucked from the beginning.  Friends laugh because we have 'bind wound' as a hotkey.<br>

How many times you see group looking for a tank, enchanter or cleric. You never see a bard, SK, Pally, ranger or bard. Once in a while I see a pet class requested.
