(and im meanin decency in the game, not here, feel free to tear or hop on)<br>
<br>
Place: Bastion of Thunder, south pad<br>
<br>
Problem:  Named up (Sandstorm), and Swavay, a Dragons of Northstar member decides that our group will be unable to kill named so he calls his guild to 'help'.  Now if you're not gonna help and just gonna have your guild take a named from an established group, be upfront and thank the group for bein slow and quit group and go join your guild.<br>
<br>
Vanston and the DoN show up, set up and in the kindness of their hearts clear the pops around the named for us.  The whole time im expecting DoN to help themselves to named, the rest of the group is thinkin the same, Swavay is sayin there is no way we could do it, the main tank is saying his wizard hydra is a few min away. So group is feelin hurried and concerned at possible theft of mob that the DoN wouldnt have known about had Swavay kept quiet. We have a rogue on standby to help, but DoN is clearin the room and Swavay keeps pointin out he might have to leave the group to help his guild.<br>
<br>
Now i'll be the first to agree that our group was a bit lethargic in attacking the named, and that we weren't 100% when we did pull him, but how crappy is it for someone in a group to call their guild, tell them a named is up and that the group they're in probably couldnt do it.  <br>
<br>
Our 65sk went down, then the pally and when oom and gettin aggro i headed for the pad, there on the other side was Dragons of Northstar all ready to pounce on the named.  Dunno what dropped, dont really care.  Just think if you're in a group your responsibility is to the ppl who let ya join with them and not to sell them out for your guild.<br>
<br>
When i mentioned it to Swavay, he said that if i knew Vanston then i'd know thats what to expect, well i don't know Vanston, and im thinkin thats not a bad thing.<br>
<br>

<br>
Bdaan's response is probably the best.<br>
<br>
First, you have no idea how DoN found out. Was Swavay the only one from DoN in the zone? And *even if* Swavay is the one who &quot;told the guild&quot; you have no idea how it happened. <br>
<br>
&quot;/gu damnit! I hate when a named pops and we can't take it&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;guildie_01 Oh yeah? Where&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;/gu South BOT&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;guildie_02 We should go wait to see if they drop&quot;<br>
<br>
And why not? If he knows you're going to drop to the named, he might as well help the guild out. It's not like you were planning on taking a named, or else the wizzy alt would have been there ahead of time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vanston and the DoN show up, set up and in the kindness of their hearts clear the pops around the named for us.&quot; That was nice of them. It helped you get to the named much more easily, and is helping not only their guildy in your group, but the whole group as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;how crappy is it for someone in a group to call their guild, tell them a named is up and that the group they're in probably couldnt do it&quot;<br>
<br>
Not crappy at all when you're, &quot;the first to agree that our group was a bit lethargic in attacking the named, and that we weren't 100% when we did pull him&quot;<br>
<br>
DoN did as much as possible to help you, it's not their fault they wiped. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dunno what dropped, dont really care.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lies.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just think if you're in a group your responsibility is to the ppl who let ya join with them and not to sell them out for your guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
*You* <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>let</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> him join? My <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>guess</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is that at 62 you got the auto-flag and the group was doing you a favor to let you join. I could be wrong about this, that's ok. Because even if I am wrong, and you &quot;let&quot; him join you, he kept his duty to the group. It sounds like he stayed in a group he was pretty sure was going to drop. He didn't disband and go join his guildies and jump past you. From what you've said, he stayed with you through the wipe, and that's class.<br>
<br>
FURTHERMORE, I'm not at all certain that the duty is to the group over the guild. If a raid is called, hopefully I have enough warning to let my group know I'm leaving soon. But if not - if it's a race to a named, &quot;Peace, yo - raid called&quot; and /disband. I'm *pretty sure* most people would say guild &gt; group, especially if it's a pickup group.<br>
<br>
Finally why *shouldn't* he tell his guild that there's a possilbe named. All-in-all I think DoN handled this situation with class, especially if they're helping make it easier for you to pull and not jumping your named.<br>

<br>
&quot;First, you have no idea how DoN found out. Was Swavay the only one from DoN in the zone? And *even if* Swavay is the one who &quot;told the guild&quot; you have no idea how it happened.&quot; <br>
<br>
--Swavay told our group that he had told his guild the named was up and that they were coming.<br>
<br>
&quot;And why not?&quot;<br>
<br>
--we were planning on taking him out, i'd been in a group earlier that had killed him, and we were waiting for the wizard to arrive.  and as has been mentioned time and time again in the blast furnace, camps mean little, first to get aggro wins.  so we were rushed (and we wouldnt have been if we had camp to ourselves as is the norm).<br>
<br>
&quot;Vanston and the DoN show up, set up and in the kindness of their hearts clear the pops around the named for us.&quot; That was nice of them. It helped you get to the named much more easily, and is helping not only their guildy in your group, but the whole group as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
--they may have cleared for us, but they may have cleared for themselves.  and eventually we woulda had him, we sat thru the ph's, they showed for the named.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not crappy at all when you're, &quot;the first to agree that our group was a bit lethargic in attacking the named, and that we weren't 100% when we did pull him&quot;<br>
<br>
--we had the wiz coming and had we died on first attempt, we could have been rezzed, worked it out or gotten a few more, but swavay decided to give to his guild instead of lettin the group deal with it.  DoN shouldnt have been sitting there waitin for us to win or lose. <br>
 <br>
&quot;*You* let him join?&quot;<br>
<br>
--i can't remember who invited who, but im usually not at a loss for finding groups. (still dont know what point is as to whether i got autoflagged or not, so some of you jumped thru more hoops than i did, eh?)<br>
<br>
&quot;he kept his duty to the group. It sounds like he stayed in a group he was pretty sure was going to drop. He didn't disband and go join his guildies and jump past you. From what you've said, he stayed with you through the wipe, and that's class.&quot;<br>
<br>
--and as for his duty, had we won, Swavay woulda gotten a chance at drops so he wins no points by staying in the group.<br>
<br>
what he dropped isnt the issue, the fact that a person in our group sold out the group and further possible chances at a mob to his guild was.<br>
<br>
we weren't racing to a named, we were standing in front of him pulling our resources together and waiting for the wiz when DoN set up camp across from us.<br>

Considering all the other posts that you referred to in your post....I think that DoN did better than most if not all the other guilds that have been blasted here lately about BoT...<br>

So your group died and someone else took your mob....Let's see...Didnt that happen like 61 levels ago?...You should be used to that shit by now and not be whining like Sycik with his balls in a grinder...<br>

They should have never opened the zones and i'm sure if we actually had to work for our flags again we'd all be a lot happier. <p>Hevyd Likescake<br>

They may suck while your working to complete them but once completed there is a sense of accomplishment you cant get from just clicking on the door and popping in.  I'm not saying they should have kept the zones closed up but in general time sinks are what made this game what it is.<br>

BoT though is a shithole.  Opening that zone was a horrible move and only created more problems then it was worth.  <br>

BTW, I do have my BoT flag and so did almost all of FotC before the flag removal.  How many guilds in BoT now would have flagged there members for BoT had they not opened the zone. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>

<br>
Speaking of ok experience, you can get that pretty much anywhere with the new changes. I went to Torgen mines with a tank and a cleric and got decent experience. Went to Veksar and had fun. Chardok B, ditto.<br>
<br>
I like BoT, but I like BoT more with less than 80 people in the zone.<br>

Is a pity as well that Torment isnt an experience zone--it should be. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bdaan>Bdaan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/49621/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Saryrn's Most Ignored Person</span><br>  Posts: 621<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/3/03 10:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3440.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> IMO.
