<br>
 A couple weeks ago, you guys were competing with KoF over Aary. KoF grants you a 1st attempt(without moving in when you wipe), and of course you guys wipe. BUT instead of granting KoF a legitimate shot, you have them trained(intentionally I might add). After doing this I believe you went in and succeeded...gratz <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Bokuza - No one likes you. Your an asshole. I've yet to meet anyone who ever liked you. I can actually tell you that every person I've ever met, that had this poor luck of crossing your path, thinks your a jackass. And after reading these boards, I see it's spreading.<br>
<br>
GoL Guildleader - I'm sorry that the majority of your guild has no respect for the games mechanics, especially dealing with how large encounters work. The fact of the matter is your guild sucks, you've been around for like 3 years, and are totally gimp. So the only way your guild can do anything, is by playing dirty pool. In the last month all I've seen from GoL is training, Ks'ing and the infamous BoT jumping on named mobs the second a group wipes at &quot;their&quot; camp.<br>
 Being a former guildleader I can tell you, prospering as a small guild is a lot of work. Don't take the cheap and easy way out, just find some leadership that can actually make your guild what you want it to be. It's tough to let go, but make the right call for the guild.<br>

Yeah -- the KOF deal was a bunch of shit too. Here we were sitting in TOV, had already worked out &quot;rights&quot; to NTOV with TOS (rotation does exist, but I have noticed GOL asses obviously don't care about reputation and tactics). KoF didn't even head towards the safe hall - instead they wait at ZI and what do you know?!?!  GOL wipes to Aary.  Does KOF come in and KS you?  NO. Instead the RL decides to be mature and hold the guild off and let you have another shot!  Imagine that!  Then as they head over to check what other names are up -- you train the hell outta them!  Good &quot;form&quot;!!<br>
<br>
I have also yet to meet anyone who likes Bokuza. Hell, I haven't liked him since my first guild when I met him there.<br>
<br>
Being an RL isn't easy.  Tells are missed, etc.  Being a GL is even more challenging.  However, doing the common sense thing shouldn't be hard.  Hell, my guild was being followed and stalked on a BoT tower named a couple nights ago JUST like GOL was doing to FOTC.  Fortunately for us, we succeeded.  The funny thing - is that when we had some deaths, they helped us rez and rebuff.  When they had some deaths, we went down and clicked a few of their people.  Did it frustrate and piss me off that they were in line incase we should fail?  Hell yeah it did.  But it did make our kill ever more sweet.  FOTC, my hat is off to you.  Sorry about what happened to you.  Shit happens guys -- but at least you guys are better prep'd for another round on AOW.  /hugs<br>

I have no idea why you are talking for another guild. Don't bring people into this who have not wanted to be in it in the first place.<br>

As for &quot;Stealing&quot; Aar or taking it outta rotation, We were told by the rotation leader to kill Aar when he pops and we get it that week, dont wait on any guilds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=razonlittlefoot>RazonLittlefoot</A> at: 7/11/03 12:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leiyah>Leiyah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/11/03 12:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3379.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guardians Of Light</span><hr size=1> Nebbun you are SO full of shit it's unreal!

The head of the rotation (Tose of ToN i believe, and Tose, chime in here if I'm wrong) cannot say that GoL can take a shot on Aary when it is ToS's week.  Only ToS can say this.  If KoF got permission for there Aary shot from ToS then they had every right to Aary. <br>
<br>
Also, NToV as a whole cannot be granted to one guild or another, only Aary.  If ToS didnt clear NToV then NToV becomes FFA, no matter who killed Aary.  This subject was discussed about six months ago.  Look for the thread &quot;NToV Agreement violated by Frozen Spirits&quot;. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>
