That's a pretty blanket statement.  I think it goes a little too far.  <br>
<br>
Part of the game should be creativity.  The game designers may put in new_mob_1 with the intention that you need to kill it a certain way.  If people use the skills given to them to find another way .. a way not intended by the game designers .. to kill new_mob_1, that isn't cheating.  It's creativity.  It's using their intelligence.<br>
<br>
As to tradeskills, though, I would tend to agree.

<br>
It's not nice to accuse VI of desiring to inflict physical pain on their customers.  That said however, the logistics of the recipies involved and the tools provided (BYOFinger) to execute them make physical pain a very real obstacle given the average player's desire to reduce the other major demand, time.  It seems that the physical, real-world limitations of the user in terms of moving the mouse and clicking hudreds of thousands of times is a very important means for them to ensure that the skill does, in fact, require a long time to master.  (Though the other, and more effective means used to acomplish the same goal is to make the ingredients only found on mob corpses.)<br>
<br>
A macro program which can move and click your mouse many times faster than is humanly possible is an obvious end-run around the obstacles placed in the player's path to higher achievement.  Macroquest isnt a mind-reading mouse driver that merely eliminates your arms and fingers from the equation.<br>
<br>
The only way you can win the argument is to try and show that the intent of the designers was that tradeskill advancement is meant to be something other than expensive, time consuming, and painful for the player.  Either that or make a case that Macroquest or similar programs are sanctioned by the designers.<br>

My argument is based off of macro programs used in UO. Unlike UO however, you can't have an endless supply of fish steaks stacked in a box in a locked house where you could macro all day long. Thus you would still run out of supplies. <br>
<br>
So what you are telling me, is that Macroquest allows the mouse to fly across the screen clicking and combining faster than any human could possibly do? That, I agree with does give some kind of advantage. However, has anyone really timed out how fast it can blow through an entire inventory full of supplies as compared to a human? Perhaps a John Henry test is in order. You know, the old man vs. machine. <br>

<br>
Yes the macros would be complicated, though if what was said about &quot;querying the curser&quot; is true, that saves a sh!tload of &quot;ok think, how do I have to lay this out&quot; time and effort.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are cases (mainly with non stacking ingreedients) where you'd have to do the whole bag by hand once to get the macro to go right.  But at the high end of things, you are getting a skill up once every 40-60 combines (on average).  And most recipies are followed for several skill ups.  So, say you use 50 combines per skill up, times, say, 10 skill ups before you go to the next recipie.  Lets just say this recipie takes 30 total actions (clicks moves combines, et all).  Lets also say that this recipie uses 1 non-stacking item.<br>
<br>
By hand: 30 moves x 50 combines x 10 skill ups = 15000 total actions.<br>
<br>
By macro, including setting up the macro for the first time: 30 moves x 10 combines (one bags worth of nonstackables to simplify the macro) = 1 setup macro. 4 macro hits (10 combines each) + (5 macro hits x 9 skill ups) = 300 + 4 + 45 = 349 total actions with more trips to the vender to restock that 1 bag you use for unstackables.  And did I mention you _could_ make a macro that did that too?<br>
<br>
Quite a difference.  Also, all those alternate products?  You could add &quot;error correction&quot; steps to any macro, it'd just increase the complexity (and thats assuming no &quot;cursor querying&quot;)<br>
<br>
As for reasons why macroing is &quot;bad&quot;:<br>
1.  3rd party software.  Like it or not, untill the eula is changed, this is technically wrong.  Weither that stops you, is an entirely different story.<br>
<br>
2.  Allows any old technically advanced person encroach apon the domain previously held by the most dedicated, mostly crazy inner circle of folks (hard core crafters).<br>
<br>
3.  Similar to #2,  Because it takes 90% of the work out of it, making it easy, and removing some of the &quot;martyr ego points&quot; from it.  The person who macros JC is less of a MAN (woman, crafter, whatever) than one who does it &quot;by Hand&quot;, who is less than one who macros thier tailoring batchs of combines (between manually collecting ingredients) who is  less of a MAN than the &quot;by Hand&quot; person.  Hell, Most tailors look down on anyone else, _maybe_ grumblingly admiting that smithing is _almost_ as hard.  &quot;Pfff, JC GM?  Don't they hand that out when you gain lvl X?&quot;<br>
<br>
4.  Macro'ng gets recipies nerfed.  Finding that golden recipie, that actually pays for itself is a grail for which all up and coming crafters lust.  Then those nasty macroers find it, and by producing millions of plat while they sleep, tip off VI that they missed one on thier previous sweeps.  Fish fillets were untouched for _a_long_time_, untill macroing made it big.<br>
<br>
And number 5.  Macros are bad because you didn't use them.<br>
<br>
Edit: garb: The numbers I was seeing were 15 combines A SECOND.  Of course, those folks also painted themselves dayglow orange and waved glowing and blinking flags for the Sony Hitsquad (l33t Ha&gt;&lt;0R division) to snipe.<br>

<br>
Too true.  However, you didn't say that VERANT viewed it as cheating, you said that &quot;most players&quot; view it as cheating.  I don't think it's true that &quot;most players&quot; would agree that it's cheating, regardless of what the people at Verant would think.  To me, and I think to many others, part of the fun of the game is finding a different way to solve a particular encounter.  Otherwise, it's just a matter of whether you have enough eye-hand coordination and timing to perform the specific actions Verant intended you to perform.  <br>
<br>
Putting that technical point aside, I've had this argument with the dearly departed Brad McQuaid.  In my view, and I think in the view of many players, anything that is within the coding is fair game, and not cheating.  Verant certainly has the right to change the coding at any time, but if the coding permits a certain action, it's awfully hypocritical of them to say that it's an &quot;exploit&quot; to take advantage of it.  Otherwise, you put the players in the position of being mindreaders .. did the game designer intend to allow me to use this particular bit of coding in this way, or not?  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, Brad didn't agree.  But again, he wasn't &quot;most players&quot;, he was the face of Verant.  His position about exploits was that it was a lot like the Supreme Court's view of pornography .. he knows it when he sees it.  That's because in his mind an exploit was something that the designers didn't intend, and of course he was in a better position than any player to know what the designers intended.  <br>
<br>
Post-Brad, Verant seems to be moving in the direction of fixing the coding, rather than blaming the players.  An example is the &quot;fear pit&quot; that used to exist in PoJ, where all feared mobs would go and get stuck.  They used a rather blunt instrument to fix problem (no more fearing in PoJ), but at least they didn't run around screaming that it was an exploit because everyone knows that feared mobs are supposed to run away and since these mobs couldn't run you were fighting in a way that the designers hadn't intended.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnashsnobb@thesaryrntavern>Gnash Snobb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(3/23/03 8:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3159.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What I always did</span><hr size=1> I had several &quot;tradeskill friends&quot; that I did business with.
