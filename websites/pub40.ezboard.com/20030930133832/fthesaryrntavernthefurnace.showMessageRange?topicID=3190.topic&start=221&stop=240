Do any of these paraphrases give you some idea of the absolute futility of your continued posting here?  Any clue at all?  Maybe some spark of recognition?<br>
<br>
I actually cringe quite often when I see what you do to yourself on here.<br>
<br>
 You should really do what's left of your ass a favor, if there IS anything left of it.. give it a break, and let the gnashing teeth bite on empty air for a while.  Their interest will fade if there is nothing to sink their teeth into.<br>
<br>
 If the constant deluge of verbal abuse is something you actually enjoy,  then I will stop cringing and just enjoy the constant innovation of the flamers here, who do manage to come up with some new surprising twists from time to time, especially when you give them so much material to work with.<br>
<br>
  I sincerely hope you find some enjoyment, whether it be by distancing yourself from this place, or because you actually enjoy the repeated ripping open of your virtual sphincter.<br>
<br>

<br>
Novbre,<br>
<br>
Your delusional dis-information deserves a reply.  <br>
<br>
&quot;LOL you think I dislike you because you were deemed unpopular over something that happened before I even met you?&quot;<br>
<br>
NO.. your reasons build upon that unpopularity.  I was an easy target to blame your EQ &quot;issues&quot; on.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you insulted Hildie and Adayven?&quot;<br>
<br>
They insulted me.  I responded with some very accurate observations.<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you accused the two people dearest to me in game of being rl child molesters, claiming you had logs as proof that you were going to turn over to the police and have them arrested? (logs btw which were mysterious deleted from your computer by a mysterious hacker?)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats not true.  The truth is I accused you of cybering with under-aged males.  I never said I had any logs of that (it was an educated guess based on your self reported real age and that of your in game BF) and I also never said I would be going<br>
to the police.<br>
<br>
I believe that started when we started trading insults.  I warned you, flame me and I willmake observations about those that attack me.<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like you might have something to hide if you made those conclusions.  Very delusional.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you posted some truly obscene filth on the guild webby and guildmotd as your &quot;mature&quot; response to frustration over not being able to get the guild to go where you wanted to? &quot;<br>
<br>
Also untrue.  What I did post was a rant on a private guild message board about people that backstab and leave a guild during hard times.  I mentioned you and your BF as prime examples.<br>
<br>
Guess the truth hurt.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you accused me of bombing your e-mail at work which resulted in you loosing your job?&quot;<br>
<br>
While I did not loose my job I did end up getting in trouble since my e-mail account caused the e-mail server which serviced 2000 employees to crash, the anonomus server host that sent the e-mails lost his ISP access and needed to get a new ISP.<br>
<br>
To this day I have no clue who it was, Iknow it was somone you were friends with and I am still not entirely sure it was not you. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you accused me being the hacker that broke into your computer and posted those awful things you said so that I could blackmail you for rl money?&quot;<br>
<br>
The blackmail situation was indeed true, to add to it somone managed to get my bank card number frommy PC and run up a $1500 dollar bill before the bank canceled the card, while I did not have to pay the fees and the person was never caught the whole situation was very stressful.  Was it you?  I have no idea who it was but I know they had to be &quot;friends&quot; of yours at the very least.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because of the nature of the insults.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because you accused me of having a secret circle of friends to chain threaten you in e-mails and phone calls, that resulted in you loosing another job?&quot;<br>
<br>
Also not completely true.  Somone you know sent those e-mails.  Somone tried very hard to ruin my life over the fact you were upset with me.  You were upset with me because the guild failed and because I was unhappy with you and your friends leaving the guild and helping to cause it to completely fail.  A single post I made that questioned the motives and judgment of you and your friends and called you backstabers set you off.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because after 22 sg raids, you tried to paint me the loot whore because YOU assigened some of the netted kelp drops to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
huh? Thats not true at all.  I believe the term &quot;loot whore&quot; was only used to describe you when it was plainly pointed out you were not interested in building a guild but rather were looking for a ride to the loot from an established one.  This after going through the trouble of starting a guild and working on rebuilding.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; Oh yeah, and let's not forget the accusation that I was blackmailing you for rl money, threating some undefined evilness if you didn't gimme any and every loot drop I wanted. (logs of which...you guessed it...where mysteriously deleted by some hacker.)&quot;<br>
<br>
No true at all.  Again.. you are very dellusional.  You on any meds?  I think you must.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That I dislike you because instead of apolgizing for the vomit you posted on the webby, you blamed some &quot;hacker&quot; saying someone broke into your ezboard account and posted that using your sign in? Another lie you tripped yourself with because in a previous post on this thread you admitted that you had posted it, and in fact spent some time defending it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somone changed the post. Yes I posted somehting but it was most certainly not that vulgar crap somone put in its place.<br>
Seemed to me like someone (gee I wonder who) had a good plan that half worked.  They harrassed me but got no money out of it. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you think it's possible I dislike you because of this abreviated list of transgressions, rather then something that happened before I knew you?&quot;<br>
<br>
You helped cause these situations and then all hell broke loose.  To be fair I do not know exactly who but I have a list of poential people that knew you that could have started this.  I will never be able to rule youoff that list.    <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;People dislike you because you're a hypocritical, back stabbing, two faced, whiney, lying waste of an orgasm.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am nothing of the sort.  In fact you just described yourself much better then I could.  Bravo!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Really? So why is your sorry ass on stormhammer? Face it rthen, you were chased off...tail between the legs and all.&quot;<br>
<br>
I really don't think I could be happy kissing all the ass people need ot kiss here on Saryrn to exist.  The fact is I kiss no ass now, I simply play the game and have fun and I have some great friends.<br>

You talk a tough manly talk but you play a female in game.  You also sound like a child.  Lets be &quot;real&quot; for a second, your a fucking feak.<br>

I have noting against you or Isen, my issue is with the community regulars here on the tavern.  Somone youknow started this chain reaction and he most certainly must be laughing his ass off at me because like most folks here the constant abuse and flamage of other people is a core driving force of this wonderful community.<br>
<br>
Yeah I made a mistake with Scartak however the communies raciton and Isen's reaciton at the time was simply overboard.  I don;t think anyone could have resisted responding to it.<br>

You're trying to piss into a hurricane.<br>

You're trying to light a fart in a tornado.<br>

You're trying to stop the tide from coming in by using a paper cup for bailing.<br>

You're trying to stop a giant sequoia from falling using your bare hands.<br>

You're trying to make a train jump off the tracks by sticking <br>

You're trying to stop an out of control 18 wheeler that's fully loaded and has lost it's brakes careening down a steep incline, by shoving your bare foot against the ground while holding on to the fuel tank.<br>

You're trying to tame a great white shark by swimming naked with it, holding a bloody fish in front of you, with open cuts on your hands, arms and legs.<br>
<br>
You're trying to fly by jumping off the edge of a cliff and lighting a fart on the way down.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do any of these paraphrases give you some idea of the absolute futility of your continued posting here? Any clue at all? Maybe some spark of recognition?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I am an annoyance.  I will remain such until the commuity shuts up and does not use the name Rthen anywhere here.  You want to crack fun and talk shit about me then do it on your prvite boards.  Thats all I ask of you guys.<br>
<br>
if not I will be happy to share my observations about my attackers.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I actually cringe quite often when I see what you do to yourself on here.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
It is really ok, you have been accepted and the community tolerates you, there is no need for you to continue abase yourself in front of them at every opprotunity.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You should really do what's left of your ass a favor, if there IS anything left of it.. give it a break, and let the gnashing teeth bite on empty air for a while. Their interest will fade if there is nothing to sink their teeth into.&quot;<br>
<br>
No thats too easy.  I want &quot;them&quot; to stop.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If the constant deluge of verbal abuse is something you actually enjoy, then I will stop cringing and just enjoy the constant innovation of the flamers here, who do manage to come up with some new surprising twists from time to time, especially when you give them so much material to work with.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Eveyone will convince themselves that their friends or that they are winning a flame war.  in the end though all sides loose face in the eyes of the silent but present majority of people that read these boards but do not contribute.<br>
<br>
These retards twist words and generally invent stuff to post here.  In the end many of them remind me of the picture of the mentally challanged kid running in the special olympics.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I sincerely hope you find some enjoyment, whether it be by distancing yourself from this place, or because you actually enjoy the repeated ripping open of your virtual sphincter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Generally getting away from 2 faced assholes was enjoyment enough.  Also playing my necro here and making some of you wait for your favorite exp or farm camps is also enjoyable.<br>

At the core of this I suspect you and your friends were responsible for all of the outside of game harrassment and I don;t really have a way to prove it.  It dosen't matter now, what you folks did do is force me to tighten up my secruity in both physically and computer related areas.<br>

My warning to all here is to be very careful with Novbre, if she don'tlike your posts she will do whatever she can to make sure she gets some twisted level of statisfaction out of real life harrassment.  Either that or you have a squad of people to do that for you.<br>

Except for the little detail that there was only ever one version that was seen by anyone.  In point of fact when I first saw the post there was no *edited at/by* anywhere on it, in fact there wasn't any edited marks on that post until hours before you announced that you had been hacked and someone else wrote the post.

And you'll see that it was very much in context.  What I didn't add previous because you already know it, there was only one accusation of blackmail made by you.  But like all your other accusations it was all incompassing.  I was blackmailing you for loot, for rl money, to take power from you within the guild, and because I was unhappy with you.   They weren't seperate instances of blackmail,  according to you I was blackmailling you for all these at the same time.  Since there was only one blackmail accusation made by you....it is either true or it's not...it can't be both as you claim it is.  So again, make up your bloody mind.<br>

This is a two parter.  The original rant I flipped out over was NOT very tame....as I said, you made obscene accustions about two of my friends...posted in graphic detail why you thought they were child molesters in real life, and threatned to give these &quot;logs&quot; you had about it over to the police because you were SURE they were criminal.  The things you said were so awful, and so disgusting that one of the people you vented your bile on retired her character over it.

 Hmm..  I think the difference here is that I have made mistakes and gotten into flame wars with others here, been raked over the coals for it, and I chose the better part of valor.  I quit arguing, stepped back, realized I was not going to 'win' no matter what I did or said, and basically stopped posting for a while.  I let bygones be bygones (is that a word?) and concentrated on other things for a while.<br>
<br>
 I now choose to observe for the most part, and insert my opinion very rarely.  I only did this time because I see you beating your head against a virtual wall over and over and over, and I felt bad for you.  Sometimes you just have to throw in the towel for the sake of your own mental health and sanity.<br>
