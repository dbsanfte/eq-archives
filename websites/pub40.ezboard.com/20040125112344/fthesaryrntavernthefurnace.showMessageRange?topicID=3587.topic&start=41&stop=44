That preacher, i think, would be spending more time in hell than the gay boy.  For putting up something that morbid and pushing more people away from Christianity rather than doing his job and promoting Christianity. I think God would be much more pissed at that then a boy sleeping with other boys. My uncle is gay, yet is a Christian. He can not help his emotions toward men and is not going to live his life in a lie. I believe whole-heartedly that he will be in Heaven when he dies, because he loves God and accpeted Christ.  I don't know how these people think they are making Christians look good to the world, and ending the horrible steriotypes, but it pisses me off.<br>
<br>
 Preachers and Priests who act like this, are just WRONG. period. No IF AND or BUT about it. They think they're ideas are right because they *think* God is automatically on their side when they do something so horrible as try and put up a statue like that. Guess they forgot the part about "God is Love" not God is hate going to kill everything you dont like.<br>
<br>
Lets not forget the most important quote this preacher is missing "Judge not, lest ye be judged" <br>

<br>
I miss your reasoning here. I assume you're speaking about the Ten Commandments monument contraversy about being placed in the court house. I was speaking of the Ten Commandments monument in Casper city park which they are arguing gives way for Phelps hate monument to be placed in the same park. <br>
<br>
My opinion on that case actually differs, I don't believe they should have installed such a monument inside a courthouse. Sure much of our modern day laws represent the same laws presented in the Ten Commandments but Justice is supposed to be blind. Placing that monument in the courthouse represents a bias and that you may be judged unfairly based on a difference of background.<br>
<br>
The 'ten commandment' judge was another one who tried to pressure his religion onto others by his past experience. He had (what I assume was) christian prayer before the jurors on cases. He had the ten commandments hanging behind his bench, ran on a religious/ten commandment platform, the monument was the straw that broke the camels back.<br>
<br>
This is one area where church and state SHOULD be seperated. Someone commits adultery so you rule unfairly against them in divorce court leaving them not enough to even get by? You take one of your parents to civil court and the case gets thrown out or vise versa and they are ruled in favor of solely on the basis of 'Honor thy father and thy mother'?<br>
<br>
But having the monument up doesn't create more of an us and them enviroment any more than there already is. Its human nature to look at people as one of us or one of them. I think the psychological term they use for it is classing people into schemas(sp)? I think its Humanistic Psychology(?Whichever looks at psychology in natural/biological view point) claims it goes way back to recognising new people as friend or foe to accept or defend against them. What would create the us and them enviroment is that the judge wouldn't allow any monument from other religions to be put in the same space.<br>

<br>
I'd have to agree I was thinking more along the lines of Vegabond's statement. Not taking out a lynchmob to string him up but deny him service in your restaurants, don't enter into service agreements with him, his cable goes out put him on the bottom of the repair list, his church has a damaged roof turn him down or give him the special hatemonger rate. (Though if it was struck by lightning or something I would steer clear of it, god may be trying to send him a message <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) There are many ways to 'run' someone out of town thats why you won't find sex offenders or drug dealers out in my neck of the woods they never last long.<br>

<br>
A few years back when Sheperd was killed I believe I remember the news coverage of Phelp's crew outside the funeral with their picket signs and chants. If thats not causing shit I don't know what is, its sad when you give no respect to the dead or the grieving family.<br>
<br>
 What if it was someone's 82 year old grandmother who had a gentlemen friend after they were widowed. Lets say some pompous ass rounded up his friends and decided to picket the funeral or wake slinging insults because she was living with a man she wasn't married to. I don't know about anyone else but we wouldn't need police to remove them from the premesis we would be all too eager to take care of that ourselves. This coming from someone who chooses not to fight rather to turn the other cheek but sometimes someone will cross the line and its a matter of respect and integrity or maybe its the Irish in me we only need a half good excuse to drink and brawl. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I've lived in a small town in the south, so I have an understanding of what it might be like, if you were to oppose a preacher, of any kind for any reason.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Towns don't come much smaller than Folsom, Louisiana and I too know what its like to oppose a preacher especially a backwoods baptiste preacher. The preacher is the head of the town living like a king. Money in a collection basket seven days a week, grass mowed by parishoners(sp), food cooked for your family every day and a church filled with people on the edge of their seat waiting for you to grace them with your next words. I guess after a while they get to feeling like God themselves. Of course with that comes banishing people to hell when you have something against them or throwing them out the church. <br>
<br>
Case in point, a young man of the church had been dating the preachers obnoxious/demanding daughter, when he broke up with her he was thrown out of the church. The Preacher would only say someone here is not welcome in God's house and wouldn't give a sermon until the young man left. He was a good kid, gave his life to god, sang in the choir, most pleasant honest young man you could ever hope to meet but after that day he never returned to church even though his family still attends that church.<br>
<br>
So a big fuck you to the preacher. Even his daughter got one when she came into my store with an attitude one day. She didn't know who I was or that I knew who she was but decided to get a holier than thou attitude with me so Go fuck yourself princess there's the door. Needless to say I'm no longer employed there but that was for telling my supervisers to 'kiss my ass' on a write up. /wave Sobes<br>
