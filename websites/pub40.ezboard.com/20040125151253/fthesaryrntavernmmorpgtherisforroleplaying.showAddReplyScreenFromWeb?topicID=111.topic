<br>
My Husband has been called away on yet another mission for the peoples of the West.  His parents and <br>
mine are as uncaring for our families needs as ever.  I know in my heart of hearts that Gavin is one of the few men in the West that can succeed in these missions.  His talent for diplomacy, and his ability to command make him almost unique among our peoples.  But I do wish that his missions didn't carry him so far away, and for so long.  The winter nights are very long this year it seems and the cold bites with steel in its teeth.  In all my years living in the Hills of Qeynos never have I known such bitter cold.  My child is restless in my whom, and I pray to Radcet daily for my beloved, and his safe return.  Oh how I miss you Gavin.  I pray to the Healer, and to the Tribunal for your safe return before our son arrives.<br>

High Keep: The Winter of the Vox<br>
  I looked down on the dark forest of Kithicor from the Ramparts of High Keep once again.  As I looked into the foggy gloom of the wood I forgot the insulting indifference of the High King to the Halas delegation.  Shalia would always pop into my mind with her wry smile, and impish nature when I was in such a mood but for some reason my ghostly self appointed guardian decided to leave me be on this night.  I found that a bit odd, but in my reasoning I figured it was due to my proximity to the Vale, the land of her birth.  <br>
  The night air was heavy with fog, and bitter with Cold.  The cold was unlike that of my home in the Tundra; it was of an evil fetid nature that clings to all it touches.  I was chilled to the bone beneath my bearskins, and armor.  There was more to this chill then temperature.  There was malice, and loathing.  A loathing I have felt before, and knew to be from evil the rotting hatred the dead held for the living.  My father in law had said to me that there was something very wrong in the stars.  A dark time was upon us, and the balance to all things had been swayed.  He told me that the stars that represent Inoruuk were moving into Mar, and Tanare.  War was coming.<br>
  There was a sudden screech from the wood below that brought my attention back to the moment as I stood there on the ramparts followed by a feint sound.  &quot;Thruum Thruum Thruum  OoooooooooOOooooooooo Thrum Thrum Thrummm Thrumm&quot; came the sound ever increasing in its intensity.  I was not alone in hearing it.  The guard posted in the tower to my left on the ramparts ran toward me, and halted at my side.  The sound was drawing closer now, and a strange howl was mixed in with it.  But the Howl was dull, and coming for our rear.  The guard ran back to his post and began sounding his alarm.  For all the arrogance, and indifference of the King of Antonica I could not argue with the efficiency of the High Keep Guards.  These were the elite of Human Infantry.  Not even the Guard force of Antonious Bale was it's equal in Martial prowess.  The fog below concealed the source of the sound from us on the ramparts, but it was becoming more, and more obvious that it was a moving army.  That Army was approaching the Gates of the lower pass.  <br>
  The captain of the watch raced up the steps to the Tower to my left.  Hot on his heals were the on duty guard force for the eastern ramparts.  The troops of High Keep were alert......<br>

I could hear the War Horns of the Knights of Thunder scream in the Winter Night as the first pain of my coming child hit me.  Gavin's protector stood at the foot of my bed as I let loose another scream.  There was something wrong, and we both knew it.  She looked at me nervously and then disappeared.  I heard another War horn break the silence of the night. This one was deeper in pitch, and came from the north.  My baby moved again, and I could feel the flesh tare....I screamed then all was black.<br>

<br>
My Halas companions joined me on the wall as the first elements of the approaching Army arrived at the lower pass.  My suspicions were correct.  The Sharlok Orcs had assembled an Army.  From the Western side of the pass I was told that a Gnollish Army was approaching as well.  My Farther in Law had read the stars well.  War had begun this dark frigid day.  The Winter of the Vox would be the season to end peace on Norath.  The gods of Chaos had taken advantage of Innoruk's move on Tanare, and launched a full-scale attack.  Then it struck me.  The Vox was awake in her lair.  I had to get home.  I ran from the ramparts at full speed and was met at the bottom of the wall by Shalia.  My Ghostly friend looked afraid.  <br>
&quot;You must get home Gavin, she needs you&quot;<br>
She then disappeared.  <br>
Angus and I gathered our men, and prepared for the long road ahead. We knew that we would have to fight our way through an Army of Gnolls unless we could find a way to get around them.  <br>
  In our rooms in the lower keep we were surprised to find that our ambassador to the High Keep Court waiting for us.  I was even more surprised that he was joined by the King of Antonica.   Clancy Mackalroy introduced the August monarch of the Anonicas to or party and brought us up to date on the plans of the High Keep Royal Guard.  He was also in contact with Antonious Bale, and my parents.  The Vox was awake, and stirring in her lair.  I was ordered back to Qeynos at best possible speed to assemble the Wolves of the North.  We had to prepare for the Vox, and her minions.......<br>

I awoke to the screaming of a child.  I no longer felt my baby within me.  My Father stood at the foot of my bed.  To his side stood Gavin's mother and the Ghost of Shalia now whole again.  She was holding Ardin in her arms.  I was amazed, once I looked upon my son for the first time.  I knew his name before I spoke it, but yet. I never thought of it before.  He looked at me with big brown eyes.  He was beautiful.  My baby was beautiful........<br>

<br>
 Captain Cranston of the Royal Guards escorted my men to the western ramparts.  There at the gates stood a troop of the Antonican Royal Cavalry.  <br>
&quot;My men are going to make a hole for ya boys.  I understand that you Halas shaman can run like Wolves.  Well, ya better be telling the truth.  My men are only going to hit um once.  Make a hole, and retreat.&quot; Colonel Williamson told us.  <br>
&quot;Don'tcha worry about us lad, we'll be a running faster then those nags yourr boys be sittin on.  Besides that lad, we will no be using that hole.  We're going into the lower pass from the ramparts.&quot;  Clancy Mcloia exclaimed to the Col.  &quot;I'll be passin the blessin's of the Tribunal on yer horses, and men ifen there are no objections, we have another way aroun da Gnolls. We'll only be needing a distraction&quot;<br>
 With that a pair of Bards joined our group.  One was the Famous Dumire of Freeport.  I had never met the young half elf but I had heard of some of his exploits in the East.  I was relieved that we would be able to travel through the Gnolls with these amazing musicians.  It was said that they could lift a crowd off their feet, and move them faster then the fastest of Horses.<br>
  &quot;Col. Williamson, please do not risk your men anymore then necessary, we only need a brief distraction while we descend into the pass.  The bards will cover us with their songs and speed us by the Gnolls.&quot; I told the Colonel.<br>
&quot;Well, we'll just take out their point then.  There isn't a lot of room on the pass for us to maneuver so will charge, wheel, and retreat to the Keep.  Good luck to you all. If the Vox is awake like they say, the Western lands will need it.&quot; The Colonel turned his charger back to his awaiting troopers, and prepared for our signal.<br>

<br>
  I held my son close to me as Shalia led me through the Blizzard to the safety of Qeynos.  My Father, and Mother in Law were close by, and had cast spells of protection and speed to insure our safety along the journey.  In normal times it was a peaceful, and scenic ride to the city.  But on this bitter night the winds were as sharp as a Halberd blade.  Ardin slept despite the goings on around him.   He was warm against my breast.  I found it odd that he seemed to be humming in his sleep as well.  A babe of only a few days, and yet he seemed to already know the ways of tune.  Reanen, my mother in law had cast auguries at Ardin's birth and said that he was touched by the healer, and would know the healing arts in the form of music.  She said his destiny was marked with Silver, and Black auguries.  She said that normally this was a sign of balance but in Ardin's case the Silver was faded.  Reanen was not sure of the significance, but my father was clearly shaken.  He made the sign of the healer, and blessed Ardin.  He then left the cottage to speak with Shalia, and Bandle MacGregor of the Wolves of the North.  <br>
 Bandle had been sent to guard us on our journey to the protection of Qeynos.  The High Chief of the Halas Clans did not want anything to happen to Heir of the Wolf Guard was his only message as he silently took up station outside our door. <br>
  He now stood near me as made our way to the Great Western City.  Shalia was to my left.  She looked at me nervously, and then broke into a trot.  She disappeared into the night Bandle stopped me, and shooed me to his rear.  My Father had a spell on his lips, and Reanen held her spear aloft.  Someone was approaching.  I could hear growling, and snarling as the thing approached.  Bandle drew his massive battle-axe, and brought it down in fell swoop that was interrupted by a sickening squish.  I turned away from the figure that was slumped face first on the ground.  It was a goblin sure, but it was a mere whelp.  More were surely about.  Shalia returned, and warned us if a Patrol of Gnolls passing near us from the Black Burrow Clan.  Our problem was detection.  Father said that there was no way we could let my child fall into the hands of the Vox.  I read some of the auguries as well. She came for him.  My son was the chosen.<br>
<br>
From the Halas Archives.  Tome VII: The Wolfguard<br>
<br>
Two Antonican Bards of note joined the Halas men at the top of the pass.  One, the famous Dumire of Freeport, and the other was a lass named Firestryke from the far away city of Kelethin.  As the bards prepared their songs of travel, and stealth the Antonican Cavalry prepared themselves as massive ballistas, and legions of Archers let loose a deadly rain of missiles on the Gnolls crowding the pass.  The Wolfguard moved the party of Halas warriors, Shaman, and the 2 bards to the Gates. Colonel Williamson gave a signal to the Gatesman, and saluted the officer of the Watch.  The Antonicans were ready.  The officer of the watch gave a silent signal for the Archers and Balista crews to cease-fire.  At that same moment the enormous lower gates flung open.  <br>
  The noise was deafening in the pass as the screams of thousands of the dog like creatures howled and whined as missile after missile penetrated their ranks and left avenues of dead among them.  Then with no warning the gates of the lower pass sprang open and to their horror out poured the renowned Antonican Cavalry with lances lowered.  The huge chargers mowed down the Gnolls like grass.  The lead Gnolls flung themselves from the cliffs in waves to avoid the lances of the Antonicans.  Gavin gave the signal to his party once he seen that the Gnolls were fully engaged with the Cavalry, and the bards launched the party into the pass.  The Halas men gave each other looks of surprise and wonder as the bards with their magical tunes launched the small but hearty band into the air with incredible speed.  It was not long until the party was passing the supply trains of the Gnoll Army that stretched all the way into Eastern Karana.  The sounds of the Battle had long faded as the Party approached the massive West Gate Bridge that spanned the Karana River....<br>
  In the pass Colonel Williamson signaled his bugler to sound the withdraw.  The Antonicans wheeled at the sound of the buglers.  The Antonican losses were light at best.  Only 3 troopers lost in the charge.  The Gnolls did not fair as well.  Their dead littered the pass, and the cavern below.  As the chargers reentered the Gates the Gnolls began to recover from the shock of what just occurred, and began to Howl.  The Gnollish Shamans, and Chieftains checked those that attempted to flee with brutal force.  The tactics worked as the Gnolls recovered from their losses and counter attacked the gates.......<br>
 <br>
From the Diary of Gavin Macalister<br>
<br>
As we passed the Gnollish supply trains I could see the roadside was littered with the corpses of all that stood in the path of this ghastly host of canines.  The bodies were of all races, ages and genders.  I was mortified at the brutality of these beasts.  I willed the fire down from within me.  I felt it reach up from the depths of my soul at the injustice sprawled on the grounds below us.  The bards beat their rhythms with masterful skill as we flew on.  It was just as we were in sight of the Great Western Bridge that I saw a small party of Teir'dal battling for their lives against a large scouting party of Gnolls below us.   Despite the race of defenders, I could not allow another being be torn apart by this monsters.  I signaled to Angus who was running at my side, and I dove down into the Fray.  I caught the Gnolls by surprise as I brought The Langseax of the Wolves down on these foul beasts.  The Gnolls could not bear us for long as Angus and the others joined me.  We were of little help to the party of Teir'dal however.  The small band was all but slain.  A young dark elf woman held a bundle close to her breast as she lay bleeding on the ground before several slain Gnolls.  She was barley alive, and I could see that her wounds were mortal.  The looked upon me with desperate fear as she clutched her babe with one arm, and fought with her impending fate to wield a dagger with the other.  I sheathed my great sword and kneeled close to the dying woman. &quot; Fear me not, woman on the Drow&quot; I said to her in Elvish.  &quot;You are mortally wounded, I would not harm such a one save to ease your pain&quot;<br>
  &quot;You are the enemy of my race Barbarian, yet you would grant mercy to me and my child?&quot;  She looked through her pain as she spoke her words with what remaining strength she possessed.  <br>
&quot;There is no honor in harming the wounded dark lady, if you ask I will make your end quick to save your suffering.  Otherwise you will receive no harm from me or my allies.&quot;<br>
  She dropped her dagger, and clutched my hand then.  Her babe whined in her arms and then peeked its head from the bundle.  That is the first time I laid eyes on Morteux. <br>
  One of our Shamans gave her a fast potion to ease her pain.  The young mother looked at me with eyes barely open and brimming with tears.  She spoke again softly this time.  I could tell that the end was near.  &quot;Please noble sir.  Care for my child.  Let him know that his mother loved him, and died bringing him to the light of Tanare.&quot; <br>
 I was shocked.  Here, a Teir'dal woman praising Tanare with her finale breath and asking me to care for her child.   If it were not for a dying woman's last wish I would have thought it Drow trickery.  But she then proved without a doubt that she spoke the truth.  As she handed the babe up to me, she also handed me 2 symbols.  One of the all mother, and the other of the healer. A parchment was attached to the symbols as well.  It was an introduction, and a promise of refuge written in my father in law's hand.  It was addressed to Antonious Bale.  I drew my great sword, and kneeled again before the dying woman.  I held the babe close to my breast and swore to him, and to this brave woman that I would defend him until the day I should be called home.<br>

<br>
The small party reached the gates of Qeynos at last.  The winter winds blasted the guardsmen as they watched the party bent before the gale approach them. Bandle MacGregor stood before the party and announced them to the Qeynos Guards.   The Guards huddled close to the braziers with their great cloaks held tightly about them squinted into the storm to see the small band.  &quot;Advance to be recognized!&quot; The guard shouted down to the great Halas warrior.   The party moved forward into the light of the braziers.  The guards seeing the that party contained several women, and the Great Wizard of the Qeynos casters guild sent out a platoon of infantry to escort them through the gates.  Upon entering the Great Western City of Qeynos the party was met by Antoniuos Bale, and several other dignitaries.  &quot;Welcome home Ariana, and welcome to the world of Norath Ardin of the Macalister Clan and welcome all who attend thee.&quot;  The Grand Duke looked down at the bundled babe in the arms of his mother, and then looked into her eyes. &quot;You have a great burden Arianna, we will do all to assist you in your families quest.&quot;  <br>
&quot;I thank you for your kindness your Grace.  We only seek shelter from the storm for the time being.  I must arrange a suitable nanny for my son, and prepare for the emergence of this winter's terror.&quot; Arianna replied to the Grand Duke as his attendants ushered the party toward the Palace.<br>
&quot;Your Grace, with your permission I would ask for an audience to confer on the upcoming events.  We must prepare for her.  She will be emerging with in the next few days.&quot;  Bastin had a look of great concern, and worry upon his face.  The stars were increasing in speed as the constellations circled one another.  The Vox and her sisters would not stay a ground for much longer.  Soon the earth would spit up these vile Creatures, and their minions.  It was only a matter of days before all of Norath would feel the Fury of Chaos, and war...<br>

<br>
 After we buried the remains of the Teir'dal party we started out again.  The Bard Dunmire fashioned a harness for the babe Teir'dal that was now my adopted son it would appear.  I placed the child in the harness that slung from my neck and shoulders.  Once the youth was secure he reached up from his new place and pulled on my whiskers.  I looked down at the lad no slung from my neck.  He smiled at me, and it seemed that his tiny ears emitted a soft blue light.  His eyes, black as coal also seemed to emit a soft but dark light.  I sensed no evil from this child.  It was clear that these Drow were unlike the ones that I had battled in the forests of Feydark so many years ago.  There was warmth coming from my chest now that the child settled in to sleep.  I could not remove my eyes from this amazing package. Not even as the bards once again played the rhythms of travel that would carry us the rest of the way to western lands....<br>
<br>
From the Diary of Arianna Macalister:<br>
<br>
We reached our lodgings in the palace finally.  Ardin was tired, and looking for his evening meal.  I settled to nurse my new son as a knock came to my chamber's door.  &quot;Mistress Macalister, I am the nanny that you have sent for.&quot; Came the call from the other side of the door.  Bandle was in the adjoining room-standing guard rushed into the room as he heard the knock.  He stood by the door, and looked at me for instructions. <br>
I nodded to him to allow the visitor to enter, and was slightly alarmed as the great warrior drew his blades and stood back from the door as he opened it.  The young maid was frieneted half out of her wits at the site of one of Halas's great guardians standing before her with weapons drew, and prepared for battle.  She screamed and caused poor Ardin to cry.  Just then Reanen, my mother in law appeared at the door, and brought the young maid into the room. &quot;Don't be a fearin a that big oaf lass.  He's as a bout dumb as they come&quot; Reanen shot a kidding smile at the Great warrior as she brought Lasia Oline into the room. <br>
&quot;That hurts mum&quot; The noble guardian said looking back at my mother in law with a painful look.<br>
Reanen was a commanding, presence to all the knew her.  Reanen was probably one of the most beautiful women I have ever met.   Something that often intimidated both men, and woman of Qeynos.  She was huge as all people of the Northlands are.  She was also an extremely powerful shaman of the 55th circle.<br>
I loved her dearly though. Her warmth only surpassed her power, and she doted on her daughter in law at every opportunity.<br>
 Lasia was young Erudite apprentice of my father, and was known for her ability to care for children.  She was also perfect for the job considering that she was also a Magician of the 30th circle, and commanded powerful servants to guard Ardin.  I was becoming spoiled at the comfort of my suit in the palace, and the amount of attention I received from the servants that were assigned to me.  If it were not for the impending chaos, I think I could probably get used to this sort of living.  Although I must admit that I missed the warm hearth of our Cottage on the Western Sea, and sound of the surf in the morning.  Gavin built the cottage with his own two hands, and it was wonderful.  Oh how I miss my husband.....<br>
<br>
From the Diary of Gavin Macalister:<br>
<br>
The journey now was hardly noticed by me.  I ran along with my companions with hardly a thought to the direction, or to my surroundings.  My new son I found myself thinking, was all I could pay attention too.  Petra Wulfenberg ran along side me now, and Angus moved to my usual spot at the lead of our little formation.  Petra was one of the Shamans that started this journey with us, and was one our more fanatical zealots.  She protested my new son's presence at first, and all but demanded that child be put to death.  But once she looked upon him, all her hatred for the Teir'dal child faded.  It was as if he had some spell upon him that caused all around him to instantly fall in love with him.  Dunmire said that he was touched by the gods.  But he couldn't say which ones.  He was sure that it wasn't the patron of the Teir'dal however.  Petra refused to cast auguries until we arrived at Qeynos, and I agreed.  There would be time for that later.<br>
<br>
We arrived at the gates of Qeynos early in the morning the following day.  We could see the smoke on the northern horizon of the battles that took place in our absence, and many of my Clansmen parted our company to join our brothers and sisters to fend off the minions of the Vox.  We were greeted at the gates by my father in law who already knew what I was carrying.  He ushered us to the alters of the priests of life so that they could baptize the Teir'dal infant in the waters of the healer.  I was amazed that these sworn enemies of Innoruuk were taking this dark elf in the home of the healer and handling him as if he were their most sacred possession.  The high priest looked at me, and he most have sensed my confusion because he came over to explain.  <br>
&quot;Wolfguard, this child is the chosen apostle of Radcet Nife.  He has blessed this infant so that he can be the Healer's minion among those that would shun the light and bring darkness upon us all.  We have waited many years for this time.  It is the beginning, and the end of all things.  You have been chosen by the Tribunal to raise 2 of the Chosen.  The sacrifice, and the apostle.  Your children will be the first in a line of Avatars that will either deliver us all to the light, or to the void.  It is in your hands Wolfguard.&quot;<br>
All I could think was &quot;Why me?&quot;  <br>
From the Diary of Arianna Macalister:<br>
<br>
At first I was angry. I wanted to blast the stupid Barbarian out of his boots for bringing a Teir'dal in my rooms, and then to lay him in the same crib as Ardin!?. I was so mad I almost feinted. It is a good thing that my father was there. He knew I was on the verge of leveling all of Qeynos, and had the good sense to remind me that we were the pawns of the gods. We must all do our part in order to bring about what was right, and just for the peoples of Norath. <br>
Once my anger subsided, I was able to look into the crib that contained our sons. That thought shocked me. I realized that I had said in my mind. &quot;Our sons.&quot; Gavin wrapped those massive cuddly arms around me, and we both wept at the sight of our sons sleeping in their cradle.<br>
&quot;You have been away to long my husband&quot; I said to him. <br>
&quot;I have never been away beloved, nor will I ever. You are always in my heart where ever I go.&quot; I turned into my Husband and kissed him. What happened next is none of your business.<br>
<br>
The Next morning, the sun was shinning brightly in our rooms, and the children were laughing in their crib. Gavin was still sleeping, so I slipped out of bed and padded across the room to stoke the fire. There was a chill in the air, and I noticed that there was fresh snow on the balcony. For the moment Qeynos was quiet and one could almost believe that this was just another quiet winter. I did not want to spoil this time with thoughts of the war that was raging not 20 miles to the north, or of the terrible beast that was awake in her lair. I only wanted to look upon our sons. Ardin and Mortuex were a strange pair. Ardin's skin was almost the exact opposite of Mort's bluish black shade. They did not notice though. They were playing with some of the toys that were brought in by the Grand Duke's servants. &quot;Gifts for the chosen&quot; he had said. Now I know what he had meant. My father had briefed him on the prophecy. I reminded myself to speak with my father at length about briefing his daughter about such things. But that would come later. It was time to give the boys their breakfast. I called to Lasia in the next room. We left Gavin snoring contently. As we shut the door behind us….. <br>

From the Halas Archives Tomb VII: The Wolfguard<br>
<br>
The Wolfguard had little time to spend in reunion with is family. The brothers Macalister were fast asleep in their cradle when a knock came to the chambers of Gavin and Arianna the night after his party arrived in Qeynos. Gavin opened the door to find Bandle holding an anxious Surefall Glade Ranger of Karana at arms length as he attempted to deliver his message. Gavin placed his hand on his old friend's shoulder as a sign to let the young man speak. <br>
&quot;Wolfguard, I bring news from High Hold. The Split paws have joined with the Mucktails, and are now in route to Qeynos with an army of Runnyeye, and Pickclaw Goblins supporting them.&quot; The young ranger was clearly exhausted and probably killed a dozen horses getting this message here in time for the Qeynos garrison to react. &quot; Has the Grand Duke been informed?&quot; Gavin asked the young scout. &quot;Aye my lord. One of my commrades is delivering the massage as we speak. There are also Rangers route to Halas, Surefall Glade, and to Eurdin. &quot;Have you seen the Army?&quot; Arianna asked as she came to the door behind her husband. &quot;Aye my lady, I have. It is a massive host. There must be a hundred thousand beasts heading this way. The roads are choked with the Antonican Farmers escaping the ranging host. <br>
&quot;Arianna, have Lasia watch the boys. We have to collect your father and go see the Grand Duke.&quot; Just then the entire castle shuddered with a roar. Gavin rushed to the window and could see a great white shape passing over head. The beast was on the hunt. &quot;GET THE BOYS TO THE CELLER&quot; Gavin shouted as he rushed for his armor, and weapons…Bandle crashed into the room and swept up the boys in one arm, and Arianna in the other and rushed out the door again. The Qeynos guards in the hall joined the great Halas warrior that was assigned to protect the chosen ones and joined him on his flight. Inside the rooms Gavin was finishing the last straps on his breastplate when the balcony window blew inward with a burst of frost. Gavin was knocked back off his feet and could barely see the face of the Vox as she breathed in for another bellow. Just then as Gavin began to recover, Lasia shrieked at the great white dragon and let loose a bolt of fire at its face. The dragon blinked for a second and seemed to smile at the erudite mage. Lasia was in the process of summoning when the Evil Lady responded. Lasia seemed to be frozen in time as she was struck by a column of ice that reached to the ceiling of the rooms. Gavin finally recovered and charged. As the great warrior broke through the remains of the balcony door there was a great sound of Lighting as the air around the dragon flashed. She winced at the spell that was cast by some unseen powerful wizard. Just then Gavin struck the beast across the snout with the Langseax of the Wolves leaving a great gash. Icey blue blood spilled forth covering the Wolfguard as yet another crash of lighting struck the great beast. The Vox wheeled, and ascended away from the spells and the massive blade of the Northman. Her wings beat over the castle and created a hurricane of snow that further blinded Gavin…the Wolfguard stumbled as he tried to maintain his balance in the gale force winds. Once the Vox was aloft she shouted down.. &quot;This night I give to you Macalisters, but you shall feel my wrath Arianna, and you Wolfguard will burn in my pits for the mark you have left upon me.&quot; She great lady turned north and was gone. Gavin once again rushed out to the balcony to track the Dragons heading. She was heading back to her lair. Gavin turned to the nanny that so lovingly cared for his sons, and was the companion of his wife. She lay horribly burned on the floor in a lifeless heap. Arianna and Bastin floated down to he balcony accompanied by several other casters from the Qeynos Casters Guild. They had pirched themselves on the rooftops of the castle and were responsible for the massive lighting strikes that finally warded off the great dragon. Arianna shreiked at the sight of her friend and rushed to see if there was anything that could be done, but it was clearly to late for the brave Eurdite woman. She had been called home to her maker.<br>
Antonius Bale, accompanied by his personal guard also entered the rooms. <br>
&quot;Well Gavin, I must say that your family have a way of bringing excitement to a man's life. I haven't seen this much excitement in the city since your return from the Faydark war.&quot; The Grand Duke smiled at Gavin as he spoke. The Grand Duke knew that this was not of Gavin's choosing. If it were up to him, he would be back at his cottage with his wife and children living in peace. He also knew that all in the room were affected by this man's destiny. It was in his interest and that of all the peoples of the west to relie on his decisions. The Wolfguard was a brave and intelligent man. If there were ever a man that could lead the Western lands to Victory it was the Wolfguard of Halas. <br>
&quot;Gavin, we have been mustering and training the Antonican militia, as well as boosting the ranks of the cavalry. If the Eurdins get here with their Knights and Casters and with the arrival of the Halas infantry I think we will be prepared to face the host coming down the pass. Put I do not think we will be able to withstand both Forces. The Icy Goblins have recruited the Orcs as well as the Blackburrow gnolls. The forces of the Vox are weaker, but they sit firmly between Halas, and Qeynos.&quot; <br>
&quot;Aye my lord. I have a plan for that.&quot; The Antonican Cavalry has not been used against the northern horde as yet. The Blackburrow gnolls are a poorly led force. And if we can keep the Vox in her lair then the Goblins will break. What's more there are not enough Orcs in Everfrost to pose a real threat. If we strike them quickly, and dispatch a large force of heroes to the entrance to the Vox's Lair I think we can drive back her forces and contain them while we face the Eastern Host. It all depends on the Eurdins though. If they refuse to commit, then we will not have enough to fight this 2 front war.&quot; Gavin finished with a look of concern on his face. The indifference to mainland trouble has always been a sore spot in Antonican, and Eurdin relations. The Eurdites felt that they were above such problems and almost never intervened.<br>
&quot;Leave them to me Gavin. I think that if I tell them that there will be no more income from the mainland because of the sevear decline in customers, the Eurdin Merchants will make all the demands for intervention we need.&quot; The prince smirked at the thought of telling the pompous Erudite ambassador that all his wealth from his caravans will soon be lost.  The merchants of Eurdin all paid him a healthy tribute for his services.  The fat old cur would flee screaming and call every knight, and caster to defend his income..... <br>
<br>
From The Qeynos Archives Tome CXXVII:  The Battle of Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
The Arch Duke had been correct in his estimation of the fat Eurdin Ambassador.  His greed out weighed his indifference to western Antonican affairs.  Once the Arch Duke explained that all trade with the isle of Eurdin would be suspended until the hostilities on the continent could be dealt with, the Eurdin ambassador dispatch 4 curriers to the isle pleading for the intervention of the Knights, and magic users of the Eurdin crown.<br>
  The forces of Eurdin began to arrive by the shipload the following week.  With the new reinforcements from Eurdin, Gavin began to deploy his forces along the passes into Qeynos hills.  At his back were elements of Halas infantry, Antonican Cavalry from Qeynos, the Steel Warriors, The Knights of Thunder, The Paladins of the Eurdin isle with their support units of magic users and healers, as well as a large contingent of scouts from the White Rose.   The northern forces of the Vox were weak and poorly lead.  The Vox herself was trapped in her lair by a large party of heroes from Greater Feydark, as well as Antonica.  The Party lead by Arianna, Bastin, and Gavin’s parents entered the Citadel of Permafrost by stealth and managed to lay siege to the Great Dragon in her own lair.  Seeing her impending fate she fled to the lair of her sister in the pits of the Lava Storm Mountains.<br>
  Once the dragon was gone the Forces from Halas fell on the Gnolls, Goblins and orcs from the north, and the Qeynos forces led by Gavin attacked from the south.  The Split paw Generals that commanded the combined forces of the Vox were forced to flee the battlefield as the Knights and Heavy infantry of the Combined armies ground their forces into dust.  <br>
  After the northern threat was eliminated, Arianna returned to the cottage on the western sea with her sons while Gavin moved his Armies to the eastern passes of Qeynos Hills.  <br>
<br>
<br>
From the Diary of Arianna Macalister:<br>
<br>
  My father and I, with the help of many friends were able to flush out that white scaled bitch.  She tried again to steal away my sons, she failed.  Gavin and I had little time together as usual.  The Arch Duke and the High Chiefs called upon him to lead the Allied Armies to the eastern pass to prepare for the Muck tail horde coming down the pass from High Hold. <br>
  The winter is still in full swing and another moon has waned since that dreadful flight from the cottage in the teeth of a blizzard.  Ardin and Morteux are both asleep with Shalia standing watch over the cradle.  Since the Northern horde was destroyed Bandl returned to his infantry command with the Wolves of the North.  The cottage is warm, and we have plenty of wood for the fire and provisions since Gavin stopped by to stock up on our supplies and firewood before he left for the pass.  It’s late.  I think I will get some rest.<br>
  <br>
I awoke in a field of soft grass touched with silver drops of due.  The Sky was deep blue with soft cotton buffs touching the sky.  I felt warm and relaxed as I arose from my slumber.  Before me there was a basket of fresh fruit, and lightly spiced mead to break my fast.  As I sat in the meadow and looked out toward the light rolling hills to the east, I realized that I must have been dreaming.  I also realized that I had never been to this place before.  It was so peaceful.  Even the animals seemed docile to the point of domestic tranquility.  After I finished my breakfast I stood up and started out toward the hills to see if I could find out where this I had been taken.  I passed a crystal clear brook while traveling and stopped to bathe.  As I stood putting on my clothes a woman approached with towels and a brush for my hair.  “Good morning Arianna, hast thou slept well?” she said as she hung the towel on a near by branch.  “Yes, thank you.” I replied wondering how this woman knew my name.  She was strikingly beautiful with golden hair and deep blue eyes that matched the sky.  She was plainly dressed in an earth brown dress that was common among the farms throughout Norath, but she carried herself with a silent regalness that bespoke of a much more complex personality then that of a mere peasant.   <br>
  “Once thou hast dressed, I will assist you with your hair my sister.” She said continuing in a formal speech.  <br>
“Excuse me my lady, but I do not know who you are.  May I know your name?” I asked as I began to dress. <br>
  “I am the woman thy husband avenged in the forests of the fey.  My name is Elanna of the House of Firona.” She replied.    <br>
  I noticed as she approached to help me with my hair that she was a High Elven woman.  She kneeled beside me and began to use slow strokes as she brushed out my hair.  She hummed and ancient Elven loves song that I had not heard for since I was a child.<br>
“Elanna, why have I been brought here, and where is here?”  I asked her.  She stopped humming; “Thou hast been summoned by the all mother and the healer.  You are in the Glade of Tunare.”  <br>
 I suppressed the urge to ask why I was summoned.  I remembered the Auguries that my mother in law cast at Ardin’s birth, as well as the prophecies of the Norathian Oracles.<br>
  Elanna finished with my hair and stood up.  “Art thou prepared to meet thy mother, and father so that they may divulge certain truths onto thee?”<br>
“I am.” I replied simply.  Elanna lead me along a soft loam trail through the trees that opened into a small meadow.  Seated in the meadow was a small woman chatting idly with an Armored Cleric of Radcet Nife.  As we approached the odd pair they both stood and faced us.  The cleric bowed low to me and said: “Welcome to the mother of the Light and of the Sacrifice” The woman also honored me in much the same way.  The cleric beckoned me to be seated on the blanket that was laid out on the grass.<br>
“My daughter” the small woman began.  It has finally come to pass when the prophecy which guides us all shall bring about certain events.  Know dearest daughter that I do not assign the task that I am about to place upon thee lightly.  My son Radcet, and I have discussed this sorrowful deed over and over and we were unable to see an alternative.”  As the woman whom I assumed to be Tunare spoke to me I became ever fearful for my sons.  I had a building feeling of dread and loss as the all mother continued to speak.  <br>
“One of thy family will be rested from the earth. Which one is not clear.  Know that thine Husband, and one of thy sons will be safe.  The future for thee, and thy other son is not clear.  You will need to make a choice revered daughter.  That choice may cost you the life of thee, or thine issue.”   I turned to the cleric who stood before me.  “Is this the way father?”  I asked.  “All though it wrings my heart dearest daughter.”<br>
  “If this to be, then I must prepare.  If it please you mother, and you Father, I shall return to my cottage and look after my sons.”<br>
  “Be well daughter, and trust in the guardian, for she will alert you when thy task is impending”<br>
I awoke in the Cottage to the sound of the babies crying in the next room.  Shalia stood at my bed holding my robe for me.  “Ya better get up mistress.  They sound hungry.”  The little woman exclaimed with a warm smile.  I went into the nursery and began to nurse my sons as Shalia stoked the fire that had been banked for the night.  The light of the early morning began to shine in the windows, but it was a dull light of yet another cold and overcast day.  Shalia scampered about the cottage cleaning and opening the curtains to let in what little light the sun was able to force through the interminable cloud cover that seems to have covered Norath for the last several months.  I finished nursing, and placed Ardin and Mort in their crib and went into the kitchen to help Shalia to prepare some breakfast.  <br>
  “How did ya like the grove me lady?” Shalia asked.  I wasn’t prepared for her question, and was a bit startled.  Although I should have realized that the ghostly self-appointed guardian of my sons and husband would know the will of the gods.  She was a Ghost after all.  “It was very beautiful.  I have never known a place that felt so comfortable”<br>
 I replied to her.  “Aye, it is that.  I have lived there on and off since Gavin laid my earthly body to rest.  The all mother seems to always find something for me to do though.” she said with a playful smirk that was her trademark.  We continued through the day taking care of the many chores around the house and then settled in for the night after we put the babies to bed after their evening meal….. <br>

From The Qeynos Archives Tome CXXVII:  The Battle of Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
The Beast swept in from the North on silent wings and descended on the lone cottage on the western sea.  She flared her massive wings and sat facing the door.  The time of prophecy was about to begin.  Her impending triumph written on the white scaly traces of her massive face.  The two woman, one earthly, and one ghostly knew she was there.  Shalia warned Arianna of the beasts approach.  What the beast had not counted on was Arianna’s heart and courage.  Suddenly the door of the cottage burst forth in a cloud of flame and sparks as the Wizardess emerged.  Behind her stood the little thief with the infant boys cradled in her arms. <br>
 “STAND ASIDE WITCH WOMAN, THOU SHALL NOT WITHSTAND MY FURY!” the Vox bellowed at Arianna.  Arianna shielded by a magic barrier raised her hands toward the Dragon;  “LEAVE NOW IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE YOU OVERSIZE ALBINO BITCH!”  With that she unleashed a rain of fire that encompassed the great Dragon.  The Vox flinched back from the flames and inhaled deeply in preparation to unleash her furious breath upon the impudent Wizardess.  Shalia seeing the dragon begin to exhale bolted from the cottage to the south toward the city, she looked back to see Arianna casting yet another barrage of fire at the Dragon as the Vox enveloped her in her frosted fury.  Shalia knew she had little time.  Arianna had made her choice and stood before the beast in defiance.  She cast forth spell after spell of devastating flame, but the Vox was only wounded.  “YOU SHALL NOT ENDURE ME WITCH!  GIVE UP THIS FUTILE RESISTANCE AND SUBMIT THY SON UNTO ME AS IT IS ORDAINED!”<br>
  The Vox boomed at the seemingly tiny human woman that so defied the power of the greatest dragon in the entire world.<br>
  Arianna answered with Lightning.  She opened the clouds with bolt after bolt of blazing electricity causing the Vox to reel in pain.  The Vox rose up on her hind legs and let loose another torrent of frost that enveloped the defiant Wizardess yet again.  This time Arianna’s shield fell.  She gasped at the searing pain that brought her to her knees.  She looked back and could barely see Shalia as she fled with Arianna’s two sons toward Qeynos.  With Tears in her eyes she bade them goodbye, as then whispered her last kiss toward the east at her husband.  She then stood up facing the Great dragon yet again despite her crippling wounds.  She knew her fate.  Her choice, and her task complete.  She unleashed her finale fury of lightning against the great beast.  The Vox felt the lighting searing her relentlessly, the pain was intense but she would not be denied her prize.  Limping with a shattered leg and with gaping holes in her right wing she bellowed a finale time.  This time Arianna was washed away in the blazing fury of the torrent of frost.  Her shattered body slammed limply with a sickening thud against the remains of the cottage.  Her task complete she lay still, unmoving and cold.  The Vox sniffed at her body with a weary nudge of her head.  She turned toward the fleeing halfling, but knew that she was to close to the city for her to pursue.  She was denied after all.  Her only solace was the fact that Arianna lay cold at her feet.  She rose, and lifted into the air limping north to her now shattered lair.  She would tend her wounds and return to claim her prize…… <br>

<br>
The now substantial ghost of Shalia approached the gates of Qeynos at a winded sprint.  Clinging to her breast was the issue of Tekin Thantos, and Gavin Macalister. Both boys now sons of the same man, one natural and one adopted after he saved the infant Teir’dal from the clutches of a marauding band of Muck tail Gnolls.  “OPEN THE GATES, The Guardian Approaches!” shouted the Arch Duke as he paced the walls of the City.  The Priests of Life had warned him of the Dragon’s attack on the Cottage of Arianna and Gavin Macalister.  Feeling helpless, and frustrated at not being able to add the daughter of his close friend, the Arch Duke vowed that he would offer protection of the chosen sons of Macalister even if it cost him his life.  Keeping careful watch over Shalia as she entered the gates, Antonious had a company of Guards meet the Halfling woman as she entered.  The guards formed a protective circle around her, and escorted her with her charges to the Palace.  Once there, Antonious left instructions for his staff to have them quartered in the lower apartments of the palace under heavy guard. Three wet nurses were standing by waiting for Shalia as she entered the suite.  Shalia was nervous, but she gave up her charges to the nurses and surveyed the rooms with a careful eye.  Once she was satisfied that the rooms were secure, she finally relaxed but only to fall into a fit of weeping for the loss of Arianna.  She wanted to help desperately, but she knew that if she did Ardin, and Morteux would have been lost.  Shalia looked up to see several Priests of the Church of life enter rooms and take up positions at the door.  Among them were several Paladins fully armed incase of any attacks.  Shalia knew that her task was near completion.  Gavin was returning, Ardin and Morteux are safe.  It was time to rest.  Shalia fell onto the couch near the blazing fire and cried.  Her weeping raked her little body with the mournful loss of her closest friend.  She knew that Arianna was not completely gone, and she watched her ascend into the heavens after her spirit stopped to check on the boys.  But she still mourned her loss.  The boys would not know her.<br>
<br>
  “The chosen ones and their guardian are secure your Grace.” The Commander of the Guard reported to the Arch Duke as he continued to pace the ramparts.  “Has the force from the Church of life arrived in the apartment? The Arch Duke asked the Guardsmen.  “Aye my lord.  They are in the suite even now.  The Halfling woman has gone however.”<br>

From the Diary of Gavin Macalister<br>
<br>
The northern threat was soundly dispatched.  The northern horde presented little in the way of sport for the great Armies of Qeynos and Halas. The Splitpaw commanders were incompetent at best; the fools didn’t even bother to assume defensive postures when they saw that a vastly superior force surrounded them.  The just attacked until they had no one left to fight.  And then they died.  Once the grizzly slaughter was over we began our march south and were joined by Armies of Eurdin.  <br>
<br>
The next day we broke camp and headed south.  My forces were stretched out all the way to the villages of Halas as we passed through the deep ice valleys of my homeland.  Once we entered the northern reaches of Qeynos hills, I gave orders for my forces to continue south, and broke off from them and headed to the cottage. <br>
  Arianna, and Shalia were busy cleaning and cooking as I approached the house that I built for Arianna and I so many years ago.  Shalia noticing my approach dropped the straw broom that she was sweeping the front porch with and ran into the house.  She emerged with Arianna in tow just as I was tying off my roan stallion to the curb in front of the porch.  I picked up my two favorite women in a big embrace and kissed them soundly.  Shalia giggled as my whiskers tickled her nose as she always did.  Arianna was quick to point out that not only did I need a shave, but a bath too.  She didn’t even want to hear my excuse that I had been campaigning in the north for the last 2 months.  Her only reply was a look of impatience as she motioned toward the back room where I had built a bathing chamber for her.  I will admit here though.  I was a bit fragrant.  Armor is nice to have on during a battle, but it tends to leave you smelling much like an old iron kettle left out of doors for a season or two.  Not to mention the mixed in sweat, and barley cleaned leftovers of several battles that seems to be so unavoidable.  Needless to say, I did not put up much of a fight.  I was beginning to dread sleeping in the same bed with myself.<br>
  After I had washed, and shaved Arianna led me into the dinning room and rather proudly presented me with a feast fit for the Arch Duke.  I was stunned.  For all of Arianna’s intelligence, grace, and wit.   She could never cook worth a damn.  I had a feeling that she may have been either taking lessons, or she managed to find a spell to summon all the fine food that decorated our table.  My stomach told me to keep my quiet.<br>
  After feasting on the copious array of food we sat idly chatting by the fire as we always did during this time of year.  The boys were sleeping and Shalia was off doing what ever a ghost does at that time in the evening.  We retired and reacquainted our selves to one another, as husband and wife are apt to due after a long separation.<br>
  The next morning I reluctantly made my preparations to return to my command.  I awoke just before dawn as I usually do and slipped out of bed.  I set water to boil in the fireplace and stoked up the banked fire.  Then I went out to the stable to tend to my horse.  When I returned to the house Arianna was awake nursing our sons and Shalia was setting the table for Breakfast.  Despite the bitter cold of this unusual winter, the house was warm and comfortable.  It would not have taken much for Arianna to talk me into staying, but she knew as I did that I had to get back to the Army to set the preparations for the upcoming battle.  We ate our breakfast in silence dreading our impending separation. <br>
<br>
From The Qeynos Archives Tome CXXVII:  The Battle of Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
The Wolfguard having returned from his day’s leave with his wife inspected the earthworks that were under construction blocking off the pass into Qeynos Hills from the plains of Karana.  The Engineers of the western armies were hard at work breaking into the frozen earth and cutting long spikes for the approaches.  Archers, Infantry and Cavalry were everywhere tending to their equipment as the ever-watchful sergeants trooped the endless tents lining the hastily set up garrison behind the earthworks.   <br>
  “The horde is moving slowly across the Karana river Wolfguard, it will still be a few days before we will have to pull in our pickets.”  The commander of the Qeynos Cavalry reported to Gavin as he walked along the Earth-works inspecting the day’s progress.  “Very good Colonel.  Have your men rest for the rest of the afternoon. They will have much to do in the next few days.”  Gavin instructed the Colonel.  The Colonel saluted and turned to leave only to be replaced by another officer of the Army reporting on the supply trains, and then another officer followed her.  The day progressed in this fashion until late that evening.  The troops were sleeping huddled in their small tents and Sentries guarded the campfires and battlements.  <br>
  The next day was extremely bitter.  The temperature was still dropping when Gavin emerged from his tent just before sunrise.  He could hear the men groaning and stamping their feet as they slowly emerged into the frigid morning at the insistance of the many Sergeants of the Army barking orders.  The engineers were still hard at work though and could be heard struggling to finish off the battlements.  Oxen grunted as they struggled to tow the countless catapults, ballistas, and trebuchets into position.  Gavin was pleased that the Army had preformed so well over the last few months of endless campaigning.  They had little time to get to know one another, much less train in the combined arms strategies of the young general, but with several fresh victories over the Gnolls, orcs, and Goblins that manned the northern horde moral was extremely high despite the sever weather<br>
  Gavin again stood on the almost complete ramparts and looked across the forest of sharpened stakes that adorned the ramps leading up to the forward trenches.  The sun was just cresting the horizon when Shalia appeared before him.  “GET HOME GAVIN, She’s dieing!” was all the little woman said in half shrieking and half sobbing voice that was filled with fear and hopelessness all at the same time.  Gavin’s heart jumped in his chest as a hundred reasons appeared in his mind for the Halfling’s message.  Then it struck him. The Vox had returned. He could feel it.  He turned from the battlements and bolted to the stables.  His staff on his heels as he ran.  Once at the stables, he barked orders to his messengers to set the troops in the trenches, and order the Cavalry, to the north.  Then he mounted his already saddled horse, and started west at a dead run….<br>
<br>
The Following is an extrapolation of the various accounts and history’s surrounding the days during and just after the Battle of Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
The Wolfguard took only a day to reach the ruined cottage that he had built on the shores of the Western sea.  His horse near death, he leapt from the foaming beast sprinting the remaining yards to the ruins.  He found his mother Reannin of Halas, his Father, and his father in law the renown Bastin of Qeynos standing near a tribal bier that was erected to hold the remains of his wife, Arianna.  She had been covered in a burial shroud to hide the hideous wounds that were left on her body, but Gavin could tell that she died in immense pain.  His mind shrieked with fury, and of sadness.  Here lay the very center of his life, the mother of his son, and his soul mate.  He turned his face from the bier, drew his massive sword, and started north at a trot.  His father knew that there would be no way to stop the Warrior.  He was in the bezerker state that was common among the men of Halas.  So he trotted after his son.  Reannin also joined the warrior as well as Bastin of Qeynos.  As the quartet moved north at a brisk trot others joined them.  By the time the party reached the gates of Permafrost Citadel they had grown in number 10 fold.  Word had spread with astonishing speed.  Stouthearted heroes, and Heroines from all over Norath were now poised to do battle with the Great White Dragon of Permafrost.  Word of Arianna’s murder at the talons of the beast had inflamed the allies of the west.  <br>
  <br>
<br>
  During this time, the Gnollish hordes struck the forward defenses of the Western Armies.  In the trenches of the western army, battalions of Archers from Surefall Glade leapt up from their hiding places and released sheets of arrows at the charging host.  Howls of pain, and anguish were thundering as the forward ranks of the Gnollish soldiers melted away beneath the hale of yard long steel tipped arrows.  On the flanking cliff Antonious Bale surveyed the army that had been dubbed the forces of the Wolfguard.  Beneath him standing a top the command tent that sat in the middle of the fortifications, the white banner with the outline of a blue Wolf with it’s muzzle up turned in the howl of the Hunt snapped in the breeze.  The Wolfguard was not present, but the commanders of the Armies knew that he was on blood quest of vengeance and kept his colors flying in honor of his late wife.  His wife’s body lay shattered on the bier where the cottage once stood. She died valiantly defending her sons against certain death.  She succeeded in her task however.  She injured the great beast to the point that it was unable to pursue the ghostly protector of the chosen as she made her flight to the safety of Qeynos.  <br>
  <br>
  Wounded both in body, and mind the Vox fled to her now ruined lair.  She was certain that if she could rally her forces while the armies of the west were occupied by the hordes of the Splitpaw she could yet triumph.  She found her once confident generals cowering in the lower depths of the Citadel.  Yet enraged by her failure in the hills of Qeynos, adding to the rage that overcame her at the sight of these cowards, she let her breath rake them, and bellowed her orders for the Goblins, and Giants to protect the gates of the Citadel with their lives while she healed herself, and sent word to her sister of recent events.  She sat in her lair fuming as she cast her spells of healing on herself.  As she lingered on the verge of sleep, one of her Ice Giant priests approached.  He brought word that the Wolfguard was returning to the hills.  She fell asleep with a smile on her face at the thought of the pain she had caused the impudent Barbarian.  His Bitch of a wife had paid the ultimate price for her defiance.  <br>
<br>
  The horde recoiled from it's first attack as the forward elements were nearly destroyed by the unrelenting rain of deadly arrows.  Seeing the futility of a frontal assault, the Gnollish commanders brought forward captured siege engines and began raining large rocks on the Defenders as they huddled in their trenches.  The barbarian infantry raised their great shields above themselves, and as many other defenders as possible. The hail of rocks still took their toll.  Hundreds of men, half elves, and Eurdins fell beneath the terrible rain before a group of Wizards were able to destroy the enemy catapults with explosive balls of fire and ice.  From a top the cliffs the Arch duke ordered the hidden catapults and ballistas of Wolfguard’s army to release their own wrath upon the Gnolls.  He also gave orders for the knights and Antonican cavalry to begin their strikes from the flanks of the Horde.  <br>
  Without knowing that their flanks were about to be assaulted, the Gnollish shaman, with the help of many pickclaw wizards began sending huge waves of fire, and wind at the earthworks before them.  Their efforts were gaining ground as hundreds of the sharpened stakes were thrown into the air, or destroyed.  The wizards, mages, and enchanters of the western army, unable to stop the waves once they were created began to build a wall of ice before the earth works in an effort to shunt the terrible forces.  But just as soon as they started to gain ground a low rumble became audible from the south, and to the north.  The rumble increased in volume, and intensity as the first regiments of the Antonican Cavalry, and the thousands of Knights of the Orders of Thunder, Life, Truth, and Love crested the adjacent hills.  With shrieking horns, and thundering hooves the mounted forces of the western army crashed into the flanks of the horde.  Antonious Bale was awe struck at the spectacle before him.  The silvery clad Knights with their bright blooms were magnificent as they lowered their lances, and charged forward at the Gnolls.  Howls of fear and pain again thundered on the plain as the Gnolls lining the flanks of the horde were swept under the initial charges of the mounted assault.  Seizing this opportunity to deal a fatal blow to the Gnolls, the Arch Duke ordered the Halas infantry to charge.  The painted warriors of the North sprang forth from their trenches in waves.  As the Halas men left the trenches, they were replaced by the Arch Duke’s reserves consisting of five regiments of steel warriors, supported by another three regiments of Surefall Archers.   <br>
  The Halas infantry, brandishing great swords, axes, and spears charged forward at a full sprint and crashed into the forward ranks of the Gnolls. Close behind them came the many casters of the Army who sent forth deadly sheets of fire and Ice that kept the casters of the horde off balance as they attempted to counter with spells of their own.<br>
  The carnage of the fight was grizzly to behold.  The Gnolls were falling by the thousands as the three-pronged attack pressed inward on the horde’s center.  The ground under foot and paw alike became slick with the terrible affects of such a battle.  The once green plane was now crimson with trickles of blood and gore, which later would become rivers.  The slaughter continued into the afternoon until finally accepting defeat the Gnollish commanders sounded the retreat.  <br>
  <br>
  Gavin approached the gates of Permafrost Citadel with his great sword held low, and heedless of any enemy that attempted to bar his bath.  The blood rage was heavy upon him as he tested the healers in his party with his reckless abandon.  The Ice Giants that guarded the entrance were dispatched within minutes as the powerful group of heroes scrambled to protect the seemingly mad warrior.  No one in the party objected to the warrior’s rage however.  Although he was heedless of his own safety, he was even more terrible to the enemy then himself.  As he pushed passed the Ice Giants, he took out huge slices from the Giants legs, and lower abdomen as he passed.  The crippled Giants toppled to each side as the warrior continued on toward his foe hidden deep in the castle.<br>
  Once the party caught up with Gavin at the entry he silently looked around him.  He could see, but could not acknowledge them.  He was still consumed by his rage.  He only stopped at the insistence of his mother to let the others catch up before pressing forward.  Despite the blood rage, Gavin knew that she was right.  Once the parties were all inside the keep, Gavin once again continued his grim advance into the icy halls.  The few goblins that offered resistance were either blasted into dust by the powerful wizards, or sliced in two by one of the many warriors that accompanied the Wolfguard on his quest of blood vengeance.  <br>
 Deeper and deeper they traveled, and now they could here the Dragon roar as they drew ever closer.  Once in the outer chamber of the Vox’s lair a finale ring of resistance was sent against the party.  The Ice giant priests, and diplomats that remained in the lower depths were destroyed with hardly a second thought.  The party was just to strong, and their resolve to great for even the dreaded Ice Giants to endure.  Once this final defense was put aside the many shaman and clerics of the parties, began preparing the warriors with their blessings and spells of protection.  Gavin kneeled before his mother and father to receive the blessing of the tribunal, as his cousin Clancy Macalroy refreshed the war paint that had been partially washed away by his tears and by the exertions, and debris of battle.<br>
  Once again the Dragon Roared, but the Party was uncaring.  The Vox’s magic was still weak from her battle with Arianna, and the party was to strong to heed her complaints.  Once Gavin was prepared with the many blessings and with the fresh markings of a blood Vengeance quester, he squared his shoulders and once again unsheathed his great sword.  Followed closely by his many friends and allies Gavin burst into the Vox’s lair.  She recoiled in fear at the sudden appearance of the warrior even though she knew that he approached.  She had heard the warnings of her shaman regarding the writings in the stars even though she was determined not to heed them. She stared down at the painted faced man, and tasted fear for the first time in her life.  Despite that, and falling back on her towering pride she struck at the warrior with all the might of her terrible breath.  The warrior only flinched slightly as he continued his advance, and brought down his great sword on her forepaw.  The sword bit deep into the paw and nearly severed it.  The Vox reeled, and struck at the Wolfguard once again, this time with her tail.  She struck him with a glancing blow, which Gavin nearly dodged, but the tail had enough force to flatten him to the ground.  And then they were all around her.  The Vox with her attention firmly on the crazed warrior had failed to notice the many other members of his party surround her.  She was assaulted on all sides by every description of fighter and caster. She was pummeled, blasted sliced and stabbed so many times and in so many places that she panicked.  She was stunned by her own fear and could not even try to heal herself.  She spun around and around trying to keep her many assailants away, but to no avail.  Finally, with a great overhand chop the Wolfguard severed her head from her neck with a devastating critical blow.  The icy blue blood washed many of the party back as it sprang forth from the severed neck like a bursting mountain spring.  The body of the great Dragon flailed in the middle of the lair, and then finally settled into a deflated heap.  The murderer of Arianna was dead.  Once the realization of the battles end pervaded on the raging warrior, he fell to his knees, dropping his weapons and screamed his anguish at the gods.  His howl was of that of a lost wolf in great pain and deep sorrow.  His wounds were heavy, but the terrible warrior was uncaring.  His bleeding was not of his body, but of his soul.  His wife dead, and many of his friends, and companions were also slain.  Beside him lay the body of his father, at his side kneeled his soul torn mother immersed in a similar bought of torment.  <br>
<br>
  The celebration of the peoples of Qeynos, Halas, and Eurdin was subdued.  Although the many peoples of the three allied states were elated by their complete victory, they were also deeply saddened at the terrible cost.  The funeral processions seemed endless as the many fallen heroes, and heroines were returned to their final resting places.  The funeral for Argon, and Arianna Macalister had caused many to weep for days.  Many loved the beautiful wizardess, and the powerful mystic.  Gavin so overcome with grief struck out from the lands of the west leaving his sons in the care of the Arch Duke.  He could not face the world with out Arianna.  So he decided that he would seek his own death by going east to join or at least attempt to add the citizens of the Pass in their ongoing defense of their mountain home.  If that did not work he thought to himself, he would find another hopeless quest and on it would go until he could once more be in the arms of the only woman he could ever love.<br>
<br>
 As to the fate of the chosen, well I can tell you first hand that the Vox’s failure was complete.  As it is I, Ardin Macalister, am the author of this final work.  My father was unable to speak of the tail and the many historians who witnessed the events were unable to assemble the story from all the aspects of the battle. So my brother and I took it upon our selves to finish the tale.  My Brother’s task is not complete as yet, but he continues to rally the Teir’dal of good heart to his cause.  I feel that in the end, with the help of our father, and our many allies that he will eventually succeed.   My father however never fully recovered from the loss of his wife, my mother.  He did slow down a bit in his suicidal ambitions, but to no great degree.  He still comes home wounded to the quick.  <br>
  So friends we come at last to the end this tale.  Remember as you go away this night to pray for your fallen heroes, and to honor those that sacrificed for your freedom.<br>
  Goodnight friends, be well in your travels.<br>
