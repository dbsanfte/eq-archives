What were you thinking?!?!</span><hr size=1> For those who don't follow Golf, Annika Sorenstam is making an attempt to become the first woman in like 70 years to make the cut at a PGA tournament. Notice I didn't say LPGA. <br>
<br>
I don't understand what she is trying to prove. It's a known fact that women can't drive the ball as far as a man, so she can't compete in that aspect. She already proved she can't make it to the green on a 500yd hole in the same amount of strokes as the male players of her caliber. <br>
<br>
Personally, I don't like her there just for the simple fact that she is making this end up as a media circus, and a basic publiciity stunt. <br>
<br>
You know why men don't go to the women's leagues? BECAUSE THEY AREN'T ALLOWED! The WNBA, LPGA, Women's Tennis, WPBL, WBC. All of them do not allow men to compete as they are women only leagues. However, when a men's league doesn't allow it, it's sexist. Welcome to the world of the double standard!<br>
<br>
I seem to remember a few years back there was a female goalie who played for an NHL team, I want to say the Tampa Bay Lightning(Correct me if I am wrong). She didn't last too long, why? Women's bodies are not designed to take the punishment that can be dealt by a grueling season such as the NHL or the NFL. So why is the PGA any different? <br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope she chokes, and realizes that this was all a big mistake. Don't get me wrong, she is an excellent golfer, and would blow me out of the water any day of the week (hey I got a 32 handicap ok =p). Although, the one thing that really did bug me, when they asked her what Tee Box she was gonna be hitting from she was quoted as saying &quot;I guess I will have to hit it from where they hit from&quot; . Well no shit Sherlock! (For those who don't know, women generally hit from a Tee Box that is anywhere from 10-50 feet and in some cases 100 feet further forward than the Pro Tee Box).<br>

In athletic sports women will always lag behind men. That is the reason why men should not be able to compete in women's events. Men are superior to women in sports for the most part. The best men's tennis player will ALWAY beat the best women's tennis player. But i think that women should have a chance to play against men in certain non-contact sports if they can qualify like the rest of the competitors. I dont think it's fair to a man to have to box or wrestle against a women for many reason. But in sports like Golf, Tennis, swimming, running, etc. i dont see why a woman shouldn’t be able to match her skills to other men if she is capable.<br>
<br>
In tennis to make it into the main draw for a major tournament you have to qualify. If a women is able to do this i dont see what the big deal is. If a women is given special treatment and is allowed special rules (see battle of the sexes) Then the whole thing is pretty much bullshit.<br>
<br>
Golf is even more of a sport where a good women player should be able to compete against men. Golf is &quot;one of those sports&quot; where you dont even compete against other players in the true sense You compete against yourself. Same with sports like running, swimming, weightlifting, etc. Basically your opponent's actions have no effect on your play as would be the case in a sport like tennis, wrestling, football, soccer etc.. So if a women can lift more weight than a man i dont see why that should not be recognized in that regard<br>
<br>
Im guarantee you %100 that Anika will not come close to winning, but if she is able to place 80th out of 100 players then her point is valid. She should have to qualify like all other players on the same terms. If she doesnt then tough luck.<br>

I bet it was someone in the PGA executive...looking to get some publicity. CNN was reporting yesterday some obscene number (around 600 - 4 times what is normal) of &quot;media credentials&quot; had been issued for this tournement. The three male golfers in her 4-some were holding a press conference (pretty much unheard of in PGA).<br>
<br>
Reminds me a bit of the male/female tennis match way back (in the 70's). Something to stir the pot, get folks who would never dream of watching the sport interested in the &quot;political&quot; aspect of matching men against woman.<br>
<br>
All that being said, I have heard she is so far beyond the rest of the women pro's that she is kinda bored with the LPGA, so maybe she told them &quot; let me play once with the boys, or I take my toys and go home&quot;.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see how high up the leader board she can get...<br>
<br>
...now if I could only get myself into a 4-some with 3 LPGA gals. I'd show them that sometimes the more strokes the better.<br>

<br>
She isn't taking any slots that a normal PGA player would take, because she got a sponsor's exemption.  Usually these go to Celebrities, CEOs, or Amateurs anyways.<br>
<br>
She picked the Colonial because it's the shortest course and because it's an invitational (smaller amount of participants).<br>
<br>
As far as qualifying, that remains to be seen.  There are plenty of players on the PGA that got their tour card without going to Q-school.  Tiger Woods, Phil Mickleson, Davis Love III, Fred Couples, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer to name a few, all got their starts with sponsor exemptions.<br>
<br>
As far as a woman playing on the &quot;mens&quot; tour, there actually isn't any such thing as the &quot;mens&quot; tour.  No where in the PGA bylaws does it state that you have to be a male to play on the tour (unlike the LPGA which states you must be female).<br>
<br>
As for the media circus, this wasn't generated by her.  She's said over and over that she simply wanted to see how she stands.  She's already the best in the LPGA, this is just a logical progression to see if she can cut it.<br>

My problem here is not that a woman is going to compete with the men.<br>
<br>
No, My problem stems from the fact that she has not achieved a station in her own sport of dominance.  She is GOOD.  She is one of the best the women have to offer, but she hasn't &quot;Done it all&quot; in women's golf.  She hasn't won every tournament, or even a Vast majority.  She is not the Tiger Woods of women's golf. <br>
<br>
She hasn't completed a grand slam of major events, or even a &quot;Tiger Slam&quot; of majors.  She is not blowing the women she competes with away Every tournament she enters, and it isn't like she no longer has comperable competition in her sport. <br>
<br>
Why should she now ascend to this?<br>

Annika didn't choose Colonial because it's the shortest PGA course.  She chose Colonial because of the way the course is laid out.  It has a lot of doglegs, which takes the driver out of the hands of most of the PGA Tour players.  Annika can still hit driver though, so her drive will be landing about where theirs will be, and she won't have to be hitting a long iron for a second shot while the men are hitting short irons and wedges.  (For non-golfers, it's far easier to get your second shot closer to the hole when you are hitting wedges or short irons.  Long irons don't stop on a dime.)<br>
<br>
Why is she doing it?  M-O-N-E-Y.  Although she's the best female golfer, she doesn't have what some columnist today called the &quot;X&quot; factor that catapults her endorsements to the next level.  She isn't Michael Jordan, or Tiger Woods, or even Serena Williams.  This kind of &quot;stunt&quot;, if you want to call it that, has increased her visibility enormously, and may allow her to command larger endorsement contracts.  <br>
<br>
Do I care?  Not really.  I don't blame her for wanting to maximize her endorsement appeal, or for wanting to test her game against the best players in the world, not just the best female players in the world.  It's the same reason all the Japanese baseball players are signing major league contracts, right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treachery@thesaryrntavern>Treachery</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/21/03 12:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Competitiveness</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The reason there is no ruling is that if there was, it would be deemed sexist,  and  some  uppity  women's rights activist group would be all over them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not necessarily, Garb -- various groups are all over the PGA about the Masters, and the PGA does not appear to care.  There is at least one other explanation why the Gentlemen In Blue Blazers wrote their bylaws the way they did, which is.<br>
If the ultimate goal of a sports league is competition[1], it is an unpleasant necessity to restrict certain groups from competing due to a statistical advantage that they innately possess.  Therefore, high school students don't play middle school football, athletes that use &quot;performance enhancing&quot; substances aren't allowed to compete, and men can't play on the LPGA.<br>
That these rules prevent participation from people who were not actually a threat to competition, due to being small in high school (me), doped up on &quot;performance enhancing&quot; nasal decongestants (me again, see [2]), or having a 75 yard drive from the tee (me), is an unfortunate side effect, since there's no easy test to separate men with weak drives from those with strong ones -- at least, no easy test that can't be fooled.<br>
But there's no reason why you would impose a blanket restriction on a group you do not deem to be good <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>enough</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  In this direction, qualifying tests actually work.  If Annika qualifies for a PGA event, there's no real reason not to let her complete. [3]  Whatever she's &quot;trying to prove&quot; are not really relevant to the decision-making process of the PGA.<br>
NOTES (what is wrong with me today?)<br>
[1] In the world of professional sports, the ultimate goal is usually money.  But competition is a proxy for this, since financial success of the league is often tied to its competitiveness.<br>
[2] Since 2000, the IOC's &quot;anti-doping&quot; policy has been disqualifying people who test positive for pseudoephedrine -- the core component of decongestants like Actifed or Sudafed.  Andreea Raducan's loss of a gold medal in 2000 after her doctor gave her cold medication is one notable case.<br>
[3] Well, occasionally this backfires.  Where I'm from, girls' cross-country (and long distance track) was dominated by pre-pubescent girls who were, on average, 12 years old.  But I don't think the same thing is going to happen to golf, although perhaps Garbhad might. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 2998<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/21/03 1:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /e corrects himself.</span><hr size=1> The PGA tour is supposed to bring together the world's best golfers to compete against one another.  If, on a completely level playing field, she is able to make the cut (what everyone seems to be talking about) then it's a really big deal.<br>
<br>
Granted, this course is tailored to a woman's game more than a men's game.  The yard-per-hole average is one of the lowest, if not the lowest, on the tour.  And while women drive the ball much less than men do, they also tend to hit it straighter, thus giving women more of an advantage that usual on this course.  But all that aside, if she makes the cut she proves that women can compete atleast on some courses with men.<br>
<br>
Now here is how I see it.  I watch golf on occasion, as well as play a bit myself.  I want to see the best competition available teeing up against one another.  If one is a woman, playing by the exact same rules as men, then I want her up there.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say I disagree with Garbhad's comments.  From a medical standpoint, he would be correct when he compared male and female athletic capabilities.  For example, when women obtain a bodyfat ratio under ten percent, they begin to have medical problems that lead to various medical complications, including some relating to childbirth and the like.  The female body wasn't built to withstand the same physical pressures as the male body.  However, golf is more of a game than a sport, and if Fat Jack can be the greatest ever to play the game, then I doubt physical condition matters. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

That's a big negative. The women's groups did were not protesting the PGA. They were protesting the private golf club that the Master's is held at. There is a big difference there. <br>
<br>
The golf club was and always has eben a private course. They can restrict access to anyone they want. It just so happens that the PGA uses it for the Masters tournament. The PGA has no say on who is allowed in to that course. <p><a href=http://www.hneguild.com/profile.asp?name=Garbhad><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~cblack87/Garbsig.jpeg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chimeraadabard>ChimeraaDaBard</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://den.mine.nu/~hecate/chim.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/21/03 2:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3261.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Augusta</span><hr size=1> I live in Georgia, not too terribly far from Augusta GA, home of the Masters.

Martha Burk decided to take her little group of protesters and make as big a stink and as much press as she could to get her little name into big print.<br>

She got her name into print 1000x more with this one stunt (protesting Augusta) than she had in the previous several years combined.<br>

When it was over, she went away, and with no publicity to be found, she has walked away from it...<br>
