Now looking back to Desert Storm there were 4 companies from the US that worked to put out the oil fires in Kuwait. One of these companies was Halliburton so we can assume that they know the area they will be working in. They employ nearly 96,000 people in 120 countries so they have the logistical support and the ties they need to get the job done. They have also worked with the military before so they are familiar with that aspect of the operation. Furthermore they are not just an oil company but also an infrastructure construction company. Wait...does that mean it would be cheaper in the long run to have a single company that has the equipment to do a job over there for one job just work on others also?...Damn...that might actually work. And as far as them moving the corporate head quarters into Iraq...well they are a Texas company so that should pretty well ensure that doesnt happen.<br>

omg how bad, the french company got the contract over the US and english companies that wanted it too. Israel took it out by bombing Osirak (name of the nuclear reactor) and murdering few people all over Europe. glad they did it even if bombing should have been enough.<br>
<br>
Companies from every occidental countries had contracts with Irak (USA included and not for the smallest part even with a supposed embargo). <br>
USA are not the only country that has to secure its oil ressources and since USA (with england) have locked the ressources from venezuela, nigeria, angola and gulf countries (Saoudy arabia, the country that gives the most money to terrorism and has the lowest respect for human rights) that leaves other countries to deal with irak, iran or the birman dictatorship.<br>
<br>
now the US troops are getting their ass kicked everyday in Irak and there is no reason that it would change in near future, the Bush administration is begging for help all around the world; more and more people in the USA are getting tired of that (and of taxes); if that was leading to US troops going back home before democracy is restored in Irak (as much as you can restore something that never existed), then it would be a complete political faillure for the USA and a disaster for Iraki people.<br>
Bush administration has made many mistakes (lying so often being one of the biggest when you try to have other countries coming along in your shity plans), had an autistic behaviour and behave like newbs.<br>

But if nothing had been done and just for the sake of arguement, Iraq(Saddam) did unleash a weapon of mass destruction on the world, then the same grp would be saying &quot;OMG, why didnt someone see this coming and stop them'.  I understand some of the reasons for the war were political, some were business and some were for humanity.  I look at it with an open mind.  I dont condone being a bully and running over a country because we can.  As far as the French are concerned, I have little respect for them, they are fence stradlers in my opinion.  They agreed the Iraq was a potential problem, but were unwilling to help in containing the situation.  As far as the burden of paying for the war, the US will be the major player in this. 1. We organized the war. 2. We are one of only a very few nations that could even begin to pay for the war(not to taken as a brag by no means).<br>

Now after reading this I have to ask if you missed this little piece of the article. <br>
<br>
&quot;Highlighting the difficulties of working in Iraq, Faletti said KBR had been negotiating with three different companies to haul fuel into the country but discovered that all of these firms were promising the same 50 trucks for the job.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you have three companies using the same trucks you are not going to get a good deal,&quot; said Faletti.&quot;<br>
<br>
They may be paying the same amount for the fuel but the expensive part is in moving it. Cheney probably knew what Halliburton was capable of and knew he could trust them to do the job. Having ties to a company is generally a good thing. Hallliburton would have probably been one of the front runners in the contract race anyways. This decision needed speed and knowing that the company was capable. Bids take time and that is sorta against the US right now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Night-blind Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2997<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/19/03 6:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3675.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3842236&pageNumber=0">www.reuters.com/newsArtic...geNumber=0</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andvarishadowmist>AndvariShadowmist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bastard Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2970<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/19/03 7:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3675.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Kioti,<br>
It is actually a problem in Afghanistan atm.. Taliban/local warlords control more of the country than the &quot;government&quot; does. Outside of Kabul it's pretty much lawless, and links have been posted here before about hwo outside of Kabul things revert to the strict rules of the past (especially for women).<br>
<br>
Afghanistan has throughout history been a troublesome place. And I can't see that changing anytime soon.<br>

Haliburton isn't an oil distribution company. Their specialty is construction. It would have made a hell of a lot more sense to use the military to do it all along (which seems like is what will happen now) instead of overpaying Haliburton for it.<br>

You know, if something like this had been done back home the government would have been forced to resign (or at the very least some ministers would have) due to how illegal it would be to:<br>
1. Not put the contract out for bids.<br>
2. Secret contract.<br>
3. Use a company they have CLOSE ties to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Night-blind Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2998<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/19/03 10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3675.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Perhaps the world would be a better place if we were all governed by the enlightened self interest of multinationals, eh?

Their acquisition of the oil pipeline company gives them this. They however have to rely on Iraqi trucks to get the fuel from the tankers into the places that the US military needs. And im going to ask how long do you think it would take to get a competitive bid to start work in Iraq?...the longer that we waited for that bid would mean that we had to wait longer to get out of Iraq.

I'm not trying to claim that one life is that important, or that US troops should be more involved in Afghanistan, but I'm confused by the ideology that pours billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of troops into Iraq, and lets Afghanistan do its own thing.<br>
<br>
If you step far enough back from history things become very simple, even things that were once very complicated. <br>
<br>
1.) A terrorist went to Afghanistan, trained people there, used the local oppressive regmie's power to launch an attack on us.<br>
<br>
2.) We retalitated for about 5 minutes, set up a voting system and began lobbying to invade Iraq.<br>
<br>
3.) We invaded Iraq.<br>
<br>
4.) We ended the &quot;war&quot; in Iraq and sent in alot more troops and spent much more money &quot;rebuilding&quot; it.<br>
<br>
5.) The orginal terrorist was never found. His local supporters continue to war their own war, and continue to win.<br>
<br>
6.) We're busy in Iraq.<br>
<br>

hum.. companies cooperate about using equipment all the time. If company A gets the deal, they use the equipment. If they don't, and they had their own equipment, the equipment would be idle. That's not really economical. <br>
<br>
An example can be made of telecommunication systems in Norway. All the cables etc belong to one company, but they let other companies (competition) use them. Why? Because they earn money on equipment that would otherwise be idle, because the other companies would be in business no matter what.. just with their own equipment.<br>

The resources for said country are quite limited from the many wars over the years and the fact that the dictator was a nut case. The military probably is already using its resources to move fuel to its troops and doing alot of that job itself. Surprise but the US military is not all powerful, even they have their limits too. <br>

I was hoping for more common sense actually. Chances are the US military is taking the fuel with their own vehicles from certain depots into the bases that need it. And in Iraq if someone tries to use what you consider yours(the trucks) then you just pop a cap in their ass and blame the supporters of Saddam for killing them cause they were helping the US.<br>

And Vainne you havent really responded to the question of whether or not the UN had taken over operations in Afghanistan or not.

Hum so they are doing the job themself, yet pay Haliburton.. oh not to forget, they are going to take over ALL of the job because Haliburton is overpricing it. Oh yeah, sure makes sense not to do that from the beginning! But wait, you never responded to that part...<br>

You do realize some of the companies that wanted a shot at the contracts (in fact, most of them) were not Iraqi, right? Shocker, huh?<br>

As for Afghanistan.. I have heard nothing about handing it over to the UN. The forces that are there are under US leadership, not UN last I checked (friend of mine was down there as a F16 pilot). But it wouldn't surprise me if they do hand it over since they obviously can't handle the mess there and at least then they can blame UN for messing it up..<br>
