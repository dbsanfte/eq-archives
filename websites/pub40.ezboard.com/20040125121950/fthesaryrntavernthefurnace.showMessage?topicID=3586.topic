<br>
<br>
~ An anguished and passionately argued <br>
polemic for the return of pubic hair  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Undeniable Facts <br>
<br>
<br>
Fact: Every year over 2 million square miles of pubic hair are clear cut or torn out by the roots, much of it in virgin and &quot;old growth&quot; stands. <br>
<br>
Fact: As recently as 650,000 years ago, 97% of the human &quot;landmass&quot; was covered with a rich, endless, impenetrable thatch of gently swaying pubic hair, stretching as far as the eye could see. <br>
<br>
Fact: In modern times, pubic forestlands have shrunk to a few out of the way musky cracks, crevices, and lowland areas. Now, these precious areas too are under attack. <br>
<br>
Fact: Pubic hair generates 53.3% of the libidinal oxygen we need to breathe heavily, and provides the subconscious motivation for 49% of all social, economic and aesthetic endeavor. <br>
<br>
Fact: The human race is toying with ecological and sexuological Ur-Megiddo. <br>
<br>
Fact: Pubic hair is on the run. <br>
<br>
Hello and welcome! I'm Doctor Henry E. Panky, and I'll be your host today. Now, please insert the first videotape. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hirsutem Pubis,&quot; that which many philosophers call the &quot;bonum onum&quot; (the &quot;good onum&quot;) of human life. Amazon Basin of the human body: primitive, mysterious, enthralling, fertile, comforting, sometimes foetid. And like the primeval Amazon, threatened with eternal extinction. <br>
<br>
This is not a journey to begin lightly - wherever we turn our spotlight, we will find little scurrying things that run behind the refrigerator too fast to focus on. If one could be caught, you would see your own toothy, rodent face looking back at you, and take it from me, that can be spooky. <br>
<br>
But let us begin at the beginning. <br>
<br>
I first became fascinated by the &quot;Glorious Oeuvre&quot; at the age of 13, upon the stupendous discovery that women have pubic hair (italics are mine)! <br>
<br>
Growing up in a repressed, high-security Protestant family, I never actually saw a female naked until I found the magazine &quot;The Year's Best HairPie&quot; under my seat on a class trip to the llama farm. This providential &quot;Howdy stranger!&quot; to the joyous, but terrifying inscrutability that would come to obsess my personal and professional life left me perplexed and hyperventilating. And I asked myself, &quot;Is this for real, or is this a freak magazine, like, you know, MAD or Ripley's?&quot; <br>
<br>
As with many families of that golden era, pubic hair and related topics were not served up on the conversational dinner plate. Our parents, that generation of heroes, really (let me emphasize: really) didn't want to talk about it - even a hint could bring on what psychologists call the &quot;fight or flight&quot; syndrome. At the least one might be grounded; at the worst, electric currents to one's tender Tom Dooley. The pater familias on &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; never addressed these baffling conundrums. Nor Donna Reed, Ozzie or Harriet; not even crusty Grandpa McCoy, beloved Pepito, that old pederast. The library didn't help - the pertinent pages of the medical dictionary long since torn out and sold - and I was a solitary child. I began to suspect a conspiracy of silence. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Ambushed by Love <br>
<br>
Still I knew I was on the trail of something big. I had stumbled on an earthshaking secret that I wasn't supposed to know. I might be in danger. I could no longer look my mother or grandmother in the eyes. I needed to believe none of this applied to them or to the super obese. Slinking furtively from the newsstand, I scuttled home with latest edition of &quot;99% Dogstyle,&quot; eager to rub my &quot;naughty bit&quot; (then about the size of my ring toe, when angry) against the old lambskin car-seat cover discarded in the basement. <br>
<br>
Oh, the line between ecstasy and despair is a razor's edge. Thus I experienced my first bitter tastes of the guilt, self-hatred and existential angst that accompany this greatest of intimacies with the inanimate. No one has ever explained why this should be - but Dr. Friedman says it's exactly the same for him. I'm not proud of the way I treated that cooperative seat cover: promises, caresses, a passion to light this sad old universe on fire! Release, lassitude, resentment and the free-bird/rambling-man don't-tie-me-down speech: a story as old and debased as man himself. <br>
<br>
I couldn't help noticing that no one in &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; or &quot;The Hobbit&quot; ever humped animal skins, or indeed had sexual compulsions at all. Nor did they fart. At the time, I had substantial and somewhat legitimate hopes of being the Kwisatz Haderach, the guy who drank the giant-worm juice in &quot;Dune,&quot; and who in a sequel became a giant worm himself, though that never rang true to me (&quot;Come on! Who wants to be a fucking eyeless worm, no matter how big? I want to stand in flowing robes on the mountain, summoning lightning, having visions, solitary in my awesome power! And as Old Blue Eyes would say, &quot;Chicks!&quot;). <br>
<br>
That's the problem with sequels: the inspiration is spent, but the money, she is good. <br>
<br>
No longer a starry-cross-eyed fourteen year-old, I realize now that all men are abject peabodies to their noodles: yes - Thor Heyerdahl, Moshe Dayan, Sonny Bono, even Tony Orlando. But back then, only Licky, my cocker spaniel, seemed to be on the same page as me. He also liked to drag his butt across the carpet in a weird sitting, scoot-like motion that I personally found uncomfortable, but which brought a thick, fixed glaze of ecstasy to his sad, brown eyes. <br>
<br>
Lambyskins was my succubus of a thousand faces, every one of which had a nice curly patch (italics mine). She has been my nympho schoolteacher, my saucy parochial school slattern, and for much of the late nineties, she played Liz Hurley to perfection. Now we're an old grumpy couple - like Fonda &amp; Hepburn in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; - but still sexually active. The old girl wouldn't have it any other way. Please insert video number 2. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: The Airbrush, The Razor &amp; The Damage Done <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't need no wax job, you're smooth enough for me.<br>
And if you need your oil changed, I'll do it for you - free!&quot; <br>
<br>
Who could have dreamed that a small area of curly follicles curving up and around from the hind to the front end of the female of the species would become the &quot;sine qua non&quot; (&quot;the good onum&quot;) of life, the slightest shadowy suggestion of which drives men, and I assume Lesbians, to wriggling and jiggling, tongue-wagging frenzy? I'm not sure what the Creator had in mind, or exactly how it was done, but I know success when I see it. And it's ludicrous and blasphemous for atheists to suggest this all happened by chancee. <br>
<br>
In the innocent years of my adolescence, one never saw the &quot;details&quot; of the female genitalia in printed media, only a comforting, unthreatening, puberulent blur of airbrushed hair. It still makes me smile with golden nostalgia. I'm certain this was done with the best of intentions, and little Henry Panky - never one to look a gift horse in the mouth - certainly didn't question it. &quot;I love you just the way you are!&quot; I sang. But this misconception led inevitably to a terrible shock when I came face to face with &quot;the real thing.&quot; Aiyee! Whoa! Very real! It wasn't easy for a dreamy romantic to get beyond the airbrush. &quot;Jeez, I'll be damned, never would have guessed at anything like that!&quot; It was all so visceral. But I did get beyond it: I dove right in, I kept my eyes open, and said &quot;Hi, howya doing!&quot; I'm proud that I did, and wouldn't have it any other way, honestly, certainly the great majority of the time. <br>
<br>
But now, the pendulum has swung the other way - too far, too far - and I worry about the little ones, the children... <br>
<br>
If you were a healthy 12-year-old today, feeding at any of the multitudinous media troughs of explicit smut, you might reasonably conclude that a penchant for pubes reflected one of the more archaic, oddball, unseemly, even perverted compulsions - ranking distinctly below water sports, she-males, toon sex, artificial genitalia, intercourse with foodstuffs, and quadruped bestiality on today's hit parade. I don't mean to disparage these fine practices, nor to put pubic hair on a pedestal - I'll leave that to the Brooklyn Museum of Art - but only to reestablish the rightful order of things. <br>
<br>
I worry about the shock my delightfully wide-eyed and heartbreakingly defenseless son, if such a child indeed existed, is in for when he first sees a naked woman in &quot;real time.&quot; After years of earnest pornography study - which yet constitutes the greater part of our society's sex education curriculum - little Danny might very well recoil in genuine horror from the best damn thing in life (italics are mine). <br>
<br>
It might well conjure up that old movie about Atlantis where humans were turned into pigs and donkeys, before everyone got burned up by the giant crystal ray gun, except those lucky few who escaped back to Mykonos on the submarine (to the best of my knowledge, the first recorded human use of submarines, way before Leonardo). This saddens me immensely - the shaved pubis conundrum, not the submarine, though turning humans into hyenas was kind of sad and creepy, and has now been soundly condemned by U.N. resolution (the Bush administration, however, refuses to limit our &quot;tool bag&quot; of options in protecting legitimate national interests). <br>

Chapter 4: The Middle Way; No Hardware <br>
<br>
&quot;What's good is bad, what's bad is good;<br>
you find out when you've reached the top,<br>
you're on the bottom.&quot; <br>
<br>
How does one compare something so slick and naked, un-garnished by the delicate, enchanting curling tendrils of human parsley, to Guinevere's Perilous Forest, Sappho's shrubbery-hidden Cave, or Sharon Stone's glorious muffaletta in &quot;Basic Instinct?&quot; I hear the soaring music from &quot;Amadeus&quot; when I remember that scene. These are holy places where men go MAD from the passion and mystery! <br>
<br>
Whoa, I've got to calm down, splash some cold water on my face, and slip into a pair of loose, fleecy sweat pants. You may want to do the same. Then, go ahead and put in <br>
video 3. <br>
<br>
Let me be clear: I am not glorifying pubic foilage (sic) the size of a dinner plate or shaggy bathtub mat. Neither Magilla Gorilla nor Cousin It. Heaven forfend. Buddha taught the Middle Way: neither too much, nor too little. Something tasteful, appetizing, exciting, nuzzle-able, but without being overwhelming: a generous pie-shaped wedge is appropriate. <br>
<br>
And please, for Christ's sake: no shaven lightning bolts, arrows, exclamation points, X marks the spot, 666's, team logos or those little circles of hair like some unfortunates have growing on their foreheads. That's like moving Chartres Cathedral to Yabba Dabba Doo Land. Furthermore, ring piercings, ball bearings and dangling chin up bars on the private parts should be outlawed - our airport security professionals are already working hard enough in these difficult times. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: God's Inscrutable Will? We Survey a Variety of Opinions <br>
<br>
Somebody's got to ask, &quot;What's behind this lemming-like race to a hairless pelvic basin?&quot; If we can identify the culprits, we can try to help them, or conversely, we can have a witch-hunt! <br>
<br>
Certain Christian fundamentalists believe that Adam and Eve didn't have any genital hair, or indeed any genitals, or anuses for that matter, until the Fall (&quot;Mr. O&quot;, no relation to &quot;Story of O,&quot; wanted me to italicize this). This reminds me of those nightmarish Outer Limits episodes, which scared me totally shitless as a child, where horrible mutants wandered and bumped around the streets with no mouths, nose holes or eyes, just skin covered declivities. I don't know if they had pubic hair. I don't want to know. <br>
<br>
Then I read an article in the Times about a Pakistani teacher who suggested to his class that the Prophet might NOT have shaven his pubic and armpit hair. Presumably, he was just trying to get a lively class discussion going, an intention I thoroughly applaud, but you know the rest: &quot;Bapu, guess what we talked about in school today?&quot; And it's too bad, a crying shame about the teacher's impending execution, though I'm not saying it's wrong, mind you; it's really not for me to say. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm, I'll be jiggered,&quot; I mused to myself. According to the article, &quot;Pious Muslim men often shave their pubic and armpit hair, while allowing the beard to flourish.&quot; Who would have imagined? <br>
<br>
Well, first of all, I want to express my respect for all the world's great religions, including Islamism, Parsi-ism and Ba'haiism. I love Cat &quot;Yusuf&quot; Stevens, and indeed often sing &quot;Peace Train&quot; to myself as I go about the glorious mundanities of daily life (&quot;Be Here Now!&quot;). If more of us climbed on board the Peace Train, the world would be a nicer place. I almost named my cat &quot;Yusuf ,&quot; but ultimately decided on &quot;PeeWee,&quot; another fantastic human being, who may now be a Muslim for all I know. Finally, and this is the clincher: I don't really give a shit what men do with their pubic hair, much less armpits! And I have a beard (yeah, I know, I'm &quot;hiding&quot;, I'm &quot;compensating&quot;, yadda yadda, fuck you). <br>
<br>
Anyway, please no death fatwas; it's not a good time for me. <br>
<br>
In James Clavell's ground shaking &quot;Shogun,&quot; a group of toothless, feudal lackwits gather round the rice pot to gurgle about the supposed penetration advantages of the &quot;hairless yoni, neh?&quot; But in his epochal study, &quot;Zuviel Bologna uber die Yohni&quot; (&quot;Much Baloney About Yoni&quot;), Professor W. Schnitzel effectively demolished this and other Shogunistic theories for everyone except a handful of obdurate Hairless Yoni cultists now living in Tokyo's subway tunnels. <br>
<br>
Here's Darwinian psychologist Harry Mahns with another view, &quot;It is the fear of loss, which leads us to depilate the 'genital neighborhood.' In the course of evolution, pubies shall inevitably disappear, and many are unwilling to take the risk of loving our furry pelts with all their scared, damaged hearts, in the here and now (Dr. Mahn's italics).&quot; <br>
<br>
Here's an alternative view from Mr. Heston, &quot;The Clintonian Trilateral Council on Foreign Relations wants to crush our will to live and make us zombie U.N. slaves with hairless balls and without our guns (Mr. Heston's italics).&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Mr. Peanut Comes to Me, Speaking Words of Wisdom <br>
<br>
I began to despair of solving the question of the &quot;grassy-less knoll&quot; before it was too late. Religious utopianism, hairless yoni-ism, pre-emptive Darwinism, childhood irredentism, Bill Clintonism, or maybe even conspiracy? (I don't know whose italics these are). <br>
<br>
Then I had a glorious dream: I saw Mr. Peanut come tap dancing out of the Gillette-Epilady Corporation clutching a fistful of greasy dollars, and as he went gaily by with that shit-eating simper of his, he whispered, &quot;Follow the money, Bubbalouey.&quot; Bubbalouey was Quick-Draw McGraw's trusty sidekick, though I remain unsure why Peanut called me that. <br>
<br>
Then the scene shifted and I saw a timber industry spokesperson, looking much like Homeland Security honcho Tom Ridge, standing chest high amid an immense undulating thatch, waving a huge, fluttering flag, and speaking of &quot;America's great renewable resource.&quot; I saw granite-jawed, tool-belted developers before the Statue of Liberty pointing to a sea of surging boatloads, &quot;People need someplace to live.&quot; I saw Snidely, Boris and Natasha bagging the rich curly silk of impoverished, education-hungry Pac 10 cheerleaders, of desperate, hollow-eyed junkies, and exploited Third World womanhood eager to join the global economy. Victoria's Secrets would weave their crinkly ringlets into an extraordinarily popular line of fine merkins,* and its &quot;You Don't Know What You've Got Til It's Gone&quot; campaign would go on to sweep the Obie Awards. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
* Footnote: A merkin is a pubic toupee. As a vocabulary building exercise, try using it today in a conversation by the water cooler, or in a letter home to Granny. <br>
<br>

<br>
At mailboxes across the country, savage fistfights erupted over the catalogue, husband against wife, father against son, archbishop against parish priest. <br>
<br>
I woke up re-energized, and noticed my &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; was achingly turgid. Is it that simple? Was all the psycho-socio-political mumbo jumbo just a smokescreen? Are we selling our precious birthright down the drain for a mess of pottage? I mused further: What is pottage anyway? Why is it always served in a &quot;mess?&quot; That doesn't sound very appealing, but somebody must like it to command such barter value since biblical times. I wonder if it's anything like chicken pot pie, of which I'm very fond. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Pübers Über Alles <br>
<br>
&quot;Give to me the life I love...<br>
Bed in the bush with stars to see&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't know the answers to these questions about pottage, and probably shouldn't have allowed myself to be distracted. It's just something I've always wondered about. But I do know that if we concede our short n' curlies without a donnybrook, next they'll come for our horny toenails and bumpy nipples. How long before the protuberant outer ear is lopped? And the belly's lint-gathering button is spackled? Already the soft and jiggling breast, wondrous in its shifting shapes, enthralling in its transience, has been sacrificed to the hard teat that succors neither baby nor swain. Inevitably it seems, all our dangly parts shall be deemed as uncouth and déclassé as Spam canapés; suitable only for rude underclasses...or the knackers. <br>
<br>
It won't end til we're all as sleek and slippery as Flipper the porpoise, as seductive as chicken tenders, defeated in our lovemaking by a lack of handholds. <br>
<br>
And so you might ask, with heavy and hopeless heart: Is all lost to us then, reactionary Luddites of the louche and gnarly human physiognomy? * <br>
<br>
