Hunting for Bambi<br>
Date: Monday, July 14 @ 08:58:54 PM CDT<br>
Topic: Weird News<br>
<br>
<br>
It's called Hunting for Bambi and it's happening right here in the Las Vegas valley. This controversial hunt draws participants from around the world..<br>
<br>
<br>
(July 10) -- It's a new form of adult entertainment, and men are paying thousands of dollars to shoot naked women with paint ball guns. They're coming to Las Vegas to do it. This bizarre new sport has captured the attention of people around the world, but Channel 8 Eyewitness News reporter LuAnne Sorrell is the only person who has interviewed the game's founder. <br>
<br>
George Evanthes has never been hunting. &quot;Originally I'm from New York. What am I going to hunt? Squirrels? Someone's cats? Someone's dogs? I don't think so,&quot; said Evanthes. Now that he's living in Las Vegas, he's finally getting his chance to put on his camouflage, grab a rifle and pull the trigger. But what's in his scope may surprise you. He's not hunting ducks or deer, he's hunting naked woman. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've done this three times,&quot; says Nicole, one of the three women allowing themselves to be shot at. Two other women, Gidget and Skyler, claim they have done this seven times. <br>
<br>
Hunting for Bambi is the brainchild of Michael Burdick. Men pay anywhere from $5000 to $10,000 for the chance to come to the middle of the desert to shoot what they call &quot;Bambis&quot; with a paint ball gun. Burdick says men have come from as far away as Germany. The men get a video tape of their hunt to take home and show their friends. <br>
<br>
Burdick says safety is a concern, but the women are not allowed to wear protective gear -- only tennis shoes. <br>
<br>
Burdick says hunters are told not to shoot the women above the chest, but he admits not all hunters follow the rules. &quot;The main goal is to be as true to nature as possible. I don't go deer hunting and see a deer with a football helmet on so I don't want to see one on my girl either,&quot; said Burdick. <br>
<br>
The paint balls that come out of the guns travel at about 200 miles-per-hour. Getting hit with one stings with clothes on, and when they hit bare flesh, they are powerful enough to draw blood. <br>
<br>
Evanthes shot one of the women and says, &quot;I got the one with the biggest rack.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gidget is the one who took the paint ball shot to the rear. She says, &quot;It hurt. It really hurt. I didn't think it was going to be that bad.&quot; When asked if she cried she says,&quot;yeah, a little bit.&quot; <br>
<br>
So why do women agree to strip down and run around the desert dodging paint balls? Nicole says it's good money. &quot;I mean it's $2,500 if you don't get hit. You try desperately not to and it's $1000 if you do,&quot; said Nicole. <br>
<br>
The men and women say this is all good, clean fun, but in Part 2 of this special report, reporter LuAnne Sorrell speaks with a psychologist who says for some men playing out this sexual aggression may lead to other more violent acts against women. <br>
<br>
Michael Burdick, the founder of Hunting For Bambi, explains the game to three women early one Monday morning. &quot;You have to collect four flags throughout the course. Some are easy for you and some are not easy,&quot; said Burdick. <br>
<br>
The woman begin stripping down to their tennis shoes and start running to dodge the paint balls that go buzzing by. <br>
<br>
&quot;We got a hit,&quot; said George Evanthes, who just shot and hit one of the women in the behind. &quot;It was sexy. Let's put it that way,&quot; said Evanthes. <br>
<br>
The women who take part in this bizarre game get paid $2,500 if they escape unscathed. Even if a paintball hits them, they walk away with $1,000. <br>
<br>
&quot;As you can see this is not lethal, and it wasn't meant to hurt anybody. Just good clean fun,&quot; said Evanthes. <br>
<br>
Burdick says the majority of the men who pay the $5000 to $10,000 to play the game are the submissive, quite type. &quot;For the individual who's used to saying 'I can't go out with the boys tonight' or the wimp of America, it's a chance for him to come out and vent his aggression and really take charge and have some fun.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marv Glovinsky is a clinical psychologist. He says Hunting for Bambi is every man's fantasy come true. &quot;You might think of all men as little boys who have never grown up, so they entertain their adolescent fantasies and they go through life being adolescents on the hunt.&quot; <br>
<br>
But Glovinsky says this so called game that mixes violence with sexuality can be dangerous for men who can not distinguish fantasy from reality, and acting out the violence in this game could lead to them acting out real violence. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you're blurring reality and fantasy and you can't make the distinction and you're emotions over power your intellect or your higher mental function, your going to get into trouble, and if you have a control problem to boot, that's really going to cause problems.&quot; Problems, he adds, like beating, raping or even hunting women with a real gun. <br>
<br>
Hunter Evanthes disagrees, &quot;This is just a game. Get serious, get real.&quot; But some worry it's a game, which may have consequences that go far beyond the playing field. <br>

<br>
By posting this story I in no way condone the shooting of women in the ass with a paintball gun. (/snicker He shot her in the ass!)  ahem... /cough.  I do not believe this is a proper way to spend 10,000 dollars in Las Vegas, Prostitution and gambling are both legal, and I am a pretty good poker player.<br>
<br>
Seriously it is dangerous and ill advised to play paintball without protective gear.  You can put an eye out.  (or shoot someone in the ass!)<br>

I was an avid paintball player and yes you will be blind if you are hit in the eye with a paintball when not wearing a mask. I think it's fucking sad.<br>
<br>
Also the article quote that the paintballs travel at 200mph. What the fuck? Paintball markers are usualy chronographed (speed test) at 250 fps (feet per second). <br>
<br>
In any case this is absolutely pathetic for all the guys who participate. What is the fun of shooting a naked woman with a paintball gun? And on top of that,, having to pay up to 10,000 bucks for it? No fucking thanks. There is no sportsmanlike motive here. I guess when you have 10k to blow you can act out all your fantasys.<br>
<br>
Still I would rather take the 10k and have a nice vacation somewhere. This is lame, I think the whores should be getting more of the cash, but oh well.<br>

Especially since the quoted 200 mph seems to be muzzle<br>
velocity, and your 250 fps is probably measured somewhere<br>
downrange, after the ball's slowed down a bit.<br>

Otherwise, i think the idea of shooting naked prostitutes with paintballs for amusement is a lot of fun =P <br>
However, prostitution in the actual city of LV isnt legal - The city with the bordellos is actually a little dot on the map next to vegas with very tight restrictions and regulations. Its still illegal in LV. (Dont tell the scads of hookers that though, then we would run out of people to shoot) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ratsan>Ratsan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/22/03 4:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3404.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://stateofthegame.50megs.com/mov/demon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: STOP THE PRESSES!!!
