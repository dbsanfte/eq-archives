Where they are in such a budget crisis that they are fining people for talking too loud or sitting on milk crates. Yeah blame CA for your problems LOL. Explains a lot.<br>
<br>
You are absolutely correct on the defense industry but why did it collapse? The money is still there it moved out of CA thanks to CA becoming unfriendly to businesses.  Tuna industry used to be big here too, they moved out of the country thanks to US and CA regulations that further hurt our CA economy. While we are identifying causes for economic issues in CA let’s not forget El Nino and the how agriculture has suffered because of it. Geez.<br>
<br>
I won’t talk on the agriculture subsidies as I know little about them and will bow to your obvious knowledge in that area.<br>
<br>
Even though I clearly stated several times I wasn’t blaming the immigrants you still try to make it seem like I am. Why? Where did I say anyone was lazy or greedy? Please don’t put words in my mouth, it’s beneath you. Unless your a Gray Davis supporter then it's understandable, it's a tactic they use best.<br>
<br>
<br>
For the record I live 50 miles from the border and work 10 miles from it.<br>
Just as you take this issue personally so do I, I’m sick and tired of hearing of men, women, and even children freezing to death in my mountains during the winter, dying of heat exhaustion and dehydration in my deserts during the summer, being run over on my freeways making a dash, or rolling their vehicles trying to escape from the border patrol. <br>
I see this all too frequently, I see the camps they’ve set up behind the local grocery stores in conditions that are worse then we give murderers and it sickens me. <br>
<br>
What do you want? Open borders? More people living below the poverty level won’t help CA nor them. <br>
<br>
Give me a suggestion Vainne. Tell me what you would do to fix the economic issues in an over-taxed and underpaid California. <br>
<br>
I’ve laid my opinion out there for you to rip and make baseless accusations. Come on now and be the savior of us all and tell us how you would fix it with out further fucking over the people of this state. Oh, and no, charging people for talking too loud is not an option.<br>
<br>
I have not ever said there is a problem with immigration but illegal immigration, especially in a post 9/11 America is something I’m willing to accept.<br>
<br>
Yes my grandparents were immigrants, my paternal grandfather was from a small fishing village in Sicily and my paternal grandmother was a French-Canadian. The were both LEGAL immigrants, who got their citizenships, who came here with nothing, worked hard, died with little, but gave their children an advantage who in turned worked hard, who gave us a step up. <br>
<br>
Excuse me if I quote wrong here but<br>
<br>
<blockquote style="padding-left:0.5em; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; border-left:solid 2"><br>
You don’t care if your lettuce costs more (although I'm assuming you don't want to pick it yourself)--or in general if your economy continues to suck, as long as the Mexicans aren't profiting from it?<br>
</blockquote ><br>
<br>
Once again you have to resort to baseless name-calling and innuendo. Why? Are your arguments that groundless? <br>
<br>
1)  FYI, I’d pick lettuce if I had to, I’ve done much worse. Why do you assume I wouldn’t? You know what assuming gets you? <br>
I’ve done grunt labor and would again if I had to. I worked two jobs and put my self through school to be come the first college graduate in the family. <br>
When I was younger I worked tuna boats and if you don’t think that tuna boats are hard then you’ve never worked 18 hour days out on the nets for 3 months at sea, no contact except the 11 smelly guys next to you at the chow table, scared shitless when waves higher then the boat are crashing down on you, lugging hundred pound bags of salt where the bags slice into your arms and the salt seeps in. I’ve still got the scars 20 years later. Does that mean I’ve paid my dues? I’ve had other grunt jobs and now I’m a Senior Software Development Manager, big fucking whoop.<br>
<br>
2) Where do I even imply that I want to keep Mexicans from profiting? If fact if my suggestion was followed those legal immigrants that worked in the fields would be better off. Instead of working for pennies I clearly suggested enforcing existing laws, which includes minimum wage requirements and fair pay. How is paying them more wrong? /boggle how is ensuring they have access to proper facilities wrong? /boggle<br>
<br>
3) You want hard numbers on health care, education, and government services. LOL, why so you can dispute the sources? You know you would. You are so blind to the realities of this state that it is truly sad. Those numbers are readily available on the net. Try Google I hear it works pretty good.<br>
<br>
I respect the fact you feel so passionate about this issue and I hope you will respect that in me. However please stop implying that I'm blaming immigrants for anything.<br>
<br>
Vainne, I’m not going to get into a pissing contest with you. Neither of us is in a position to judge each other and we will never agree. <br>
<br>
Edited cause I can't do damn quotes<br>

I am certainly not denying that there are problems, but I question how many of these problems are experienced by both you and Garbhad, and how you learned these problems were from illegal immigrants.<br>
<br>
Unless either of you work as immigration officers, or border guards, I would guess that the majority of your information comes from the media.  Oh... wait a minute... everyone else can watch the same media.  Hrm.... Well this is just a dilly of a pickle then!<br>
<br>
Oh!  Maybe the California media speaks in code words that only select few California natives would understand.  This would certainly bias the rest of the country, since they are essentially being fed misinformation.  You Californians sure are sneaky!<br>

When I got old enough, even though he already was making a good income as a professional (first in his family to go to college) he LOANED me the money to buy a paper route and I was doing that at age 10 to make money.<br>

Now, when I want MY son to learn from the experience of delivering newspapers, what do I find? All the local routes are &quot;owned&quot; by adults... who deliver by car and, just incidentally, don't speak enough English to understand that I don't want my paper on the front lawn in the winter.

<br>
A lot of the problems in this state stem from it's diversity. So many ideals and beliefs....too bad a lot of it is bleeding heart liberal ideals =/ <br>

<br>
You don't have to work as an immigration officer to see the immigrant camps scattered around my community, nor the 50+ immigrants that are sitting in front of the local donut shop every morning waiting to get picked up by someone for the day labor. We recently had a Hazmat team close a portion of a creek near my house because of the toxic level of human waste. Then there was the time I nearly took out a woman and child running across a 65 mph freeway at night, lovely memory, excuse me while I change my shorts.<br>
<br>
If you live in So Cal, especially in San Diego's rural areas you'll know that what they show on the news isn't the half of it.<br>
<br>
If you ever want the secret code words let me know...I have an inside source<br>

I do appreciate the stories as I find them quite interesting (not living in California myself).  I do not, however, believe that you have provided any justification as to why one must have lived in california all their lives in order to have the necessary knowledge to argue intelligably about California's illegal immigrant &quot;problem&quot;.<br>

<br>
Yes. Exactly. Also exactly the stories about your parents and grandparents. You know, it is really annoying to Become a &quot;legal&quot; immigrant in America today, even without all of the crawling under barbed wire and across a desert at night to do so.<br>
<br>
What I mean is, its hard. It takes forever. And you cant work legally during the whole thing. And they don't have to let you in at all. These days, they can pretty much do anything they want to you too. You're a non-person.<br>
<br>
Anti-immigrant sentiment is nothing new. Those bloody irish papists came here and bred like rabbits. Lazy disreputable lot, almost as bad as the italians. And don't get me started on the Chinese and those railroads...its a wonder the damn things were ever build--Gold Mountain, indeed.<br>
<br>
(That is sarcasm and its heavier-handed than any of you deserve, actually.)<br>
<br>
I'm sure none of you &quot;hate&quot; illegal immigrants, I'm pretty sure you're not scary racists also. But...I really do think it can't possibly be the fault of illegal immigration that California is so fucked. Far as I know California's been fucked for a long long time. Or at least my grandma says that is true. I mean, you can't even swim in the San Joaquin River any more, wtf. And have you ever had kool aide with sulpher water? Shiver. Also, you all like, live in your cars. You don't have sidewalks. You have no water. There's this huge earthquake faultline. Fire ants. Pesticides. And so on. And Fresno is really flat. Build a few hills for god sakes.<br>
<br>
I think blaming illegals is a scapegoat. A bread and circus thing that ignores other issues. Didn't Enron have something to do with California's energy crises? (No, that is a serious question--I'm opinionated, not well-informed.) I'm positive the defense industry went totally  bust before it bounced back in other state as well. And I seem to remember there was something about a property tax thing in the early eighties that totally screwed over your college system?<br>
<br>
The solution? Come up with a reasonable immigration system. One that lets people in that want to come here in normal amounts of time. Make low-wage jobs slightly less like slave labor by giving them benefits and stuff so that people might actually want to do them. Cititzens might want to do them. It is kinda like now we have labor laws, but we also have a way out of following them. I do agree, city sweatshop or migrant farming conditions should not be the way they are.<br>
<br>
We just disagree on the solutions. I say, let em in, let em raise their families and improve their lot. You say, keep em out, keep jobs for us. Shrug, always will disagree on that I guess.<br>
<br>
I don't like California liberals either, mostly. But in California there's this odd mix of the hard right and the hard left that just creates a complete mess. They NEVER should have given you initiative and referendum. Maybe that is the problem?<br>
<br>
But also, Fammadan I do concede your point, I am being mean, and I am probably not right about all things in this. However, I get really mad when people start bitching about immigration.<br>
<br>
And I have never worked on a tuna boat, no--but I did wash dishes one summer. And I only mention that for the sarcasm value--obviously, in terms of actual hardship, I may have seen it, but I totally have no clue.<br>

Not bragging on my driving abilities if I hadn’t seen the car ahead of me swerve they’d be dead. I was driving south on the I-5 near the border, a van or truck of illegal immigrants had broken down and they were hopping the freeways trying to get across. Could I swear in court that it was an illegal immigrant? Nope, you got me there. Odds are in my favor considering the situation and the number of deaths down there that are so bad that they have actually put up signs now on that part of the freeway. You know they ones that look like deer or cattle crossing signs, warning to look out for that type of situation, the sign shows what look like a family runnin. <br>
