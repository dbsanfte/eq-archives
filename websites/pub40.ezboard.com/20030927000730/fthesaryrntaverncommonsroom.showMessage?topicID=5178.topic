A pick-up raid on the dragon Vox.  Yes, I died, but we killed her &amp; I was one of the very last ones to die (about 20 of 36 died) I died only because I accidentally hit my taunt hotkey.  Oops!!!   Once was all it took. Pulled agro, chomp, chomp, chomp, one dead me.  For a lower level (43) tank it was a fatal mistake and one I won't make again.  <br>
<br>
Chalk it up to inexperience. Anyway, I now realize that if I want to do more raids on any sort of regular basis I'm going to have to join a guild. But the question is which one to join? I have a number of friends in guilds, but they are all small/mid-size guilds that almost never raid – more like social clubs or cooperatives.  <br>
<br>
So I have to look for information on guilds elsewhere.   I'm having a hard time finding any good reference information on guilds and the various options, how big they are, how often they raid, level qualifications for joining, etc.<br>
<br>
I don't want everyone to respond by saying &quot;Woot, my guild is best....&quot;  Cause I'm sure they are all good in their own way.  I’m just looking for a method to evaluate my options.<br>
<br>
Here's what I'm looking for - good sized (mid-large sized) guild where they raid a few times a week but have enough members that they won't get bent if I can't attend more than 2-4 raids a month. Prefer a strong east coast US membership to make scheduling easier.<br>
<br>
I am not looking for a social club, or a guild into the role-playing thing (&quot;Hark, a dwarf strides yonder......&quot; - not my style) or a guild into that whole EQ marriage thing (one more aspect of the game I'll take a pass on - I have a RL wife, sure don't need another one in EQ!!)  Just looking for a large bunch of good, nice, fun players/smart people who like to kill stuff and help each other out when we can.   I don’t want to be one of those people who hop around between guilds, so I want to make a smart choice up front.  <br>
<br>
On to my question:  Have any of you been in this situation and how did you end up selecting a guild? What are the best resources to research the guild options on Saryrn? I know there are a number of ezboards, but I'd rather not visit each and every one.  Are there web sites where most of the guilds post information? Does Verant publish guild lists with sizes?  And lastly since many of you are in guilds and I’m not, what are the more important qualities that you think I should look for in a guild?<br>
<br>
Any insights would be appreciated.<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

'Here's what I'm looking for - good sized (mid-large sized) guild where they raid a few times a week but have enough members that they won't get bent if I can't attend more than 2-4 raids a month.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
For the best fit, you'll first need to approximate how many raids you'd actually be able to attended. If you suspect you'll really only be attending 3 out of 12+ raids a month, your attendence will likely lag behind that of other members, and if awards are important to you, you will probably find this situation unsatisfactory.<br>
<br>
Some guilds will allow potential recruits to raid with them so both guild and player can familiarize themselves with each-other.....but you may not get a true feeling for the guild without attending many raids. Still, short of doing a lot of research, this is probably the best path to take.<br>

I doubt any raiding guilds(like you are looking for) will Say &quot;Woot my guild is best! Join us!&quot; on forums for a level 43 warrior.<br>
<br>
As posted above me, you aren't going to be useful at any raids besides Naggy/Vox. Find a small guild you can join and level up, have fun in the game. How can you be so hungry for power when you can only raid 3-4 times a month? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=585801"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/XlablikxSig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I'm not sure you meant this the way it sounded. Mid-sized, mid-level social type guilds don't like to be used as pawns to be stepped on.<br>
<br>
How would TWC like it if 15 people joined over the course of a month then left 4 months later to do a character transfer once they had the qualifications to get into Afterlife? I'm not sure how TWC would view this but to me it would feel kinda like a knife in the back.<br>
<br>
Back to the origional poster. I'd recommend going to the links part of these forums. There's a lot of guild links in there. Surf websites, visit forums and talk to some members of guilds that look like they might fit into with what you're looking for. There's a lot of nice people out there and even some not so nice people out there. The only real way to find out what matches what you're looking for is to experience it first hand.<br>
<br>
BTW, did you really take out the AoW last night with only 18 people? or were there more hiding back in the bushes? <p>-Tweelis Twitchydigits<br>

<br>
Person A joins TWC one week before Planes of Power comes out. They earn a crapload of aaxp over a few months. They also get plenty of nice items over the course of several months because they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>earned</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the points and spent those points.<br>
<br>
Lo and behold person &quot;A&quot; notices several guilds in PoTime.  TWC (or insert any other guild in existence really) has failed to make person &quot;A&quot; want to stay due to wanting to head to PoTime. Person &quot;A&quot; says &quot;the guild sucks, and fuck em. I want to be in PoTime and not dance around in VT.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, TWC did provide gear/services/etc to person &quot;A&quot; but didn't that person also provide something back to the guild? Did person &quot;A&quot; slow a mob? nuke it down? smack it around with a sword? shoot it with arrows? do combines on high end trade skill items? rezz and buff guildmates? etc..... Playing devil's advocate here but what do they owe TWC or whatever guild they were in? Person &quot;A&quot; earned points (sorta like I earn a paycheck) and spent those points (kinda like I spend money on my truck) on what they wanted.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've just been lucky and haven't been in a 100% social guild. Or maybe this dam blond hair is making me interpret what you're saying incorrectly. I would consider myself a social guild type person. I'm yet to be in a guild that says &quot;you must raid x times a week for y hours each raid&quot;. However even when I was in my teens my first guild  (Norrath's Fallen) took a few groups down to the Qeynos catacombs for the Lucias Dress quest. I currently see DragonChow as a social guild but yet last night Derkator the Vindicator and The Idol of Rallos Zek (guild first there) went down (with a hand from several TWC members). A few members got some very nice upgrades over the course of the night. Granted they're not on par with some of the gear coming out of Ssra, tier 4 planes or Vex Thal but were also nothing to sneeze at. <br>
<br>
Dragonchow has given me some things that I will feel like I can never repay regardless of how long I'm in there and how much I can possibly hope to do. Am I loyal to DC? Very much so. Several members of Echo of Valor helped me with things and in return I assisted others with trade skill items, quests, epic fights, etc. Was I loyal to Echo of Valor? for a couple of years and change. To a certain extent I'm still loyal to my friends that are in Echo of Valor.<br>
<br>
I think both of us would agree that having memebers disband themselves from your guild <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bites</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> regardless if you're in a social guild, raiding guild or something in between. If a guild really does nothing but provide another chat channel for people to hit on each other with then yes I would agree with you 100% about the loyalty part.<br>
<br>
Nandarie, if you're interpreting this as a flame or bashing please don't. I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from, not bash you or TWC at all.<br>

If you don't find a regular group of people to play with you'll generally level slower, and not have as much fun.  It's a lot easier when you know there's people you're going to be able to play with every time you log on.  It's also not a bad side effect to maybe make some friends.  That's what finding a social group means.  <p>-Tain<BR>

They earn a crapload of aaxp over a few months. They also get plenty of nice items over the course of several months because they earned the points and spent those points.<br>

Lo and behold person &quot;A&quot; notices several guilds in PoTime. TWC (or insert any other guild in existence really) has failed to make person &quot;A&quot; want to stay due to wanting to head to PoTime. Person &quot;A&quot; says &quot;the guild sucks, and fuck em. I want to be in PoTime and not dance around in VT.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, TWC did provide gear/services/etc to person &quot;A&quot; but didn't that person also provide something back to the guild? Did person &quot;A&quot; slow a mob? nuke it down? smack it around with a sword? shoot it with arrows? do combines on high end trade skill items? rezz and buff guildmates? etc.....

Person &quot;A&quot; earned points (sorta like I earn a paycheck) and spent those points (kinda like I spend money on my truck) on what they wanted.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, this is unavoidable, but unlike a smaller guild who will tag anyone on sight (EoV even tagged the eqemail scammer on an account he hacked) we have an extensive application system which allows us to evaluate each member to a point where we can get a pretty good feel for his motives.  Since the application process takes several months, no one who joins, gets a few items, and then leaves is using their time and effort very efficiently.<br>
<br>
Additionally, most of the people in TWC are either late night raiders, hydra players, or both.  We offer advantages to these people, and that is what keeps them in our guild.  What does a social guild offer players to keep them in?  Loot? Nah.  Compelling conversation?  Very rarely, if ever.<br>
<br>
Usually, social guilds are locked in an eternal struggle for members.  (No, I'm not including Dragonchow in this example).  Most never have anyone online to do anything.  Hence most die out.  They must recruit anything that walks in an attempt to keep from drying up, especially because of their usually low retention rate.  Said warrior being in Xsocial guild for 20 levels then leaving does them more of a favor for being online in guild chat than not being in the guild at all.  They should be thanking him for gracing them with his time.<br>
<br>
Why must I post in such an abrasive manner?  Because I hate hypothetical arguments.  First off, they are fictional, I would be much more eager to argue facts instead of a made-up situation that really proves nothing.  Second, it's posted in such a manner to make it appear that I have not yet considered such situations.  I understand what losing a member and being a stepping stone feels like.  TWC had to deal with it for a long time, and it is simply part of the game.  <br>
<br>
When it is a really good player (not just skill wise, but someone who is simply a kickass person) and you lose them to a higher guild, I usually chalk it up as the guild's fault for failing to retain the person leaving.  It's also motivation to become more powerful and keep that from happening.  Nowadays we rarely lose members at all to higher guilds (only a few to HnE) and our occasional reject members apply to ToN after losing their tags (/huggle Locuss, Alorea, and Hadorm).<br>
<br>
So what I am trying to say is that it sucks, it's part of the game, it should be met openly and dealt with, and it's the guild's responsibilty to keep its members happy. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Re: original poster, find a guild that is raiding things a 43 warrior can help with. Perhaps Kael somewhat, ToFS, Lower guk, etc. I don't know if they still exist but when I was a younger bard there were several family-style guilds that organized events for their members, got themselves into the planes (and not always with the 18 hour Fear crs), led Naggy and Vox raids, camped Seb keys, etc etc.<br>

In fact the answers and dialogue were very informative.  Thank you all who provided input.<br>
<br>
Since this is my first character and I’m learning along the way, it also looks like I made another erroneous assumption.  I had thought that at level 43 I was approaching raiding level – looks like I was wrong, (with a few exceptions.)   I’ll just continue working on leveling up some more.<br>
<br>
I’ll also try suggestions that a couple of you made. I’ll look through the guild boards on this site, and also see if I can join a guild or two on a raid – assuming at my level I would be a value add.  As for joining a “family-guild”, not sure what a family guild is except that I’m sure it’s different from a raiding guild and a social guild. I realize that a power-raiding guild is probably not in the cards for me because of RL time constraints, but maybe a less hardcore raiding guild, or some sort of hybrid - raiding/social guild - would work, provided such guilds exist.  Once I get my character leveled up a bit I could probably commit to 5-8 raids a month.<br>
<br>
I’ve gotten a couple possible guild names off the string here, but if any of you want to suggest any others - good, reputable guilds that might consider someone at my level - please post some names. Of course, I’m not assuming they’d take me, which would be presumptuous.  I know I’d have to meet some members, tag along on some raids, and prove myself (both from a game skill standpoint, but also as a fun person to hang with), which is only fair.<br>
<br>
I will say in response to a couple comments that no, I wouldn’t consider myself power hungry and I’m not looking for a series of guild “stepping stones” (which is why I started this string.)  If I was looking to power level or just take an easier road I’d have joined a guild long ago for the rez’s, hand-me-downs etc. I’m happy to do it the hard way and actually enjoy the process.<br>
<br>
I’m not going to say that I’d turn down loot, but fairness and fun is important to me. Because I’m great at producing absurdly low rolls with the /rand generator, I’m not looking for much raiding loot – at least not initially. Plus, I’ve managed to accumulate some decent gear in the bazaar (buying/selling) Instead, I’m looking for the additional variation, sense of camaraderie and excitement that I believe raiding will provide.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the feedback you’ve all provided so far, and any additional guild suggestions would again be appreciated.<br>

The basis of most guilds who call themselves &quot;family&quot; guilds is that the guild is more focused on friendships and companionship while playing the game than uber loot or the biggest and best mobs.  I'm a part of a family style guild that does weekend raids.  We can do many things, some of which are huge challenges for us due to numbers, but we know our guild will most always have limits and is never going to be the &quot;top guild&quot; on the server.  The thing is, those of us in the guild are playing the game mostly as relaxation and would rather raid lower zones with people we know well and enjoy playing the game with than the biggest and baddest places with people who are strangers.  Don't get me wrong.  We like to keep ourselves challenged and we want to see good items and new places -- but it is a secondary to other goals much of the time.<br>
<br>
I'm not dissing any guild who is a heavy raiding guild, nor guilds that are mearly social.  Everyone plays the game their way and has fun doing their own thing.  Its just a matter of finding out what you want in a guild and from the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frotttty>frotttty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/2/03 10:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5178.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An answer</span><hr size=1> Rather than trying to form some sort of vague and generalized notion of &quot;what a guild is&quot; and &quot;the correct manner in which to join guilds&quot; you ought to just group with people.

Don’t want everyone to think that I’m putting too much weight on this guild thing.  It’s not as though I’m naming my firstborn.  I’m just one of those people who tries to do his homework before making certain decisions. When I do make commitments, whether I say I’ll do something or when I join a group, I don’t take those commitments lightly.  <br>
<br>
I agree that in a perfect world I’d have the time to meet representatives of all the various guilds, group with some of each, get a good sense for what each guild was like and then make an informed decision. (And hopefully the guild that I chose would want me as a member.)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately though life’s never that easy, which is why I started this string.  Over the last 5 months in Crushbone, DSP etc, I’ve probably grouped with members of almost every guild that had members in my level range.  I’ve met some really great people, and gotten a couple dozen offers to join guilds.  <br>
<br>
In almost every case when I asked about the guild, the member said they loved it.  When 20 different people all tell you their guild is great it’s somewhat hard to make an informed decision between them. Which is why I declined the invitations.  (Granted, in the beginning I didn’t know enough about the game and guilds to ask the right questions.)<br>
<br>
I also have some good friends in guilds.  But oddly enough they are either in role playing/social guilds that they like (role playing is not my cup of tea.)  Or they are in smaller guilds which they joined early on, with little information and about which they are now having reservations.<br>
<br>
Though I’m sure it doesn’t exist I really wish there was a simple spreadsheet - similar to the zone level charts - that listed the following:<br>
<br>
Size of guild (I don’t need a huge guild, just one that has enough members to schedule a few events every week and does not need everyone’s attendance to have successful raids.)<br>
Percentage of members in each time zone (handy for weekday grouping/raiding)<br>
Percentage of members at each level range (20’s, 30’s, 40’s, 50’s, 60’s)<br>
Average number of raids or other activities per week. <br>
Role-playing guild? (Y/N).  Hard core raiding guild?  (Y/N)<br>
And lastly, has the guild been growing or contracting over the last 3-6 months?<br>
<br>
With this information - out of the 40+ guilds there may be on Saryrn (not sure how many there really are) - I could select the 4-6 that might, at first cut, be the best fit.  I could then group with members of those guilds and based on how things went make an informed decision.  Oh so easy, in a perfect world.   ;-)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I’ll take your advice. I’ll browse the web links on this site to try and find the guilds which fit my playing style and who don’t have uber level restrictions. Once I come up with a short list I’ll keep my eyes open for guild-members in game and try to get to know/play with a few.<br>
<br>
Thank you all again for all your suggestions, feedback, and advice.<br>
