I have had numerous people just give me gear,plat etc.. just out of shear kindness(and no room in bank probably :P ) I have NEVER had one person be rude or brash when ive sent one of my many /ooc noob questions through a zone hehe. So in a round about way Thanks to all who play on this server, i think it is a general server wide  attitude as i see in when i am in POK also, where alot of people congregate. I know if i ever get to be a high level character ill try to do the same for some lower lvl noob.<br>
Ok that all being said heres the second part,<br>
<br>
I cant help but feel like im missing out on some part of this game that now has its nasty clutches dug into me. Being in a Guild, Is it all that it seems to be? My reasons for wanting to be in one would be, hunting parties, events, learning new things(trade skills,languages,strategies) Raids when i get high enough, making friends, hanging out and having a regular group of people to go hunting with or to help or be helped. The only problem i have noticed with this is that alot of the guilds i have looked into are lvl 65 only or real high level. I can appreciate wanting to be Uber Loot machines, goodness knows i love to make plat and have twinked gear. BUT what happened to helping the little guy? Have the higher lvl people become so enamored with thier own wealth and greatness that it is all they care about? dont answer that, i think i already know the answer. I mean like i said before of the kind and generous people i have ran across i dont believe any of them were guildies, and sure the gear they gave prob wasnt good in most peoples eyes,but it is when your starter Tunic is the consitancy of Toilet Paper ill take it. So is there anyone out there that knows of a Mid level guild, that embodies any of the characteristics i mentioned above? And is looking for a lvl 29 Shammy connected to a 32 yr old guy that likes to have fun, drink beer and play EQ in large quantites?<br>
<br>
LOL After reading this i hope it doesnt come off as a flame or rant, just posting a noobs view after 2-3 months of gaming <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=klahhz>Klahhz</A> at: 4/24/03 8:04:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vagabond>Vagabond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 768<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/24/03 8:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5118.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 headed post</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have NEVER had one person be rude or brash when ive sent one of my many /ooc noob questions through a zone hehe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Hunting parties do happen easier with a guild to back you up, so Yes there.<br>
<br>
Events.  Most guilds don't have events, other than raids.  And GM events are big clusterfucks, so guild'd status doesn't matter much there.  Gona go with an &quot;Um... NO.&quot; to that point<br>
<br>
Learning new things:  The World wide web is your friend.  In the time it would take a guildy to explain how to make banded to you, you can just cruise to eqtraders, print out the recipie page, print out the &quot;what merchant sells what where&quot; pages, and have a hard copy to go off of, mark up, et all.  Strats, same thing.  Languages?  Not exactly important, but if you want, just offer plat in PoK, and afk for 20 min as they spam you to master.<br>

<br>
I would suggest you quit looking at the high end guilds.  There are quite a few lowbie, or mid-bie guilds out there.  The people your level, that you hunt with; if thier not wearing a Hi-bie tag (signifiying twink), then they are probably a guild your level.<br>
<br>
Most low and mid level guilds are not that vocal here.  The more vocal people here tend to also be the higher end players (be it ability, or just hrs wise).<br>
<br>
Most high end guilds are Raiding guilds.  They can't raid while dragging low/mid levels along, due to zone restrictions, and general fragility of the said lowbie.  So they don't tag them.<br>

I can see your point about raids, and not wanting or being able to drag a &quot;lowbie&quot; around, but, do these high lvl people raid every night? I just find it funny they have the lvl restrictions, i would think they would want to use those lvl 60+ toons to help groom future guildies, After all it seems these &quot;Uber&quot; guilds never are around longer than a year, perhaps because of the lack of new blood. I have been a member of a guild that plays 5 different games for 7 years and i believe we have lasted because of the influx of new people with a solid core of Old heads.

Sure, they're gonna teach you some stuff along the way, about how encounters should be approached and situations handled, but they don't want to have to show you step by step how to play your character.  <br>
<br>
Get in a smaller guild, get some experience playing your character, and try a little bit of everything.  See what makes the game click for you, on each level.  And if you find yourself chasing that carrot to the achieve the highest level of accomplishments, and you're a good enough player, you shouldn't have a problem getting into a higher-end guild someday down the road.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and yes... most raid-guilds do raid almost nightly, most between 5-7 nights per week. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=358285"> <br>

<br>
They count on the natural progression of players and get their new blood on the whole from the guilds just below them or people that have been in those guilds. <br>
<br>
The level limit makes sense also. If you are with 3-4 or 10 people that are 20 levels below the remainder of the guild, you will be left out of most activities because you can simply just not cope in the zones that these activities are planned- even if it is not a raid. Also grouping in xp groups is next to impossible because you either don''t get xp, dont contribute to the group or just simply can't zone into that zone.<br>
<br>
From the other side, if you are in a guild like that, you will feel useless, &quot;tolerated because you are a nciepreson or family/friend of person x in the guild&quot; etc. All that will take away so much of the fun you can have that it will kill eq as a game for you.<br>
<br>
I have seen this happen even with people just 4/5 levels lower that the remainder of the guild. <br>
<br>
I have some friends on the server i would love to get into our guild but i am not inviting them for the simple fact that they will not enjoy it at the moment. They are in other guilds and do their thing in there and occationally we do things together. I find that it works much better for all involved than dragging someone into a guild where they won't fit in with the remainder of the group<br>
<br>
So my advice would be to find a nice midlevel guild where you are on the lower end of teh membership and so can grow inside the guild/with the guild. If/when you outgrow the guild, it is time to look around again. Don't be afraid of doing that either. It is just as bad getting stuck in a guild as one of the 2/3 high-end people and the remainder is too far behind you in levels to actively be involved in guild activities ( there is only so much Mistmoore raiding you can cope with at level 55+ or buffin/recruiting sessions in Greater fay at level 50 :-P) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Night-blind Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2434<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/26/03 9:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5118.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 headed post</span><hr size=1> Find a guild with people in it that enjoy being level 30-ish and doing things that are a challenge at that level.

Ask them if they like it, what they think of it, and what sorts of things they do.  The &quot;lower level&quot; guilds I have been in tend to have a few more social oriented events, and fewer of the higher level guilds do this.  Lots of reasons for this that don't really merit going into.<br>
<br>
From lvl 1-40 of true newbie-hood I think of guilds being a place to meet new friends and as a way to learn more about the game.  After that, guilds tend to become different things to different types of players.  Raiding, exp groups, quest help, all become things that are needed for most higher level characters.  You can go alone or with a few friends you have met outside of guilds, but it gets more difficult.  When you see a guildtag you havn't seen before, do a /who all &quot;Guildname&quot; and see what levels and classes seem to come up.  Good luck! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spyrit123>Spyrit123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/29/03 5:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5118.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 headed post</span><hr size=1> if you find me on brash send me a tell and i got some hand-me-downs... its so rare to find an actual newb to eq /sigh they are like almost non-exsistant, you just get the higher level oldtimers making new level 1 alts and getting them pimped out. <p>CHECK MY GEAR<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=580352" target="top">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=580352</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylahrathsidhe>Taylah RathSidhe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/5/03 12:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5118.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 headed post</span><hr size=1> Nice choice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     My sister is guilded with Ring of Shadows on her cleric and loves it.<br>

I know they were the leaders of the guild and the few people from Rage that moved to saryrn during the split. <p>Fuggun Shiznitlit (retired) and Caan (TWC)</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showPrevMessage?topicID=5118.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showNextMessage?topicID=5118.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5118.topic&index=13><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.emailToFriend?topicID=5118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.threadControl?topicID=5118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom>Commons Room</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
