If you're reading this Megara, you might as well confess here since you do nothing but insult me when I talk to you. For everyone else that is reading this, the site admin notifed us who did it through IP tracing and logs. It was her account and only she had access to the files. I even asked her to transfer the account to me when I became GL. She didn't, I guess so she can pull one last act of idiocy on us. This has to be the most despicable thing I've ever seen anyone ever do. It just proves how frustrated and spiteful she really is.<br>
<br>
OOP is usually a honourable and respectful guild. Im surprised you guys take this kind of trash. She's done a good job of fooling us into believing we were friends. OOP be warned.<br>

And it doesnt suprise me in the least that she pulled that crap on Isengard. Ever since her failed attempt to win a popularity contest rid us of her she has been nothing but spiteful and vindictive. Ummm sorry Megara but you were a suck ass guild leader leading us nowhere and personally I say good riddance. We have done and will continue to do FAR better without you under the EXCELLENT leadership of Pelagia and team. It only goes to show how pathetic you are that you stoop so low as to TRY and screw over an entire guild full of people, many of them who you dont even KNOW and some of which you call your friends. But then I always knew you were pathetic. Anybody that supposedly has 2 masters degrees yet acts as arrogant, immature, and idiotic as you must be pathetic. At the end of the day your BS wont even matter because Isengard grows bigger and better now that we have a leader that actually LEADS us and SUPPORTS her officers instead of trying to belittle them in front of the entire guild. You have no class and never did. And to be honest I find you a laughable player and person in general. So um play your bullshit games because all they do is make us laugh at how desperate you are to take revenge on us for washing our hands of you. And did you think you wouldnt get caught? Are you that stupid? Or did you just not care? Either way just goes to show what kind of person you are. Might want to consider changing your sig to Megara, Saryrn loser shaman....seems more fitting to me. I sincerely hope OoP wakes up and boots you to the curb like the trash that you are. Oh and feel free to flame away Meg because frankly I dont care what you call me or Isengard because I have facts and truth on my side. Hope your IQ and degrees keep you company because whatever friends you HAD in Isengard you just pissed on and you know what they say...with friends like that who needs enemies? Well you have made an enemy of me Megara...not that you care and not that I expect you too. But if you want to play hardball thats what you are gonna get. Watch your back, ya never know whats gonna come back your way.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ranj0rgirldya>Ranj0rgirlDya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/28/03 5:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3083.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> FU MEGARA </span><hr size=1> By the way I should say this loud and clear for all to understand.....my previous post was MY OWN opinion not that of Isengard as a guild.

<br>
Megara (and her daughter) posted on our site over the weekend, requesting to be removed from the member roster.  I replied - we would if we had access. I believe I was the only person who replied, or perhaps even saw this post.<br>
<br>
So, Megara logged into the site, removed herself and Brena from the member list, and deleted the rest of the site - including all backup files saved on the server.  This was verified by the host administrator.<br>
<br>
Megara claimed to have &quot;friends&quot; in Isengard - those who followed her cluelessly until she bailed on her &quot;family&quot;.  She then immediately turned around and pissed on all of us with this loathsome act.  So many of our members gave her the benefit of every doubt she ever presented to us, probably against their better judgement.  The pity parties about the sorrows of her life are nothing but a bunch of bullshit, apparently.<br>
<br>
Your degrees have obviously taught you nothing of common sense, Megara.  Your lamb attitude will only take you so far before people start to see you for the pathetic person you truly are.  I hope OOP doesn't allow you to ride their coattails too long before they see your true colors. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=265136><font color=purple><font size=2.5>~Xynta Morwen~</font></font><br>

<br>
Uh... the only account I ever had to that website, I turned over all information to Gadena on months ago.  As far as I knew, you guys had changed the password and all that when I left.  And obviously, more people than me had access to the files, since I had given the account info to other Isengard members over time, and if you guys hadn't changed it, it's been the same for almost a year!<br>
<br>
But yeah, whatever, sure, I was finally was having fun with the game again, and I just couldn't stand that, so I wanted to torture myself by having to listen to Pelagia and Malkier more, so I decided to provoke them.  <br>
<br>
Someone suggested to me last night that Malk probably set up all this, since he was pissed at me and my daughter.  Seems the most rational explanation to me.  <br>
<br>
And yeah, I am ignoring you and Malk in game, Pelagia.  I am trying to enjoy it and have fun instead of getting into constant pissing contests with you.<br>
<br>
I am gonna go off and feed my alleged God complex for a while and ignore this board.  I am sick of hearing you guys beat this dead horse.

<br>
Never had any beef with anyone personally. Guild Leader, raid leader, whatever. It's just getting along with one another and killing stuff, hanging out, etc.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is that someone from Meg's IP did it.<br>
<br>
I feel that ranting and flaming is fairly inane, and I won't be dragged down to it's level (because I'll be beaten by experience). <br>
<br>
Malkier doing this would be funny, because, I don't think too many people in Isengard actually give a @#%$ about you anymore, Meg... you had always made it a point to talk about how you were the &quot;casual guild leader&quot; or something and you casually went *poof* one day. Yeah! Delete the boards so that we can suddenly think about how completely inept you are? &quot;You can't fire me because I quit!&quot; has quickly turned into &quot;If I can't have isengard, noone can!&quot;<br>
<br>
That's been the pattern for a long time: I finally thought we were out of it. &quot;Do stupid @#%$ to prove a point at the detriment to the guild as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then you talk about requesting to be removed from the members list. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND! I myself receive at least 15 tells a day asking me all about you, when will the madness end!? /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
The joke of this was simply what the @#%$ were you leading if you were rarely around. Seriously, if you had a problem with the lifestyle you should have backed out graciously. This made most all in the guild suspect some completely childish &amp; immature &quot;power struggle&quot; between folks who were visibly leading the raids (ie, the guild). I saw terra, malk, azo, pelagia, xynta, trinity, jacoby and others step up and actually steer the raids. I'd done that myself. <br>
<br>
But a big flashing red light and obnoxious siren went off every time someone had a problem and all that was returned was &quot;my reasons are secret, i am your casual guild leader&quot; indicating that you obviously weren't handling the task with poise.<br>
<br>
That's not a knock, none of this is. This whole thing is boring, especially realizing others have so small a life that you have to ruin other people's fun after being, essentially, excluded. Oh, wait, you stepped down after 3 weeks of hordes of people wondering what the hell was going on and why all the important members were angry and quitting. <br>
<br>
Then, we get a post from you: remove me from this list! <br>
<br>
Then we get more vaguities from Brena in a rambling guildchat thing like <br>
<br>
Brena tells the guild &quot;I'm going to type a bunch of hazy and abstract sentences&quot;<br>
Brena tells the guild &quot;and not explain anything&quot;<br>
Brena tells the guild &quot;because if I did I'd come off as irrational&quot;<br>
Brena tells the guild &quot;hopefully you haven't turned off guildchat&quot;<br>
<br>
Yawn.<br>
<br>
I suppose any publicity is good publicity so voicing my amusement at your joining Order of Phoenix is fairly futile, but damn that alters my vision of them a great deal.<br>
<br>
ps / awesome that we've derailed another useless thread about someone miscamping a spawn... really, it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pelagia>Pelagia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/28/03 3:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3083.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bot Wing Named</span><hr size=1> <br>

----Someone suggested to me last night that Malk probably set up all this, since he was pissed at me and my daughter. Seems the most rational explanation to me. ----<br>
<br>
<br>
Here come the Lies.. Dont take our word for it Megara, Go talk to Aereos, you know, the Site administrator. It was YOUR IP ADDRESS...or have you conveniently forgot that. Oh wait thats right..Its a big conspiracy against you and only you. You are the most worthless piece of trash I have ever met in this game. Look at what you're saying here...Malkier deleted our website, so we could blame it on you. <br>
<br>
Pathetic, I mean Pathetic.<br>
<br>
Please continue Megara so we can catch you in a web of lies.<br>

I want more train and KS stories!  Maybe Hareq whining about people passing him in BoT, cus he thinks I'd tell people not to so they can just be screwed over, too!  Then they could hang out with Hareq at the top of them stairs and cry in unison about how everyone is mean!<br>
