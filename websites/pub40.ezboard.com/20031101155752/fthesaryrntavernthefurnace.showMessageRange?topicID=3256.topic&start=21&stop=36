I felt more that some of the fight scenes went on too long, moreso than the dancing.  They were just all the same, another chance to show off neato-nifty-cool moves.  To me it got tired.  Too much focus on big fights.  The real agents were also a lot less impressive in this one, even though right at the beginning Neo comments after one seems to move faster that they were, &quot;upgrades.&quot;  No one else could last against an agent for any real amount of time in the first movie.  Now they're practically holding their own.  <br>
<br>
Some of the individual scenes were incredible though.  The highway chase was fantastic.  I found myself flinching as Trinity drove the motorcycle against traffic.  The &quot;ghost&quot; twins were very cool, albeit they served little purpose in the grand scheme of things.  I'd liked to have seen them used for something more.  <br>
<br>
Overall I thought it was just ok.  There were some great individual scenes, but I didn't feel like it all tied together as well as the first one.  And I'm not even one of these fanatics about the first movie, I thought it was just a good movie.  This one was a good visual showcase, and an ok movie.  <br>
<br>
But, I may very well go back to see it on the Imax screens for that very fact. <p>-Tain<BR>

<br>
<br>
Going into The Matrix: Reloaded, I wasn't worried if the fight scenes or special effects would measure up to the first film—it was the metaphysics that bothered me. The first Matrix was such a neat allegory of Gnostic philosophy, I was more concerned with how the Brothers Wachowski could successfully extend the metaphor into three films than whether they could pull off even more virtuoso examples of cinematic ass-stomping. What was mindblowing about the first movie, after all, wasn't the fight choreography or bullet time, but its brave assertion that the banal, day-to-day reality we live in isn't the real world. In that sense, all the wire-fu was just the candy coating on the red pill the filmmakers were offering to every high school student and cubicle slave in the world. (Though, since I study martial arts myself, I found the idea of kung fu as being metaphorical for something happening in hyper-reality, a la Thibault's mysterious circle, to be pretty darn appealing.)<br>
<br>
Thankfully, Reloaded more than allayed my fears, even if it seems that half the reviewers either didn't understand what the Wachowskis were getting at, or else were only paying attention during the highway chase. Watching the movie, I was personally less impressed by the fists of digital fury than by the Brothers' evident familiarity with the Dead Sea Scrolls and the theology of Origen of Alexandria. Seen in the light of the books they're referencing, the movie's plot is brilliant; of course, to the non-initiate, the characters' actions and dialogue seems arbitrary and incomprehensible, and the exposition is just filler between car crashes. It would seem, therefore, that a bit of exegesis of The Matrix: Reloaded is warranted. But be warned: If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read on. There are some major spoilers.<br>
<br>
Much like that other great Keanu Reeves vehicle, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, The Matrix: Reloaded centers around the hero's journey into the Underworld. Frazier, in The Golden Bough, notes that it is a prophetess—in this case, the Oracle—who sends the hero off on his journey, from where he returns with special knowledge. And, of course, that's just what Neo does, though it would have been a while lot more amusing if he'd had Alex Winter along. (The Oracle probably isn't entirely benign, by the way, even though she may not consciously intend any harm: She is, after all, the one who sent Neo on the path to the Core.)<br>
<br>
Neo's first task is to rescue the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim, doing his best Rick Moranis impression) from the Merovingian, who is a daemon—in both senses of the word—left over from a previous version of the Matrix. (The Merovingians were the ruling Frankish dynasty; they were succeeded by Charlemagne's family, the Carolingians, and then by the Capetians, who thought they were descended from Christ.) The guy in the health food store where I buy my granola and soy milk thinks that The Merovingian was one of Neo's predecessors, but all the explanation I need, as well as the way I understand his obvious fascination with human pleasures, is found in Genesis 6:4—&quot;There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them. . .&quot; According to various sources, including Kabbalah, this mating of men and angels (here, a computer program from an earlier version of the Martrix) is what produced various monsters, such as the vampires and wraiths that serve the Merovingian. Dante, bringing a Christian sensibility to the proceedings, placed these monsters in his Inferno. Thus, though the Merovingian is sort of an antediluvian remnant of the former world, he's also (as is shown by the fact that his wife is named Persephone) kind of like Hades, the holder of the keys to the underworld. What the Keymaker does, much like the golden bough the Sybil gives Aeneas, is open doors and permit Neo access to the underworld—or, in this case, the Core.<br>
<br>
After the requisite battles and explosions, Neo gets into the Core and finds The Architect. Considering that The Architect built the Matrix, you might think that he's God. Of course, he's nothing of the sort. In Gnostic theology, it is Satan, not God, who has created the world in order to imprison humanity. It is also the Architect who is unleashing the Sentinels to destroy Zion; that is, beginning the Battle of Armageddon. It is my prediction that in the third and final film, it will be revealed that there is a power behind the Architect, and that he is the one who sent the One into the Matrix. It is also my prediction that this guy will look a lot like Neo.<br>
<br>
The important thing is choosing what to believe from the raft of condescending exposition that the Architect inflicts on Neo. He says, basically, that though ninety-nine percent of humans believe in the illusion of the Matrix, there is that troublesome one percent (comparable to the few awakened Gnostic true believers) who refuse to believe in the created world. This tends to produce massive amounts of instability, and crashes the system. (Not coincidentally, most of the people in Zion seem to be black or Hispanic, which makes perfect sense: If you're a white suburban Matrix resident, driving your Matrix SUV to your Matrix golf club, why doubt the nature of reality?) The solution is that they allow the dissidents to escape to Zion, which they can then periodically destroy. They have also created the Prophecy of the One, who is in fact a device sent by the machines into the &quot;real&quot; world so that his knowledge of humanity may be integrated into the system in order to further perfect the Matrix-illusion, and then allowed to re-start Zion so that the cycle can begin again. The idea of multiple creations and a cycle of created and destroyed worlds is, needless to say, also found in theologies as wildly variant as the Mayan and the Buddhist.<br>
<br>
The idea that the Prophecy—and Zion—were just another means of control is lifted right out of French philosophy. The first movie made use of Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation; this movie seems to be dipping into Foucault and Derrida, who wrote that the systems of power and control are all-pervasive, and language is one of the ways they make their influence felt. The Prophecy is, like all prophecies, speech, and thus language. More importantly, it is a religion, and, as John Zerzan writes, the purpose of a religion is to manipulate signs, that is, words, for the purpose of control. Zion is the longed-for millennial promised land; by keeping the war between good and evil foremost in their hearts, even the freed humans are kept from doubting their own world, from thinking too hard about why things are the way they are.<br>
<br>
Understanding why things are the way they are requires an understanding of another holy text: Asimov's Laws of Robotics. The machines, as demonstrated by Smith's need to try to kill Neo even after being &quot;freed,&quot; don't have free will. (Likewise, in Gnostic theology, angels and other such divine beings also don't have free will—only humans do.) The bit about the machines needing human bio-energy to survive, as Morpheus (the dreamer) explained in the first movie, is bullshit. The machines keep humanity alive but imprisoned, even after taking over the world, because they were created to serve people. In other words, the machines would like to destroy humanity, but they CAN'T. Instead, they need a human to make the choice.<br>
<br>
As the Architect reveals, Neo is not the first One, but rather the sixth. Why the sixth? The answer is that Neo's five previous incarnations represent the Five Books of Moses that make up the Old Testament. Neo (representing Christ, and thus the New Testament) differs from his five predecessors in his capacity to love. In the work of Origen of Alexandria and other Church Fathers, it is love (&quot;eros&quot; in Greek) that compels Christ to come down from the heavens to redeem humanity. Furthermore, &quot;neo&quot; means &quot;new&quot;—as in &quot;New Covenant.&quot; In Neo, the machines have finally found the iteration of the One who will make the illogical choice of saving Trinity and dooming humanity. [Note to the theology geeks who've been e-mailing me: I know the difference between eros and agape, but Origen used both terms for reasons I'd have to delve into pre-Socratic philosophy to explain.]<br>
<br>
This is the Architect's real purpose in giving Neo a choice between two doors. At once all human and all machine, rather than being a device to refine the Matrix into a more perfect simulation of reality, re-found Zion, and thus continue the endless cycle of death and rebirth—as the Architect says he is—the purpose of the One is to be manipulated into destroying all of humanity. However, not having free will themselves, the machines are not able to comprehend it in others—and thus Neo, being also human, is a bit of a wild card. It is Neo's destiny—as was Christ's in Origen's theology—to break the cycle of death and rebirth, and offer humanity a new future. This is shown by the fact that, by the end of the movie, Neo (and also, incidentally, Smith) gain power over machines in the &quot;real world&quot;—which shows that he has power not only over the first—level simulated world of the Matrix, but also the second-level simulation of Zion.<br>

I share Cogs opinion that there really is a Zion, however i'm willing to entertain the notion that the that the first movie was a matrix within a matrix. everytime they supposedly left the matrix they, merely entered another matrix.<br>
<br>
that is the only way i know of to explain how Neo lived from being shot multiple times in the first one by agent smith and the only way i can explain of how he revivied trinity, from being dead and morpheous seeing &quot;carrier signal lost&quot; and how neo stopped the sentinel with super human abilities.<br>

The action mostly bored me (portions of the Smith sequence and the chase were cool, but both were too long), but I enjoyed the movie a lot, mostly because I did not expect it to so unapolagetically talk in code.  But then, I like my science fiction as dense as possible.<br>
The great flaw of the film compared to the original, I think, is that it does not integrate its action with its metaphorical mishmash anywhere near as well.  MATRIX RELOADED has a severely split personality, and as a result a lot of people seem to have split opinions on it.<br>
I have nothing but evil thoughts about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Attack of the Clones</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->; the Yoda thing enraged me.

I think many people came to this expecting that same shock value, but the story had to evolve, so many people thought it was just the same old thing.<br>
<br>
The architect tries to force Neo to make choices based on logic. Think the idea they were trying to convey is that love tends to defy logic, so Neo is making choices that he shouldnt make, logically, because of his love for Trinity. I think the idea of &quot;Love defies Logic&quot; will be the key to destroying the matrix in the 3rd movie somehow.<br>
<br>
So the whole grand matrix scheme, which is based on a series of logical choices isn't going as planned. Neo simply wont follow the logical path. <br>
<br>
I had a few problems with the movie also. The combat music just did not &quot;fit&quot; at all. Some scenes took way too long, &quot;aka, the xion tribal dance scene&quot; and some of the fight scenes didn't seem necessary. &quot;aka, the weapons fight scene with the french man's goons&quot;, although, they did display superhuman abilities, so maybe the matrix evolved some as Neo did, or maybe Neo only meant to delay them, dunno, but it seemed like he was fighting people he should have dispatched effortlessly.<br>
<br>
As in the first movie, I enjoyed the character of the Oracle. I also liked the Keymaster. I'm inclined to agree with the &quot;matrix in a matrix&quot; theory, ala the 13th floor. (B movie with a similar story) For some reason though, something is bugging me. The architect keeps making references to &quot;the anomoly&quot;, which we are supposed to think, is Neo. I'm starting to think it's Agent Smith. He is the only being in the matrix to transcend to the xion world, to my knowledge. Just a hunch.<br>
<br>
I missed the previews at the end for the next matrix, so I'll have to go watch it again. Perhaps I'll pick up on some more clues, as I watched the first one several times, and always seemed to pickup on a new aspect of the storyline. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/Sig_BryJar.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayrabofsaryrn>Hayrab of Saryrn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/26/03 9:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3256.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dissapointment *SPOILERS*</span><hr size=1> **WARNING: LOTS of Spoilers included**<br>
<br>
     Top 10 reasons Matrix Reloaded Sucked:<br>
<br>
Wachowski_Brother01 and Wachowski_Brother02 will henceforth be referred to as 01 and 02.<br>
<br>
1.) I don't pay $8 to see &quot;To be continued&quot;, it doesn't belong in cinema. I expect to see this bullshit watching 80s sitcoms. It would have been better with a hard transition to credits than a slap in the face.<br>
<br>
2.) If you're going to make me see Neo's ass give me a goddamn trinity tit shot WTF!<br>
<br>
3.) The scene in xion is 100% ace and gary gay.<br>
<br>
4.) 01 tells 02 &quot;Hey, people really liked the fight scenes in the first one lets have 30 minute fights in this one, I mean more is better right?&quot;<br>
<br>
5.) Neo pulling the bullet out of trinity was ok, but restarting her heart had me laughing at what looked like it was supposed to be a serious moment.<br>
<br>
6.) 02 tells 01 &quot;The fights in the first one looked too good, lets make neo look like stretch armstrong with this new computer!&quot;<br>
<br>
7.) 01 tells 02 &quot;I think we should give neo the ability to fly for no apparent reason, and umm I really like this new ground ripple effect I downloaded last night that we can use with it!&quot;<br>
<br>
8.) 02 tells 01 &quot;Ok ok, even better lets put 2 twin bad guys in the movie that don't do anything but look cool!&quot;<br>
<br>
9.) Could the architect guy please talk faster?<br>
<br>
10.) Jada Pinkett Smith can't act and it looked like she was given a part in the movie as a favor.<br>
<br>
     Now that all the negativity is out. I enjoyed the first matrix immensly I thought it was one of the most original movies to come out of hollywood in a long while. The only complaint I had was Keanu Reeves acting or the crappy lines 01 and 02 gave him.<br>
<br>
     The entire time during my viewing of the second movie all I could think was &quot;Wow, they took everything in the first one and made it bigger, longer, and more obsurd&quot;. It's &quot;sequel syndrome&quot;, you've got a big hit on your hands you don't want to screw it up but you also run the risk of being too boring. It looked like they did all the fight scenes and then threw in all the stuff about the matrix to try and continue the story.<br>
<br>
Btw, if I made any spelling errors, fuck off.<br>

Not trying to debunk your opinions of the movie Hay, just giving my perspective on the points I agree were most disagreeable, I quiet enjoyed it both times i went to see it, but i can see with all they hype and 4 years expectation, everyone was probably a little let down.<br>
<br>
I do think they are in a matrix inside a matrix, mostly because how would the exiled/rogue programs be able to survive a system wipe, if not by uploading themselves out of the obsolete system?<br>
<br>
My biggest question after watching the movie 2X is What are the levels of survival the machines are will to sink to?<br>
<br>
Over all I certainly enjoyed the film, and my expectations are high for revolutions, but I would be lying if I didn't say this film didn't live up to they hype.<br>

<br>
Star Wars.<br>
As a movie, it stood on its own.  At the end of the movie, evil (DeathStar) was vanquished, and all was right with the galaxy.  Except that Vader was still lurking around.  The ending leaves us thinking &quot;what could happen next?&quot; but with peace of mind.<br>
If Star Wars had sucked ass, most of us would never have heard of it, and it would be sitting on a dusty video store shelf next to Solarbabies. And it wouldn't matter how many sequels and prequels Lucas wrote. But people did like Star Wars, and Lucas was bank rolled to create Empire.<br>
Empire is not a movie on its own.  Imagine somebody who's never heard of the Star Wars trilogy renting and watching JUST Empire.  They would have sooo many questions about what came before and what came after. And they would return it thinking it was a crappy movie for having such a downer for an ending.  The ending of Empire did nothing but lead up to Jedi.<br>
Jedi put a cap on the story line.  The evil is definitely destroyed this time.  Lucas would have a hard time convincing people that the Emperor had an escape pod down at the bottom of the shaft which Vader threw him.<br>
<br>
So far The Matrix is following the same pattern.<br>
The Matrix was a fine movie on its own.  Evil (Smith, and presumably all Agents) is vanquished.  Except the Matrix is still lurking around.  Neo flies off, leaving us thinking &quot;what could happen next?&quot; but with peace of mind.<br>
Imagine somebody seeing JUST Matrix: Reloaded.  At the end of the movie: &quot;Hey, there's that guy the Agent Smith jumped into lying next to Neo.&quot; [CUT TO BLACK] <br>
And if Revolutions doesn't end the story line, I think there's gonna be rioting in the streets.<br>
<br>
I've thought of a few other movies that follow the same pattern:<br>
<br>
Back to the Future<br>
The first one did well on its own.  At the end evil is vanquished (in this case &quot;evil&quot; is the problems the Delorian creates).  Except the Delorian is still lurking around.  They all fly off in the Delorian, leaving us thinking &quot;what could happen next?&quot; but with peace of mind.  (I don't think they originally planned on making sequels, despite that it said &quot;to be continued&quot;)<br>
BttF2 ended with Doc getting zapped into the Wild West, and even showed clips from BttF3.<br>
At the end of BttF3 the &quot;evil&quot; Delorian is destroyed, thus ending the story.  They even put &quot;The End&quot; at the end.<br>
<br>
X-Men<br>
Again, this one did well on its own.  It ended with evil (Magneto) being vanquished, but still lurking around.  And Mystique posing as the Senator left us thinking.<br>
X2 probably could stand up on its own better than others.  It ended with Jean getting washed away (a definite downer).  But if you noticed the faint orange glow in the water where she fell, and know a bit about Marvel comics, you can see the &quot;Pheonix&quot; rising, leading up to the next (but maybe not last) movie.<br>
<br>
Terminator<br>
It did well on its own.  Evil (the Terminator, duh) was vanquished.  But the future is still uncertain.<br>
T2 again did okay on its own, but the ending definitely left the door open for another movie, what with them driving down a dark road. (BtW they had created a happy ending with Sarah playing with her grand children in the park, but it didn't go over well with test audiences.)<br>
I've seen teasers for T3.  The robots are in the process of taking over the world.  If the evil isn't permenantly destroyed after this one, we might see T4 and T5.<br>
<br>
I feel the Star Wars prequels are a trilogy in themselves.  Of course the feeling of continuation is a bit forced since we're expecting them, and we pretty much know whats going to happen.<br>
Phantom Menace ended with evil (droids and the Federation) being vanquished.  But the Emperor/Palpatine(sp?) is still lurking around.<br>
At the end of Attack of the Clones we're just waiting to see how Anakin finally turns over to the dark side, or what's the circumstances of Luke and Leia's birth.<br>
I suppose the end of Episode 3 wouldn't see the final destruction of evil. /shrug<br>
<br>
<br>
So the trilogy formula:<br>
1st movie - stands well on its own; evil is dealt with but not permanently<br>
2nd movie - a lead in to the 3rd movie<br>
3rd movie - the end of the story line; evil is wiped out for good<br>
<br>
I noticed a few trilogies that don't fit the formula:<br>
Beverly Hills Cop, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Evil Dead, Lord of the Rings<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
While watching Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones, I noticed a pattern in all the Star Wars movies.  There's a seperation of Jedi fighting (with light sabers), and everybody else fighting (with blasters and space ships).<br>
Star Wars: Vader &amp; ObiWan dueling while everybody else blows up the DeathStar<br>
Empire: Luke &amp; Vader dueling while Han gets frozen in carbonite<br>
Jedi: Luke, Vader &amp; Emperor dueling while Ewoks and everybody else blow up DeathStar2<br>
Phantom Menace: QuiGonJinn, ObiWan &amp; DarthMaul dueling while JarJar and Anakin destroy the droids and Federation<br>
Attack of the Clones: Yoda &amp; CountDooku/DarthTyranus dueling while the cloned storm troopers destroy the droids<br>
Episode 3: Obiwan &amp; Anikan/Vader dueling while ????<br>
<br>
There's a similar seperation in the first two Matrix movies.<br>
Matrix: Neo is fighting Agent Smith in the matrix while the Nebekenezzer(sp?) is being attacked by the squiddy in the real world<br>
Reloaded: The Architect is making Neo choose doors in the matrix while Zion is getting attacked by the squiddies in the real world (we don't see the battle)<br>

Well here is where they went wrong with creating a T3. The end of T2 should have been it. If all went as they said, then the destruction of the T-1000 and Arnold's Terminator Unit should have caused all hell to break loose in the time stream. <br>
<br>
John Conner should have poofed from existance, while Sarah should have gone back to what she would have been doing 12-13 years down the line from the original. Also, the creator at cyberdyne systems would not be dead and that company would most likely be bankrupt. They destroyed the arm, the chip and any evidence that those machines were ever in existance before the future time line. <br>
<br>
The protector from the first movie would have never been sent back in time, starting this entire mess, because John Conner wouldn't be there to do so. <br>
<br>
The end of T2 should have been the end. Unless they intend on T3 being the time line before T1(meaning before John Conner sends his father back in time to protect his mother) to show how it got that far. <p><a href=http://www.hneguild.com/profile.asp?name=Garbhad><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~cblack87/Garbsig.jpeg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=snufffilmjenkins@thesaryrntavern>Snuff Film Jenkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/28/03 8:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3256.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix: Reloaded</span><hr size=1> A trilogy for movies usually follows the 1-stand well on own 2-lead in 3-conlusion type because of the fact that often the 1st one will be the last one if it sucked and they have no budget for 2 and 3. The Lord of the rings however, is the example of what I call a true trilogy. It flows seemlessly through all 3 parts and one part of it could not be its own work. <br>
<br>
From what I gathered seeing the T3 trailers it looks like it might fit somewhere in the middle of T1 and T2 or something. It looks pretty lackluster to me and I will probably just wait for it to come straight to video. As far as the whole time travel thing goes you gotta remember that there is infinite possibilities with that (at least in a writing sense). someone can always screw around with the past and make this or that happen. Few movies have portrayed anything to do with past time travel very well. the terminators amongst the worst. The shwarzenegger action bullshit is good for what it is though, no need to go into philosophy about it.<br>
<br>
Ah yes I originally intended to touch on the Matrix. I thought it was alright. Some amazing philosophy behind it all. Basically I knew it was just going to be a tie-in for part 3, wich better kick all sorts of ass or I want my money back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zvensabbyth1>zvensabbyth1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/4/03 8:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3256.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix: Reloaded</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

if you all remember, arnold's arm was ripped off in the second one, when he was fighting the t-1000 and the t-1000 knocked his punk ass out.<br>
<br>
on the second matrix, i have thought about the matrix inside a matrix theory and seem to agree.  but if you think back to the architect, the door on the left was to pick 20 or so people to restart zion, and the door on the right would lead to humanity's end.  either which way, at the end of the movie there are still humans alive in the world to start another zion.  either which door would have lead to just about the same thing.<br>
