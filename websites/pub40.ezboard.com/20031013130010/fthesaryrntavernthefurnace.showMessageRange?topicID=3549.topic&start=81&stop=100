9/11 Mastermind: Plan Involved 10 Planes  <br>
 <br>
4 hours ago  <br>
 <br>
By JOHN SOLOMON, Associated Press Writer <br>
 <br>
WASHINGTON - Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, has told American interrogators that he first discussed the plot with Osama bin Laden in 1996 and that the original plan called for hijacking five commercial jets on each U.S. coast before it was modified several times, according to interrogation reports reviewed by The Associated Press.<br>
<br>
Mohammed also divulged that, in its final stages, the hijacking plan called for as many as 22 terrorists and four planes in a first wave, followed by a second wave of suicide hijackings that were to be aided possibly by al-Qaida allies in southeast Asia, according to the reports.<br>
<br>
Over time, bin Laden scrapped various parts of the Sept. 11 plan, including attacks on both coasts and hijacking or bombing some planes in East Asia, Mohammed is quoted as saying in reports that shed new light on the origins and evolution of the plot of Sept. 11, 2001.<br>
<br>
Addressing one of the questions raised by congressional investigators in their Sept. 11 review, Mohammed said he never heard of a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi who provided some rent money and assistance to two hijackers when they arrived in California.<br>
<br>
Congressional investigators have suggested Bayoumi could have aided the hijackers or been a Saudi intelligence agent, charges the Saudi government vehemently deny. The FBI has also cast doubt on the congressional theory after extensive investigation and several interviews with al-Bayoumi.<br>
<br>
In fact, Mohammed claims he did not arrange for anyone on U.S. soil to assist hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi when they arrived in California. Mohammed said there &quot;were no al-Qaida operatives or facilitators in the United States to help al-Mihdhar or al-Hazmi settle in the United States,&quot; one of the reports state.<br>
<br>
Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were on the plane that was flown into the Pentagon.<br>
<br>
Mohammed portrays those two hijackers as central to the plot, and even more important than Mohammed Atta, initially identified by Americans as the likely hijacking ringleader. Mohammed said he communicated with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar while they were in the United States by using Internet chat software, the reports states.<br>
<br>
Mohammed said al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were among the four original operatives bin Laden assigned to him for the plot, a significant revelation because those were the only two hijackers whom U.S. authorities were frantically seeking for terrorist ties in the final days before Sept. 11.<br>
<br>
U.S. authorities continue to investigate the many statements that Mohammed has made in interrogations, seeking to eliminate deliberate misinformation. But they have been able to corroborate with other captives and evidence much of his account of the Sept. 11 planning.<br>
<br>
Mohammed told his interrogators the hijacking teams were originally made up of members from different countries where al-Qaida had recruited, but that in the final stages bin Laden chose instead to use a large group of young Saudi men to populate the hijacking teams.<br>
<br>
As the plot came closer to fruition, Mohammed learned &quot;there was a large group of Saudi operatives that would be available to participate as the muscle in the plot to hijack planes in the United States,&quot; one report says Mohammed told his captors.<br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia was bin Laden's home, though it revoked his citizenship in the 1990s, and he reviled its alliance with the United States during the Gulf War and beyond. Saudis have suggested for months that bin Laden has been trying to drive a wedge between the United States and their kingdom, hoping to fracture the alliance.<br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence has suggested that Saudis were chosen, instead, because there were large numbers willing to follow bin Laden and they could more easily get into the United States because of the countries' friendly relations.<br>
<br>
Mohammed's interrogation report states he told Americans some of the original operatives assigned to the plot did not make it because they had trouble getting into the United States.<br>
<br>
Mohammed was captured in a March 1 raid by Pakistani forces and CIA operatives in Rawalpindi. He is being interrogated by the CIA at an undisclosed location.<br>
<br>
He told interrogators about other terror plots that were in various stages of planning or had been temporarily disrupted when he was captured, including one planned for Singapore.<br>
<br>
The sources who allowed AP to review the reports insisted that specific details not be divulged about those operations because U.S. intelligence continues to investigate some of the methods and search for some of the operatives.<br>
<br>
The interrogation reports make dramatically clear that Mohammed and al-Qaida were still actively looking to strike U.S., Western and Israeli targets across the world as of this year.<br>
<br>
Mohammed told his interrogators he had worked in 1994 and 1995 in the Philippines with Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah on the foiled Bojinka plot to blow up 12 Western airliners simultaneously in Asia.<br>
<br>
After Yousef and Murad were captured, foiling the plot in its final stages, Mohammed began to devise a new plot that focused on hijackings on U.S. soil.<br>
<br>
In 1996, he went to meet bin Laden to persuade the al-Qaida leader &quot;to give him money and operatives so he could hijack 10 planes in the United States and fly them into targets,&quot; one of the interrogation reports state.<br>
<br>
Mohammed told interrogators his initial thought was to pick five targets on each coast, but bin Laden was not convinced such a plan was practical, the reports stated.<br>
<br>
Mohammed said bin Laden offered him four operatives to begin with _ al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi as well as two Yemenis, Walid Muhammed bin Attash and Abu Bara al-Yemeni.<br>
<br>
&quot;All four operatives only knew that they had volunteered for a martyrdom operation involving planes,&quot; one report stated.<br>
<br>
Mohammed said the first major change to the plans occurred in 1999 when the two Yemeni operatives could not get U.S. visas. Bin Laden then offered him additional operatives, including a member of his personal security detail. The original two Yemenis were instructed to focus on hijacking planes in East Asia.<br>
<br>
Mohammed said through the various iterations of the plot, he considered using a scaled-down version of the Bojinka plan that would have bombed commercial airliners, and that he even &quot;contemplated attempting to down the planes using shoes bombs,&quot; one report said.<br>
<br>
The plot, he said, eventually evolved into hijacking a small number of planes in the United States and East Asia and either having them explode or crash into targets simultaneously, the reports stated.<br>
<br>
By 1999, the four original operatives picked for the plot traveled to Afghanistan to train at one of bin Laden's camps. The focus, Mohammed said, was on specialized commando training, not piloting jets.<br>
<br>
Mohammed's interrogations have revealed the planning and training of operatives was extraordinarily meticulous, including how to blend into American society, read telephone yellow pages, and research airline schedules.<br>
<br>
A key event in the plot, Mohammed told his interrogators, was a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000, that included al-Mihdhar, al-Hazmi and other al-Qaida operatives. The CIA learned of the meeting beforehand and had it monitored by Malaysian security, but it did not realize the significance of the two eventual hijackers until just before the attacks.<br>
<br>
The interrogation reports state bin Laden further trimmed Mohammed's plans in spring 2000 when he canceled the idea for hijackings in East Asia, thus narrowing it to the United States. Bin Laden thought &quot;it would be too difficult to synchronize&quot; attacks in the United States and Asia, one interrogation report quotes Mohammed as saying.<br>
<br>
Mohammed said around that time he reached out to an al-Qaida linked group in southeast Asia known as Jemaah Islamiyah. He began &quot;recruiting JI operatives for inclusion in the hijacking plot as part of his second wave of hijacking attacks to occur after Sept. 11,&quot; one summary said.<br>
<br>
Jemaah Islamiyah's operations chief, Riduan Isamuddin Hambali, had attended part of the January 2000 meeting in Kuala Lumpur but Mohammed said he was there at that time only because &quot;as a rule he had to be informed&quot; of events in his region. Later, Hambali's operative began training possible recruits for the second wave, according to the interrogation report.<br>
<br>
One of those who received training in Malaysia before coming to the United States was Zacarias Moussaoui, the Frenchman accused of conspiring with the Sept. 11 attacks. Moussaoui has denied being part of the Sept. 11 plot, and U.S. and foreign intelligence officials have said he could have been set for hijacking a plane in a later wave of attacks.<br>

You know, all I hear nowadays is how Bush has done this wrong and that wrong.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, don't just bitch about it.  Come up with a new productive point of view. Present this idea to the public.  And then let it take form from there.. none of us have all the answers but when ideas are tossed around, amazing new ideas can be formed.<br>
<br>
Just sick of all the negative bullshit in the media and politics these days.<br>
<br>
For the love of god, why are there so many people who always seem to think they know what is wrong, yet have no good ideas on how to make it better.<br>

How about bush re integrate the US into the civilized world by getting back on board with kyoto, stop his plan of a nuclear defense shield and join the war crime tribunal.<br>
<br>
You may not realize it (or care about it for that matter) but a big part of the world who normally isnt upset with the US is frankly pissed off at their foreign policy. <br>
<br>
Now before you say fuck them just think of the strain your economy and millitary is suffering from invading iraq. Now add canada, france, germany, russia, china  to the list. How long do you think you can occupy those countries? And as soon as Tony Blair is out of office you can add the UK to that list.<br>
<br>

Do you particularly like this individual? Or are you only agruing it because it was Bush who made the decision? How did you feel when Clinton sent troops to Bosnia? Or Yugoslavia? Heres another good question...Did Clinton ever ask for money to restock the US's depleted military stockpiles when he bombed 4 countries in 7 months? So what happens when we have to restock this? Does Clinton magically make this go away? Or does he just pass it on?<br>
<br>
Clinton's years were a party compared to what Bush is going through. Do I like of the military getting sent there? No, but I do see why they need to go. I've got friends in the forces and I dont wish any harm to them. At the same time from reading their letters I can see that they know why they are there. <br>
<br>
Oh, and Clinton never really got congress's approval to send troops. He just sent them. Yet we praise him?<br>

I'm trying to deside if you're really this stupid, or if this is just the standard &quot;he thinks differently than I do, burn him!&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
Of course I want to have Saddam's hot throbing cock in me.  I mean, he's crazy, he has proffessed a great dislike towards my nation (among others), and his every word is law in his country.  Lets not forget the rapists and murderers that he calls children.  I want us all to be one happy family.<br>
<br>
/Sarcasm off.<br>
<br>
I won't hide the fact that I dislike Bush and his puppetters.  But you know, if we had found conclusive proof, and I'm talking hard, uncomprimizing proof, that Saddam did the deed, and was gearing up to do it again; I'd have no problem with us going in there, slapping him around, et all.<br>
<br>
But he didn't.  We have yet to have any proof that he even dreamed of this anyplace outside his bedroom after the lights go off and he's all warm and snuggly in his feetsy PJs.<br>
<br>
Did he point and laugh, and maybe even throw a party when he found out that Bin Ladin finally got it right?  Probably, but I highly doubt he was alone in this.  We've pissed off petty dictators, drug lords, and all arround pisant badguys all over this globe.<br>
<br>
So why didn't we take over all the other Bumfuckistans out there?<br>
<br>
Bush n'Co. are doing a bang up job at draining the US of money and of able boddied solders.  They, or the megacorps they are only marginally distanced from are doing a bang up job and soaking every last blood soaked sheckel (ruble? euro? what ever goes for cash in the middle east at the moment) out of this pissant little country in the middle of nowhere.<br>
<br>
And I'm not even getting into the loss of personal freedoms his crew has been responcable for using the fear of future 9-11's as his crowbar.  Nor am I talking about his deplorable natureal conservation record, or his blantant abuse of the whole keeping church and state separate thing.<br>
<br>
Was Clinton perfect? Hell no.  Has any of our presidents? No, they've all had faults and dirty little secrets.  But where as Clinton will make the rolls as one of the few that ever got impeached, and that on the technical that he lied to congress about having an affair; Bush may very well go down with the ranks of Presidents who have done the most harm to this country.<br>
<br>
And really, for me, lieing about getting your dick sucked is a far lesser offence then lieing about the reasons to start a war, profiting from said war, and then leaving said mess for  the next Prez to try to clean up (be it 2004 or 2008, I really doubt the middle east and Iraq will be anywhere near where it was before all this shit went down)<br>
<br>
As an aside, while democrasy has all the good things we know and love about it, god it sucks for trying to actually get anything done.  Even the Prez had the most perfect idea for solving world hunger while at the same time insureing world peace, he could never get it implimented. First 2 years of first term cleaning up for the last prez, 1 year of doing stuff, 1 year of campaining to try to win another 4 years.  Assuming they win the extention, you got 2 years more of actual usable time to do stuff, and then the last 2 years is crammed with getting as many of your parties toadies into power as possible so that even if your party loses the next election, you'll still hobble that dispicable dude_from_other_party_01 so bad he can't do shit for 2 years into his first term.... <p>Ninen of Saryrn<br>
