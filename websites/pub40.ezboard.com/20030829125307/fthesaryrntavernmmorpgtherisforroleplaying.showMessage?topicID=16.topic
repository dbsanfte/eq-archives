<br>
Feel free to add to the story...<br>
<br>
I was a younger warrior then, in a younger version of what had become known as Permafrost. There is the constant threat of the Ice Giant guards, and I had seen them take down many a brave, but foolish warrior attempting to sneak past them. I has spent my whole childhood in the wastes of the tundra and hence I had come across the hidden tunnel- more of a break in the mountain than something man made. I had gone down this tunnel it seemed forever, until I could smell and hear the Giants, cooking something they had clubbed and throwing their giant mammoth bones in some rude, evil game over the body they had slumped in the corner. Truly wicked beasts, 'I will get them again someday', I muttered.<br>
<br>
I also had noticed that I had, indeed, snuck behind them and they never seemed to pay attention to what was going on in the tunnel behind them. I had then decided that I should sneak further in, I was after all a berserker, and I was more than willing to fight whatever was in my path. <br>
<br>
I poked my head around the corner, the mist of the place was thick, and my vision was limited. I did, however, see a couple goblin warriors standing guard, if you could call it that. The original owner of this mighty castle would have been disgusted at how sloppy then new owners took care of it. The walls, once rich with art, now frozen and crumbling. The goblins I was looking at were playing a game, similar to the game the giant were playing, and weren't paying attention to the hallway. I began my move up to them...<br>
<br>
I had hit the first one while it was sitting, he seemed to have won the round and was collecting his gold when I cleaved into it with my fine steel bronze sword that I won months before from a human paladin in Qeynos as a price for a token from the evil bandits the plague the Karanas to this day. It didn't stand a chance, hitting the ground quickly, its head several feet away, staring at its body. Its other companion was up, rusty sword in hand. I started to feel the berserker fury of my ancestors in me, as I sang praise to the Warlord, Rallos Zek. We had fought, and indeed it was a better opponent then its brothers on the tundra, but I still managed to take it down in a few short minutes. <br>
<br>
I looked over the two guards. Rusty weapons and rawhide armor, and some gold. I had already fought the orcs that raided into High Pass, so I was clad in a mishmash of chain mail and patchwork. I checked my wounds, they were heavy, and I was bleeding in several places. I then knew I would have to get some help to go in deeper into this place.<br>
<br>
I struck out for Halas, taking the secret route out of the castle, past the oblivious giant guards. Going immediately to my favorite pub, the Fire Cider to find out more of this 'Permafrost Castle' and to have my wounds mended by the holy men. I had promise myself I would be back to that place of evil, and take it for the glory of Rallos Zek, and for the glory of Atkins!<br>
<br>
OOC This was kinda how I imagine my first time into Permaforst, about a year ago. I had been killed by the Ice Giants as a newbie, and lost all my stuff. I ended up soloing in there, or fighting with a shaman or cleric friend in there from level 16-20. That was when they disided to blow the place up and make it next to impossable to fight in there at those levels. I have always loved fighting in Permafrost, its probably my favorite dungeon in the whole game.<br>
