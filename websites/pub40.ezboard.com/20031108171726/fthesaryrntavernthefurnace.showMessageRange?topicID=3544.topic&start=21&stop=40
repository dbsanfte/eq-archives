<br>
I get into a BOT group, run to hub, pull random_mob_01, FD, get up and attack from behind (smack/smack/kick/kick), &quot;you get experience&quot;, rinse repeat.  Occasionally a spec drops but monks don't get those.  Occasionally a named spawns and then dies using the same pattern and once a month when the stars align it will be both a monk item (leather pattern) and the RNG makes me the winner. <br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
the clock is ticking ... you have 5 minutes left and 4 items to still get.  Then 3 minutes 2 items then 1 minute and 1 left and will you make it???  Once we luckily had a DC pet we killed that dropped the item and the ML overlooked a corpse and after desperately trying to target I suceeded and got the item.  This game is about tension and challenge not boring XP grinds.  Sure BOT/HoH XP is better but &lt;SNORE&gt;.  Unless we are raiding no way do you get that buzz of excitement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ssaredchief>SSARedChief</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/15/03 3:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3544.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LDoN sucks.</span><hr size=1> Coming from someone who started after luclin came out let me say this.  First, Velious is the best expansion there is, not Kunark (Velous just has a lot more depth then Kunark and no 32k HP limits on mobs).  Except for expanded bank slots, dyes (which isnt that good of thing when a bright pink ogre runs by), and drogmars, LoY was junk.  And Luclin had the possibility of being a great expansion, but wasnt.<br>
<br>
As to LDoN, its not great, but its has loads of possibilities.  Gear wise, for 3450 points I can put a 1 hander together that is as good as a Acrylia Handled Broadsword (Curse-Smelted Long Blade from guk for 1150, +3 damage from Miragul for 1150, Vampires Kiss from Mistmore for 1150).  The 1450pt armor drops are far better then any armor outside elemental.  Also, you dont need normal grps in LDoN.  A grp of 5 pallys and a bard owns mistmore.  You no longer need a plate class to tank (Rangers w/ decent gear (not elem though) and some def AAs tank fine). <br>
<br>
But LDoN has brought out its share of asses who care about win/loss stats more then anything.  Last night we had a grp about to zone into guk when the rogue got called for a raid.  Everyone in the grp but the mage was all for trying with 5 but the mage was more interested in not having a loss and then left saying he didnt want to be w/ a grp who wanted to loose.  <br>
<br>
Now, the only thing left is to redo the graphics on Butcherblock, South Ro, etc so they are up to par with a zone like JaggedPine.  That way we still have the lag. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>

So you have a variety of companions. Also you have OOC spam if you wish to joke around or talk smack with a larger and more unfamiliar audience. In LDoN, you go to a lonely ass place with just your 6 where no one may leave for like 30 minutes minimum.<br>
<br>
Also, if a different camp opens you can move your group there. If someone needs a quest mob somewhere, ok lets go do it. Hell if you want just move the whole group to a different zone. In LDoN, however, you are stuck where you are until you finish the mission lest you lose those oh so precious points.<br>
<br>
I know you all think it is great that you are moving about instead of pulling to a wall, but each adventure camp seems to have 2 or 3 cookie cutter zones that are identical in feel and very similar in appearance with no real variation except where the dead ends are, you kill a bunch of weak ass trash mobs as fast as you can and once in a while kill some equally weak ass name who drops the same few craptastic loots every time. How goddamm saturated with those stupid arrow summoning  bags is the bazaar going to be in a month? Loot that anyone can get five times a day is not special no matter how nice it is. <br>
<br>
And WTF ever happened to CR's?? In a real dungeon crawl you stand a reasonable chance of wiping and being faced with getting your corpses from behind crowds of respawned mobs. This was a risk that made success seem sweeter. In LDoN you are competeing with a stop watch, and even if the stop watch wins, your corpses get spit out of the dungeon, thank you come again. Yes this started in PoP but at least there were respawns there, if you have no rezzer and one person dies, who cares just run back and help us beat the clock!<br>
<br>
I suppose if all you could ever find to do before was sit at a wall in PoV pulling stuff to kill, then you might find this shit exciting, OH NOZ! TEH TIMER IS RUNNING!!1!1, but I contend that if that was how you spent the bulk of your time in EQ, then maybe it was not game mechanics that were at fault but how YOU choose to make use of them and your sick desire to only do that which yields the highest pixel reward instead of mixing it up in terms of what how and where to pull and kill things. Granted, all this is coming from a guy who has probably spent over 100 hours running in circles around the same picnic table in Plane of Fire, but I would also pull casters, spawn named mobs to get loot drops for guildies, and welcome anyone of any class to come group with me and offer what ever they could while we shot the shit and got xp. People could go afk whenever they needed to and usually still get rewarded by a different pullers and support members while they did, I bet there were clerics who were happy to get some xp by standing around nuking while someone else did the work for a change. I bet most other servers saw this as a defined camp where one or two kite classes would sit around by themselves hoarding xp all day. <br>
<br>
I admit there are some cool new mob models in LDoN but that only goes so far in spicing up the same replicated set of tunnels and halls over and over again. Maybe I am crazy, bitter and/or jaded but this is how I feel. Everyone else seems to prefer having thier gaming experience spoon fed to them with little risk. I myself liked having the ability to let my own imagination direct some of what my gaming experience will be, with LDoN the game itself dictates your every move. <br>

Would you be directing it then for the 8 months or whatever you spent in Vex Thal Fammadan? Or the year you spent getting to the Plane of Time?<br>
<br>
Certainly such things have their place (well not VT, there's really no reason for that)--but I'm not really sure I see alot of &quot;choosing your own destiny&quot; in that as opposed to LDON. Reverse aggro kiting the height of excitment? The only CHALLENGE in that is not to run into a wall--admittedly I have trouble with that but I assume most people are more dexterous.<br>
<br>
LDON is fun...will that get boring? Probably, so did Sebilis. Beauty of EQ though, there's always something else to do.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Coming from someone who started after luclin came out let me say this. First, Velious is the best expansion there is, not Kunark (Velous just has a lot more depth then Kunark and no 32k HP limits on mobs). Except for expanded bank slots, dyes (which isnt that good of thing when a bright pink ogre runs by), and drogmars, LoY was junk. And Luclin had the possibility of being a great expansion, but wasnt.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not sure I understand what you are saying here.  Velious came out prior to Luclin, so you weren't playing at that time.  IMO, it's hard to say it's the best expansion if you weren't there to experience what was before it.  Velious had very rich content, but comparatively - it was expected.<br>
<br>
Kunark was something that allowed old school players be excited about something new.  New levels, new spells, new skills, new armor, new zones, our first dungeon that was considered the most dangerous in the game (with no GM assistance) - all for the very first time.  So those of us 2000 people or so per server back in Spring of 2000 - we were really jazzed about the first expansion.  Kunark was a wonderful taste of what we hoped would be the first of many great expansions.  It sincerely left a good feeling in us, that this game's future was boundless.<br>
<br>
Velious was, indeed, very rich.  It taught us to chose our allies within the game.  Extremely good quests and zones for the time.  But to many of us, the thrill wasn't as fresh as it once had been - with Kunark.  Luclin, so-so.  Again, awesome loots and a generally good idea, but sometimes it seemed a little too far fetched and over the edge.  Fun, no doubt.<br>
<br>
Planes of Power was the first expansion to bring back that &quot;old&quot; feeling, for me.  There was, again, a sense of extreme risk... until you discovered your corpse will just pop back at the ZI.  I liked the old days of CRing.  Yeah, coffins can get expensive for an entire raid, but hey - wasn't it SOE who said there was too much plat in the economy in EQ anyway??   PoP allowed small raids, large raids, solo/duo experiences - just like old days.  Or perhaps, it's just that it was an expansion released for high levels - a category I finally fell into.<br>
<br>
LoY - flop, IMO.  I've been to only 2 zones there I think.<br>
<br>
LDoN - too restrictive, and that is my primary complaint.  Yes, I do feel as though individual people are worthy of solo &quot;adventures&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Or perhaps, all this is just my realization that EQ may finally be taking a more relaxed backseat in my life - my journies here are more rich than anything in EQ.   Perhaps 50 months of EQ has taken it's toll on my discretion - and I'm getting a little bitchy about it.  1520 days.  That's a long ass time <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=265136&resize=true" target="_new"><img border=0 src="http://webpages.charter.net/xynta/xsig25.jpg" </img></a><br>

We go through there with no problem. It finally gives us something more to do than to sit in the same spot pulling the same 15-20 mobs over and over again as they spawn. <br>
<br>
LOY was actually a great expansion for those who took the time to adventure in it. I spent 20+ levels there with my SK. The place has a big story to it, one where you can actually become a part of. Sure the items are so so, but it was an expansion geared towards 30- mid 50's. There are several ring events and quests for semi decent items for those levels. <br>
<br>
It just depends on how you look at the game. If all you want is phat loots and to be the uber player then it's not for you. If you want the sense of adventure in trying something new...then by all means. <p><a href=http://www.hneguild.com/profile.asp?name=Garbhad><img src="http://cblack87.home.comcast.net/Garbsig.jpeg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adaari>Adaari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.division-usa.com/avatar2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/16/03 12:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3544.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.division-usa.com/avatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: um...</span><hr size=1> I typically solo or duo with my hubby, so I wasn't happy about the LDoN group thing.

<br>
Corpse runs used to be very thrilling, very exciting.  Everyone I know hated it, particularly if you died someplace where the zone in wasn't safe (Fear anyone?).  And losing exp every time you died, now that made the game challenging.  Death had a real meaning.  Die deep in a dungeon, and there was a real chance that you might not get your stuff back.  I remember dying once in Befallen, and wondering if I was ever going to be able to find and loot that banded armor I had taken so long to get.    <br>
<br>
Then we all levelled up.  Guilds got bigger and stronger.  Clerics got rezz.  Necros and SKs got summon corpse, and necros got rezz too.  Suddenly, it didn't matter if you died, or where you died.  You'd just get a guildie to come summon your corpse, and another one to rezz you.  Die in Fear, and there was always someone to drag you to a safe spot for a rezz, or a friendly guild to break the zone in for you.  <br>
<br>
The game was a heck of a lot more thrilling and exciting when death had a real consequence.  Unfortunately, that was the thing people complained about the most.  There's a reason why there are graveyards in PoP, and it's because the customers demanded them.  So, if we think the game isn't as thrilling as it used to be, we have no one to blame but ourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3544.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3544.topic&start=41&stop=59>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showPrevMessage?topicID=3544.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showNextMessage?topicID=3544.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3544.topic&index=40><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=3544.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=3544.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3544.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3544.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246i<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
