<br>
I'll rephrase then!<br>
If you feel that Dream Theater is the most talented band that you have ever heard my opinion is then that you either A) Have never listened to much of anything else, or B) Don't comprehend what you're listening to. <br>
<br>
That's not to say that Dream Theater are a bunch of talentless hacks.  On the contrary, I'd certainly put them at a higher musical level than say Vanilla Ice.  I don't actually enjoy listening to anything they've ever recorded, but that doesn't mean I don't think they can play their instruments without hurting themselves. <br>
<br>
I still think it's quite a stretch to say that they are the most talented musicians that you have ever heard.  Unless you have a vastly different definition of talented than most of the rest of the world.  Sure, there's plenty of room for variation, but at some point you just go off the deep end of crazy. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As I said, I've been a musician for over 20 years<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's backed up by just about every musician who has ever heard them. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now this I really must call into question.  You are welcome to have your opinion, but unless you're prepared with a notarized statement from each and every musician who has heard them play you shouldn't really make such claims.  Possessing talent?  Acceptible!  But the single most impressive talent that has ever graced the ears of almost EVERY SINGLE musician who has ever heard them?  <br>
<br>
I'll be polite and say, &quot;Questionable.&quot; <p>-Tain<BR>

 I think your entire post can be summarized in this one quote.<br>
<br>
 I'll be polite and say that &quot;you don't have a clue&quot;.  <br>
<br>
 The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>musicians</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who have posted in this thread who *have* heard the band I'm talking about have all posted in support of my statements. <br>
<br>
 To be at a higher musical level than Vanilla Ice wouldn't be any more difficult than being able to sing and stay on key.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for this;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How lovely for you! That doesn't inherently make you a good one, or a judge of what is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, it doesn't make me a good one, however, Yes, it does make me a better judge of what is than someone who doesn't have any idea of what kind of dedication and invested time it takes to play an instrument at the skill level I'm speaking of.<br>
<br>
I will phrase this differently because I don't think you understood it the first time. (I don't think you will this time either, but I feel the need to try)<br>
 If you aren't a relatively skilled musician, you cannot accurately judge the skill level of someone who is.   This theory is upheld by your claims that DT is nothing more than an average band in terms of talent.  <br>
<br>
I claim that you cannot accurately judge the talent level, (meaning SKILL playing their instruments, nothing more!) of these bands.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I challenge you to obtain a Dream Theater CD,  Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory,  or maybe  6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence, (those are their two most recent releases) and have everyone you know who has been a practicing musician for more than 10 years listen to the entire CD.<br>
<br>
I guarantee you, if they are a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>practicing musician</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, even if they don't *LIKE* the music, they will tell you that the musicians playing it are incredibly skilled, possibly even among the most skilled they have ever heard. <br>
<br>
I would be *very* surprised if you got any other response from anyone who knows and understands how difficult and complex the music they play is.<br>
<br>
Zandramas<br>
<br>
<br>
*edit*<br>
I may have left out some information that is important to what I am trying to get across, and I apologize if that is the case.  I am speaking of the *entire band* being the most talented band as a whole that I have ever heard, not the individual musicians. <br>
<br>
 Individually they are fantastic at what they do yes, but there are absolutely many other individual musicians in the world who are at a skill level comparable to theirs.  I don't feel that it's possible when musicians are at that kind of talent level to say that one is better than another, because once you reach a level of talent such as they have, it all becomes subjective and a matter of taste.<br>
<br>
They just happen to *all* be at an incredible skill level, whereas most bands in the rock genre have maybe one or two extremely skilled players and the rest are average at best.<br>

<br>
Just about every musician who has ever heard them.  That's a lot different than every musician who has posted in this thread.  I would like to hear from any other musicians who are reading however.  It's a simple question:<br>
<br>
Is Dream Theater the single most talented band of musicians you have ever heard? <br>
<br>
Not, &quot;I respect their ability.&quot;  Not, &quot;They're one of the best.&quot;<br>
Are they, as Zandramas claims, the most talented musicians that almost every musician who listens to them will ever hear. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To be at a higher musical level than Vanilla Ice wouldn't be any more difficult than being able to sing and stay on key.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Indeed!  I freely admit that Dream Theater meets these criteria as far as I have heard. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This theory is upheld by your claims that DT is nothing more than an average band in terms of talent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now now, don't make things up.  I never said they were an average band in terms of talent.  In fact I have not once made any claims that they lack talent.  I merely disagree that almost every other musician in the world feels that they are the most talented musicians that have graced instruments.  I also disagree to a lesser level that you can truly believe they are the pinnacle of human achievement in music up to this point in time (allowing for such things as ignorance of every other person who has ever picked up an instrument or sung a note.)  I'll accept that it's possible that you believe this, shake my head and go about my business.<br>
<br>
However!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guarantee you, if they are a practicing musician, even if they don't *LIKE* the music, they will tell you that the musicians playing it are incredibly skilled, possibly even among the most skilled they have ever heard. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now we're reduced to, &quot;possibly even among the most skilled.&quot;  That's quite a change from:<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>they're some of the most &quot;talented&quot; musicians the world has ever seen, and that's actually not just my opinion.

<br>
What's next, they could maybe be considered somewhat talented by people who heard that someone once walked by their CD in a store?  <p>-Tain<BR>

(grin)<br>
<br>
  Led Zepplin helped pioneer an entire revolution in rock music.  They were huge influences to most rock musicians who came after them. <br>
<br>
 They wrote music that people really got into, and they didnt' just stick to 3 chord songs. They were good solid musicians.<br>
<br>
 Technically I would have to say they were miles above most of the bands I hear on the radio these days, but they were definitely not in the class of musician I've been speaking of.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, that's an unfair comparison though, because at the time they were 'current', they WERE some of the best rock musicians in the world.  The only musicians in the 60s and 70s who aspired to the kind of technical proficiency I'm comparing them to were Jazz (and Jazz/Fusion) musicians,  Classical Violin Soloists, Concert Pianists,  that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
Only more recently has that kind of techical virtuosity made its way into the rock'n'roll world, starting with the Jazz Fusion players like Alan Holdsworth, Chic Corea, and  John Patittuci,  then the Neo-Classical rock guitarists such as Yngwie J. Malmsteen, Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, etc.<br>
<br>
 It's tough to respond to a question like this, because of the huge influence and popularity of a band like Zepplin.  It's sure to offend someone or other just because they love the band so much!<br>

<br>
Maybe they were the &quot;real first&quot; or whatever to do this kinda music, but the thing is it's not all that unique to me. On a technical level they are very skilled but I know all those scales too and could put together a song of that style in minutes. What I'm more impressed by is bands like Sublime and the Clash and people who play with their influences and don't necessarily fit into a genre, but rather play what they feel. I can't read much more than elementary sheet music, or tell you the names of any of the scales, or do music theory or any of that crap. I just play. I hear and I play, or I think and I play. I could take lessons from Satriani and make myself a polished technical guitar player yeah, but I prefer to just play what I feel. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.discreetww.com/snuff.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=snufffilmjenkins@thesaryrntavern>Snuff Film Jenkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/10/03 10:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3530.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top Albums: 1990-1995</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah and Listen to Children of Bodom - Children of Decadence. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.discreetww.com/snuff.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zandramashammerfist>Zandramas Hammerfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 364<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/10/03 10:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3530.topic&index=70>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top Albums: 1990-1995</span><hr size=1> Jenkins, the technical skill side of it was my entire point.

<br>
So to you the statements:<br>
<br>
&quot;I've never heard any band more talented than Dream Theater and I doubt I ever will again. &quot;<br>
&quot;that's actually not just my opinion. It's backed up by just about every musician who has ever heard them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The musicians who have posted in this thread who *have* heard the band I'm talking about have all posted in support of my statements.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I guarantee you, if they are a practicing musician, even if they don't *LIKE* the music, they will tell you that the musicians playing it are incredibly skilled, possibly even among the most skilled they have ever heard. &quot;<br>
<br>
Are mere changes in wording yet all mean the same thing?  You go from saying almost every musician who has ever heard them, to every musician in THIS thread, to practicing musicians MIGHT list them among the most skilled. <br>
<br>
You've gone from saying they are the most talented musicians you've ever heard and that almost every musician who has ever heard them would agree with you, to every musician in this thread (of which none have expressed anywhere near your level of lofty praises), to any musician would MAYBE say they're AMONG the most skilled. <br>
<br>
You don't see that as a complete change of direction? <br>
<br>
You also keep tossing out there that my dislike of Dream Theater is at fault, and yet have I once said, &quot;Dream Theater sucks!  I hate them!&quot;  In fact I'd never have had to ever heard a note they've performed to take question with your boasts of universal adoration by anyone who's ever picked up a musical instrument.  <p>-Tain<BR>

It doesn't represent them. Yeah I think alot of bands suck. Matter of fact for everyone I like I can think of ten that suck, but that's besides the point. What they play is what represents them and their fans can feel that and their critics can't. Look at the guitar player from sum 41. That guy is actually pretty amazing I've seen them live and he has enough skill to play in any metal band. Yet he plays in a poppy punk 3 chord band. Heffe from NOFX as well. That guy is pretty amazing as well as Fat mike on the bass. Shit and speaking of bass, Matt Freeman from Rancid? Music is what you make it. Besides that look around I bet you can find a ton of bands still making DTish type music. They may not be right in front of your face, but they're there. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.discreetww.com/snuff.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frotttty>frotttty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/10/03 2:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3530.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> list and reel</span><hr size=1> *Melvins - Houdini (93)<br>

Ween is the infamous &quot;got this stolen from me X times&quot; tape... RIP &quot;tapes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, every form of music is valid. Music debates are silly when you're discussing &quot;popular music&quot; which is a form of music that is, by its name, populist... ie, a form of music that many people like/purchase.<br>
<br>
As far as talent is concerned, talent for what? <br>
<br>
Dream Theatre, for instance, or any other band that has a signature style/sound (beck, sonic youth, deicide, NWA) have a method that they utilize, be it showcasing of musical dexterity or showcasing brute/raw emotion.<br>
<br>
Aside from the marketing, Nirvana was a band that expressed themselves very brutally &amp; honestly without putting the music itself first. The voice, the method, the dynamics are more important than precision or composition. <br>
<br>
It's like saying expressionist painting is &quot;worse&quot; than neoclassical romanticist painting. Some expressionists literally threw paint at the canvas, ie, Pollock or de Kooning, Frankenthaler (Cobain, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth) whereas others sought to defend painting objectively like David, Ingres, or Gericault (Dream theatre, tool, etc)<br>
<br>
The 90s movement towards brutal expressionism (white people rapping about eyeballs in a condom, guitar solos done with screwdrivers) was a rebellion from victorian enforcement of the late 80s metal dance music where you were forced into an audience role due to the extreme gear or time put into their training, craft, business. The common folk gravitated towards the supposedly honest, raw, down to earthiness of those who'd belt out their songs, jump into the crowd and have a beer with you. And it was marketed very well, with Columbia House selling them all out at a premium.<br>
<br>
I personally don't usually enjoy prog rock, metal, etc. because it's *too* refined. It's *too* a well oiled machine, I don't &quot;escape into it&quot; so much as I'm alienated by it. I like looseness in my music, not precision engineering. Even some of the sloppier stuff, it becomes annoying and glaringly obvious when someone has &quot;written&quot; a screwy or messed up part. It's like an expressionist who paints a picture of paint splatters rather than actually splattering the paint. Insincere.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I love it. I threw some of the seminal, IMO, metal bands up there - who I thought were at least the pioneers of their, ehm, art.<br>
<br>
Take Beck, for instance. He started his career singing folk songs on the public bus. He's made rap songs, electro, synthpop, ballads, r&amp;b, country, power rock and even metal songs. That has it's place. I think it's &quot;good&quot; or &quot;important.&quot; Other bands might not be able to pull off such range, they dwell in their own realm quite comfortably. That's lovely, too. A favorite of mine, The Jesus Lizard, has one of the most skilled guitarists of the underrealm of noncommercial music, in my opinion, but they could be seen as being guilty of making the exact same record (just with different songs) 4 or 5 times. And I love them all.... hmmm I forgot to add Fugazi to my list.<br>
<br>
So, yeah, if we went by speed alone, uh, the great kat would win as she's been clocked as the fastest recorded guitar soloist, think it's in the guinness book, something like sustained 64th note triplets or 128th notes, I can't remember... at a fast tempo... <br>
<br>
...on the other side of the spectrum, you had bands like GG Allin and the Murder Junkies who runs off stage and rape a minor and stabs people until the concert ends (usually 2 or 3 mins after it begins).<br>
<br>
I lean towards the Murder Junkies' side of the fence, but obviously not so radically. I can still appreciate the compositions of modernists like Olivier Messiaen or Emmanuel Nunes, without requiring it for the one purpose of music: <br>
<br>
enjoyment.<br>
<br>
...I forgot to add NWA to my list. It seems limiting (or is it defining) to set such rigid limits on what can be considered &quot;good music.&quot; It's all got a story, it all has it's place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baksfyre>Baks Fyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 793<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/10/03 2:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3530.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~rich.bostick/Baksani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: list and reel</span><hr size=1> One group/album I'm surprised no one mentioned here:<br>

Let's see a 15 minute progressive song, with 2 guitars both rythemand lead plus bass and drums. Also include lyrics with at least a hint of story to them put together in minutes.<br>
