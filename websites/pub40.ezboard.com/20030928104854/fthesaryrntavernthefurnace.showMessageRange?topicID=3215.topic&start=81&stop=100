We do our best to not over run other guilds.  Our officers will flat out refuse to go into a zone if it seems that guild x is going after a mob.  To prove that this theory actually works, compare our run in with FS a few months back.  FS is still struggling to hold NToV, while ToN has moved on to kills like Seru and other mobs.  <br>
<br>
Another great example is ToS, they play by the same rules as ToN.  They are now in VT.  <br>
<br>
This just proves that stepping over other guilds is the only way to advance in this game.  <br>
<br>
As far as the incident in seru though, I will not comment on it, as I was not there.  The only information that I have is what I hear from my guildmates.  However, I really find Nandaries remarks as stupid.  She and people like her is what truly maintains TWC's bad rep.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=479240" target="top">Sage Aflack Dukky </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

Why did he /ooc basically saying that since FotC pulled Van Dyn (which by your statement was untrue) you guys were moving on IV.<br>
<br>
Either the train was a accident, which then makes Sslithers a liar; or the train was purposeful which makes him not only a liar but someone who should have been banned for training a raid.<br>
<br>
Either way, ToN was complacent in Sslithers actions that day.<br>

Last time you attacked me it resulted in you taking a 3-month hiatus from posting here.  You've been warned.<br>
<br>
Now, there was one post I liked, and one I didn't.  First, the one I didn't.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;That was why one of the GM's (there were two!) announced in /ooc that if a TWC raid leader did not send them a tell they'd poof Seru?<br>
<br>
You engaged Nan, please have the decency not to lie about it.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Holy Jesus motherfucking Christ, batman!  Are you really that goddamn stupid?  You've earned the right to shove it for the rest of the thread.  We were very much intending on pulling, our puller asked if we were ready, then the GM /ooc'd.  If that is engaging Seru then I'll concede every point in the history of the world to you Vainne.  However, it's not.<br>
<br>
The post I did like is Shagz's, as I think it's about as level headed as someone can ever be expected to get while arguing for their own side.  But I would like to make a few additions/comments that would best classify as 'spin.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;We move up to the final room start killing the stationary guards and roaming guards. After we've killed a lot of the roamers and the nearby stationary guards, TWC clicks up into the final hallway, and quickly moves down the hallway while we're killing some of the mobs we just pulled. They kill few of the guards inside his room and sits their entire raid inside the Lord Seru room into the spot we were preparing to set up.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The problem being that you waited until TWC was in force at the gate before you clicked over.  You had a lot of time previously to move in if you needed to, but it sounds like you didn't because of an AFK cleric who died.  If you required this cleric to kill Seru, then you should have waited for him before you moved forward, and not moved ahead rapidly to try and give an impression of first-in-force when in fact you weren't ready.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;My personal view is, TWC was not in the Lord Seru building. They were killing house masters. Lord Seru was not being moved on so we made him our target. Similar to ToV for example. If Guild A is killing Telkenor, and Guild B decides to make LTK their target and moves to them, In my opinion it would be silly of Guild A to say they were FIF for LTK because they were in the zone&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The problem here is that by porting in, you had set the precedent that you would not considering first-in-force simply being here - that it would require to actually be killing Seru.  There is little difference between having 45 people in zone out of Seru building and having 45 people in the Seru building who are not ready to engage.  So until the point when Seru is actually engaged, both guilds can lay equal claim to him.<br>
<br>
Granted, it is very diffiicult for me to comment on whether ToN had enough clerics without this dead one, as the entire force was anonymous.  Since you had to wait on him, I am assuming this is so.  If we have 80 people ready to engage Emperor, and no enchanters or bards, then we are likewise not ready.<br>
<br>
But I agree with the rest of your post almost entirely.  It's probably about the clearest account of this incident that we will ever end up having. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399">Yes, my hat looks like crap.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agarthibeornegar>Agarthi Beornegar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/17/03 4:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3215.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mchsi.com/~c.crouse/head1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> While it pains me to do so, I will say the monk in question Sslithers or however the fuck its spelled has on multiple occasions intentionally trained other guilds, well ill tell you!<br>

I hydra the mother fucker all the time so don't try to tell me it &quot;could&quot; have whiped you out he is a patheticly ez boss mob. Also theres no way in  hell I accidently trained him on you, ( I didn't even know he was up ) and hes a good run out of the way of the path I take to IV. I don't know how that happened, dont ask me I don't know, but please get your facts straight or use some common sense before you flame me on the Saryrn BF ( ya right, thats hopeless too ). The GoL thing happened shortly after this one. They had like 28 ppl sitting outside the Tmax temple blocking our pull and trying to say they were just aobut to fight him. I told them &quot; ok you have 10 minutes or im pulling him to my guild &quot;. They refused to move, I spammed them asking them to move or risk getting Tmax agro, they refused and proceeed to make fun of me, asked a few more times after that and they still refused. So I pulled Tmax and one of their people decided to engage him as he and his pets ran by so, short story they whiped out. Not my fault they decided to tag him as he ran by. Anyhow I hate even being in those situations because no matter how much I try to xplain or deney it ppl arn't going to believe me so the monk gets fucked.... thats why hes parked now.<br>

We've killed him since with less than we had then.  Not claiming OOP didn't have more, or that they couldnt have engaged and won much sooner than we could have.  And just for the record, we didnt kill Emp that night when it repoped; our first victory was some time later.<br>
<br>
Hearing you still calling it &quot;cheesdick tactics&quot; is downright hilarious.  The way I remember it was roughly 70 OOP and 50 TWC all moving from zone in to the 3rd floor in one giant mass (thus your folks' stupid petitions of trains, lol).  OOP stopped to farm insignias for all your new newbie WotC zergs, and TWC moved directly into emp room.  OOP's the one who lost that race, and no matter how many more people you had outside, fact was we had at least a minimal force that could have engaged and stood a chance.  OOP was the one who moved their massive force into that little nook after our entire raid was sitting there and we were struggling to work out our plan.  Ya, not immediately porting out when OOP says &quot;get the fuck out of our way now&quot; is &quot;cheesedick tactics&quot;.  Maybe you should ask HnE if OOP was guilty of similar &quot;cheesedick tactics&quot; at RZ.<br>
<br>
As for admitting to wrongdoing, that requires a wrong to first be done.  My principles are simple and the rules laid out by VI are well known.  I've never broken either.  If you want to talk about being wrong in remembering details of events or behavior of mobs, then yes I have been wrong and I readily admit it when it is demonstrated.<br>

Two guilds with the ability to kill the mob formed their forces equally and moved them as quickly as they could while treating each other in both a fair and competitive manner. <br>

Kioti.. you are as full of pure and utter bullshit here as you were in the tells that day. Please give me ONE good reason why I am a scumbag? When have I EVER done anything to you, HnE or anyone else in game? You can't give me a single occassion, can you? Didn't think so, because it hasn't happened. You see, when I disagree with something happening I voice my opinion clearly to our Officers. If they still go along with it, I leave. Oh yeah that makes me such a scumbag..<br>

<br>
See above. The day you sent me the most harrassing tells I have ever seen in a game, was the day with the AoW/KT/LY bullshit. I wasn't there for the AoW part which got you so pissed (I was ressed in just as the mob whacked us and people ported out). I even helped whoever it was that trained a few mobs on us kill them (Barbarian warrior? Can't remember name) and we resed him since he died. Had about 1 group in Kael then, rest had left. But you know all this, because I have posted it before. I didn't even know what happened, yet you lay into me with childish insults and profanity. You know, if I had been such a scumbag I would have /reported it instead of trying to explain I had no idea what had happened. Wouldn't I?<br>

I have respect for plenty of people in the game. In fact, I so often defend other guilds that I get into arguments with my own guildies about it. <br>
