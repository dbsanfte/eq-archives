<br>
Let's think about this for a moment.  Excluding quest pieces, songs, spells, and free horses, he drops (according to Alla):<br>
<br>
Attuned Spire Shard <br>
Belt of Virility <br>
Bonecurse <br>
Boots of Stability<br>
Etched Bone Ulak <br>
Geomantic Fingers of Focus <br>
Ichorflow <br>
Jenniy's Two-tone Cuirass<br>
<br>
And like just about any regular spawn mob in this game, he may, and likely will drop more than the two pieces in question...and those two drops may be much more common than the rest of his table.  How many times have you seen the same mobs drop more or less the same loot, over and over?<br>
<br>
If you really think it's not possible for CA to have gotten the exact same drops (or more) than GoL did, you're even more retarded than I thought.<br>

Point is taking corpse shots from other guilds because 1. You were to lazy 2. Not a good corpse shot 3. Liked the other one.<br>
<br>
- Fighting over it is dumb, I believe this post was created because it was believe that they are throwing kills out there they have not received, if they have killed grieg before good, if they have killed grieg many times and never seen those 2 items then its kinda lame. Should have the lower level guilds post thier quarm kills to get people to join. Do i have anything against froggerx, no. I have liked him, while not many people in my guild or any guild like him he still has remained a friend to me.  He has said it was wrong to take someone elses corpse shot so its over with.

Feedback - <br>
<br>
My first encounter with Collective Assault was on November 12th, 2003 in SSRA. I'm sorry to say that it was not a positive experience. Several of your members were extremely rude and negative towards my guild, Isengard. They were slinging insults at Isengard (not select members, but the guild as a whole), both in ooc and say, as we zoned into and moved throughout SSRA. We were shocked, but did not respond to the verbal attacks and belittling of our guild name. We kept moving to raid Cursed, as planned. Soon after we finished mobilizing and prepping, CA punted out from the zoneline and from where our raid was set up to do Cursed. <br>
<br>
The way some CA members conducted themselves in this instance disgusted and disappointed not only myself, but many members in Isengard. I understand that not everyone will like each other, or all guilds and that it sucks to lose a race to a spawn. However, I do believe that people should meet other guilds with mutual respect, or at least have enough respect for their own guild to keep their negative thoughts and opinions to themselves and out of public channels. According to your guild rules, so do you.<br>
<br>
I hope that my guild and other competitive guilds can expect more maturity and respect from CA in the future, whenever our paths should cross. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I thought you guys would be more curtious and it was apparent to me and my guild mates that you guys were gonna start it regardless of us planning and saying we were doing it. I told my members to stop harassing isengard members, and if they had a problem with it they could /tell me. Those that did - did indeed send a tell, there was nothing else said in ooc. I sent tells to your leadership and got no responses. Perhaps they were just ignoring the tells from myself and my officers?.

It was worded thoughtfully and the purpose was obviously not one of ill will, that is why I was annoyed that you deleted it. At first, I just figured you didn't want it posted under the rules, so I moved it into the general section. The people in your guild who spoke so lowly of us, also did so in public and in quite the opposite manner of which I did. So, I figured it would be fine for me to speak to them publically as well.. not this public, but you wouldn't let me speak there, so be it. I didn't know you were the leader until tonight nor did I take down names, that is why I chose to approach the subject on the guild message board. <br>
<br>
The reason for waiting a week to mention it was simply because I have been busy irl with a new job and I haven't been able to spend much time online since then. Also, I didn't know the board addy til tonight. Being that a week has passed, doesn't make them any less wrong and didn't make me feel any less perturbed about the situation. The fact that we mobilized and prepared faster isn't any excuse either. I just wanted the issue to be faced and dealt with and you say it has been. Hopefully CA will be more respectful to competitive guilds, or at least mature and civil. I got what I wanted, thank you. I will now let the issue drop.<br>
<br>
As far your question, I have answered that over and over again. There was no conspiracy and no &quot;golden platter deal&quot; for us to join any other guilds, we left FoTC because we wanted to. We weren't having fun and that's what EQ is meant for, fun and entertainment. We asked Isengard if we could join and they said yes, it was that simple. Anyway, as far as the whole Shall &amp; guild bank thing, I'm tired.. so let me copy and paste from the old post:<br>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Didn't the leadership abandon the membership and all flee to isengard taking the guildbank stuff in the process while acting like everything was going fine?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all, if you were a member of the guild near the end, you would know that everything was not fine and everyone was very aware of that. We were in the process of trying to fix things and lay down new rules. Disbanding and/or leaving FoTC was not something that the leadership planned, in fact it was announced the same day that Shalladiah realized that he was no longer enjoying himself and only still remained because he felt obligated to the people and guild. As the only two remaining officers, I said that I would not take over the helm as GL and that I felt very close to the same way that Shall did. Fira did not have enough time to dedicate to such a large task. We all did nothing wrong here, to any of these people, other then by making a choice to leave FoTC and go back to having FUN in a game that we PAY to play. As for fleeing to go to Isengard, a group of close friends had a pow wow and decided they wanted to stick together and find a guild they could all enjoy. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>

and another rumour is that the old leader made like a bandit and took guild bank and guild BoC with them &gt;&lt;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The guild BoC was given to Muggzy, who was basically the guild's MT. Tinymity who was also as often the Guild's MT at raids, already has one of his own. As for the guild spells and funds, the officers were just told to sell any of the spells they had and keep the money for themselves. There was nothing in the guild bank other than the BoC and whatever was left after supplying peridots, emeralds, pearls, coffins, essence emeralds, etc to all of the members at each raid. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=552260" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/OtanaSig_SaryrnServer.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spyrit123>Spyrit123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 371<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/20/03 3:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3687.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>at least mature and civil.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I sent a tell to Malk asking if he'd agree to roll for the event for his guild, if I /ran'd higher then him, its ours(ca), if he /ran'd higher then me then its yours(isens). He ignored, along with a few other tells. <br>

We had 16 when you guys had 10, then isen started comming in 6's while we took our time - We were with NAG(not a guild) at the time. Whom were also dissappointed to see isengard walking over others. <br>

I didn't want your post on our boards for the simple reason as with every action there is a reaction... Making a post like that will obviously get people in a bad mood and start a flame on our site, which we do not need nor want.

Okay so let me get this straight. Isen walked over 16 CA/NaG waiting at zone in to get to cursed cycle? 16 isn't Fif is it? Can you do cursed with 16? Have you ever killed Cursed? When you kill Cursed cycle will you steal isengards screenshots because yours were crappy?<br>
<br>
<br>
Not really walking over you when you obviously have no experience doing the cycle and only have 16. Malkier doesn't have to roll with you to do a raid that you obviously don't have the numbers to do. Especially after all of your members are sitting there being jackasses in ooc and /say.<br>

And for the record, some CA people were being less than kind at the zone in.  Specifically blocking the door so Isen couldnt join the rest of their guild at the Cursed area.  They were also nice enough to berate NaG as well, when we were only there to help you.  NaG had some people already down near cursed, and some at the zone in.  We(NaG) decided to leave after the not so nice way some of the CA members handled themselves.<br>
<br>
I have no idea how many it takes to kill Cursed anymore.  Seeing has how the emp can be taken down with 30 or so.. it cant take too many these days.  But that doesnt mean we couldnt have given it a shot.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=202513" target="top">Morbidsoul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Exactly how many guilds do you figure would sit back with an entire raid force and wait will you had more people log on?<br>
<br>
You &quot;called&quot; it. So?<br>
<br>
Ok, I call Plane of Time.  We can't raid it yet, but everyone else has to back off till we can and it's ours cause I called it.  If anyone has a problem with that, you are just gonna have to take it up with Froggerx cause he writes the playbook for Saryrn now.<br>
<br>
Since you don't understand the concept Froggerx, let me explain. First in Force means you are present with sufficient force to engage and hopefully kill the mob.  It doesn't mean you have the first person there &quot;calling&quot; it. It means you were there and ready to engage, or in this case, begin the Cursed cycle.  Just because you want it real bad doesn't mean you get it.  Trust me on that one.<br>
<br>
I usually have my log on. If you want, I will provide you with all the names of Collective Assault people that violated your charter so you can punish them. I'm nice like that. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=304618">Graowl Whitetiger</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

My guild has been the victim of that many times.  You know what?  That's our tough luck, and I don't complain about the fact that other guilds are able to mobilize faster.  I've also been on an Agnarr raid with about 40 or 50 people, prepping in the courtyard, when suddenly Isengard zoomed in with a much larger force.  We hurriedly tried to get ready, we rushed to beat Isengard to Agnarr .. and we wiped.  And Isengard took him.  Many people were unhappy, but I don't remember anyone screaming that Isengard was kill stealing.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adaari>Adaari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/20/03 7:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3687.topic&index=95>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.division-usa.com/avatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I sent a tell to Malk asking if he'd agree to roll for the event for his guild, if I /ran'd higher then him, its ours(ca), if he /ran'd higher then me then its yours(isens).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Isen already had roughly 45-50 to your 16, and we were supposed to roll?  Maybe I'm missing something here, but we've raced a few guilds on this server for various mobs.  Never in that time have I seen raid leaders rolling for the mob.  You want the mob?  Super, then mobilize faster.  Sometimes you will win the race, sometimes you won't, but don't resort to name-calling and bashing because you lost a fair race.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaizerevolaruali>Kaizer Evolaruali</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 649<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/20/03 7:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3687.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I guess some of you are missing the fact that CA wasnt alone there.

<br>
Yes, this is true we did not have the force, and Isen was there in force. I think what Kaizer is trying to say is that we (NaG) were put in a position where we didn't want to be in.  When a few of the CA members started being rude to some of the Isengard members by blocking the zone in, we wanted no part. They then continued to be rude to a few of our members who were there to help them at the time. Once that happend, we got out of there. We wanted no part of any of that.<br>
