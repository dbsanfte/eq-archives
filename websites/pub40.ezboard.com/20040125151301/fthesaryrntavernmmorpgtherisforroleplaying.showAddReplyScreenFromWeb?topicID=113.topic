<br>
It all started in FearPlane when I heard someone say <br>
&quot;Firiona Vie is in Lfay&quot;.. I felt a string in my heart plucked and played at that moment and knew I must head there..<br>
I opened a portal for myself and a friend and we teleported to Butcher, I called upon the spirit scale of the wolf to carry us there swiftly. As we zoned into Lesser Faydark I checked the ground for footprints and saw a footprint light and delicate.. the step of Firiona Vie herself.. <br>
I followed her path untill I caught up to her.. Her beauty stunned me... an aura of pure grace surrounded her.. I knew this was truely Tunare's champion! Struck with awe, words came to me... a poem about her, <br>
<br>
&quot; An Elven maiden there was of old,<br>
A shining star by day,<br>
her mantle black was hemmed with gold,<br>
Her shoes a silver grey.<br>
A star was bound upon her brow,<br>
A light was in her hair,<br>
And Tunare herself doth smile upon,<br>
This Elven maiden fair&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled upon me and bid me to follow her.. I did as she asked and she led me to a mystical unicorn. This unicorn Equestrielle radiated with life energy, truely was one of Tunare's blessed creatures. He spoke to Firiona Vie shortly and told her of a ceremony that must be preformed. By this time a rather large crowd had appeared and some heretic, foul followers of Cazic Thule were verbally assulting Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
The Unicorn bid us to follow him to the sacred place where the ceremony could be preformed.. we all followed him to the Fairy rings, he said that they were the only place connected enough to the Plane of Growth to preform the ceremony.<br>
He then told Firiona Vie that she was the 5th element..of life and that she needed to find the other four elements to stand in the middle of the circle of people to summon Tunare.<br>
Firiona closed her eyes and picked out the first person,<br>
A high elven cleric that had pledged his service to her.. She identified him as the Fire Caller. She walked around the inside of the circle of people and stopped before me, taking my hand and drawing me into the middle, changing my identity from Lalinai Amarylii to Lalinai the Wave Caller.. I set down in the middle of all those people rather confused and bewildered, yet so very honored.. She picked two others, a druid like myself named the Wind Caller, and a Dwarven Paladin named the Earth Keeper..<br>
<br>
She handed each of us a Stone of Faith and bid us stand in seperate corners like a compass with her in the Middle.. we did as she said.<br>
She reached her hands into the air and closed her eyes, murmuring words i could not hear.. A soft breeze whispered throu the trees as she chanted... She then instructed the Cleric to use his faith stone.. He did so and his fists burst into flame, the breeze grew warm almost hot as he did so.. signaling the element of fire.<br>
She then turned to me, I stood proud as she placed her hand on my shoulder and told me to call the element force of water,<br>
<br>
I clicked my stone and let forth a mighty yaulp, suddenly dew sprouted from every plant in the forest, sending a lovely raw green smell floating throu the air.. I felt a cool aura surround me and stay with me, a sound like waves crashing to shore echoed throu me.. filling me with a strange sense of peace. <br>
<br>
She the turned to the Wind Caller and instructed him to click his stone. He did so and the wind blew with an intense force almost knocking some off thier feet filling us all with a sense of lightness and happiness.<br>
<br>
She turned to the Earth Keeper and bid him to call the elements of Earth.. He did so.. and his body was made strong by the power of earth... A surge of energy swept up over us, birds started singing louder than ever.. it seemed as if every animal in the woods was sending out thier life energy to help with the ceremony...<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie then took her place in the middle of the Callers and shouted to the heavens...&quot; Mother please bless us with your presense.. I summon you now!&quot; She then must have clicked the Stone of Life for then a great light appeared in the heavens and the thunder rolled over us .. and The Mother Of All appeared right before my eyes... taller than any giant I've ever seen.. I immediately bowed and kneeled before her..&quot;<br>
Firiona had to tell the crowd to back up and let her talk to Tunare..<br>
Firiona apologized to her for losing the Lifeguide staff to the evil Iksar shaman Danak. Tunare took this in stride and forgave her champion.. Telling her she must seek the Ring of Scale for more answers.. Firiona grew very agitated then, remembering what had happened last time she ventured into the RoS grasps.. She had lost her memories, they had stolen them from her... Tunare then promised her that it would not happen again. <br>
<br>
Suddenly a dark cloud rolled over us.. a foul stench overcame us and fear raced through all of our hearts... Cazic-Thule himself had just appeared in the circle... He laughed at Tunare and was verbally assaulting her and Firiona... many a would be heroes ran at him... ready to kill.. only to find he was invulnrable.. Tunare told us to leave, but Firiona Vie refused to leave the Mother.. protecting her god with her life..<br>
<br>
As a caller I felt I was in my place to stay as well.. I stood fast by Firiona's side in front of Tunare..ready to give my life for the Mother.. Firona attacked Cazic with impressive skill.. her blade shining in the dark of the forest.. Cazic laughed at her and layed his gnarled hand on Tunare.. Tunare screamed in pain and ran around the circle of people ... Cazic spoke theese words.. &quot; Be gone with you foolish one.. you are powerless to stop me.. I walk now in your woods unbothered.. this is my place now&quot; and with that Tunare vanished.. Cazic had banished her from this world!! I fell to my knees crying.. I had failed in my task to protect the Mother.. The Unicorn Equestrielle re-appeared then and began to help Firiona in battle.. Firiona begged the unicorn to stop but he would not relent his attack on Cazic.. Cazic laughed at Equestrielle and grabbed his horn... The horn immediately began to glow a putrid green.<br>
He had tainted the sacred unicorn.. With that Cazic Thule cackled and said &quot; this is your present Firiona!&quot; With that he dissapeared.. lightning crackling overhead and a foul stench of sulphur lingering in the air...<br>
<br>
The unicorn looking very ill walked to Firiona and said,<br>
&quot; He has corrupted me.. the only way to cure this is to cut off my horn Firiona.. you must.&quot; <br>
Firiona shook her head and said she would not.. that there had to be some other way.. The unicorn nuzzled her and reassured her.. telling her she MUST cut off the horn..<br>
Crying, with her shoulders slumped Firiona pulled out her lovely jeweled sword.. and with one quick skillfull slash she removed the horn and placed it into her pouch, promising to find a way to restore its power and cleanse it. She then turned to the other Callers and I and told us..&quot; I must go home now..to Felwithe, I shall summon you to me when I need you&quot; with that she dissapeared..<br>
<br>
About 10 min later I was running throu Butcher Block and a light surrounded me..I dont remember anything for a few minutes but then suddenly I popped in right next to the Elven Princess standing in the Cleric guild in Felwithe.. She asked the four callers to stand side by side facing her.. a huge crowd was behind us as she called us out one by one and handed us all a coin...She directed us to turn them into Lord Nethrynn in the inn to become a member of the Realm of Heroes.. I stood there for a minutes completely in awe of this great champion, then I ran to the inn and turned in my coin eagerly!<br>
<br>
Lord Nethrynn then shouted zone wide,<br>
&quot; All Hail Lalinai the Wave Caller, her actions of bravery has earned her a place in the Realm of Heroes!!&quot;<br>
The Lord then turned to me and bowed.. holding out a shimmering cloak to me, I gasped and took the cloak tenderly afraid to harm it.. I bowed and thanked the man and ran back wanting to thank Firiona as well.. I got there and there she was.. standing proud and tall in the midst of what must have been a horrible depression.. I stood there admireing her strength and bowed before her thanking her from the bottom of my heart.. She smiled upon me and bid me off my knees as I was kneeling before her.. She then told me how proud of the Callers she was..how it filled her with pride as they had all stood before the Mother at that last battle.. I smiled and told her then..&quot; I would do the same for you M'lady... I pledge my life to thee&quot;.. <br>
<br>
She turned to the crowd of people and announced that she was tired after such a trying day and that she was going to retire..She then turned back to the Callers and told us to always be ready.. That she would call on us when she needed our help in searching for the Ring of Scale.. I bowed before the Champion and bid her to rest well..<br>
She waved goodbye to us all and dissapeared then..<br>
<br>
It has been months since Firiona Vie's apperance. I await anxiously for her return.<br>
<br>
