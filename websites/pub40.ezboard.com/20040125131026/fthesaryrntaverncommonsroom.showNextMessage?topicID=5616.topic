However; I mostly do LDoN dungeons. I have found that even for a 65 Shaman, I have some problems getting a group quickly.<br>
<br>
So here is my idea: Build a guild that is open to all people levels 20-65 and the guilds focus will be on LDoN groups. So that people can get groups. The hardest part is being level 20 and getting LDoN groups, it gets a bit easier the higher level you are. My idea will allow peoples mains and alts to be in the same guild, and have better access to LDoN groups, and more importantly have the ability to do more of them in the time you do have to play.<br>
<br>
The problem is the casual player only has a few hours to play, and if they are unable to find a group quickly the dungeon might actually take longer than the time they have, and you can end up wasting a lot of play time just trying to find a group.<br>
<br>
The semi-casual player would benifit from alot more groups in the time they do play, thus increasing there point accumilation in the amount of time they do play.<br>
<br>
The more hardcore player benifits the same as a semi-casual player getting more points in the time they are playing, with less downtime inbetween dungeons.<br>
<br>
With enough interested people a LDoN guild could help its members gain more Adventure Points faster than they could finding pick up groups on there own, and eliminating alot of the &quot;LFG&quot; time.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to put this idea out there for people, and find out how many people might be interested, and according to how many positive responses I recieve, continue to create this guild, or forget about it and move on to other things.<br>
<br>

Not everyone can run though a Hard adventure in less the 50 mins or an normal in less then 30. but then those that can are in the Raid-centric guilds <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://e.domaindlx.com/imminentdefeat/Images/nishwtext.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

A guild totally based on LDON would fit my needs for a long time and I wouldn't have to deal with as much downtime LFA. Presently, Ldon is all I wanna focus on, no epic stuff, farming or anything so I'd be game for something like that. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198579">Marshall Albyen Anklechopper</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Casual LDoN raids would be a nice change of pace from LDon grinding. Also its important to understand that people in the guild would do other things, not JUST LDon. I am sure many members would go off and do some planar XP and AA mining when they are the correct levels. I am not planing on some militia mentality guild that will break fingers of anyone who isn't in a LDoN. <br>
<br>
The idea is to put together a guild of like minded people who want to do mainly LDoN groups, eventually working into LDoN raids, if people find that interesting. Many people I know, including myself, dislike raiding, and find it boring and time consuming. I see many problems in the bigger guilds no matter what their loot distribution system is, many people feel as though they are being looked over, or that they are being screwed out of loot. an LDoN focused guild would have less problems with such an arrangement, as the main loot in LDoN is point bought, not dropped. (Though we all know, no matter what system is being used, somebody is gonna feel like they are being screwed, thats just the way it goes. People have feelings, and sometimes they aren't justified.)<br>
<br>
and honestly, this guild just isn't for everyone, some people are going to think the idea sucks, and they are perfectly justified in their feelings, as it would suck for them. Though I am just trying to see if there would be a large enough interest in the idea, if so then Saryrn would have an alternative to huge raiding guilds. A huge LDoN guild to find LDoN groups quickly and easily. Eventually most people would find a group or two of people they enjoy playing with, and there would develop &quot;clicks&quot; of players. Thats good in some ways, not so good in others, but thats the way social structures work. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I will keep checking back on further comments, all the input I get is useful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=annabriespiritsoaring@thesaryrntavern>Annabriespiritsoaring</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/6/03 12:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5598.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tenkei is now re-forming, as saryrns LDoN guild...</span><hr size=1> If your tired of having a hard time finding LDoN groups, or aren't finding them fast enough, then Tenkei has your solution. We are building our player base around the idea of LDoN players level 20-65 can find groups faster in a guild that focuses on doing LDoN. Like minded people joining together to get the most out of LDoN.<br>
<br>
Casual Players, and semi-casual players benifit a great deal, as they will be able to find LDoN groups more easily, more hardcore players will benifit from a higher Adventure point/time spend ratio.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or wish to join Tenkei, please contact me in game, or email me at Annabriespiritsoaring@hotmail.com with questions or times and locations to meet you for recruitment.<br>

<br>
Sounds good in theory, but the reality is that LDoN raids are pretty damn hard.  To gear up 36 people through LDoN adventures to a point that they'd stand a chance in one of the raids would take an extremely long time (unless you've got a bunch of just super hardcore LDoN'ers).  If SoE added some raids for people in NToV-quality gear, I think this idea becomes much more viable.  Anyhow, good luck with it.  I hope you're successful.<br>

I came back because what I realized I thought was cleric burnout was raid/grind burnout, and in a big way.  I have a character on Stromm that I love playing, but found that the post-60 game there makes it almost impossible to find LDoN groups for a lack of key classes interested in them at all.  So, based on friends telling me of the larger popularity of LDoN here, I came back.<br>
<br>
It would be safe to say that without this expansion I would have quit EQ a number of months ago.  As it is, I am now working towards goals (sadly just gear, I'm hoping the next expansion takes the instancing and single-group content approach to things like zone progression and moving through a real storyline ala PoP for raiders) and have not had as much fun on my cleric as I can remember in a long, long time.  <br>
<br>
I'm looking into a guild that some old friends of mine have formed, but if in addition to your &quot;all-LDoN&quot; guild there were a functioning LDoN channel (or if there is, let me know, last I heard from someone it was defunct) I would be altogether way too happy to participate in it.   <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Venerable Zarros Livinglight</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> High Elven Archon<br>
