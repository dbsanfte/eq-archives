So you're basically saying that 'whatever leadership decides is the 'right' thing'<br>
<br>
What if the 'leadership' is a fascist dicatorship huh?<br>
<br>
Just b/c someone makes rules doesnt mean it's morally or even legally correct...they make em cuz they have the power...and enforce em..cuz they have the power. <br>
<br>
And might does not make right, sorry to disappoint you.  And obviously most of the server has decided that FS isnt the right fascist dictatorship for them...so they left the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Any moron can make arbitrary rules and enforce them if he has the thugs to back him up...doesnt mean shit...<br>

This wasn't anywhere she was advertising but using for her personnal use.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Aye an important point.  But she proceeded from putting the altered work on her wall for her and her family to see(FS private forums), to putting a sign up in here front yard for anyone who passed by to see(FS public forums), to putting up a billboard on a busy street(made it her EZboard sig).  Along the way she got busted by the artist(first Ciara as part of the PA community and then the whole of the PA community) and the lies started cranking out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is a HUGE difference between disagreement and disrespect. What Ciara did was disrespectful. Sure Hayley MAY have been in the wrong but Ciara deserved everything she got. FS is a moderated board. Not a democrocy. She could have dropped it and hit the &quot;EDIT&quot; button and only the people who read the boards everyday would know what happened.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Depends on your pov and your personal feelings.  I never felt I owed Hayley an ounce of respect.  She had done too many things in the past to lose the initial starting respect I give people I dont know and had dont nothing but further erode her respect level.  Cant speak for Ciara, but cant imagine she felt the need to respect Hayley either.  Especially when that sig popped up after Ciara made the post that linked to PA to begin with and said &quot;Hey check this site out but please respect their policies.&quot;  Hayleys sig then pops up in direct disrespect to all of that.  At that point why should Ciara owe Hayley any respect even if Hayley had no past history?<br>
<br>
I posted/post on those boards knowing that my posts are subject to deletion.  By I do have a voice and dont feel any need to be quiet just because Lord Hayley has spoken.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ciara, while empathetic to her, got what was coming. You think I am wrong then go insult your boss and stand up in front of everyone and call him/her a thief and a liar and see if you still have a job. Hayley &quot;Edited&quot; or &quot;Deleted&quot; posts that is her right. She as the guild leader is enforcing the GUILDS rules not hers. Dernhelm has already said he did it too.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If my boss is stealing and lieing then her bosses and I could prove it(and it has been proved on Hayleys account numerous times) then my bosses boss would shit can her and pat me on the back for finding it out.  In this case Hayleys boss is the guild.  The guild is under no obligation to Hayley she leads only as long as the people of the guild empower her to lead and not a second longer.  In the case of FS, without the power/desire to fire Hayley outright, the OVERWHELMING majority of the guild &quot;fired&quot; her by leaving.<br>
<br>
It might be Hayleys right to delete/edit posts(and I would argue that point also), it is my right to come here and post about it.  I am under no obligation as a member of FS or of the server community to help with Hayleys coverups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While Hayley has shown some character flaws, she seems to be doing the right thing. Regardless of the reasons behind it. Guilt shows a concious. While I say piss on EQPA, I would not have done it and I think the morale thing to do was not do it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But how many times do you just let it slide by?  How long before Hayley should realize she isnt cut out for this and just go hang out in a corner cybering Detah?  She isnt a monster.  She just screws up time after time after time after time and does not have the moral strength to own up to it unless she is forced to.  She has to be guilted into doing anything even close to the right thing.  And this isnt guilt she comes upon on her own, its guilt forced on her by her peers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyone tell me how you know something? I mean really, sit down and think about how you know 2 + 2 =4. You know it because trial and error and learning from mistakes. So Hayley is a slow learner on some things. Just because you have your own values and morales doesn't mean she grew up with the same thing. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But the time comes when that person has screwed up enough that they need to realize they are in over their head and are negatively affecting those she is responsible for helping.<br>

Agree that the sig part is done with.  But the lies and deception that she spread about the sig dont go away with the sig.  She just flat out lied.  Everyone here knows it.  She knows it.  Its not the first time.  Its another time in a long list of times.  A person like that isnt fit to lead a guild like FS which at one time was actually respected. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bygzalf>Bygzalf</A> at: 6/10/03 4:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bygzalf>Bygzalf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 595<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/10/03 4:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3262.topic&index=304>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: omfg</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So it this when I post the screenshot of Hayley claiming she owned Detah, his bank accounts, email accounts etc?

Hayley decided that ksky was a homewrecker and proceeded to make her life a living hell and to do her best to ruin ksky's name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ksky is my friend, she is a great shaman, and certainly NOT the type of girl to get involved with a loser like Detah! (let alone get involved in a virtual relationship like Hayley)<br>

<br>
First off, Muse Muse Muse is the coolest. Cooler than Rainessa, cooler than Kocho, cooler than Pash. Someday, when I am Muse Vainne Niteblind, I hope to approach that coolness. Unless I decide to leave Vai swimming in the lava in the Temple of Veeshan...but that is another story.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I'll address the part of Haley's lament that mentions me:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>With the exception of Vainne, I cannot think of one tavern regular that would say with absolute conviction that they would expect to be able to distribute said lootages as they see fit if not aquired on a guild raid.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok I read this three times and am not sure what I would do differently still, but I think what Haley meant is that I am such a selfless, generous, and wonderful person that I would never ever sell anything ever.<br>
<br>
I am touched that I can have this reputation and I remember vaguely making silly arguments that said something quite like that, but it is not true. In fact, if you're selling copies of Spectral Bard parchments instead of holding them for your FS bards, please note: I'm looking for Riz and Chorus of Marr. ALso HoS.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, the copright issue:<br>
<br>
It would be Polite to abide by it. But that is all. Legally binding...sure. Right. Go spend legal fees either way trying to enforce something like that...there's an entire ez board devoted to the appropriation of images to make EQ signatures, at least on the bard boards tons of people changed around primary weapons to make them offhand, eliminated backgrouds, etc etc etc...the thing they Did do of course, was leave the logo in, as asked...but again that is the polite thing to do--perhaps the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but that is all it is.<br>
<br>
Art history itself has a long and colorful history of appropriated images, and making them pixels on the web only increases this factor.<br>
<br>
All of that being said however, I love the site, I spent hours playing with it, and I have tons of respect for what you all have accomplished with it....however I would agree that what Haley did wrong here was not really the &quot;stealing&quot;--(and she wasnt even the one who made the image right?)--it was the trying to defend herself by editing posts and offering to pay people. Simply adding the links would have sufficed, and been polite enough...and if she was smarter she would have realized that.<br>
<br>
Fourthly, FS...which is none of my business.<br>
<br>
If your leader sucks, get a new one. But stop whining about it already.<br>

<br>
EQPA has a legal right to stop Hayley from using the sig, but I will admit that it would be highly impractical and not cost-effective to enforce that right, if Hayley were to thumb her nose at them.  There are lots of examples of this in the world .. you can be totally right, but proving it in a court of law isn't worth the trouble or the cost.  (Aside: that's why many &quot;nuisance&quot; suits, for example suits by employees against their employers, get settled, because the cost of settling is often far lower than the cost of winning a court battle.)  Nevertheless, that legal &quot;right&quot;, whether it has practical significance or not, is more than a question of polite behavior in civilized society.  <br>
<br>
Let's keep the issues separate.  There's the issue of whether it's legal to modify an artist's work.  There's the issue of whether it's fair or ethical to modify the artist's work, regardless of what the law would provide.  And then there is the issue of whether the artist has any practical remedy if her work is used in a way that everyone agreed they wouldn't use it.  All of those issues are worthy of discussion, but I think you've morphed issue 1 into issues 2 and 3.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3057<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/10/03 7:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3262.topic&index=312>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: copyright</span><hr size=1> I should have been keeping up with this thread, my name was mentioned:<br>
