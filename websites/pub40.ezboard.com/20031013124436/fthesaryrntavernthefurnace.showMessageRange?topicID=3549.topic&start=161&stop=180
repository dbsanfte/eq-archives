Some Americans see themselves as the World's Lifeguard.  This may be truer to the point, but keep in mind, America will always look out for Number 1 first (of course).  Bush has promised a &quot;distinctly American internationalism&quot; ...<br>

Why would a Liberal not handle the situation the same way?

<br>
No it's not assanine. And it's not even asinine. (Y'know, Iaeriel, when you're insulting someone else's intelligence, it helps to spell the insults correctly. So readers can at least have an idea that you know what they mean.)<br>
<br>
Let me explain my reasoning for this opinion about the Democrat Party. Thanks for conceding that &quot;democrat&quot; equates with &quot;liberal&quot; in this respect. It saves me time. The Democrat (liberal) party likes to call itself the &quot;party of inclusion.&quot; A better term would be the &quot;party of equivocation.&quot; This is because when you try to &quot;include&quot; everybody in your power base, you end up having to equivocate in response to every decision for fear of offending one person or another. Democrats do this every waking moment. No decision is made, however trivial, until the flags are raised to test the wind. Until anonymous quotes are floated in the media to &quot;take the pulse&quot; of the power base. If the decisions are even slightly non-trivial, Bill Clinton's favorite technique is implemented... POLL-TAKING. (I think Clinton commissioned more polls during his White House years than the previous six presidents did combined, although don't quote me on that. LOL)<br>
<br>
Acting decisively isn't consistent with equivocating.<br>
<br>
Now, I would probably concede that a Democrat president would have attempted to protect &quot;the country to the best of there ability. Even to the best of THEIR ability. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They're not traitors, after all. (Hmm... this could be argued about Bill Clinton with respect to giving national security secrets to the Red Chinese but that's a topic for another thread.) But what would a Democrat president THINK is the best response is the billion-dollar question.<br>
<br>
You see, I consider the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq to be parts of Bush's decisive response to 9-11. Those invasions told the world, and specifically our Islamo-Fascist enemies world-wide that THIS particular American administration was not going to be &quot;taking it&quot; anymore. It doesn't matter if the rulers of Afghanistan supported the Taliban, or if Saddam gave tacit support, or if Saddam did or did not have WMDs. We can be certain (with a confidence approaching 100%) that these governments are on &quot;the other side&quot;, i.e. legitimate enemies of the United States who considered the destruction of the Twin Towers to be praiseworthy. That alone is justification for Bush to take the decisive actions he did.<br>
<br>
And the effect has been very powerful. No more saber-rattling from Libya, from Syria, from Cuba. Very little from Iran. Russia doesn't seem to find much to argue with us about these days. (Right after we rolled into Baghdad, both France and Germany started talking to us about &quot;helping&quot; us occupy the country. LOL.) All those Third World despots were probably locked to their TV sets during the Afghan and Iraq invasions and I'm sure they were very impressed. <br>
<br>
Now, do you think a Democrat president (Clinton or... [hahaha] Algore) would have taken such decisive action?<br>
<br>
I suspect not. Especially since I don't think ONE of the Village Idiots running for president now supports the actions Bush took in Afghanistan and Iraq. (Some of them might have expressed support back in 2002 when national opinion was mostly in lockstep behind Bush. But not anymore. The winds have changed. Polls have been conducted. See what I mean about Democrat EQUIVOCATION?)<br>
<br>
Heck, I'm not saying the Republicans are without sin. Far from it. They sample the winds also. But overall I think they're more committed to a nationalistic point of view which is essential for national security in a dangerous world. Life is choosing the least evil from a bunch of lousy choices. They're my choice, at least until something better comes along. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maneta@thesaryrntavern>Maneta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/29/03 1:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3549.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> you disagree with me, so I will shoot you</span><hr size=1> &quot;You see, I consider the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq to be parts of Bush's decisive response to 9-11.

<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition I suggest invasions of China, Korea, Nepal, perhaps even Australia (I have quite a few Aussie friends, they say Bush is quite hated there and in fact they praise bin laden's bombing of the WTC as a brilliant political act).  I'm sure the world will get the message that the USA is tired of being everyone's bitch!<br>

Wow, and I thought <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was the expert. I defer to your expertise though, if you're &quot;fairly certain&quot; what all the world's despots are thinking right now. You got an inside source in the International Despots Union?!<br>
<br>
The message I think the North Koreans got was this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Support international terrorism against U.S. interests and face the risk of having your despotic government replaced.&quot;<br>
<br>
How do I know what Al Gore would have done after 9-11? <br>
<br>
I'm &quot;fairly confident&quot; he would be true to his Democrat roots. <br>

Hmm?

As for reason not to invade irak, because we all want to avoid of these right?<br>
<br>
1- Economic strain and loss of life of a lengthy occupation<br>
2- Radicalisation of many many otherwise moderate iraki<br>
3- Triggering another nuclear arms race.<br>
4- Creating another hot spot in the middle east when we have 2 that need solving allready (afghan war and the israel/palestine conflict)<br>
5- Divert ressources and focus from fighting radical islam all over the world.<br>
<br>
Any one of these would have been more than enough for any sane person to arrive to the conclusion that invading irak was a hudge ass mistake.<br>
<br>
And dont give me the WMD argument. No sane person believe he had anything of substance after more than 10 years of sanctions and 4 months of UN inspector roaming around. The worst case scenario was that he had a limited stock of chemical or biological weapon and was going to share it with some terrorist organization. The irony is that scenario  was made MORE likely as soon the US invaded irak since by then saddam would have nothing to lose. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallaorn>Gallaorn</A> at: 9/29/03 4:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vtynofsaryrn>Vtyn of Saryrn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/29/03 5:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3549.topic&index=177>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not enough guns! thats the problem!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Believe it or not big businesses generally do more good than bad.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hammer, meet nail.<br>

Your idiocy is profound.  But in all honesty it is probably not your fault.  You have been brainwashed, like so many other millions of Americans, into believing that this Corporate driven, fast-food consumer, SUV driving economy is actually good for the world.<br>
<br>
I got news for you, it's not.  Corporate America does factors more harm than good every single day.  Fast food is poison.  We shouldn't need 1/5 the number of cars that we as Americans put on the road every single day.<br>
<br>
Just open your mind up.  It's all right there right in front of your eyes every single god damned day.  Republicans and Democrats alike are equally to blame, the political thing is merely another tool to keep us divided.  Use your brain and think for yourself.  You don't have to accept what you see and hear on the TV as truth, you can make your own judgements.  <br>
<br>
DON'T BE AFRAID.  That is the most important part of all.  Fear is the tool that the Government and Corporations use to keep you in check.  If you fear what they tell you to fear, they control you.<br>

I mean who needs a computer or anything like that right? Not like any of us use them to do anything. But who actually made the first mass produced computers? <br>
<br>
When you go and cook your non-poisoned food, do you look to see what was used to grow it? Or do you simply suspect that it was grown in a field and a single person went to go pick it just for you. <br>
<br>
The world is made up of big businesses and many of the luxuries that we take for granted here are non-existent in other places. <br>
<br>
Oh and Arkay are you referring to the same UN that was selling military hardware to Iraq? Or the UN that blocked any form of new resolution for Iraq because they were trying to get their money out of them? The UN is worse than our own congress in deciding matters and every country has an agenda of their own. Its like trying to heard dorfs. France and Russia, who were both permanent members of the UN security council, sold arms to Iraq. Even after the sanctions were put into place. Does this mean we should put all of our faith in the UN to police the world and keep us safe? Hell, who wouldnt want France to have a say in our safety right?<br>

<br>
Worst case scenerio before 9/11 for a hijacked plane was them killing passengers or crashing the plane into the ground.<br>
<br>
And as far as the WWGD(What would Gore Do)...I believe this comment sums it all into perspective.<br>
