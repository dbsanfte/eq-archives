My Father was a wealthy merchant, and a noble of the city. My mother was a devote follower of Quellios, believing strongly in life and inner peace. I had the skills and intelligence of my people; I didn't have the time or will to practice the arcane arts of magic. I had dedicated my life to the use of arms for the higher powers of Quellios, to the defense of those to weak to fight ageist those who blindly assaulted them. I am Harleem.<br>
<br>
I had attended the schools of Quellios, passed my tests as a squire and learned a little of the healing arts that are bestowed upon Paladins. At this point I was sent off, to do good for the world, and spread the word of Quellios to those who my listen, and to help those who would not. My travels took me to Qeynos.<br>
<br>
I got off the boat in this human city. It was not at all like Erudin, but I was used to foreign ports. I knew right away to stay out of the Fish's Ale, being the closest bar to the docks, it also tended to be the roughest. I made my way to the temple of Karana. Though I wasn't a follower, I knew I could get some help with directions in the overland routes to the great human city of Freeport. <br>
<br>
I found the temple, more like a small city within the city. There were followers and soldiers milling about. I inquirers as to where the head priest could be found. The man I asked looked me up and down. &quot;Your not a mage? We don't see to many Erudite warriors... in fact we never see Erudite warriors.&quot; he said, a little bit amazed. I smiled at him, &quot;Sir, I am Harleem, paladin of Quellios the Tranquil. I have come seeking shelter and some directions to the over land routes to Freeport.&quot; He looked at me once again. &quot;Well it seems that you have come to the right place, there have been many bandit attacks on the caravans heading though the Karanas. You will most likely be able to get on one of these caravans as a guard.&quot; He explained to me the bounty placed on bandits, then sent me to the Lion's Mane Inn for shelter and more info on this.<br>
<br>
I made my way to the Lion's Mane Inn. There where a few human merchants in there. I hailed one of them as I entered. &quot;I have no need for a mage.&quot; he said, giving me a half a look. I explained to him that the Paladins of Karana sent me to help them out. He looked me over again &quot;You don't seem to be a mage...&quot; I explained to him that I was a champion of Quellios, the Tranquil. &quot;You don't look like a monk, son. Please, we have trouble enough as it is without some joke from a Erudite enchanter with a spell on himself.&quot;  I rolled my eyes; this was going to take some doing &quot;Sir, I would like to help you out. I am willing to journey with you though the Karanas. I would like to learn more of the bandits that infest the area. You my call me Harleem, I will be down later for dinner, and will meet you once again.&quot; With that I went to the counter and got my room for the night.<br>
<br>
Later that evening I went back down for dinner. The merchants where there, and the one I spoke with came right up to me. &quot;Son, I had a friend of mine check into your story, and indeed you are correct. I would more than happy to have you accompany us on a trip to High Hold Pass...&quot; after that we worked out the details, getting everything set to travel the next day. <br>
<br>
The next morning I woke up. I made my way to the city gate where the merchants where making a few last deals before they left. It wasn't long before they had all of their crafted secure and we where moving out. The first leg of the trip was calm. We went though the hills of Qeynos, and entered the western portion of the Karanas, heading to a Barbarian outpost. <br>
<br>
The outpost was just a small fishing village. I had seen very few of these huge people in my travels. They were not very well educated, but when asked about the bandits, they where nice enough to tell me about them. It seems that the bandits had all the roads blocked, and that the guards Qeynos had set out here where having little to no effect on their raids. They tend to stay clear of the barbarian village, though. These folks were very well armed, and didn't have much to offer in the way of loot. We spent a few hours with the barbarians, and then headed down the coast to avoid the roads.<br>
<br>
A great river flowed next to us, out into the crossing of Erude (as it had become known). I spent most of this boring time cleaning my weapons and armor. The time was slow and soon it was time to stop for the night. The master of the caravan was swearing. He had wanted to push though to a great stone bridge that day, but was we were off the road and the going was slower. <br>
<br>
I set up my watch, along with some of the guards the merchants hired to head out with them. Then I saw him. He was in a large dark robe and tends to stay in the shadows, rarely showing himself in the day. It was a dark priest of Innoruuk. His weapons and armor where of the highest quality and he wielded a magnificent weapon. He looked at my indifferently, and went about his prayers to himself. I figured just as long as he didn't try anything to me, or those I was protecting that I wouldn't do anything.<br>
<br>
The night fell on the camp, the fires were put out, and the merchants slept in their wagons or in tents. I had just fallen asleep when a hand tapped me on the shoulder. &quot;Your watch, Sir&quot; a heard a young man say. I put my armor back on, and took my place. The moon was full, making it fairly easy to see. I then saw the priest of Innoruuk once again. He was walking towards me. &quot;Good evening paladin of Quellios&quot; he said &quot;You have nothing to fear from me, I am also employed by these caravan to protect if from the bandit attacks. My name is Zege.&quot; I felt a little better about this and we struck up a quite conversation. <br>
<br>
An hour later a storm blew into the area. It was raining and miserable, but not as bad as the storms off the ocean. Zege pointed out to a hill. In a lightning strike I saw it.  People were up there. I hunched down and looked at Zege. He pointed to the hill and stealthily started moving up. I got on the other side of him, a few yards away and moved up with him, my crystalline blade out. We moved up to where the movement was and saw 3 people with rusty weapons looking at the wagons, they hadn't noticed us. I was about to ask them what they were doing when Zege cast a spell; roots came from the ground, grasping him into place. The other two turned and saw me, and attacked. <br>
<br>
The two of them fell on me with speed, not even bothering to find out what happened to their friend. I parried their attacked with my shield, another magic item given to me by my father. I slashed at one with my sword, while hitting the other with my shield. The one I hit my shield wasn't ready for it and fell over. Zege came out of the shadows and bashed his skull with his mace. The one I was fighting tried once again with his rusty weapon, but my armor was proving to good for him, with but a few nicks and bruises I fought back, overpowering him with my superior weapon. The last one saw his friends go down and tried to flee. He fell on his face. Zege went up to him and grabbed him by the hair. &quot;Where is the your fellow bandits&quot; he said to him, though clenched teeth. The bandit was scared and gave up all the information he had, telling us of a farmhouse where they were staying. The roots let free and he turned around looking at us. Zege lifted his weapon ready to strike, but I held his hand. &quot;He must die!&quot; Zege yelled. I wasn't going to let him be his mans judge, and I bound the bandit, and put him with the merchant caravan. I grabbed the sashes of the other bandits, as prove of the fight.<br>
<br>
Zege and I had a location of a bandit camp and we needed to act on this information now. I said my good byes to the master of the caravan and we headed off, to the west, where the farms where. After an hour of travel we found the first one. I looked around and saw no movement inside. It looked like it was a normal farm, very well kept. I found a sign on the house that said 'The Millers' we looked around the house and found nothing, we moved on. <br>
<br>
After another hour and two more farmhouses we finally found one that wasn't quite right. The place looked ok, but there was people milling around in it. Most farmers would be asleep by now. We investigated further up, moving though the crops. There were 5 men, all armed with rusty and bronze weapons. They had bags, probably filled with loot from another travelers they had waylaid tonight. I looked at Zege as I pulled my weapon. He cast a spell while I charged. They were in compete surprise and the first one fell to my magic blade without even knowing I was there. The other four dropped there bags and turned to fight. <br>
<br>
Four to one wasn't very good odds, and I was quickly overwhelmed, but I continued to fight on, with Zege healing us from time to time. Our weapons had proven effective as we cut them down. My wounds where deep by the end of the fight, we took their bags and their weapons, Zege wouldn't leave without some sort of compensation for the fight. I just grabbed their sashes again, and we put the bodies in the fields. I had seen a guard tower about a half hours wolf from here, and we headed there.<br>
<br>
The two guards at the tower noted our report, and within ten minutes 4 guards went out for the farmhouse. The guards had taken care o the rest of the bandits. Though it did seem that one of them didn't seem too happy about it. I did hear of some corruption among the guards that protect Qeynos.<br>
<br>
We rested at the tower for the rest of the night, and headed into Qeynos the next morning. I had given the sashes to the paladin I met earlier and had got a small reward for them. With my new, though rather odd, companion Zege, I headed back out to Freeport...<br>
