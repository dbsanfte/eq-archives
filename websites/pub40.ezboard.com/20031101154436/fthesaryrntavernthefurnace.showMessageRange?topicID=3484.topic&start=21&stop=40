  Great comprehension skills you have there. <br>

 Azoicia very clearly and correctly stated that Aary popped Thursday night. We killed him thursday night. I'm quite sure that Saturday is only 48 hours after thursday, so even in your incorrect and flawed perception of the NTOV agreement, it would STILL be within your '72 hour window'.<br>

There is no mention of RoV in the NToV rotation rules, implied or not because it is not part of it.<br>
<br>
Because ToN previously asked if Isengard was going to do RoV after they were finished their rotation in NToV one should not assume that this would always be the case. <br>
<br>
This appears to be an unfortunate miscommunication that stemmed from an assumption that the guild in the rotation was entitled to the RoV event. <br>
<br>
You can't expect that the guilds that want to do the RoV event must be in the NToV rotation or that all the guilds in the NToV rotation wish to do the RoV event. They are seperate 'targets' and should be treated as such.<br>

I have the deepest respect for many of their members. I grew up with some.<br>
<br>
However, consider a few things before you shoot yourselves in the foot:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They were mobilizing, and ToN stepped on them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They weren't in the zone. We were.<br>
<br>
We've been doing RoV for...gods how long now? Since like May? March? Longer? Its a blur....<br>
<br>
In all of that time no one else has bothered.<br>
<br>
Recently ToS did it, I know Gol and Fotc have tried it. I didnt know Isen had, although I'd certainly rate their chances of succeeding pretty high, if they have a few goes at it to get the pattern down.<br>
<br>
However, including RoV in the rotation means, next week if Haley decides FS is going to attempt it and continue to attempt it, Isen won't have that chance. Suppose then Haley says, Hm, I hate Isen, I will give it to FoTC instead. You want to give control of RoV over to the guild that is in Ntov? When no one in the rotation currently has even completed it? What I guess you are saying is, you'd rather &quot;practice&quot; RoV once every five weeks, instead of every Saturday afternoon until you get it right?<br>
<br>
If Isen had had a raid force going in, we wouldn't have gone. I didnt do a who, but I certainly didnt see you mobilizing at the zone in, or the safe hall, or the arry pit...you made plans to do Rov on Friday on Saturday? I planned on getting my MM flag on Friday, myself...but you know, bloody TWC took the mob. Yeah they mean that way, evil bad people taking my mob...but Am I complaining?<br>
<br>
(No I am not, that was an example--me crying about that would be as silly as this.)<br>
<br>
You left a mob up that we do with fair regularity. For months and months and months. Inside and outside of the rotation. No one has ever complained before. No one has ever said, &quot;but he's part of the rotation!&quot; before...I find it kinda sad that my guildleader is nice enough to tell you what we do, offer to help you, and in general bend over to accomodate your whimsy, and this is the response.<br>
<br>
In at least my opinion, (and its true its not like I actually know anything), Isen has the best chance of the guilds in Ntov of completing RoV. And yet instead of dusting selves off next week and mobilizing before someone else does, you're crying to have another five weeks to wait before trying again...why? To give GoL a chance? (or whatever, no clue whose week it is next week.)<br>
<br>
IF you insist that RoV IS part fo the rotation there are some things you'd better work out. <br>
<br>
1.)When after the last dragon dies does it go ffa?<br>
<br>
2.)How many attempts are allowed before it goes ffa?<br>
<br>
3.) Do you allow &quot;gifting,&quot; and if so, do you allow it to guilds outside the rotation? So...are ToS or us even allowed in there ever? Or, to do Vulak, would we need to reenter the rotation? (Hm...and that would benefit you..how?)<br>
<br>
4.) How much time has to be given if the guild whose week it is hasnt killed Lady N, Vyemm etc, before another guild can move in?<br>
<br>
5.) Or would it be simpler for you if it never went ffa, and you each just got to try it once every five weeks? In a world where you all suceeded I could see this working quite well...but we're not in that world, are we?<br>
<br>
On a personal level, although RoV has been a great accomplishment for us, and although I still actually enjoy it, I'd be thrilled to see other people share that accomplishment. I'd be the first to grats you all doing it too. I'd like to think that this is just a misunderstanding, instead of these vague threats that we are evil and bad now, because we took &quot;your&quot; mob. Hell, none of you have killed it, its been ours for months. But that doesnt mean we wouldnt be happy to share.<br>
<br>

FS is not in a position to attempt Vulak, nor would we take pleasure in 1) spawning for the hell of it, or 2) gifting it to another guild.   I am flattered that you use me in your example, but FS does not play like this.  We have never blown a spawn to screw over another guild, nor would we want to.<br>
<br>
I do however feel that any guild should 1) respect the 72 hour time frame regardless of whether or not it is an &quot;event&quot;  or get permissions from the guild who is still rightfully in NTOV. <br>
<br>
This happened to us, when ToN just &quot;assumed&quot; that we couldnt kill Lady Nevederia, Vyemm and I believe Jorrelag even though we had several times before. They went in before our raid times and killed them.  This was very disappointing to FS as this was about all we could kill at the time.   (Yes we stopped doing Vyemm for a while, and that was the only exception)  My point being,  they incorrectly assumed they had the right to jump in and take what they wanted, when they wanted.  This was before they left the agreement, and still within FS alotted time frame of 72hrs.  <br>
<br>
I dont really have a point other than to say it sucks to be stepped on and hopefully, next time, people can just wait or discuss things amicably before hand. We are all too good to treat eachother so bad.<br>

This whole post is bullshit.  ToN is wrong, Isengard is right.  NToV rotation isn't the &quot;Aary, DtD, Vyemm, Lady Nev, etc.&quot; rotation... IT'S THE NToV ROTATION dumbasses.  RoV is part of the rotation, plain and simple, Tose wanted his guild out of NToV to accomplish bigger things, but he still wanted to farm RoV, fuck that, you left NToV, DEAL WITH IT.  Unless a guild gives you the right to do RoV or any mob for that matter, why are you even near ToV?  Being 'out of the rotation' doesn't put you above the law, it gives you the right to stay the hell out of NToV.  Get off your high horse and play fair.<br>

You are so correct, the right thing to do here is for you ALL to start doing Vulak! No matter that you might not be able to, it is, after all, your mob!<br>

Hayley, how about having your guild actually <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>kill</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Vulak before coming across as being the righteous and holy savior of Saryrn's down trodden guilds?

Killing Aaronyar doesn't prove that you can kill Vulak.<br>
<br>
Oh yes and before you say I don't know what I am talking about... let me remind you that I have been at raids that have killed Vulak while you have not. <p>-----

Frankly, most of the normal NToV loot rots, goes to recruits or is fed to pets. It's not worth our time to kill the lords and ladies. I'm however quite certain that we'd be prepared to jump right back into the rotation and kill the nameds for our turn at RoV. But I don't think that would be what the guilds currently still in the rotation would want, who could still benefit from the gear that drops in there want, and we'd rather not have to do it. <br>
<br>
But if the current consensus is that you MUST be in the rotation to attempt RoV and ToN still has a strong interest in RoV, the logical step would be for us to roll through NToV once every 5 or 6 weeks or whatever the hell the number is to get RoV. Wouldn't it be better if the gear we'd drop goes to a guild who could make better use of it? <br>
<br>
In the past RoV has never been part of the NToV rotation simply because 1) it was put in later and is 2) much more of a challenge than the normal NToV mobs. <br>
<br>
Due to the difference in the difficulty of the encounter, and the fact that it was a later addition, RoV should be a separate event and thus fif. <br>

<br>
We arent saying that we want to, tried to, or even give a flip about Vulak.  It's the fact that other guilds are killing other mobs, Lords/etc when its still rightfully another guilds &quot;turn&quot;  No one did this to ToN/HnE/TWC/OOP -- why would they do it to smaller guilds?  Most of the members in those guilds are above petty conflict like that.<br>
<br>
When another guild concludes that because our force is not on at 2pm PST (when I myself and our raid leader are still in school/work)  that we have forfeited rights to the rest of our NToV mobs, (nev, Vyemm, and the few that had not popped until very late) it does indeed become my concern.  My guild counted on those mobs at that time for upgrades.  Although this may be changing, we still rely on some of those upgrades/mobs.  We will farm it out until everyone has what they want. <br>
<br>
For another guild to just hop in and feed their pets loot that we actually use, and loot that actually improves us is a disappointment, and very rude.  We are more than happy, as im sure all guilds are, to leave Vulak alone. <br>
<br>
Speaking for FS, we want only the Lords, Ladies, Trips, Jorr, Dgarn, Aary, and anything else not Vulak that I am forgetting.  We kill it, depending on when it pops, and we get out.  We have other raid targets and want in and outta NToV as fast as possible.<br>

RoV has never been part of the &quot;rot&quot;, just like Eashen &amp; Ika.  ToS went in &amp; killed it with no bitching.<br>
<br>
Your only real complaint here is that you didn't get a notification like you did in the past.  Hrm.  Sorry, I took a day off, so didn't notify you.  Remind me of that the next time you guys do something, cause I'm sure I'd hate to miss it.  Please send me tells every time you guys kill something, so ToN knows what's going on.<br>

<br>
I dont care who kills Vulak, when and how.  As long as they arent killing the mobs that my guild is counting on for the weekend.  When we are done with NToV, (no more than 72 hours as has always been agreement) i would be more than happy to /t Kerowyn, /t Kordin, /t Seani, /t anyone else remotely interested &quot;FS cedes NToV, and proclaims FFA on Vulak&quot;<br>
<br>
We just want what we have always killed.  We have no interest in Vulak.  My ENTIRE point has benn ~communicate~ with the smaller guild that is currently counting on raiding NToV and let them have the mobs that give them loot, and still provide upgrades. <br>
<br>
As far as isen goes, it was unfortunate that a compromise couldnt be reached, and that ToN had to step on allies.  These things are forgiven, but rarely forgotton. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://ro0t.com/~hayley/HayleySig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Due to a multitued of problems (not enough people, screw ups, etc) we left ToV that night and Vyemm/lady nev were still up.  Come Tuesday, ToN did LadyNev/Vyemm/ROV without asking FotC if they could do it.<br>
<br>
Vainne, to answer your questions, here is some thoughts - <br>
<br>
1.)When after the last dragon dies does it go ffa?<br>
24 hours minimum.  This allows the guild whos week it is to return the day after clearing to attempt RoV.<br>
<br>
2.)How many attempts are allowed before it goes ffa?<br>
As many as they want within that 24 hours.  If they return the next day after that attempt again, so be it.<br>
<br>
3.) Do you allow &quot;gifting,&quot; and if so, do you allow it to guilds outside the rotation? So...are ToS or us even allowed in there ever? Or, to do Vulak, would we need to reenter the rotation? (Hm...and that would benefit you..how?)<br>
No, just like gifting isnt allowed currently.<br>
<br>
4.) How much time has to be given if the guild whose week it is hasnt killed Lady N, Vyemm etc, before another guild can move in?<br>
As long as they are in NToV attempting these mobs, as much time as is needed.  Its there week and there in NToV as required by the agreement.<br>
<br>
5.) Or would it be simpler for you if it never went ffa, and you each just got to try it once every five weeks? In a world where you all suceeded I could see this working quite well...but we're not in that world, are we?<br>
No, you can try it as many times as you want, as long as its your week.  It resets every 2 hours I believe?   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>
