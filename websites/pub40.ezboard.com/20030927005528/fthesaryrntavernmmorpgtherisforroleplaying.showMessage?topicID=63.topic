The graveyard had been here even since before his time, he'd visited it often. Making his way towards the familiar gravestone he lowered himself to one knee, and said the same prayer that always passed his lips on this day, in this place, at this very spot.<br>
"Karana, watch over thee, for she is a noble woman and her heart is true. Bless this soil with your cleansing rain and forgive the sins of past wrongdoings. Accept thee into the house of thunder. Amen"<br>
<br>
His mother had died and long since been buried here at her resting place. The memories of the pain and sorrow still rang true in Kulgan's heart. Qeynos is a very peaceful town. Far away from the hustle of Freeport, and only existing for the commerce received from Erudin. The night she passed had been a terrible night indeed. Twenty years ago to the very day, undead had made it's presence known in the hills of Qeynos. Hordes of the undead legions came pouring forth from the ground clawing and scrabbling at the earth to free themselves. Kulgan's mother had been walkingback from a business trip in Surefall Glade when she was accosted. There were no witnesses, which was probably for the best. Had Holly Windstalker not seen her corpse, she may have disappeared entirely.<br>
<br>
Kulgan was at home, he'd just gotten back from his guilds training grounds and was exhausted. In the distance, the huge clocked gonged out the time and Kulgan thought it strange that his mother hadn't made it back yet. It was only a short travel to Surefall, and typically he accompanied his mother, but today training was required. Kulgan requested that she wait untill he was done, but she refused saying that Karana would protect her. A knock came at the door. Kulgan opened the door to see a half elf breathing heavily looking as if he'd run miles without stopping. "Sir Kardaan, I have urgent information for you. Holly Windstalker requests your presence immediately! There has been an accident! Please, come quickly!" the half-elf tugged at his arm. <br>
<br>
He didn't waste any time. Having just gotten through with practice he was still fully armored and his weapons were still on his horse. Kulgan put on his helm, climbed onto his steed and set out towards the Glade. As he was riding, he felt the familiar sensation of ice chilled air. The creatures around him silenced, and he could hear his own breathing. This did not bode well, the only thing the animals would stay quiet this long for is undead. And where there was undead, there was sure to be a Necromancer or Shadowknight. Fog was rolling in on both sides of the street, unnatural fog, tinted with a greenish hue. This wasn't good, this wasn't good at all. Kulgan spurred his horse onward and finished the ride to Surefall Glade.<br>
When he arrived, he was ushered inside by the guards standing outside. "See Tracker Windstalker immediately!" was all they'd said. He went to her hut and gasped at what he saw. His mother was lieing on a cot, severely wounded and very pale. "What happened?! Who did this!? Will she be alright?! Where did this happen?!" he had so many questions that needed answering. Holly informed him that she'd been unconcious since her arrival and the only details she had were that she'd found his mother on the side of the road unconcious and bleeding from several wounds. "Her life force has been diminished, something out there stole it. I don't know what, but I don't like the sound of it at all. May Tunare protect us from the evil that has befallen us." <br>
<br>
Kulgan looked at his mother, concentrated, said a few arcane words and a blue light eminated from his hands, bathing his mother in the blue aura of healing. "It's no good, you can't heal her wounds. Her life force isn't strong enough to accept it. You'll have to find out what stole it, and slay the creature, only then will her lifeforce return to her." Kulgan knew what had to be done. "I'll need your finest trackers, I need you to show me exactly where you found my mother. Are there any other people here in the Glade that can assist me?" Holly whispered a few words into the pages ear next to her and he ran off. Minutes later three burly men lumbered up to the hut, clad in platemail and wearing horns on their helms. Moments later two more people showed up. "This is our finest tracker here in Surefall, she's been in my tutilage for many years now, and I stand by her abilities. This is the resident Cleric of the town, he'll be able to assist you as well. If there is undead, he will aid you greatly." Kulgan introduced himself to the three Barbarians, the Ranger and the Cleric. The plans having been laid out, Holly told the Ranger where she'd found his mother, and off they went. <br>
<br>
The fog had thickened to the point of almost no visibility. It's amazing that the ranger could even track her groupmates, much less find the spot where his mother had been accosted. Regardles, the ranger found the spot and began to look over the surrounding areas. "Damn this fog, it will make it difficult" she said, "but no matter, I've been known to track blindfolded." She examined the ground, the scrape marks that weren't immediately visible and the imprint of soft souled shoes, alog with the drops of blood here and there and pointed out their destination. "A caster of somesort and a skeleton. My guesses are a Necromancer. They've gone west towards the pass to the Karanas." Just then a loud inhuman cackle pierced the quiet night. Then another answered it's call, and another. They were surrounded.<br>
<br>
"To arms!" Kulgan cried out as he pulled his sword from it's sheath. The barbarians let out a battlecry that pierced the night and the cleric held his holy symbol in front of him defensively. A bony hand burst through the fog and clawed at Kulgan, scraping from his platemail. Kulgan instinctively swung around bringing his sword lashing out at the midsection of the skeleton and shattered it in a million pieces as his sword flared in a brilliant white light. The light cast from his sword illuminated the surrounding area and revealed the other skeletons surrounding them. Two barbarians lept forth to attack one skeleton while the cleric began to cast a spell. The ranger ran at the other foe and began hacking and slashing with all of her might. The other barbarian flew into battle with a warcry. Kulgan held his shield ready and sword high as the last two skeletons advanced on him. The clerics casting had begun and he was being surrounded by a white and purple light that came out in arcs around him. He pointed at one of the skeletons advancing on Kulgan and it exploded into bone shards and fragments and crumpled to the ground. Kulgan dispatched the remaining skeleton with a few slices from his sword and went to help the barbarians. The barbarians didn't need any help, the skeleton was being pummeled into dust be the sheer ferocity of their blows. One after the other their weapons came down, impacting on the spine and skull of the monstrosity. After it had died it took some coaxing to calm the barbarians down, they were still beating it into dust, such was the rage that filled them. The ranger had just finished her skeleton off as well and was being tended to by the cleric. <br>
<br>
"I think he knows we're on to him" said Kulgan. "Aye, I tend to agree with you. We should get moving, lets go." the ranger replied. With that the party moved west towards the pass. Loud moans and groans could be heard everywhere, accompanied by the cackling of skeletons and howls of wolves. Something very bad is happening here, Kulgan thought to himself. Something very evil indeed. Winding their way down the path to the guardhouses, something was amiss. The ranger went ahead of the group and ran back panting. "The guards are dead, all of them!" Kulgan replied, "Any signs of the necromancer?" "No, just his minions did this. He must be getting stronger, what we fought couldn't have done this." Kulgan would need time to think this over, but now they didn't have time. By the looks of it, time was running out, if the necromancer was getting stronger the longer he was there, he needed to be vanquished before irrepairable damage was done. "To the pass then." Kulgan said with strife. He would kill the wretched soul who had done the damage to his mother. He would have his revenge.<br>
<br>
The group walked on, a few minor skirmishes along the way with the lesser undead. Zombies and Skeletons tried to impede their progress, but they were no match for the skill of the party. Entering the pass they heard a shriek of terror come from deeper within. "Get ready, we're going to charge in and advance on anything there. Take care, for the bystanders, he may not have harmed them." Kulgan whispered to the party. Kulgan took the lead with the three barbarians behind him and the cleric and ranger in the rear. Running into the pass they were not prepared to see what they saw. Several animated corpses milled about the pass, skin rotting off and muscle tissue exposed, still bloody in some places. Their faces contorted in painful expressions as their body deteriorated. In the middle of all the corpses, animated dead and skeletons was one individual. His back was to the party and with no sign of alert, he simply turned and pointed at the newcomers, his face covered in darkness. "Ahh, I see you've come to join my army. One day I vowed that I would return and punish the people who'd sent me away so young to fend for myself. Now they will regret their decisions as I end their restful slumber in the aferlife, and subject them to a life of never ending pain and suffering. So, do you choose to join me of your own free will, or shall I destroy you now where you stand?" the figure said. "Join you? The likes of you whom would rather commune with the dead than speak with their peers? Blasphemy! Karana shall strike you down where you stand! For my mother!" and Kulgan rushed into combat, heading straight for the figure in the shadows. "HAHAHAHAHAHA, you shall now witness the power that I hold you fool!" the figure laughed maniacally. Kulgan paid no attention to the oncoming minions of death, paid no attention to the spell weaving of the figure. Meanwhile, in the background the priest was weaving his own spell, directed at the enshrouded figure. "In the name of Karana!" and a ball of force struck the figure, knocking him back and stunning him. The barbarians ran in to melee with the zombies and skeletons, knocking them down or hacking them into pieces. The ranger began weaving a spell of her own and ensared the necromancer in vines and roots. Kulgan charged him with shield held in front of him, ramming the man in the chest with all his might. Just before he made contact with the figure, he vanished. Kulgan looked around, but it was too late. A dark black aura surrounded Kulgan, he instantly lost his breath and his legs felt like lead. It was all he could do to take a few steps forward. The barbarians still had their hands full with the army of undead, the ranger too, had put her efforts into helping them. It was all the cleric could do to keep the warriors standing with the onslaught of undead they faced. Kulgan suddenly felt poison burning through his veins, creeping it's way to his heart. He tried to yell for help, but could only manage a wimper. Kulgan said a silent prayer to Karana, closed his eyes and waited. His hands shone so brightly with a blue aura that it enveloped his whole body, he felt healthy enough to stand again. Kulgan got up, prepared a spell and aimed at the necromancer. "Ye shall be BLINDED!" he shouted, and a blindingly bright light hit the figure in the eyes. With the illumination Kulgan could see it was no man under the shroud, it was a lich. He was just starting to decompose, and only looked to be in his mid thirties, why then was he a lich? Didn't necromancers become liches when their own life force ran out? Why so young? These questions would never be answered by the lich directly. Later, Kulgan told himself, he'd find the answers he sought, now he had a problem he had to deal with. Using the distraction as time to close, he rushed the lich wielding GhoulBane high above his head and came slicing down across the lich's chest. A gaping wound was opened up, but instead of blood, a black ichor oozed out, where it hit the ground the grass and soil smoked. Kulgan brought his sword down again on the fiend that stood before him, GhoulBane responded with a pulsing energy delivered with the blow, but the lich still stood. He was no longer blind and was chanting. GhoulBane came slashing down again, only to hit an impenatrable layer of protection. Where the blood had hit the ground, skeletons were clawing their way out of the earth, one grabbing Kulgan's leg and tripping him. Kulgan was overtaken in a matter of seconds as the unearthed monstrosities clambered over him clawing and scratching at him. Everything went black and all he remembered was the pain. The pain was almost unberable. And then blackness, emptiness, void, void of light. Nothingness. Just pitch black.<br>
<br>
Who knows how long Kulgan was in that void, but he thought he heard something. A faint whisper blowing across his ear. "Not yet" it said, Kulgan pondered, "Not yet?, what does it mean?" and then a brilliant light formed around him and made a multicolored tunnel in his field of vision. He was being drawn into it, the sound of thunder booming in the distance. Faster and faster he was being drawn down the tunnel. Kulgan came to with a gasp of air, choking on the pain that he felt. Looking down at himself his platemail had been ripped open in several places and some had impaled him, leaving gouging holes in his skin. Karana it hurt, at least in the void he hadn't felt anything, no pain, no sorrow, just nothing. Kulgan looked at his surroundings, he was in the bed that his mother had been in previously. Across from him two of the three barbarians were laid up similarly, and the cleric that was tending to him cradled a broken arm that was healing rapidly. The ranger sat across from him on a stool binding her own wounds she'd sustained. Kulgan bolted upright despite the pain, "The lich, is it dead? Did you kill him? Mother, where is she?" "I'm sorry son, your mother passed away shortly before your return, she passed in her sleep." the priest said. "The lich fled after your attack, but shouted that he'd be back and more powerful than ever. You didn't make it, had it not been for Karana's will, you'd not be here with us now. Karana saw fit that your life be restored to work his will." he continued. Kulgan was too shocked to respond. He didn't quite know how to handle his mothers death. She was all he had. His father had died before he could remember, his mother told him he'd died fighting the undead frogloks that inhabited the swampland on the other side of the Ro desert. It seemed a noble way to end ones life, but to leave mother alone for so long to raise him, it must have been hard.<br>
"There was nothing that could be done for my mother?" Kulgan asked. "I'm afraid not, she had so little life force left in her, it's amazing that she lasted as long as she did. Your mother was a very strong woman. I can see that her will has carried onto you as well." "My mother always said I was stubborn." he replied.<br>
<br>
Kulgan would spend the next several months researching the lich that killed his mother. He'd learned that the appearance of the 30 year old man that he saw was just his magic sustaining him to look that way, the lich was actually hundreds of years old. Had it not been for he and his companions that thwarted his efforts the first time, he may have very easily taken over Qeynos and the surrounding areas before anyone ever found out. Had Kulgan delayed the inevitable, or hindered the liches actions enough to make him change his plans? He had no way of knowing, but he planned on ridding the lich of his miserable existance and clearing his mothers soul from the void as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Thunder echoed over the graveyard and Kulgan looked one last time at the gravestone marking his mothers grave. "I love you mother, you'll rest in peace by my hand." and he spurred his mount towards Everfrost Peaks.<br>
