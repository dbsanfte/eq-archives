Hard to say I'd replace it to be safe.  No I think we're going to just get rid of the car earlier instead. then this is  Followed by me yelling into the shop to put it back together and get it out door.  <br>
<br>
Your local body shop is one of the best places to get affordable cars, you can save a good deal of money by buying a rebuilt with a salvage title.  it's instpected before it's retitled and I've found them to be in very good condition in general, jsut make sure you go to a reputable shop.  <br>
<br>
I would suggest you take your 2k and borrow 2k more and get something decent, like let's say a rebuilt 98ish maybe 99 grand am with low mileage if you can find it. or if you don't mind financing a little more and you live in the detroit area check out autorex in waterford, talk to dave. <br>
<br>
but if you must stay with 2k I'd suggest an import, as they generally are more reliable, run longer than domestics and are usually cheaper.  <br>
<br>
I would also suggest you take the vehicle to a shop such as any firestone store and have it inspected this will run you anywhere fom 9.99 to 19.99 and you get a good thorough inspection.  Or you can go to a place with free inspections such a tuffy but it's usually a crappy inspection since the tech doesn't get paid for doing it in most of those deals.<br>

<br>
By something with a warranty, anything than can go wrong, will go wrong within the first few years of the car. Anything other than that is wear and tear. <br>
<br>
Ask to see receipts of oil changes, any part's bought, regular maintenance performed. <br>
<br>
Also check out www.carfax.com it's a great resource. <p><img src="http://cblack87.home.comcast.net/teeto.jpg"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghandue>ghandue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sycornet.com/familjen/images/members/thumb_ghandue.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/13/03 7:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5534.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> good suggestion, but dont' buy an aftermarket warrenty though they're about useless they'll do most anythign they can to get out of paying, and also if he is only going to spend 2k it's gonna be as is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=punkrawkbbob>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1870<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/14/03 12:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5534.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> -</span><hr size=1> Yes I still live in Detroit area.

Isn't there some car auction place up Telegraph some where in Dearborn/Detroit/Redford?  *ponders* Grab the yellow pages.  :)<br>

Its a very very wise decision in this day and age (for credit wich is a huge help later on). try to maybe get in to the 6-8k total cost range as you don't want to huge of a payment. I have worked at car dealerships as a sales rep and my roommate is currently head sales at one. The best thing to do is to make friends. People that are dicks to the sales rep and management end up getting dicked in the end, wich is great because the reps end up making a fat wad for their pocket without feeling the slightest bit guilty. If you spread your visits out with them (don't buy the first time), and find a rep that you have something in common with to talk about, They will eventually want to help you out. Now this is key... make sure the day you are going to buy is a slow day (usually a tuesday or wednesday) come in about 11am or so. They will have been open a few hours and anxious for a sale. Figure out something you can handle, 2k down maybe with 150 a month payment... something like that. Whatever it is your comfortable with stick to it. Make sure its your day off cause you could spend anywhere from 2-6+ hours there, but eventually they will take your deal. Make sure you are very nice because they will want to take care of you. People always think that salesmen are trying to pressure them and that they are assholes so in turn they should be assholes back but not the case at all. The more of a dick you are the more you get dicked. Dealerships pay rock bottom prices for used vehicles and if your patient enough you too can get them for rock bottom prices. My car I bought from a dealership using pretty much the same method I just described. sticker price was 8k at the time. after many many visits and talking with the same person and management I learned that they only paid 2.5k for it and while they can't let it go for 0 profit they can let it go for 500 over what they paid bare minimum. I bought an 8k stickered car for 3.5k (I could have got it for 3k but I wanted my rep to get some money from the deal). to rap it up, the car has run solid with no fixes besides regular maintenance. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.discreetww.com/snuff.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=punkrawkbbob>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1871<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/17/03 10:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5534.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 0-0-0</span><hr size=1> Got a '99 Dodge Neon, $4,320 in the long run.

You only need a new transmission if you start beating your car hard other then that if you maintain it should be good. <br>
<br>
other then that oldschool is where you want to be baby! <br>

<br>
Grand Prix will always be my favorite car. Oldsmobile is nice too. It seems though everytime I get a new car the carb goes, I bought a new one and the intake didn't line up with the carb, then I bought this Universal intake that lined it up just to see the carb was to big to even fit in the damn place. One thign though Cadilac Insurance....Is the devil. <br>

If anyone ever goes to buy a vehicle, stay as far away from this shit as you possibly can.  I am at a shop that does the structural integrity and inspections.  <br>

Where do you get this information? <br>
<br>
Is this based off of your experience with one car? <br>
<br>
Or your vast knowledge of vehicular mechanics when it comes to Dodge/Mopar transmissions? <br>

Transmission had to be replaced twice within 100k miles of each other.<br>
<br>

My friend got a brand new 2001 Dorango. New tranny needed as well as other repairs before he ever hit 10,000 miles.<br>

Dodges look cool and all but in my opinion are cheaply made.<br>
