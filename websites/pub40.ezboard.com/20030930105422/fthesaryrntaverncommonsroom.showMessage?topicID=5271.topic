Interview with Heaven and Earth posted by Ever Linkdead on 07-15-2003 18:33<br>
 <br>
Today's feature &quot;Uber Guild&quot; is Heaven and Earth as we interview their leader, Numnayan. Not much else news in Everquest today minus the update on the EQ Future Plans page mentioning the next patch should be early August for the revamp of the zones. Let's hope to see how these new revamps will turn out, the current revamps seem decent but let's hope they're more interesting this time around.<br>
<br>
<br>
You told saryrn.Numnayan,'I am Ever Linkdead from EQNews.us and I am interviewing Numnayan, Sovereign Lord of the glorious guild Heaven and Earth on Saryrn. How are you today?' <br>
saryrn.Numnayan told you, 'Don't you feel it is redundant to send me a tell informing me that you are talking to me? Is this being recorded?'&quot;<br>
<br>
Q:'What are your feelings towards the current &quot;End-Game&quot; Time situation and how long do you think it will be before Time has been defeated?' <br>
A:'I think that Time, like all zones before, has good parts and bad parts. The good parts are some of the loot. The bad parts are having to redo the ridiculous first trials every trip, the design flaws regarding the situation of multiple guilds being in the zone, and the lack of a zone out. How they managed to not learn from the Elemental planes that melee are too stupid to carry gate potions is beyond me. As far as when it will beat, perhaps it will be like the Rathe encounter where it will be beat as soon as SoE is ready for it to be beaten, or as soon as Thott figures out how to kill Guarm.' <br>
<br>
Q:'What do you think and what are your feelings towards Furor and the Fires of Heaven crew?' <br>
A:I don't care about guilds on other servers. Nothing FoH, AL, Triton, or (Ha Ha You Died) is ever going to affect my game or my &quot;online experience&quot;. The biggest impact they can have is getting to some bugged/poorly tuned encounter first and having it fixed before my guild gets there. As far as Furor, I believe the previous sentence explains how Furor's mental state arrived at what it is today. That, and the fact that he probably gets way too many tells from the idiots that make up the majority of the petty, jealous, pixel-penis-envy population. <br>
<br>
Q:'How far do you think Everquest has come since it's start? And compared to Everquest, how far do you think Everquest 2 will go?' <br>
A:EQ has had its ups and downs. At times, VI/SoE/989 Studios, whoever the hell is running the game, seems to be completely out of touch with the game it maintains and its playerbase. At other times, they do a bunch of things that make the players happy, and make some niceties that actually make me believe they do play and enjoy their own game. <br>
<br>
As far as EQ2, if they had the resources to dedicate to EQ to completely revamp the entire game and rewrite the engine, it'd probably end a lot of frustration on the parts of both the developers and the players. Of course, this isn't feasible, really, within the project &quot;EQ&quot;, but maybe EQ2 has hope. It's entirely possible that they could make an &quot;EverQuest&quot; that resolves 90% of the issues players have with the game annd 95% of the issues that the designers/developers have trying to make it better. On the other hand, this is the same company that has a highly successful and established online game, went to release another one, and the server status at release sucked, so... <br>
<br>
Q:'How do you feel about the drawn out 'Planes of Power' storyline and what do you think about it's difficulty? Is it really worth it?' <br>
A:I like the lore in PoP. I like stories and Oreos because they're high in some kind of fat that will make me die before I get too old to see the monitor. I am still hoping that at the end of PoP, you become one with the Nameless and your character gets deleted, but we'll have to wait and see. As far as difficulty, I don't know. The tier 1 planes are not an increase in difficulty from, say, VT. It's not until RZ that PoP actually gets more difficult than Luclin's end-game, and with the new (and newer) changes to mini boss AEs in elementals the difficulty goes all whacky. I would say the best thing PoP has going for it is that there are different kinds of boss fights, i.e. they came through on not every fight being a MT and CH rotation battle. Besides, the reality of EQ is that it's more difficult to get 60+ people to all focus on one task and not do something dopey that blows the whole encounter (Rathe, anyone?) than it is to figure out what to do. As far as &quot;is it worth it?&quot;, that's really a subjective question, so my answer doesn't do much. I obviously think so or I wouldn't play, or at the very least I wouldn't be running around in the planes every night saying helpful things in guildchat like &quot;Run away&quot; and &quot;No, not into Terris&quot;. I enjoy talking to the people I play with, and I enjoy pretending I can suck the life out of a creature, then fall over on my side and convince it I'm dead. That's all about me, though, and I certainly wouldn't tell any sane person &quot;yes buy EQ and PoP and throw that social life out the window.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Definately the puppy-lovin Num that we all know and love...<br>
