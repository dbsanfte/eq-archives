I will be advising TWC to kill TT whenever I see you online in PoN?  Why?  Because this thread is a very funny read.  I want to see you post more.<br>
<br>
I'll probably speak for TWC as a whole when I say &quot;We don't care.&quot;  Not that we don't care that we kept training you or some shit.  Ideally we train nobody and don't have to bother CRing anyone.  What we don't care about are people with your heightened level of diplomacy.<br>
<br>
Anyways, all this thread has done is make you look extremely foolish in the eyes of the entire server, so GOOD JOB!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone asked if we killed TT?  The server crashed mid fight...annoying...we were all going ld for about two minutes while we could still use the chat channels.  That was fun.  I thought we were done for the night, as servers came up after midnight central.  But last night was awesome, as our news page will show you.  We prolly started Vt nearing 1am central, and ended our raids 10am central.  And check out that l337 Tormax tank.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I don't know how to cross the river without aggro.  I doubt many members of TWC do.<br>
<br>
To the original poster, I'll say i'm sorry you had a rough time when we were moving through that area (and it was an expecially long, greuling time getting everyone together).  As for all the complaints you had and your conclusion that TWC leadership is to blame, I have to note that you nor anyone else ever contacted me or any other officer regarding your specific or the general situation at all. <br>
<br>
Flame and vitrol in /ooc will earn you no &quot;respect&quot; in game and earn you no special considerations, similar to the reaction you have provoked here out of game.  Personally I suspect you're probably not a very pleasant person to be around in even the best of times.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, regarding this situation, I'll say that I dont know of any solutions that would not guarantee a similar or repeat performance of this kind of thing in the future.  And as evidenced here, it seems that no guild has the answer to this particular problem.  Do like everyone else and blame Sony, i suppose, it's their world after all.  I can however guarantee that respectful and calm complaints directed to me and I would hope any of the other officers of TWC will be responded to with honest and sincere efforts to remedy any damages that might have been done and to avoid further problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
Flame threads are always the best, and though it is completely pointless I want to comment on some of the other things mentioned in this thread.<br>
<br>
Yes TWC is about as old a guild as there are in EQ.  I joined it in late '99 some time.  Actually I'm still upset our reform cost us our place in the guild file, and you can no longer get a list of TWC members with &quot;/ all the&quot;.  There are a handful of members who are still in TWC that are founding members or have been in as long as I have.  I've been GL technically for a bit over a year, and defacto GL for good portions of half a year to a year before that.  The very vast majority of members are relative &quot;newcomers&quot; in the guild.<br>
<br>
As for turnover, hehe seems like over half the server has been in TWC.  Recently though I would consider our retention to be as high as can be realisticly expected.  The guild is stronger than it has ever been, and by a very large margin at that.<br>
<br>
To the haters, we ask not for your sympathy.  It's not worth much anyway.<br>

<br>
 There is a pretty reliable method of crossing the river with either no aggro, or maybe an alligator at most aggroing if you lose too much height too quickly.<br>
<br>
1)Follow the zone wall until you see the canyon edge.<br>
<br>
2)Stay a good distance from the edge and follow the canyon out into the zone until you reach the first large boulder sitting at the edge of the canyon.<br>
<br>
3) Face the river and look for the tree on the other side.<br>
<br>
4) Run to that tree, turn and check for aggro.  <br>
<br>
 Usually there is none, at most you'll have one critter to deal with.   If you don't get that far from the zone wall though, you *will* aggro hobgoblins, which are the worst thing you can aggro while crossing the river.  That's what causes most trains.<br>
<br>
 Hope this helps someone. <br>

<br>
It goes without saying that you should have lev on, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Yes, it's always possible to draw random aggro on that trip.  You might not run high enough, or you come too close to the hobgoblins, or you just get unlucky somehow.  But you can avoid 95% of the aggro, and 95% of the trains, that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=articnv>articnv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/13/03 7:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3306.topic&index=54>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Beth adding me to what list and for what  i m cvonfused <p><body>

for future reference, any train you see please rate it accordingly<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>CLUB FU TRAIN INDEX <br>
(compiled by Breathe/Flitterbick, proud member of the Club Fu guild on Bristlebane ) <br>
<br>
Trains in EverQuest are an inevitable occurance. Yet despite the frequency of trains, little effort has been expended towards the scientific goal of rating these oft-maligned forces of nature. <br>
<br>
Until now . . . <br>
<br>
NOTE - For your train to be valid for rating under the CFTI, it must be an UNPLANNED train. While any idiot can maliciously cause a train if they set their mind to it, TRUE training comes from the heart. It is the wondrous alignment of lag, carelessness, and sheer dumb luck that coalesces into a living, breathing example of Chaos Theory at it's finest. Spontaneity is your goal, and this is defeated by premeditation or intentional efforts to increase your CFTI once you realize your innocent little pull has mutated into the most feared of all events . . . a train. <br>
<br>
This index would not have been possible without the dedicated, nay FANATIC efforts of the many pullers within Club Fu and the many suggestions from others across all servers. I would thank you individually, but I'm too busy looting my corpse. <br>

<br>
They need to get thru the zone and your in their path. What dosent help is that for alot of classes, invising there is more of a bother than help (why invis when I can DA there much safer). <br>
<br>
Its bad zone design as posted above not TWC's fault. No one was trying to train you but your in the safest path to get in the zone and no guild wants to spend more time getting thru the cesspool of PON one of the worst layed out zones for trains.<br>
