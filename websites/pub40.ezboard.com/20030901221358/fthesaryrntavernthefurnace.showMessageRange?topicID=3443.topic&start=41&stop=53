<br>
Elaborating on which part?<br>
<br>
Socrates' affection for the young?<br>
<br>
Or, the influence of Platonic thought on western civ?<br>
<br>
I think the first is a silly non-issue, although potentially more colorful than his dialogues.<br>
<br>
The latter? I'm hazy, that is why I can talk about these things only at cocktail parties. Hm, I think it kinda started with St. Augustine. The idea of using a dialectical path--a series of questions and answers, contradictions and resolutions--to get closer to god was sorta his thing. Also, that God was an &quot;Ideal&quot;--something beyond our understanding, perfect beyond it, seems pretty Platonic.<br>
<br>
In any case, he was very early Christian relgious figure, and I think it might be possible to attribute some of the classical training that was popular in the church to his influence. I think? Also, if I were going to go out on a limb, it Might be possible to say that some of this Platonist stuff became incorporated into the medieval mystical saint-vision-thing that was Very popular.<br>
<br>
And I am pretty sure that a bunch of guys sat around debating the ideas of philosopher kings a bit later too...its my understanding that the influence of classical thought waxed and waned quite a bit with the socioeconomic times of various places in Europe--wasn't the Italian Rennaissance/Humanist movement some sort of rediscovery of these things as well?<br>
<br>
Augustine was a neat guy, much more interesting than Plato. It's true I have forgetten almost everything I read about him when I was in college, but I remember enjoying the Confessions almost as much as Ableard et Heloise.<br>
<br>
And I'll take a vodka gimlet please, straight up. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isevenl>Isevenl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/4/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3443.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ci.lamar.co.us/cse/chris_pho.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BF Reminded me of something I read once..</span><hr size=1> What would Plato do, if he were here today.<br>

<br>
Right, exactly. I took your post as saying &quot;don't nitpick&quot; when part of the fun of this board is doing just that (see ! It's the EQ version of trash-talk, and it has its place (which it seems we both agree on).<br>
<br>
&quot;its just disagreeing to practice.....CONSTANTLY, it's annoying&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree. A good illustration (no offense intended) of what I take to be a poinless nitpick is the discussion about how many people Nandarie was talking about at the end of the &quot;kael &gt;TWC&gt;GoL&quot; thread. But, while I consider it pointless, I'm also not going to post &quot;this is pointless&quot; if they're getting their kicks out of it. Whatever floats yer boat, eh?<br>
<br>
&quot;Although it's much easier to say that that was my motivation after I have had all this time to think about it. I'm sure that that noble cause was not in my head when I actually pushed the &quot;add post&quot; button &quot;<br>
<br>
Just say that it was. Make someone prove you wrong. (/snicker - I liked that joke because of how it fit in with this conversation)<br>
<br>
&quot;Applauding my attempt at imitation sounds like an insult, but maybe it wasn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, heh, heh, it was <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But it was one of those insults crafted for (what I took to be) its wit (i.e. to &quot;get&quot; that you were insulted, you had to understand the conversation. If you understood the conversation, the insult didn't apply to you. If you didn't get the insult, it did apply to you. You got it, so it doesn't apply. I hope that makes sense).<br>
<br>
Also, as a final note, notice that when an important question comes up (&quot;What is Plato saying?&quot;) the 'mere quibbling' goes away. That's a good sign, imo.<br>

<br>
&quot;Actually I always thought of it more like, Plato believes in ideals. Behind everything &quot;thing&quot; there is an absolute &quot;perfect&quot; thing on which that thing is based. The &quot;Good'? Feh, that's just a word--and I don't think that was really what he meant at all...Plato is not really a Good and Evil kinda guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
OK, what I think you're talking about here is Plato's conception of the form. Behind every 'chair' we see is the ideal 'Chair' on which all chairs are based. There is only one Chair, but there are many chairs.<br>
<br>
This is arguably Plato's conception in his earlier works. However in the Timaeus, Plato makes it clear he rejects the idea of multiple forms. Instead, he sees the Good as the &quot;idea&quot; behind every &quot;thing&quot; <br>
<br>
I think you're right <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in a sense</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about Plato not being a Good and Evil kind of guy. Plato simply didn't think Evil existed. It's been a while since I've dealt with this somewhat complicated argument, but I can give a brief sketch. For Plato, the Good exists. If Good <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exists</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it must be, well, good <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>to</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> exist. So all things which exist partake in Goodness in at least a very basic level: existance. However, Evil, then, cannot exist, because if Evil existed, it would be 'partaking in Goodness', and if Evil is the opposite of the Good, then it cannot partake in goodness. Confused? Sorry. Basically: Good exists, Evil is the opposite of Good in all manners, therefore Evil does not exist.<br>
<br>
Now, that doesn't mean that Plato didn't think people could be Evil. Plato thought people had souls, and the soul was the seat of rationality. However, people could, according to Plato, diminish their soul by being unjust. This 'diminishing of the soul' is what allows evil to manifest itself. People who exist act unjustly, and so, in a sense, begin to partake of non-existance. There's more to it than that, but Plato definately thought people could act evily, and they should be punished. (His unfinished work <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Laws</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> deals in part with how to punish such people.)<br>
<br>
&quot;The above is the most interesting thing about Plato. People took him very literally for a long time. And the made some neat stuff.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yes, yes they did. Many leaders in the history of the West claimed to be the embodiment of Plato's Philosopher King. I don't think you can understand the West without understanding, at least in part, the works of Plato.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although this idea of the &quot;Ideal&quot; is interesting, personally I prefer Aristotle, or Marx...practical kind of guys. I may not agree witth them, but I can imagine them actually going to work, and not just sitting in the Agora stroking their beards.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bah! Plato did more than write books. He was a warrior and a statesman. Socrates, his teacher, won numerous honors and distinctions in battle. Yeah, Greek philosophers were the man (unfortunately women weren't really allowed into philosophy, something Plato argues against), not like lethargic logic professors we think of today.<br>
<br>
So, way tangential, but I blame The Lost Rogue for bringing Plato into this in the first place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The post you made in reply to Vainne was just fantastic. I had forgotten about the Chair vs a chair thing. And I don't think I ever read anything about the good vs evil, existing/not existing things that you brought up, I'm enjoying contemplating that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeah, there's some way cool implications there, though metaphysics is not my forte.
