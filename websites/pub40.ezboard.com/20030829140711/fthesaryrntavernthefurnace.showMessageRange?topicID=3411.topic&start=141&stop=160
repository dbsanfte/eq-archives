So do you admit it was bullshit?  You kinda sorta seem to but you havent actually said so yet.  Don't be afraid man.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Kordin, you cant kill those blobs in 45 minutes&quot;  Better keep those yardsticks out&quot; -- I didnt compare them to us.  I said he was exaggerating.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once again you call their force barely adequate, yet, if they win, to me that seems adequate enough?&quot; -- Is it somehow true that you cant understand that &quot;barely adequate&quot; is equal to or greater than &quot;adequate&quot;.  Is your brain being short circuted by the panic of having your complete bullshit called with nowhere for you to run and hide?<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;My superiority over you...&quot; Wow keep that yardstick out&quot; -- He's the one who brought the superiority argument into this.  I admit I knew that he was just using a cut and paste pseudo-phychology insult, but the least I can do is ground the discussion in reality if he would choose to go there.<br>
<br>
&quot;See above where you mentioned reading from an insult book.&quot; -- Sorry it was supposed to be humorous.  In my book, I thought it was better than what I perceived to be the tone and intent of his &quot;tool&quot; comment.<br>
<br>
Don't forget, we're still looking for that admission that (no matter what your motive and gleefully-generated result) &quot;breathing down their necks&quot; was just bullshit.<br>

As Kordin has pretty much explained to you, ToS are at exactly the same point as you are if ToS does not follow your '5 year plan' type system to clear VT the uber way. If you start raiding directly after ToS which is usually the case considering time zones, then you are doing the same thing as ToS will be doing the next day if you decide not to kill those mobs left up the previous evening. Don't blame ToS for killing a mob with good loots late at night with few people and thereby indirectly causing a zone error because it's SOE that's at fault as sad as that may sound to the ears of someone who reads EQ message boards often.<br>
<br>
If you were in the position of ToS in that you didnt have a raid force online of 70 people so that you could zerg the entire zone and thereby clear it and pronounce yourself to be the uberest of the uber (but still at the same level as those that you define as 'barely successful' ironically), wouldnt you go for AHR right away as well and get some of the best loot available to you at this point while the mob is up rather than leave it up for the competing guild? <br>
<br>
If you are about to type 'no' or some sad variant of it, press the back button because that is BS, or [backspace] if pressing back button is too un-l33t for you.<br>
<br>
Chimeraa is American by the way like you so would be using a yardstick as well. A yard is less than a meter by the way so if youre trying to somehow imply that your measurements for raid success are grander i must disappoint you. Have another cookie. <br>
<br>
And let me get this straight:<br>
<br>
ToS gets to VT by the same process as TWC. They then take double the time to kill the same amount of mobs that remain up as TWC who have double the amount of members available. Then Seani comes and thinks that this is wrong and that ToS should kill everything on the same day for some bizarre reason at the same rate as a raid force that has double the amount of members available online? <br>
<br>
Makes sense... <br>
<br>
... if you still go to nursery classes. Sorry to disappoint you; I'm sure you're a valuable and opinionated child in class who makes contributions like yours right now on the BF no matter how clueless they are.<br>
<br>
Arkay: since when do you need to kill an entire zone in one sitting to prove that you are capable enough that you can kill the entire zone? <br>
If you can kill the toughest mob in the zone and then also the boss mob who is arguably weaker according to some which makes no difference at all to my argument, then aren't you just as good as the guild who is about to do the exact same with double the number of raiders in half the time? Grats to TWC for being able to get 70+ people online but just like the saying goes: 'size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it.' And in this case ToS has achieved to do the exact same as someone who is double the size. Logical thought will give you the correct conclusion from the above if it's available to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree with Kordin,<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If mobs are up, just go kill them, it's not like if we put mines in the zone. Blobs drop great items, if you need them, just go pick them, that's trivial with 70. I guess having those two mobs up makes you drool but having to work to get them pisses you. maybe next time we only leave one up so it will cause you less trouble.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Couldn't have said it better myself. Don't expect the guild before yours to clear the way for you so you get easy l00tage. Or do you expect random people in real life to hand you money for free too? If so tell me that person's phone number!<br>

 I wouldn't blow my top about anything said here any more.. I got over that little 'phase' in my existence quite some time ago.<br>

  I know excuses and/or reasons for anything said on here are worth about as much as a pile of shit, so I'll just say it was a pretty stressful period in my life, and it spilled over into Everquest for a couple weeks.   ...Which was long enough to jump to a couple of conclusions, make a couple accusations, and 'blow my top' hard enough to make myself the target of most of the blast furnace for a while. <br>
<br>
I just couldn't help chuckling over the irony demonstrated in the line I quoted in my previous message.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I used irony and not hypocrisy on purpose.

It's very convinient that in this case the &quot;everyone else&quot; group is only one guild who is competing with ToS at the moment, namely TWC, isn't it Seani? Really proves all your points.

I must of course rebutt, though.<br>
<br>
First off and this is the basic motivation for my complaint, ToS does not do with half the forces and twice the time what TWC does.  What in fact happens is that ToS does LESS than what TWC does but ends up with just as much loot.  To do the same thing we do you evidently require that second day.<br>
<br>
To summarize:  ToS has a relatively weak raiding force that can, must, and does unashamedly use the unfair advantage handed to them by Sony and their time zone to erase any hint of earnest competition (merely opportunistic in and of itself, but bad when followed up with) and furthermore leverages that unfair lack of competition to buy themselves an additional 24 hour day to clear VT, an accomplishment anyone else would be forced to (and does/can) do in a single day.<br>

-ToS views accomplishment under a &quot;biggest fight with least people&quot; yardstick, ignoring time.  a 1 person AHR kill that takes 31hrs start to finish is more uber than a 100 person kill that takes 30 sec.<br>
-Seani views accomplishment as a &quot;most loots in the shortest period of time&quot;.  People used is irrelevent.  Wham bam thank you Maam.<br>
<br>
Neither point of view is inherently wrong.  But they obviously don't mesh well.  <br>
<br>
(side note: If it takes you 6hrs to do Zone_X with 30 ppl &lt;while skipping auxilarary content&gt;, and it takes us 3 hrs to do Zone_X with 60 ppl &lt;NOT skipping content&gt;, that's not Zerg.  Zerg (in my book) would be taking people above and beyond, without a corosponding drop in time taken to do content (e.g.  3 hrs to do Zone_X with 100 ppl))<br>
<br>
(side note #2:  If doing most with least is your thing, AND using more people than strictly nessesary equals zerging; then do you admit to &quot;zerging&quot; all those encounters that you bring 35 people to, but you've done in the past with 32?)<br>
<br>
-Tos has admitted that they are aware that the way they do the zone makes it far more likely that noone else will bother with the mobs they leave up, giving them almost exclusive raid content for the next day.  It sucks, but its allowed under SOES rules.<br>

<br>
Because they are in Europe?<br>
<br>
Let's look at this.  <br>
<br>
Honestly server resets now do happen at all hours.  The crash the other day was actually at a bad time for ToS making us miss a few planned mobs.  We stretched the raid time late to compensate, and won AHR.<br>
<br>
We begin about 2pm EST raiding.  We end about 8 Est or earlier MOST of the time.  This is about 6 hours total.  <br>
<br>
TWC has the same ability to be on 6 hours or more a day, therefore mathematically having the same chances for mobs to spawn on their time.  <br>
<br>
We don't have competition on our raid time?<br>
We compete with attrition.  There aren't many high end euro players on Saryrn left.  We lose members to attrition just like all others, but there aren't 50 other guilds on our time to reject members so we can scoop them up.<br>
<br>
And your line about when have you lied?  Well, I am not going to quote, too lazy right now... You basically said no raid force has ever wiped to AHR.  <br>
Lie? Maybe, maybe just an exaggeration...<br>

<br>
I've made no requests and honestly expect no changes to their play, because they're stuck being as barely adequate as they are and because it would go against pure greed (what the game is about in VT) for them to not exploit their advantage to its fullest.  One thing is for sure TWC has never been in a situation like what ToS enjoys and exploits.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you should read more carefully.  If you wish to deny that you are doing anything here more than hating on who you've always hated, answer those 3 questions above.<br>
<br>
Kordin, I went through minor pains to make the summary of my entire complaint into one huge run-on sentence so you wouldnt break it into parts to criticise it.  I wouldn't bother making a complaint out of any of those parts on their own.  If you single out part of it its easy to blow off.<br>

BS ...</span><hr size=1> Chimeraa, thanks for a return to non-spew.<br>
<br>
&quot;How is it that ToS really has an advantage Seani? Because they are in Europe? Let's look at this.&quot; -- OK, if you want an analysis I can give you one.  Keep in mind though that this is not my whole point, its only the enabler.  <br>
<br>
First, lets talk scheduled patches.  There has been, and will be, a vast minority of patches that finish after 2pm est.  As long as it comes up before 2pm est, ToS begins their prime time with a full pop VT.  Clearly an advantage for ToS in reward for doing nothing whatsoever &quot;better&quot; in game than TWC.<br>
<br>
Second, lets talk server/zone crashes.  You could make the argument that those can happen randomly any time of day and that sounds relatively reasonable to me.  If it happens more than a couple hours after the start of either guild's prime time there is not much chance of them going in and getting to aten.  Lets say that if the reset happens after 5pm est ToS knows they cant do aten.  Lets say TWC's prime time begins at 10pm est.  If the reset happens after about 1am est, then we probably cant do it.  Or lets even be more demanding on the TWC zerg and say they could even kill aten with a server reset at 2am est.  So a server reset any time between 5pm and 1am, 8 total hours gives aten to TWC, or 9 hours if we have extra zerglings on at that time.  On the other hand, a reset at any other time of day will result in ToS having the time to kill aten, a total of 16 or 15 hours.  Again, clearly and advantage for ToS for doing nothing at all except waiting for the earth to fall into proper alignment.<br>
<br>
Last, and what must have seemed like a brilliant idea to the dude who designed VT thinking it would be a multi-day clear for everyone, the respawn on the mobs/warders seems to be just about 6.5 days.  In theory that means that the start time is offset and a guild who didnt have it up for them initially will have it in their time slot the next week.  What actually happens tho is that all it does is make the initial mobs, after a ToS clear the previous week, start respawning at the tail end of TWC's raid window, and aten respawning just about when ToS's raid window is opening the next day.  The only screwball is the wacky warder repops which ToS can't seem to verify are up or not before they start clearing.  End result tho is again, advantage ToS.<br>
<br>
Its pretty clear the advantage exists, to deny it is ignorant.  But then again crying about that would be stupid.  That's not what I'm doing.  I have to, and therefore do in fact, live with that disadvantage and I don't think its reasonable to ask someone to throw it away when the point of the game is greed.  My complaint is that the unfair time advantage of 6-7 hours is used by them to do something that actually takes them 24+ hours to execute, and that even when they don't get the big payoff (respawn days when they dont finish clearing), they have almost certainly disrupted the zone in such a way that anyone else wanting to do it must first spend hours finding a GM while their precious 6 hour raid window is ticking away.<br>
<br>
Maybe the more analytical approach will be more illustrative, so here are the list of things that when taken together form the thrust of my complaint.  Take away any of them and I will stop complaining.<br>
1) ToS has a very skewed advantage in terms of competition on spawn days and respawn days.<br>
2) ToS is *barely capable* of getting to aten, and can take the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the zone.<br>
3) ToS is largely incapable (done it only one time?) of actually clearing the zone in a single raid, and must have 2 days to complete it, but due to #1 and #2, they can be pretty sure they can get that second day.<br>

Suppose, hypothetically, that the roles were reversed.  You were the leader of a European guild in competition with one U.S. guild for VT.  The raid force you had to work with was exactly the same as the current ToS one.  Can you in all honesty sit there and tell me that you would not use the time zone difference to your advantage? That you would not go after the best loots you could in the set amount of time that you could?  That you would sit back and let the U.S. guild clean house in VT just because they had the force to clear the entire zone, while forfeiting all the said loots that you guild could have earned?  It seems like you are trying to blame Titans of Saryrn for the rotation of the earth on its axis.  Aside from that, you have implied more than once that we purposely fuck up the warders, which we don't.  But do you really believe that we should forgo improving our collective equipment just so that we don't inadvertently mess up the warder/named link? Call me cynical, call me whatever you want, but I refuse to believe that The War Council would sit back and let a guild that they are in competition with scoop up all the goodies out of common courtesy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
