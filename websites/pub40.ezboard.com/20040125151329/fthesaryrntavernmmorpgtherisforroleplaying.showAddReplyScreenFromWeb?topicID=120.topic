<br>
Shaking the ashes off my fur coat.... regaining my bearings.... as I look around ... the ground is scattered with the bodies of the dead...as I shakily stand on all four legs taking in the view...I see a few souls rising from the ashes also.... <br>
Slowly I walk around.... Sniffing the cool night air...<br>
and I see lying before me is the banner of Eve of Prophecy lying on the ground...but I see no flag bearer around..… I howl in to the night’s sky, under the shining rays of light from the moon...<br>
I pick up the banner with my jaws and it crumbles into dust as I fade into the dark mist filled woods...<br>
Chilling howls filled the night...sometimes a single howl and other times is was a chorus of howls....<br>
<br>
      Many years later legend has it in the shadows of the night under a full moon, there is seen a misty form of a wolf running thru the woods... and like flickering will o wisps, if you look hard enough, you might see other wolf forms following...<br>
<br>
      Though local folk will tell you that whether they are ghosts of a forgotten past or spirits forewarning of troubled times ahead.... These spirited souls in their magical ways bring to ease the new adventurers lost on their way through the dark misty woods in search of their own prophecy..........<br>
<br>
      Howler...<br>
a ghost in the day <br>
a spirit in the night<br>

Transcribed from the Journal &quot; Shadows of the lands&quot;. Written by the well-traveled Mage Yelin Loudly.<br>
He comes before you all in with these writings to give testimony of what lies beyond and the tales of adventure that still awaits...<br>
 I t was a crisp fall morning deep in the Southern Karanas, there was a white wolf tending to the care of the land and was found often enjoying the company of the Treants. Though very few knew of this. The wolf was very magical, for travelers have told tales of this wolf coming to aid in dire circumstances. It was as if this wolf was so in tuned to the surroundings it could sense distress.<br>
 On this morning the wolf was visiting the Centaurs and playing with the young. Hide and seek was the game, when the young centaurs would get close to catching him, he would turn and bark and just vanish in thin air. The youngster loved this and would run about trying to find him, only to see him reappear behind them and bark in joy. They played this for some time then he would let them catch him, and they would hug him and scratch his belly, for he loved that. As they where resting, the wolf sensed something amidst. He sniffed in to the air and could faintly smell death. This was a very bitter smell, a familiar smell that he hasn't come across for a long time. He got up and spoke to the youngsters in a harmonious elven voice that was soothing and caring &quot; Children seek out your families and go to them, I must speak to the elders something is amiss&quot;.<br>
The wolf turns around and with the wind ushering him along he vanished around the building leaving a faint trail of dust. &quot;Coloth Meadowgreen, I must speak to council it is urgent, be quick for time is uncertain.” the wolf says. Coloth Meadowgreen replies to the wolf &quot; I will gather the elders, meet us at the council hall.&quot; &quot; I must speak to others on this&quot; The wolf says and the wolf speeds off into the south across the open field to be swallowed up by the wooded tree lines.<br>
 Coloth Meadowgreen places a large curved horn to his lips and a deep bellow emits forth. That call is heard across the surrounding land. Coloth Meadowgreen then turns toward the council hall and prepares for the meeting.<br>
 As the wolf goes deeper into the south the smell flickers in and out. The wolf journeys to the ancient spires to investigate. Upon arriving at the outer skirts of the spires, the wolf could feel the pulsating of magic emanating from it. The wolf sniffs the air and senses nothing amiss, examines the surrounding perimeter and detects no disturbances. The wolf takes a moment and feels his eyes tingle and he is compelled to turn in a direction. He sees the piles of bones on the ground surrounding the spires from this angle. &quot;Nothing amiss here&quot; he says to himself, as he turns around and speeds off to the southwest.<br>
He runs by a small herd of elephants and notices Cracktusk leading them towards a small watering hole to graze and feed. The wolf approaches the herd cautiously and speaks forth calling for Cracktusk. Cracktusk is a massive elephant in size and strength. He lifts his head up and trumpets a command to the herd. Cracktusk then turns and approaches the wolf in a solid stride, showing he fears no creature in this land. &quot; A wolf that speaks, I remember you very well, for as mighty as I am &quot; as he speaks he raises his head and puffs out his chest in pride. &quot; I can not forget all that you have done for me in the past&quot;. Cracktusk says to the wolf. &quot; What brings you so far south in the lands&quot; have you grown weary of chasing the rabbits up north&quot; Cracktusk then gives a pulsing shrill trumpet sound as if he just made a joke and was laughing over it. &quot;Cracktusk ever full of the wit you are, but you know that the rabbits are more cunning to let a ole wolf catch them&quot; the wolf replies. &quot; I am glad I came across you and your herd, I have summoned forth a council for I have sensed dire circumstance to come forth, I head south to the city to seek to the chieftain. If what I sense is coming forth it will be a dreaded day to come. I called you to give you a warning and spread the word to all the creatures Tunare herself watches over.&quot; Cracktusk looks at the wolf with very concerning eyes full of sorrow and says.&quot; You know in your heart we will speak to the others, this land will come alive, we will be awaiting you call.&quot;  &quot; Alive is what this land is to be but I sense great death Cracktusk, great death&quot;. Cracktusk lowers his head for a moment as if he is pondering some distant thoughts. &quot; May Tunare blees you and your herd Cracktusk may your pastures be ever green with life and your waterhole never dry up, with that i must go.&quot; say the wolf. In a blink of an eye the wolf disappears into the horizon, to hear a loud sounding trumpet sound rolling arcoss the land.<br>
The wolf crested a hill only to be swallowed up by the next little valley. Deeper south he runs, then slowly veers to the west as if he picked up a scent and refuses to lose it. Slowly he strides over a lightly wooded hill and in the horizon he sees what he was searching for. A huge towering city looms in the distance. He speed forth knowing there is no time to spare.<br>
 The wolf approaches the city and is still awed in the vastness of this wooden structure. The wolf slows down some to regain his composure and stamina. He comes to the ramp that leads up into the vast Avaik city to be greeted by two huge humanoid shaped birds. Bright red feathers stand out blazed with faint streaks of blue and speckles of golden yellow. Hidden within the valleys of the deep Karanas they unique creatures keep to themselves, only to occasionally scout out various regions of the Karanas. As the wolf stands before these two guards, one speaks out in the common tongue and asks.&quot; What is your business here, wolf&quot;? The wolf speaks in a soft elven voice and says.&quot; I request council with Krak Windchaser and the Avocets.&quot; The guards look at one another as if neither one wants to be involved with this request. &quot; I tell you what wolf&quot; speaks one other guards.&quot; You go on ahead up there and you'll find Krak he'll let you know if he can give you a council&quot;. The guard chirps approvingly of the solution they gave to each other.<br>
 The wolf immediately bounds up the wooden ramp not giving the guards and moment to reconsider what they said. This is not the first time he has been here, though it has been awhile. The wolf winds further up the ancient ramps and rushes pass the burning torches that seen never to burn out. Magic is alive in this city the wolf thinks to himself. Through the wooden outposts till he come before a thin ribbed ramp that rises up into the low floating clouds. The wolf takes a calming breath and ascends upwards.<br>
 Coloth Meadowgreen has been overseeing the preparations of the feast that is customary at all councils. He is pleased in watching the four recent centaurs that bravely passed the rituals of passage help gather supplies for the feast. For strength comes not from just the battlefield but also being a strong role within the tribe. As council member arrive Coloth Meadowgreen greets them and whispers softly to each one that this meeting is being called upon by a druidic overseer. As each one hears this statement, they nod acknowledge.<br>
 Wonderful smells fill the air; fresh roasting game and colorful dishes of vegetables fill the feast table like a dwarven table filled with every colored metal and gem known. Soon the meeting will begin Coloth Meadowgreen thinks to himself but no sign of the wolf. He'll come the feast to fill the belly of journeyed friends till he comes. He looks towards the south as the sun begins to set leaving shimmers of golden speckles dot the horizon. &quot; Goddess speed, Goddess speed&quot; he whispers into the evening air.<br>
The clouded mist softens glowing yellowish light as the wolf nears the top. The paws of the wolf feel the slickness of the dampened wood, so he steps ever more carefully. The light becomes more of a more singular mass, the wolf steps to the top landing and sees torches ablaze within the penthouse. He step towards the entrance way and is greeted by 2 more guards but these ones are wearing crimson red ceremonial robes trimmed in gold and silver rune symbols covering the chest area. They easily tower over the guards at the bottom ramp in girth and height. &quot;Greetings child of Tunare it is a pleasure...cluck...cluck. To have such a note worthy guest this night&quot;, the one on the left says to the wolf. &quot;Yes...cluck...cluck… it is have you been summoned here or are you trading tales with Krak this eve?&quot; says the one on the right. The wolf cocks his head and is pleased with the greeting. &quot; I have come to speak with Krak and the avocet council on a urgent issue that lies before all of us.<br>
The Avocets stand aside as the wolf walks in side … and you hear the wolf speak and murmurs ascend within the penthouse....<br>
After the sky darkens into the evening sky and the stars begin illuminating the night, the wolf come outs from within the torch light pent house and is followed by the council. &quot;We must meet the others for they are waiting for us&quot;. The wolf says. &quot; I am dispatching to the four winds my scouts in triple force, &quot; Krak firmly commands. Then to the left and right of the wolf the Avaik scout party dispatches lifting off into the clouds and fading away into the night sky. The wolf turns and faces Krak and speaks arcane words in elven dialect. Stars instantaneously surround the wolf and streaks of light circle in a hypnotic pattern fade in and out as the wolf slowly begins to rise above the slick wooden planks.&quot; Krak&quot; the wolf says in a firm voice,&quot; time we head to the centaurs&quot;. The wolf glides off the penthouse planks into the misty clouds and begins to run towards the northern night sky. In the background the wolf hears the thumping of wings gathering the night air beneath them and slowly following him.<br>
The lush land of the southern most regions of Karanas lies beneath the wolf as he skims through the star studded sky in all the calmness the nighttime offers. The wolf ears perk up as it hears a cry in the night wind. The wolf relaxes for it is a screech owl looking for its prey. Krak and the Avocet council closes the gap with the wolf and Krak says,&quot; Do you think that the tomb has been disturbed for sure?&quot; The wolf replies to Krak,&quot; That is something I will investigate, while the council make cautionary preparations.&quot;<br>
From high above in the star light sky a dark swarm slowly descends upon the centaur village. The village is a glow with festive fires burning. The centurion guards look up into the night sky hearing the sounds of rushing air. As the swarm descends closer to the light of the fire recognizable characteristics become visible. In the forefront is a white wolf followed by large birds.<br>
The wolf and the Avaik chieftain’s land near the council hall. The centaurs are pleased to see the wolf again and greet him and the Avaiks warmly for it’s been some time since all have sat around a table. As the wolf closes in to the entrance his body begins to shimmer and his body promptly takes a humanoid shape then in a blink there stands a young wood elf dressed in natural brown tones of soft leather. He takes a moment and shakes his head and runs his hand through the long brown hair that faintly sparkles in the glow of the fires burning. He turns his head over his shoulder and looks at Krak and the Avocets following him, Krak motions as if he is going to say something but stops when he sees him look at them and notices his eyes flicker a fiery yellow. Was it from the fires burning nearby? Krak wasn't sure it has been a long time he seen him in humanoid form. The wood elf heads through the entrance and greets the council stationed within the hall.&quot; Hail Coloth and brothers and sisters I have brought Krak and the Avocet council here to join together involving the matters at hand.&quot; The centaurs bid good greetings to Krak and the avocets, then they return the same complimentary greetings.&quot; Take a seat or roost my fellow friends and please enjoy the feast we offer while we begin the council.&quot; Coloth says. <br>
 As everyone takes their place around the hall, the wood elf stands next to Coloth then realizes he'll need higher ground to see every one. He climbs up on to the crate near the round table. Coloth says,&quot; Hear, Hear good friends brothers and sisters, we was gathered here today to discuss possible revelations that is disturbed.&quot; Coloth looks towards the wood elf and says,&quot; We all know our dearest friend that stands before us, and it is his council of interest and concern that calls us together, with out further delay... Howler the floor of discussion is yours.&quot;<br>
  Howler stands on the wooden crate, looking at all the guests within this room. Anxiously waiting for him to speak. In the simple wooden toned dressings on him he stands in a solemn humbled stance and with his head lowered he raises it up. With his head focused straight ahead and he eyes seem alive with the glow of a burning fire that will never be quenched. Krak can tell now that it was no refection he sees. &quot; Council&quot; a firm smooth elven voice says.&quot; I have addressed lightly of my concerns that I call us together.&quot; a murmur washes through the hall and fades away. &quot; As we all know of what we hold in these lands are precious and vital to each one of us&quot; Howler begins his speak knowing it is in the heart he strikes first. There are many audible agreements to these words from with in the room. &quot; I have much investigating to do in order to confirm what i believe to be true, I bring us all together only as a forewarning, a moment to remember why we are here in the lands. I am urging caution to all here to listen what’s out there. &quot;<br>
   Howler repositions his footing on the crate and takes a clear breath and continues,&quot; What I sensed what something I helped banish into a different plane of existence. It was many moons ago. About 200 years back when I was fighting the good fight in Sands of Ro with the elven battalion pushing back the combines efforts of the Dark races. My squadron was cornering into the foothills. A foul practitioner of the dark arts had a sizable undead army at his command with Orcs, Trolls and Ogres supplying tactical charges against our forces. Well as we was holding our ground their forces was slowly eroding away. We summoned our magic users near the front line to contain the enemy forces back command line. As we began to collectively tap into the magic forces, we could see that they knew what we were planning; a massive magic assault. In our focusing… we didn't notice that their forces was tapping into the dark energies surrounding the area. Now in all honesty the lands of Ro for the most part have been tainted for the lands were laid to waste by powerful magic from long ago and it still looms there. Now our mages released their arcane powers in full force towards them and in the same instant they directed theirs at us. I feel for the souls at ground zero, my friends that collision of magic vaporized all at the front line. In a blinding flash of yellow, red and black a force shock wave came like a tidal wave in both directions and was swallowing up the surrounding land, sucking it in to a whirlpool of nauseas gases and fizzing of burnt ozone. My squad seen that the leader of the dark forces was beginning to retreat from the swelling up of this pit of doom. Our remaining forces spread commands to cut off his retreat for his forces was almost nil. He suffered a great lose of his troops and the stragglers was fleeing for their lives from this force of no mercy.<br>
 Our squad got to him closest and we used what we had to contain him. I casted many spells and most of them fizzled around him in soft blue sparks. Though the one archer in are group was able to land several quarrels into him but then they just deflected off. We knew he was using his magic in defense. Which is good, he’s not attacking us at the moment. He sees his escape is cut off as the surrounding troops close in. Like a rat cornered he stops for a moment and looks around. In an instant there is four wraiths standing between him and us and they look at him and he shouts something. The growing whirlpool was deafening loud swallowing up so much.<br>
  Then to our shock, something vile and hideous erupts forth from with the deep well of the massive whirlpool. It was demon with huge leathery wings with fire burning off of them and a hideous head and two curled horns with large ice blue eyes gazing around this land. Everyone stopped in his or her tracks. Being unsure of what laid next. This creature looked down at the Dark one standing so near the pit. In a blink of a eye the wraiths surrounded him and they rose upward towards the demon and the dark one casted a spell and it engulfed the demon and there was a scream unlike anything ever hear before and the demon the dark one and his wraiths and the massive whirlpool sucked into itself and vanished as the land was unearthly quiet. Deathly quiet.&quot;<br>
