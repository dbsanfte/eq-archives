While I agree that it is a very sad fact.. it is also a necessary fact.  If government agencys paid everyone who was injured while performing an act similar to their government paid job while &quot;off the clock&quot; the government would soon go broke.  Not to mention the number of people who would push false claims thru.<br>
<br>
Do I agree the city is right in withholding pay... NO.  But I also understand why they do.  For a city government to continue to give full pay and benefits to employees hurt OFF the job it would be necessary to raise taxes, considerably.  While the public hue and cry for this officer is probably quite high in his community, how many of those same folk crying &quot;foul&quot; would be willing to pay an additional 1%, 2% or more on their local taxes to defray the cost of continuing support?<br>
<br>
And the argument that if he had been uninjured and still working they'd have to pay him anyway does not work.  While he is out recuperating they are having to pay others to fill the position he normally holds.   <p>Mherina Whyndreaver<br>

The guy was a police officer, he put his life on the line on a daily basis when he was active on the force. Ok he was offduty so that is their defense for not paying. But if a police officer was offduty in an establishment that was being held up and he was shot preventing it, should he not recieve any pay because he was off duty? <br>
<br>
With regard to the false claims defense this could be easily proven. As he was ice fishing where he saw the two men who had fallen through the ice <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;I could see it in his face, I could see it in his eyes that this guy was dying,&quot; Garon said.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
So I assume aside from Garon the two men also required immediate treatment. Would be going to some great lengths to have people sit in ice water long enough to sustain those injuries just to cover a pulled back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garbhad>Garbhad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I will not<br>celebrate<br>

Would you expect your company to pay for injuries you received doing the same thing? <br>
<br>
He was off duty when it happened, thus the city doesn't technically have to pay for his injuries. He took it upon himself to rescue them. He could have called for an on duty officer and a rescue squad to come assist, where they had proper tools to perform the rescue without someone getting injured. <br>
<br>
I understand there may have been circumstances which may not have allowed for such a thing to occurr, however, like I said, he took it upon himself.<br>
<br>
I think he is a courageous man for what he did, the people he saved may have died if he had not intervened.  <p><a href=http://www.hneguild.com/profile.asp?name=Garbhad><img src="http://cblack87.home.comcast.net/Garbsig.jpeg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=newnand>NewNand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.familjenguild.com/uploads/awe.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/5/03 2:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3651.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some pretty sad shit</span><hr size=1> It reminds me of a Phil Collins song.

And if the person was not a police officer, but say a fireman?  Should he then recieve full compensation also?  What about a City Council Member?  At what point is the line drawn for off duty injuries?  What if it's just average Joe Citizen... because he was performing a life saving act, should he now be compensated by the city as a city employee?<br>
<br>
As I stated in my original post.. I think it SUCKS!!  I think circumstances should be looked at on an individual basis.  Yes, this officer should recieve assistance/compensation from his city.. his employer.  But I am also in the position of understanding WHY HE IS NOT... and therefor have to put myself into the position of devils advocate.. as much for myself as anyone. <p>Mherina Whyndreaver<br>

Never heard that before and I know a few cops.<br>
<br>
The city is not obligated and should not be obligated to cover his bills, being that it happened off the job.  Guess what? There's people who would lie about how they got hurt and take advantage if municipalities were too loose about that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
That being said, from a PR and goodwill standpoint (18 year cop) they should attempt to cover the rest of his bills.  It's the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine how his insurance could have cut him off.  Damn right the cop union should be threatening to use a different insurer if they dont cover ALL his costs for him.<br>
<br>
By the way I wonder how many of you arguing that the city should pay would be willing to have your taxes raised to cover situations like this.  Cuz you can't have it both ways-- the city covering massive expenses that don't fall into regular budgeting without those extra costs being passed on to taxpayers.<br>

They are'nt paid 24 hours a day and they're job does not extend 24 hours a day.  Obviously most cops are the type of person that would try to help a person regardless of what their occupation is.  Thats why they became cops.  But to say the officers employer is now liable for his injuries is ridiculous.  What a precident that would set.<br>
<br>
also...  Would it be nice if they paid them?  Sure.  Would I vote for a tax increase to cover THIS GUY?  Sure.  The problem is that it would then be abused by a few others and mis-managed by multiple others for the next 40 years until it was a fucking out of control joke like every other gov't program.  It's sad that we cannot trust the systems of gov't to handle our money effectivly.  Everyone loses.  It's such an enormous and widespread problem though I don't think anyone has a clue where to begin to fix it.  Would be nice if someone would try though would'nt it?  I think a majority of the people who have the power to make real change in the systems benifit from it's ineptness too much to want to change it though.<br>

I'm assuming from your posts you are some type of officer!??  If so how would your department react to this situation?<br>
<br>
You are off duty, you witness a Shooting, the victim is cared for by other witness, the Police/emergency personal are in route, the shooter is fleeing in vehicle.  (In my area the average response times are about 5 mins, as I live in a very rural area, we have no city police, and only a Sheriff for county duties, we rely heavily on the State Police)  The chance of this guy getting away if you don't move will be high, do you follow and try to apprehend? Do you say &quot;I'm off duty, sorry&quot;<br>
<br>
As a good cop I am going to assume you do the right thing and pursue, during pursuit you are shot. Should you be covered?  Again in my area ALL Police are REQUIRED to intervene because of the remoteness, also if you sat by and let this shooter get away imagine the public out cry, not to mention if the victim dies.  <br>
<br>
I say this because it has happened out here, The state deemed that because of the nature of the job the officer was &quot;Always&quot; on duty, and there for obligated to intervene, and hence the state obligated to cover the medical bills.<br>
<br>
This is also a fact for the Military, there is No such thing as &quot;Off Duty&quot; you may not be required be in uniform, but you are expected to offer the proper respects, and considerations to the officers, men/women, and or units you serve with.  I can remember Many a time getting pulled aside for not saluting an officer while he was in uniform and I was not, or getting into shit for not paying the proper respect to the flag at close of day...<br>
<br>
Now maybe this guys city is different, maybe there are close enough that they have a good response time, but he is a cop, he is on duty at all times, I am not saying the paper pusher in the district court house should get the same considerations as any of the police as they don't have the same responsibilities to the community.  This can be said for Fire fighters as well - imagine a building on fire and a little girl caught on a second floor yelling out the window, and this off duty fire fighter standing by and JUST watching, the wrath of shit that he and his department would receive!!!!<br>
<br>
Maybe the city should not cover it out of their pockets, but they should at least have some sort of EXTRA insurance, fund, and system for just such an event.<br>
<br>
As for the caring of cops and the reason they become cops, all the cops I know pretty much say it's the thought of helping people, but then it's also the POWER to do something about the problems they see.... <br>

If you think that the &quot;heroic&quot;  or even smart thing to do would be to enter a burning building with no support and no gear just because you are a &quot;firefighter&quot; then you obviously have never had even the most basic training in fire safety and supression. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=554649">Fammaden Flycaster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hneguild.com" target="top">Heaven and Earth</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bethene>Bethene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1465<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/6/03 11:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3651.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sycornet.com/familjen/images/members/thumb_bethene.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some pretty sad shit</span><hr size=1> <marquee><h2>TURK 182</h2></marquee> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eqnish>EQNish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(11/6/03 11:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3651.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some pretty sad shit</span><hr size=1> NO I have not had any training, and I would never do anysuch fool thing, but then I am not a firefighter!  and yes even on leave you are a soldier!!<br>

If I was sick my medical cover is pretty much everything after an initial excess (my insurance is that I cover the first EUR100 of my claim) My employer will pay me full salary for at least the first year of sickness when I would fall into the state system - my employer pays an insurance on my behalf so that I would receive 70% of my salary until I can return to work or until I retired if I should become disabled (its kinda more complicated but that is the simplified version).<br>
<br>
I moved to the Netherlands from the UK - in the UK medical bills are a complete non issue - 100% is covered by the national health service however for non emergency work the waiting lists are pretty bad there - again my old UK employer paid me a full salary for the first year of sickness.<br>
<br>
How can someone be genuinely sick - like that guy obviously is and not be protected by someone?<br>
<br>

<br>
But waiting lines are not an issue, except for really esoteric things like organ transplants, and the waiting lines for things like that are only because of scarcity of the transplants. <br>
<br>
I work with a couple of canadians who moved here, and I expressed my envy of their system, but they seemed to prefer the US system. Of course, they are employed, which makes it more reasonable.<br>
