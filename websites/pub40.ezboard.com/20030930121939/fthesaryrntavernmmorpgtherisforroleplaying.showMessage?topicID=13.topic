Dubar, Linc and several others were very close friends of mine during that time.  I post it here to show a shining example of what Beta was.  And why so many of us that were in it are often heard to say, wistfully, &quot;I miss Beta&quot;....<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Help!&quot; shouted Mikhak, breaking the silence of the day. &quot;I have fallen in the Estate of Unrest by the evil within and have had no luck retrieving my corpse&quot;. The dwarven warrior's pleas fell on deaf ears. <br>
<br>
Then, with a sound like thunder and a blinding flash of light, Loviane, Bard of the Order of Norrath, appeared. <br>
<br>
Dubar stirred in her presence, for he had always held a fondness for this one. She is of a kinder, gentler, spirit with a deep sense of compassion that is so rare in this harsh land. The Half-Elven Bard came forth to investigate this plea to see if in fact there were foul play at hand. But the dwarf had fallen by the evil of this darkened hell-hole and not by some mistake of the gods. <br>
<br>
&quot;Alas Mikhak, my hands are bound. I cannot help thee lest I anger the gods myself&quot;, said Loviane, &quot;You may request the help of your fellow adventurers but there is nothing I can do.&quot; As gracefully as she had appeared she was gone. <br>
<br>
Having overheard this conversation from nearby, Dubar looked to his party... their faces showed a silent sorrow as each one pondered Mikhak's situation and mirrored it into their own... Rynna Ketilson, Yiin the Wizard, Dubar's brother Linc, Hope Healfinger, and Megadyen the Ranger. Each knew the horror that lie within these forsaken walls, they sat quietly until one spoke up. It was Yiin who first said, &quot;maybe we should try to help him.&quot; <br>
<br>
A noble gesture but all of them knew they had not the stamina to charge foolishly into the perils that lie within that mansion of the unholy. Adding theirs to the corpse that lie within would serve no purpose... but Mikhak was a loner and had no party of his own. Dubar thought, &quot;If only there were a way to pull together all who hailed here in this foul place we may stand a chance after all.&quot; but how...upon that thought, Dubar stood up, cupped his hands to the sides of his mouth, and shouted for all to hear, &quot;How many of you here would like to lose your corpse?&quot; <br>
<br>
...a long uncomfortable silence fell over the estate. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then we must band together and do this for Mikhak!&quot; Dubar's companions looked on, a new feeling swept the group... not one of sorrow but of Honor and Chivalry. They began to prepare for the battle that was to take place here. The other groups complied with this plan and included some of the finest warriors and wizards in all of norrath... <br>
<br>
Mavrik the Gnome, Celestak the Half-Elf, Ainadyen the Wizard, Curzad the Dwarf, of the Angels of Norrath, and several of his Guild. But one stood out in particular. A champion named Saava Devilare.. clad in shining platemail and wielding a mighty claymore. And so it was ordaned, these nobles would take on the evil of this estate, amidst the foul stench that permeated the air, as one legion. <br>
<br>
The parties gathered near the rear stoop of the Estate, the groans of the undead filled the air and mingled with the clanking of steel and armor as the restless army prepared for battle. The sounds of spells and the glowing of magic fired off as the clerics prepared their warriors with the blessings of holiness and spiritual aids they would need to withstand this fight. As the night drew upon them, another silence fell as the clerics meditated for their last time to prepare for the final showdown. <br>
<br>
Saava and Megadyen went into the house first, their plan to bait the lesser ghouls and skeletons to the trap which lie just outside the back door of the Estate. Linc and Dubar moved to the sentry position to see that they were not caught off guard. <br>
<br>
It worked!! With a blast and a shriek they came barreling down the hallway with several undead in tow through the back door. As Saava plowed out onto the lawn, Megadyen was hit by a stunning blow that sent him for a loop reeling in pain. Linc and Dubar jumped to his aid, taunting and warding the foul creatures to draw their fire as Yiin, Ainadyen and the Clerics blasted them down with powerful magics. Curzad's crew jumped in quickly to dispatch the remainder of the ghouls attacking the mages. The first stage of the assault was a great success and boosted the moral of all. <br>
<br>
If only they had known what lie in store for them... <br>
<br>
Rynna and Hope settled in to meditate while the fighters prepared for the next assault.. the one they hoped would lead them to the corpse of the fallen Mikhak. The clerics stood and healed the Paladins, the graceful wave of their arms and the pale blue light eminating from their fingertips a glorious site to behold as they delivered their life giving gift. <br>
<br>
Once again Saava and Megadyen entered the house first, this time followed more closely by Linc, Dubar and the Angels of Norrath. As they entered the hallway leading to the stairs the groans of the unholy seemed deafening. This time the mages and clerics followed into the main foyer to await the battle cries. The stairs creaked uneasily under the weight of the armored Paladins as they cautiously approached the second floor landing... still no sign of Mikhak's corpse. <br>
<br>
Saava peered up the next flight of stairs, a lump forming in his throat as he imagined the evil that dwelled on this level. Champion or not, lore has it that a bewitching hag resided here that could charm any living creature and force them to do her bidding. The thought of Saava's calymore turned to do evil's bidding put a lump in Dubar's throat. <br>
<br>
As they aproached the top floor, Dubar could see Mikhak's corpse. It lie in a twisted heap at the top of the third landing. Just to the right of it was a room, the door slightly ajar, and Dubar could see from within a tall skeleten and two large ghouls. His bravery was tried as he stood in the doorway and called for Mikhak to come to the front and begin his recovery. With Saava to his back, and Linc and the Angels just below on the stairs, Dubar peered into the room biting back on his fear, ready to distract the foul creatures should they try to interfere with Mikhak. He knew it was only a matter of time before they sensed him, for the undead could smell a Paladin from a mile away. <br>
<br>
The time ticked by, seconds seemed like hours and the only sounds were that of the tormented dead and his own heartbeat pounding heavily in his chest... then he realized it... he was staring into the face of the hag herself! <br>
<br>
Almost as though his thoughts betrayed his presence to her, the hag snapped to and stared straight into Dubar's eyes. Ice filled his veins as he readied his own Claymore, poised to strike. Mikhak had completed his recovery and readied his weapon, he would stand and fight with these brave souls who had helped him to retrieve his belongings. <br>
<br>
The hag shrieked and began casting as the two carrion ghouls rushed out of the room... &quot;Thud&quot; was the sound as Dubar was hit by the first, then again by the second... stunned for a moment he yelled to his companions &quot;THIS IS IT! ITS GOING DOWN HERE, NOW!&quot; Saava turned and immediately jumped into the melee, Linc rushed to his brother's aid along with Celestak, Megadyen, and the fearless Dwarves led by Curzad, the fight was on. <br>
<br>
To the stairs came Rynna and Hope, they began casting their healing magic onto those who were most in need while Yiin, Mavrik, and Ainadyen blasted away with the magics reserved only for the most dedicated of mages... fire flew from their fingertips in a glorious rage! The level of chaos rose to new hieghts as several more skeletons joined the fight, Monks and Ice Bones led by a Barbed Skeleton the likes of which could humble the holiest of Paladins. Bones crunched and brimstone flew as the melee turned into a frenzy of flying steel and explosions. <br>
<br>
But the fight was not going well... the close quarters of the hallway made for a disadvantage and the order was given to retreat. This proved to be the turning point of the battle... for the worst. <br>
<br>
The hallway flushed out... the formation of the group turned tragic during the retreat as the Mages and Clerics were now at the front-line and the first floor was replenished with fresh ghouls and skeletons.. Meanwhile the flank was now heavy with the purest of evil. The party took a beating and the halls of the undead were covered with fresh blood while they made their way back into the graveyard. <br>
<br>
Out onto the lawn with a fury unseen until now the battle continued. All hell broke loose and Nosferatu's Legions came down like a flaming fist. Saava, now in a beserker rage, Megadyen flailing wild with two swords, Curzad and his Angels bashing and slashing, Linc and Dubar side by side, brothers to the bitter end, Celestak, Mikhak... warriors all true and brave, trying desperately to relieve the clerics from the relentless attacks of the foul unearthed but all fighting a losing battle. <br>
<br>
Rynna, the finest Cleric ever to grace this party, feverishly tried to heal her friends, hollow, knowing she had run out of mana and was in poor health herself. The companions were outnumbered 2 to 1. Hope Healfinger fired her last of spells and turned to fight in weapon melee... all around the sounds of clashing steel and the howls of battle! <br>
<br>
Then it happened... <br>
<br>
A fatal blow was delivered, the blood curdling sound of bones crunching and the last dying gasp of a comrade in arms, Dubar turned in the heat of combat to see Ainadyen fall at his feet... lifeless in a pool of blood. Rage and tears both filled his eyes, tearing him between his hatred for the undead and his compassion and respect for his comrades... as he looked toward Rynna he could see she had abandoned hope, her health failing fast despite all he could do to distract the carrion ghoul, but she was as brave a warrior as any on the battlefield and she would not flee until the command was given, always putting the lives of her comrades ahead of her own. <br>
<br>
With one final, crushing blow from the carrion ghoul, Rynna's life was taken... as she fell to the blood-soaked field her dying gasp was like a dagger that tore through Dubar's heart... for she was not only his faithful companion but his brother Linc's soulmate and love. With her death came the harsh realization that they must now flee for safety, those that remained, so that they might one day return to avenge the deaths of their fallen bretheren. <br>
<br>
The trip out to safety would not be an easy one however, it was a long way to the edge of the estate and the undead were now bloodlusted and bent on destruction. Mikhak fell in the path between the hedgerows.. he fought bravely with his saviors right to the end. Not 10 feet from Mikhak lay the corpse of Curzad... honorable and noble... he would go into the history books. <br>
<br>
Dubar was the first to reach the passage leading from the estate. With his party close at his heels he turned to offer assistance to his brother Linc, who's life was in dire peril. He was no better off but he would lay his life down if it would do some good. As Linc entered the tunnel, followed by Megadyen and Yiin, he was rooted by a ghoul with his back facing the attack. With at least 6 more undead at his back the assault was devastaing and Linc was forced to lay hands on himself in a desperate ploy to withstand the abuse until he would be free to run again. <br>
<br>
As Dubar taunted the undead at Linc's back to no avail he could see Megadyen approach from behind, near death but still swinging his swords in a most valiant manner. Neither Megadyen nor Dubar could deliver an effective defense for Linc and Megadyen fell in the effort. <br>
<br>
All at once Yiin stepped up and in the most heroic deed of the battle cast his area spell into the pack of ghouls knowing full well they would all turn on him at the delivery, thus sacrificing his own life for the chance to save Linc. Linc reminded Dubar that he could do no more good here told him to go on alone. Dubar was so severely wounded that he was barely able to crawl to the border. As he backed away he watched as Yiin fired his spell and was torn to shreds by the relentless servents of hell, followed by the gruesome dismemberment of his brother Linc. Tears filled his eyes as he joined the remainder of the survivors in safety. <br>
<br>
As he sat with his head in his hands, the visions dancing through his mind of his fallen friends and family, Dubar pondered the question... was it all worth it? The answer resounds through his head like the Trumpets of Antonius Bayle's Court... yes. <br>
