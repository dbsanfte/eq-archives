I thought it would be apt for the BF.  The porn issue, like the drug issue, is fairly complex and I would prefer not to get into it. Suffice to say I am female and am NOT into porn.<br>
<br>
<br>
I get most of my information from 'debate class' :P , books and magazines, but I do like to provide internet links since this is an *internet* forum.<br>
<br>
And yes drug laws do favour the rich and punish the poor. 12% of black people are in jail (and have lost the right to vote) b/c of  the drug laws, while only 1.4% of white people are affected...<br>
<br>
<br>
And theres the wife of a US Colonel who trafficked cocaine for 'spending money'.  They both got a lighter sentence than your average pot smoker would. <br>

<br>
<br>
And just to clarify, I think it'd be just nifty if pot remained illegal.  But fine people...throw em in jail overnight...but do not punish the minorities and take away their right to vote...the punishment just doesn't seem to fit the crime imho.<br>

<br>
I was wondering why you hadn't responded to me.  Fear not!  I now understand that you needed to read 1003 websites, and reference a few books to tell you how you feel about this subject.  Honestly, as a true and blue question to you, why do you feel the need to find &quot;references&quot; for everything?  Why is it that you can't put forth your ideas in your own words?  It sounds as though you were one of those &quot;A+++&quot; students who couldn't think of an original idea to save their lives.  Actually, it's probably just low-brow old me not understanding you.<br>
<br>
My first question is:  Are you really sure you'd like me to continue responding to you?  If you like, I can stop now, and you can post another large and mostly ancillary diatribe and claim that you've won and &quot;p0wned&quot; me.<br>
<br>
While I did read your post, and the majority of the links you provided, I am still stuck on the fact that you needed to find weblinks to &quot;prove&quot; your thoughts.  Why can't kids these days actually think for themselves?  Oh... wait just a moment!  Do you believe that I am so &quot;thick&quot; because I am not producing sufficient references to back my ideas?  At any rate, since I am here arguing with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOU</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I will respond to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOUR</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> points, and not those of some overpaid, eternally bored philosopher.  If you want my opinion, I think the world would be a much better place if people would begin thinking for themselves instead of quoting old rubbish from yesteryear.<br>
<br>
1) Your analogy is fine, and I have no problems with it.  He did steal, and he is a criminal.  If he doesn't get caught, great!  If he does, he deserves to go to jail for breaking the law.  I will repeat, since it hasn't quite seemed to sink in yet:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IF YOU CHOSE TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY, YOU CHOSE TO LIVE BY THEIR LAWS OR SUFFER THE PENALTIES, WHATEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE.  IF YOU WANT REFORM, THEN GO THROUGH THE NECESSARY AND LEGAL STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Second, I mentioned twice in this thread that I have *never* touched alcohol, drugs or cigarettes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Great!  Would it validate or invalidate my argument to state that I do or don't?  Being so quick to jump on the &quot;Straight Edge&quot; bandwagon certainly raises a few questions about the validity of the statement.  <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>OK first off, minor nitpick point i know but...if you dont care about the arguments why are you engaged in this debate?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I grow tired of this.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>READ WHAT  WRITTEN!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I am not engaged in the debate about whether or not drugs should be legal, I am engaged in the debate about whether or not people should take the law into their own hands and break laws that they don't think are valid or useful.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Marijuana smoking doesnt hurt anyone. Show me proof of where marijuana smokers have gone on murdreous rampages? have beat their families? have held up banks? now when drunk driving, you stand a good chance of hitting and killing someone. The only way marijuana use hurts ppl is thru the enforcement of marijuana laws that put more and more ppl in jail *which* costs the taxpayer money.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->While it hurts me to do this, where do these people fall in your little spectrum of morals?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Social contract morality often involves a utilitarian approach, where the relative value of an act is determined by &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, I guess it's not the coveted level 3, stage 5.  Marijuana hardly contributes any &quot;good&quot; for the &quot;greatest number&quot;.<br>
<br>
To slow it down, marijuana would have a negligable &quot;relative value&quot;, since the good is only benefiting the individual.  An example of something that would be the &quot;greater good for the greatest number&quot;, would be to harvest food, or build a large communal building for all to use.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Level I: Pre-conventional morality. While infants are essentially amoral, very young children are moral in a rather primitive way described by the two preconventional stages. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Why are there laws in society?  What is the reason?  If you have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> law in society, it is there for a reason (outdated, or not).  If it is outdated, then people should petition in mass numbers (instead of breaking the law in mass numbers).  It sounds to me as though anyone violating the morals (read: laws) of the society would be, by definition, amoral.  So I guess I can take pride in the fact that I've reached the apparently not-so-coveted stage IV.<br>
<br>
If you'd really like, I could think of nothing I'd rather do than go pull out some sociology textbooks and start quoting, since you seem to prefer pre-fabricated to original ideas.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I notice you managed to control yourself and included a 1/3 less insults! WTG!<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly, as a true and blue question to you, why do you feel the need to find &quot;references&quot; for everything? Why is it that you can't put forth your ideas in your own words?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Well actually, last time we 'debated' you admonished me for not providing links.  'Back up your case you nitwit' you said.  And if I recall you also badgered Kida to provide you with the definition of a word during a debate on race. So forgive me for providing 'backup' for my premise. (the famous Rthen ban thread, and my name was Maneta).  In addition to this, seeing as how you were lecturing me on philosophy/debate etc Id have thought you'd realise that it is important to provide footnotes..and other 'fancy' stuff like that.  While logic is good, actual facts and anecdotes tend to make one's  case a lil more solid.<br>
<br>
&quot;My first question is: Are you really sure you'd like me to continue responding to you? If you like, I can stop now, and you can post another large and mostly ancillary diatribe and claim that you've won and &quot;p0wned&quot; me.&quot;<br>
<br>
We can obviously go on forever.  It is possible to take either side and provide a *convincing* argument.  And I would much rather play Thief 2 than respond to your insults on the BF (entertaining as that may be).<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am still stuck on the fact that you needed to find weblinks to &quot;prove&quot; your thoughts. Why can't kids these days actually think for themselves?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
As I stated in my reply to Vainne, I like to provide links, so people can see for themselves, without just reading MY words and MY opinions.  Hopefully they can read up on the subject and form their own opinions.  Or provide counter links and counter-facts.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;IF YOU CHOSE TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY, YOU CHOSE TO LIVE BY THEIR LAWS OR SUFFER THE PENALTIES, WHATEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE. IF YOU WANT REFORM, THEN GO THROUGH THE NECESSARY AND LEGAL STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I think it's wonderful that you feel this way, and admire your conviction.  It's just that...as I stated many many times in my big reply, reality doesn't work that way.  It's only when lawmakers can't control people or they realise that the cost of enforcing said laws outweighs the benefits do they change....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Great! Would it validate or invalidate my argument to state that I do or don't? Being so quick to jump on the &quot;Straight Edge&quot; bandwagon certainly raises a few questions about the validity of the statement. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
You accused me of being a stoner RIGHT OFF.  Would you prefer I had lied and said 'yes Nakros im a stoner?&quot;  Fact is whether or not Im a stoner should have nothing to do with the debate itself.  You kept bringing it up though - I assume as some tactic to make yourself look superior 'oh lol look at the stoner, he's disagreeing with me so he must be a stoner.'  <br>
<br>
&quot;While it hurts me to do this, where do these people fall in your little spectrum of morals?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm really not sure what the point of this question is. Id have thought it obvious from the 'big reply' and from that very statement that I am contrasting the two, and saying that your average pot smoker isnt quite the danger to society that a *true* criminal is (someone who either through negligence or just mean spiritidness goes forth and hurts people).<br>
<br>
Perhaps a little analogy will clear things up.  I have a friend. His name is Fred. He is 40 years old.  He works 9 to 5, pays his taxes.  Has never beat up anyone, stolen from anyone, driven drunk or downloaded an mp3.  Fred buys some marijuana and has a few joints on a Friday night in the privacy of his own home.  Say the cops get a tip, catch him, throw him in jail.  Thanks to 'zero tolerance' laws hes now doing 5 years and has lost the right to vote for life.  Now expain to me who's been victimized here?  Who did Fred hurt?  Who did Fred hurt *enough* to justify such a harsh sentence?<br>
<br>
<br>
I would quite happily throw away the key if he willingly drank himseful stupid and jumped in a car...if he willingly broke into someones house and stole their possessions.  But I dont' see how hes hurt *anyone* other than himself by sitting alone in his room enjoying some marijuana.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;To slow it down, marijuana would have a negligable &quot;relative value&quot;, since the good is only benefiting the individual. An example of something that would be the &quot;greater good for the greatest number&quot;, would be to harvest food, or build a large communal building for all to use.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I look at it in terms of cost/benefit.  Example. I am quite anti-booze. Hate the stuff.  But I realise that if prohibition was still in effect, crime would most likely be even more *out of control* and society would have a bigger problem on it's hands than if it decided to regulate it. Prohibtion leads to black market leads to murders leads to gang wars leads to exorbitant costs of enforcing leads to otherwise non-violent people going to jail leads to costing taxpayers a hell of a lot of money.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are there laws in society? What is the reason? If you have any law in society, it is there for a reason (outdated, or not). If it is outdated, then people should petition in mass numbers (instead of breaking the law in mass numbers).&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, and I keep saying, it doesn't work that way in reality.  Laws change through ACTION, they change when the gov't realises the costs of enforcing such laws outweigh the benefits. People very rarely listen to reason.  Politicians care about votes and their pocketbooks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you'd really like, I could think of nothing I'd rather do than go pull out some sociology textbooks and start quoting, since you seem to prefer pre-fabricated to original ideas.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, no idea is original :P  Everything's been recycled hun you should know this.  And speaking of 'originality' all you've done this entire debate is pick out irrelevant text from my replies and flame me.  Instead of providing new information you'd merely come out with 'hah rubbish, you stoner, it is obvious that no one can take you seroiusly precisely b/c you disagree with me, the great Nakros.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, just to prove your 'superiority' I will provide a 'pre-fab' quote, written by a friend of mine, who's been reading this debate:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;LMAO ... First he blasts you for NOT providing proof and insinuates that your stupid and &quot;stoned&quot; because of what you wrote. Then you provide him with &quot;proof&quot; = more than just your opinion and he tries blasting that.<br>
If it were me by all means I would challange him to &quot;break out the text books&quot; and prove you wrong. <br>
It all falls back on his opinion that you should petition to change the law and not break it first. He must think RL is like eq and when something you dont like happens you &quot;petition&quot; to have a GM come change things. Lame so lame )))&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
While I doubt I've 'pwned' you Id certainly say that my friend has...<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank for your time,<br>

Your argument is weak.  How did gay marriage come about in Canada recently?  Thousands of violent gay people stormed the streets of Canadia threatening to get married on every corner?  But, by your irrefutable logic, they must have broken the law to get a law changed or added!  <br>
<br>
Well, maybe thats a corner case.  Let's take the anti-smoking law in public buildings in Ottawa!  There were a few clubs shut down because everyone in them was smoking (and quite a few individuals got slapped with large fines).  Hmm... Rebelling against that law seemed to do a whole world of good!  Whether it jives with your little world bubble or not, there have been many ammended laws that did not need any sort of law-breaking whatsoever.<br>

<br>
&quot;Sure, if I was your philosophy professor. I'm asking you your opinion, and you're spouting gibberish you read on the big wide Interweb.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, Im spouting gibberish I've read in *books* and *newsmagazines* but I prefer to post *internet links* since this is an *internet forum*.   I suppose if I merely spouted 'gibberish' without 'links' then you'd accuse me of 'talking out of your ass' (wait, you already did that!).  You're grasping at straws, and doing a piss poor job of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Put into words how one decides which laws are worth discarding and which are not worth discarding? That is what I have asked from the beginning, and that is what you have refused to provide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He hasn't. How does this relate back to your bullshit about stages of morals? He hasn't helped *anyone* other than himself either! What has he done? Wasted 4 hours of his life, without contributing to The Greater Good (TM).&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Read what I had to say about cost-benefits. And consider this:<br>
Never in my arguments did I state that people smoking pot were contributing to the &quot;greater good&quot;.  The answer to this question is simple. Each person (that thinks for themselves unlike Nakros) has their owm moral and civil &quot;code of ethics&quot; based on what they believe to be right and wrong. Some of those are universal such as murder is wrong. The other issues are decided on a person to person basis. Personally I see nothing wrong with pot smoking but do feel that alcohol consumption has ruined many innocent peoples lives. I also feel the same way about prostitution. If 2 consenting adults wish to engage is sexual adventures and exchange cash its their business and nobody elses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
'No. I would've prefered you say absolutely nothing on the subject. Your use of substances, or lack thereof, is of no value to this debate.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Then why did you bring it up (lets count):<br>
<br>
#1 You potheads can't step away from your happy fun fun weed for long enough to actually form a valid argument. If you can't form a valid argument, you can't convince anyone of anything, let alone win a war!<br>
<br>
So, in closing, lay off the drugs, and the rest will follow. Q.E.D.<br>
<br>
<br>
#2 I don't mind people making pro-legalization arguments, I just don't like it when they try to lead the audience by saying &quot;oh, I've never taken drugs so I have no vested interest!!&quot;. The fact stands that anyone who tries to argue in favor of legalization is quite obviously high as hell -- you know it, we know it, so you might as well own up to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
#3 Get out of your haze, put down the joint, wait for 4 hours for the effects to wear off, then come have a reasonable discussion, please.<br>
<br>
<br>
#4 you simply post broad accusations and attempt to make ridiculous statements, perhaps in the hopes that some moron reading will put down his joint for a minute and say &quot;yeah man -- what he said&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
#5 Anyone can throw out unsubstantiated claims, and ridicule someone who responds to them, rather than argue or debate. I must, therefore, conclude that you are full of shit and talking out of your ass. <br>
<br>
<br>
hehehe had to include #5 even though it's not a pot related insult. It's ironic isn't it? you said #5 with a straight face after statements 1-4. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha! I doubt that strongly. You are enthralled with our little debate here.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's been interesting.  It's sort of a 'my strap-on is bigger than yours' kind of deal.  But since we will obviously never agree (or agree to disagree), and since you will keep grasping at straws, the way that you do, and picking out certain statements and making the oh-so-predictable 'witty' remark - well I would have to admit that Thief 2 is much more fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your argument is weak. How did gay marriage come about in Canada recently? Thousands of violent gay people stormed the streets of Canadia threatening to get married on every corner? But, by your irrefutable logic, they must have broken the law to get a law changed or added!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Cost-benefits again. And when did I say people had to be violent?  One can protest, peacefully.  One can disobey laws without getting *violent* or *storming the streets.*  And I never said that this so called 'violent protest' was the *rule* there will always be exceptions. But the fact still remains that politicians won't change laws until it affects votes or hurts their (and our) pocketbooks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If your friend has something to say, why doesn't your friend create an account and post his or her opinion? I'd love to have another 20-something yuppy head-strong victim to respond to -- you're getting tiresome.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
So now you've moved on from calling me a 'pot head' to insinuating that im a '20 something yuppy' - and we allll know how 20 something yuppies lack the ability to think clearly!<br>
<br>
<br>
And lastly, Nakros...you're like a bot. Oh so predictable.  You highlight the minutae and then make the requisite sarcastic comment.  &quot;OH, well YOU should go back to school.&quot;  &quot;OH, that is such rubbish what kind of moron are you.&quot;  &quot;You must be high to say something as retarded as that.&quot;  And to top it off, you're not even funny.<br>

2.) Maneta is not even 20, and therefore can hardly be a yuppie.<br>
<br>
3.) Maneta does not actually know any 40-year old potheads in jail.<br>
<br>
4.) Maneta has had a negative experience in her life involving alcoholism, but has never had a negative experience with pot--therefore, pot must not be &quot;that bad!&quot;<br>
<br>
5.) Maneta thinks big companies like Jack Daniels are bad, but entrepeneurs who smuggle weed in from Mexico, or grow it in Oregon are good, because pot is good.<br>
<br>
6.) Maneta feels sorry for the injustices of our judicial system and their effect on minorities--all this is MUCH worse than the effect of drugs on poor people. But I'm not sure she knows any.<br>
<br>
7.) Maneta thinks it would probably be cool to be a stripper. As long as you weren't, like, drunk or anything. Gag me.<br>

<br>
<br>
I never said pot was 'good'.  I never said it was better or even worse than alcohol tobacco etc. My main point is that considering there is no real proof that it does MORE harm than these legal 'drugs' that it is counter-productive to be putting folks like my 'fred' character in jail for 5 years, taking away their right to vote, all at the cost of the taxpayer (trillion dollars so far remember, and drug use is going up).<br>
<br>
Now what is so hard to understand about that?  What is so 'radical' about this point of view?<br>
<br>
And for those whose reading comprehension is poor (as seems to be the case) I never once said that 'if you smoke pot it will lead to a Greater Good and happiness for all.'  The point is if you put people like my 'fred' character in jail and spend billions enforcing that law and ruining lives such as his - THEN you do negatively affect the 'greater good.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will not respond to any of your pathetic attempts to flame me Vainne.  I will just catalogue it under the Nakros school of thought 'try to ridicule said opponent and suggest that he/she is either a pothead or a yuppie or gasp now a teenie bopper! to bolster my own weak case and make me look superior' or some such :P<br>
<br>
<br>
Im done with this subject now. I feel I've made my point very clear and if for some reason any of you are still having problems I would put it down to either 1) poor reading comprehension 2) need to flame to give a boost to those fragile egos<br>

<br>
<br>
i will state a few Facts for you.<br>
<br>
1) you cannot die from marijuana poiisoning, yes, that poisoned marijuana was bad, but it wouldnt have happened if it were regulated by the FDA<br>
<br>
2) drug dealers are mean, and bad, thats why you should make it legal, so that drug dealers will go bye-bye.... its obvious the 'war on drugs' doesen't get em<br>
<br>
3) Amsterdam, where it is legal, still seems to have functionable society... it's  treated like wine or beer over there, and there are obvious limits<br>
<br>
personally, I think they need to find a way to detect if drivers under the influence of pot before they legalize it, but after that, fine.  I am an avid fighter of intoxicated driving....so I think that needs to be handled before anything.  why not devote some of that &quot;drug war&quot; money to THAT instead of sending joe shmo the taxi driver to prison for blazing  doobie? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3474.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3474.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3474.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3474.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3474.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showPrevMessage?topicID=3474.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showNextMessage?topicID=3474.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3474.topic&index=117><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=3474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=3474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
