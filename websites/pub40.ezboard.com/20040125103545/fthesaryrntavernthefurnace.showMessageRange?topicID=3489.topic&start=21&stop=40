<br>
Yeah that is really a terrible story.  No one to blame but the mom.<br>
<br>
Anyone remember the story last year where some woman hit a bum on her way home?  She was rushing to get there to have sex with her boyfriend, so she left the bum bleeding and stuff, on her hood, hanging like halfway into the front seat thru the windshield, while she went in and had her sex.<br>
<br>
When she went back in the garage like 4 hours later the bum was dead.  As I rememeber she claimed she thought she had hit a dog.<br>
<br>
Anyway I bring that up because it's a similar story of neglecting responsibility for selfish pursuits.<br>
<br>
I thought I heard recently that this woman just got thrown in the slam for the bum incident.  Hate to say, but the EQ woman deserves the same. <p>Axaroth<br>

She was rushing home from her job at the HOSPITAL to get crack from her BF. she was scared she would be put in jail, so she left him and said, &quot;I'm sorry&quot; *from her confession* she then asked friends to help her dump the body when she found him dead.  <br>
<br>
And Guess What.<br>
<br>
It was HER fault. <br>
<br>
Not the Crack's fault. <br>
<br>
Not the bum's fault.<br>
<br>
And, On top of it, She didnt try to pawn it off on either of these. She Hit him, she refused him nursing help *she was a registered nurse* and she allowed him to die.<br>
<br>
The Mother in this scenario left her child unattended, refused her supervision, and allowed her to die.<br>
<br>
Both situations are very similar, Don't you think. I am not saying EQ is not addictive, I am saying it is not to blame. I have posted a lot on this situation, only because I am very passionate about *Actual* child abuse and child neglect. Not spanking as a last resort, not discipline. Abuse and Neglect. This is a SERIOUS case of neglect where the Mother is entirely at fault.<br>
<br>
If I ever left my children unattended and something happened to them, I would not be able to live with myself, because, it would be my fault and I would know it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dugat>Dugat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/21/03 9:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3489.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lady</span><hr size=1> I'd have to disagree with you with that comparison Katonyntales, I don't see the similarity so easily between the two.<br>
<br>
The RN saw the bum and still hit him, she left him to die, she offered no aide as she was most likely qualified to do something, she didn't seek out help for the person she hit, instead she made a concious decision to let that person die because she was more worried about crack or sex or whatever it was. She basically committed murder intentionally, not to say she started out that day to kill a homeless person but she possibly could have prevented it once she was alerted to his predicament.<br>
<br>
If this mother saw their child in despair do we really believe she would have left her to die so that she could play a game? There's been no cause to believe she would have even attempted to cover it up. This woman wasn't the spawn of satan she was just like most of us. The difference is she didn't know where to draw the line between her hobby and responsibilities of her life and as it was fate dealt out her punishment for that by taking her daughter.<br>
<br>
Many times I group with stay at home parents who play while their kids run around the house and now and then you get afk kids getting into something, or afk have to see what they are crying about. This could just as easily have happened to any of them it just so happens it happened to this woman that none of us know offhand.<br>
<br>
She did play a large role in her child's death and blame can go on no one other than her unless someone locked that child in the car(still not sure how a three year old got outside of the house unattended let alone inside of what should have been a locked car) but from the evidence provided by the article she did not intentionally kill her child.<br>
<br>
Now for another sad turn of events no one has yet mentioned. This woman has another child who is I believe I read was nine years old. What happens to this child, clearly it can't be left with the mother even if she isn't incarcerated, the mother has said the father has been abusive to her prior to the divorce and had hit her 2 yr old(to what extent it doesn't really say), this child lost his/her sister, the mother may be jailed, the father is abusive. If the family doesn't take them it will be one more child in the system as a result of two people who were not prepared to have children.<br>
<br>
Hopefully people can learn from this, know their priorities and responsibilities, count their blessings it hasn't been their children yet, and very importantly don't have children unless you are absolutely sure you are mentally, physically and financially able to care for them. Its wrong to bring children into this world if you're not fully committed to them and stable enough to rear them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Night-blind Bard</span><br>  Posts: 2727<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/21/03 10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3489.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lady</span><hr size=1> When you're playing eq how much supervision do you give a three year old?

Do you leash them? Put them in a playpen? What?<br>

I am NOT defending this woman, I am saying, there is a difference between this kind of neglect--which to me reads more like a tragic accident than abuse--and the guy who locked his kids in the car and went to work, or the woman who went to the mall with her kid left in the back seat, or any other number of cases.<br>

At the same time, I do think EQ is addictive, and I don't think its healthy. Why do I play it?

<br>
Everquest like everything else that makes you happy, becomes an addiction when not handled moderately.<br>
<br>
The point is not how much supervision a child gets while you're playing EQ, as a parent it's your job 24/7/18+ to know where they are, who they're with and what they're doing.  <br>
<br>
Although this woman was neglecting her child, and it is her fault, not the fault of EQ that her child died, I refuse to bash her here.  She hurts right now, she knows it's her fault, and losing her child will cause more pain than words typed by strangers ever will be able too.   <br>

Well, maybe she should have thought about that before NEGLECTING her child?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A 3 year old needs supervision</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  1mil to 1 odds this 21 year old she's shacking up with (read the article, boyfriend, not husband) is someone she met online, yet a year ago she was SO opposed to the game.<br>

It's her fault, period.  Don't try to shift the blame elsewhere, I feel sympathy for the other child having his life torn apart by an obviously screwed up family, and losing a sibling.  I have no sympathy for a woman who would obviously neglect her children in such a fashion.<br>

If you have two kids and are always jumping up to wrangle one, play a wizard or druid or necro, you can solo and be free from group constraints, take care of the kids while medding, invis and be safe while afk, and no one will even notice you are AFK on raids most of the time.<br>
<br>
No life, friends, phone calls ever at all? You can be a main tank or a main cleric!! We require your constant attention for success so you wont have time to think about your lonely worthless existence as you make sure the mobs stay off the guild or you make sure the guild stays in the red.<br>
<br>
Do you generally just want to seem important while you chat in 15 channels or cyber your online BF/GF? We have many choices!! Be a ranger...when not eating a death touch or harmshield pulling some insane boss into place, you can cheerfully send huggles and kisses out to all your friends while you wait for your 15th rezz. Or be a shaman, just pre slow and debuff that thing then when it kils you its all your time while the guild kills it for phat lewts!!<br>
<br>
Or maybe you cant sit still, be a rogue shadowknight or monk.  You can spend all your time running ahead and pulling trains on the group so you dont get too bored.<br>
<br>
Anyway I neglected some classes but I am tired of this already so you get the point, this bitch should have been a druid, but she was prolly a chanter or cleric or some such high maintenance shit. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=554649">Fammaden Flycaster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hneguild.com" target="top">Heaven and Earth</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sychasoulsucker>Sycha SoulSucker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2y9c4/tinytori.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/22/03 6:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3489.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lady</span><hr size=1> &quot;When you're playing eq how much supervision do you give a three year old? No, really, I have no idea. My dog sits at my feet or sneaks into the bathroom and eats my clothes....presumably a toddler would do more, could do more.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have never had a problem taking a 2 minute break so a group mate could go check on the kids. I've been known to wait much longer, happily, while all manner of parent-type tasks were being completed. Other peoples kids &gt; My Xp. That is how it should be.<br>
<br>
Most EQ'rs that I know that have really small kids have their computers set up in the same area their kids play. Near the TV, the toy box etc. Usually the living room so they can keep an eye on the whereabouts of the youngins. I don't really agree with spending all your time playing EQ if you have small kids, but it's not for me to say how much time in Norrath is too much. I won't parent someone elses children, but for fuckssake, there is a difference between being a neglectful parent and a GROSSLY NEGLIGENT one. Neglectful = &quot;Mommy didnt hug me enough as a child, but I was fed, clothed, and made it to school&quot;. Grossly negligent = Being locked in a car and being dead.<br>
<br>
EQ itself is not the problem, its a symptom. If EQ were non-existant, these parents would play DAOC, or Asherons call, or any of a billion other games out there right now. If it werent an MMORPG it would be a chat room thingy one. If that were outlawed too, it would be just a chatroom. If it werent a chatroom, it would be a bar. If it werent a bar, it would be a guy upstairs in the bedroom. <br>
<br>
I used to be addicted to EQ to the point where I wouldn't leave the house, wouldn't eat, wouldnt pull myself away from the computer to visit the lil necro's room. Id go far too long between showers. Id never answer the phone, told my mother and roomates to screw off.. etc. You bet your ass my cat was well fed and when I heard a loud noise from the other room, or things were suspisciously quiet I would go and investigate. I know my cat is not a child, but in every regard, a child is MORE than my cat, and if I, the stereotypical addict (at the time) could tear myself from the screen for a four footed fluffy companion, then I feel I can go out on a limb here and say that that mother had deeper seeded issues than EQ. Issues that involved not caring where her child was. Issues with being a mother. Issues with life on earth, not life in Norrath.<br>
<br>
EQ is not to blame, no matter what a world that loves to scapegoat corporations and shirk off any personal responsibility tells you. <br>
