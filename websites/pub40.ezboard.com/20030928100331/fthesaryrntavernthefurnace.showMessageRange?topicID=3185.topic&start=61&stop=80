The interesting part of any of this is really that story on the other thread about the guy who gave his guildmate a job, (doing what is never really explained), and stock options, and then took the stock options back, resulting in much trauma.<br>

I think there's a wealth of material there, that is what I want to hear about.<br>

&quot;Who cares what some geeks that play a computer game think of you&quot;<br>
<br>
That was good advice, usually I follow it.  Excpetion being those few times I remind myself that there's a human being on the other end of any screen name.  Then I get myself burnt and remember not to give @#%$.  <br>
<br>
Fact is even though I think you are quite honestly a bitch I still have respect for you.  Sadly your the only person on this shithole of a server that I have an ounce of respect for...oh.. well besides Bethene.  I respect both you guys.<br>
<br>
Its objective.. and I know neither of you give a @#%$ what I think or if I respect you or not.  Both of you @#%$ talked me in the past (who the @#%$ hasn't.. people after all are heard animals) and found my plight amusing here.  Thats cool though.  Your both more decent then your fellow Saryrn citizens.    <br>
<br>
The other flame thread Meak has going is insightful.  Yes Meak is indeed the real expert on drugs here I believe and on Rage culture.  I suppose thats something lol.  Sad actually.    <br>
<br>
As always I call it like I see it.  This server is quite a romper room.  With that children I leave you to yoursleves.  I'll be back here eventually to entertain some more.<br>
<br>
Take care.<br>

<br>
I read the other thread that was posted, it it's like verbatium the same guild crap from Rthen's guild here on Saryrn.  Not one scrap of new material, just the same crap.<br>
<br>
Rthen's a masochist.  He enjoys being put down, he's some symbol of what good, decent, mentally healthy men should be and relishes all this negative attention because he thinks it makes him some kind of heroic martyr.<br>
<br>
He thinks all people who play eq are &quot;kids&quot;, and friends in eq are really just cybering.<br>
<br>
He thinks all eq women are either gay men (kids) looking to dupe &quot;real&quot; men into cybering with them, or they are all old, fat, ugly divorced women looking for kids to cyber with because they are too depraved to get men in rl.<br>
<br>
He thinks uberdom is related to your guild, or your gear, or who's ass you kiss.  Skill is not a concept he has ever considered.<br>
<br>
He thinks he's the most conspired against person in eq, as if all the evil &quot;kids&quot; are drawn to this game to insult him, to deprive him of respect, and gear, and opportunities that his skill alone cannot gain him.<br>
<br>
Anything bad that happens around him, is someone elses fault.<br>
<br>
Anything good that happens around him, is because someone kissed ass, or has mindlessly joined the &quot;band wagon&quot; of conformity.<br>
<br>
He doesn't care what you think, but he'll reply to every post about him, and liberally sprinkle doses of insults to make sure you keep posting so he can keep getting his fix of martyrdom.<br>
<br>
Rthen has no friends.  To him there are only two types of &quot;kids&quot;  those who have conspired against him, and those that haven't sprung their conspiracy on him. But in the end, EVERYONE is out to get him.<br>
<br>
If you don't know him, and chat friendly with him, he'll tell you all about his fridged wife, and the persistant fantasies he's been haveing about his cat.  Then he'll just suddenly stop, and 10-15 minutes later his wife will tell you that Rthen's pasted out at the key board again, and she's gateing him out to log him out.<br>
<br>
He's predictable if nothing else.<br>
Let's just hope that doesn't mean he's coming back here to join his necro again.  =/<br>

Novbre,<br>
<br>
You are one of the most self centered, minulplitive, &quot;evil&quot; people I have ever encountered in this game.  You disgust me.  Everything you say is clearly half truths and conjectures developed to further throw dirt on me.<br>
<br>
You are also one of the most bitter people I know.  You have always blamed other people in this game for your inability to progress as far as you would have liked.<br>
<br>
You blame eveyone for the fact you feel casters get screwed on help and on loot.  You blame males in general for a varity of your real life issues.  You need some mental help.  I hope you got some.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Rthen's a masochist. He enjoys being put down, he's some symbol of what good, decent, mentally healthy men should be and relishes all this negative attention because he thinks it makes him some kind of heroic martyr.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually thats far from true.  I made numeorus attempts to reconcile my differencs with the popular players and leaders of this server.  I was denied the chance on each attempt.  I was blacklisted, and the members of any guild I tried to start came to the guild looking for reasons why I was not the &quot;perfect player&quot; and why I was so hated.  This only caused problems for me and for the guild.<br>
<br>
Yes, I challanged the server in regards to being ordered to deguild someone without proof in the first small guild I tried to run here years ago.  They were acused of ninjaing a item in KC.  I tried to stick up for what I thought was fair and right and the result was a tremdous mess that still continues to this day.  Mostly because I refuse to change my screenname on the boards.  I REFUSE to be bullied into that.<br>
<br>
&quot;He thinks all people who play eq are &quot;kids&quot;, and friends in eq are really just cybering.&quot;<br>
<br>
No.. you are the one thats cybering underaged males.  The vast majority of people playing this game are younger then I am.. therefore I suppose I should expect this highschool like bull @#%$.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He thinks all eq women are either gay men (kids) looking to dupe &quot;real&quot; men into cybering with them,&quot;<br>
<br>
Very few female characters are played by real life females this is just a fact.  As for the males trying to cyber eachother I never said any such thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; or they are all old, fat, ugly divorced women looking for kids to cyber with because they are too depraved to get men in rl.&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you talking about yourself?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He thinks uberdom is related to your guild, or your gear, or who's ass you kiss. Skill is not a concept he has ever considered.&quot;<br>
<br>
On this server its all about who's as syour kissing.  You should know that by now.  Skill?  No one cares, and besides this game is not that hard to learn.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He thinks he's the most conspired against person in eq, as if all the evil &quot;kids&quot; are drawn to this game to insult him, to deprive him of respect, and gear, and opportunities that his skill alone cannot gain him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually your close to the truth here.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything bad that happens around him, is someone elses fault.&quot;<br>
<br>
No.. that is your view on the world.. not mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He doesn't care what you think, but he'll reply to every post about him, and liberally sprinkle doses of insults to make sure you keep posting so he can keep getting his fix of martyrdom.&quot;<br>
<br>
I refuse to back down to the a holes here or on any server.  I tend to stick up for myself.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Rthen has no friends. To him there are only two types of &quot;kids&quot; those who have conspired against him, and those that haven't sprung their conspiracy on him. But in the end, EVERYONE is out to get him.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have no friends on Saryrn.  The friends I have might be few but I can count on them.  I don't believe in maintaining &quot;fake&quot; friends.  I believe in real people.. real friends.. no 'fair weather&quot; a holes that are here for a meal or a beer.. or for what they can get out of me only.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't know him, and chat friendly with him, he'll tell you all about his fridged wife,&quot;<br>
<br>
This part is true.  She's not into sex and I tend to share things with people I think are my close friends in the game.  Well I used to.. I learned after my experiences on this server to share nothing with people online.  They will use it aginst you later.<br>
<br>
I could go into the crap you shared with me but 2 wrongs here defintly won't make a right now will it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;and the persistant fantasies he's been haveing about his cat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats a lie, it is also rather disgusting.  I did make the reference that my pet was a better compainion, which to be honest is correct.  However in regards to sex I can assure you I have no problems finsing attractive human females to have sex with if I wished to.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Then he'll just suddenly stop, and 10-15 minutes later his wife will tell you that Rthen's pasted out at the key board again, and she's gateing him out to log him out.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can remember 1 time that that happened, we had friends over and were all quite drunk.  So 1 time in what 50 some raids?  Grow up child.. grownups drink.  Fact is I used to drink a lot.<br>
<br>
You don't like that?  Too f ing bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He's predictable if nothing else.<br>
Let's just hope that doesn't mean he's coming back here to join his necro again. =/&quot;<br>
<br>
I play my necro, I am in a guild. One day before the servers go down you might actually learn who I am.  I will say this.. it amuses me to see how just plain mean spirited and cruel you have continued to be.  Its not just my opinion.  People do talk.<br>
<br>
Have a wonderful day now.<br>

Tsk tsk, you really should get your facts straight before you try and distort them to suit your purpose.  I left OOP with quite a bit of unspent DKP.  Hardly the MO of a lootwhore.

See, you brought it back to cybering again.<br>
<br>
I didn't &quot;stay&quot; in OOP.  I left for about a month.  Worked out a compromise of sorts with Adayven, and re-applied with OOP.  Nothing mystical or underhanded about it.  It's pretty upfront.  If I get back into OOP as a full member it's not because I kiss a$$ or cybered with anyone, it's because I can put in long hours and raid I full time.

One day you will realize it is really yourself you should blame for all your EQ &quot;hardships&quot;.  I blame myself for simply not leaving Saryrn sooner.  I blame no one here for the drama and bullshit.  They were here first I should have just left.<br>

I struck a nerve in my last post.  The fact your name comes up in casual conversation with people I do still speak to on Saryrn amuses me to no end.  I don't even have to mention it first and I do not.. because quite honestly I don't care.<br>
<br>
I only bring it up here in the soap oprea fourm because you started flaming me again out of the blue.<br>
<br>
Have I even mentioned your cursed name or refered to you on any of my posts until you come along with a flame?  Nope.<br>
<br>
You are the one who won't leave me the @#%$ alone.  Also.. you should know that there ae other people who think very poorly of you on Saryrn.  This based on your personality, actions, and general behavior toward other people.  That has nothing to do with me.<br>
<br>
If you have a desire to flame me constantly whenever you have the chance I will remind you of that also every time you do.<br>

I was warned when we created a guild way back seems like years ago about you and your friends.  I did not take the warning to heart and I got myself burned.  Somone in your camp of party pals decided to take the harrassment to the real world.<br>

I am fairly certain I know who it is (player screen anme).  I won't post real life info here though (I know the person who was responsible.. as in rl name).  Needless to say that person won't admit to it either, their too embarrised that they were caught.<br>

Bump it.<br>
<br>
I call out loot whores and jerks.. on a few servers, though on especially this one folks like that are welcomed with open arms.<br>
<br>
While you are bumping it take a look in the mirror and think on the fact that you actually ninjaed a piece of gear years ago and somehow still are here on Saryrn.  While.. my downfall was asking the community for more proof before deguilding a member of a small guild I ran clost to 3 years ago. He was acused to Ninjaing gear, turns out the community was right however noone was interested in providing logs or proof.  They threw a lot of insults my way even before I had a chance to try to understand the situation.  I was new to the server, my mage was only a half serious effort here.  I focused on levels not raids.  I should have taken that as a warning concerning the type of people here and moved my mage to nameless ASAP.<br>
<br>
This community sure is kinda screwed up.  <br>
