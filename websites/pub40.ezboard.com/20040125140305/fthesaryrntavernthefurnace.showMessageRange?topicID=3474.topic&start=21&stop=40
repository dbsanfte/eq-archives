It hurts my brain to continously formulate reasonable arguments only to have them fire back with some kind of witless one-liner like that and consider the discussion over. <br>
<br>
Instead I've decided that the appropriate argument is not pro-marijuana but rather anti-alcohol. Other than the money the industry rakes in via the sale of a admittedly addictive substance, I've yet to find anyone anywhere who can give me a legitimate reason why it's legal to consume something that can be directly associated with more than 40% of all vehicle related injuries in the US, half of all violent crimes and the death of one person every 30 minutes.<br>

<br>
Look at is this way<br>
<br>
Driving under the influence of Alcohol will get you a hefty fine and depending on the level of the of the Blood alochol.. revokation of your license.<br>
<br>
Just carrying 1 joint on you is considered a minor misdemeanor.  <br>
<br>
See something wrong with that?<br>
<br>
For something so damn illegal.. you can only get a misdemeanor for having one on you.. but yet if you have an open beer on you its a hefty fine and your license might get taken away. ( like i said, if your blood alcohol comes out high )<br>
<br>
Legalize the shit,  tax it.. control the influx.. BAM.  no more national debt.  give the stuff the usual sin tax.  Make a quarter cost as much as a pack of cigarettes... it will be so cheap and common that people wont do it as much because its readily available.<br>
<br>
Granted the current laws should still be in effect.  Make driving under the influence of Marijauna just as punishable as alcohol.<br>
<br>
Drug testing for Careers - hell yes.  I wouldnt want some half-wit to drop 1000lbs of steel drums on my head because he thinks its funny to do circles in the forklift.<br>
<br>
Drugs out of schools.  Yes.. make it just like alcohol.  18 or 21 and up.  License Revoked if you are caught underage in possession or buying.  <br>
<br>
It can be done.  Noone in the government wants to admit that they have been wrong all this time by literally throwing away our hard earned money so that Columbian drug lords think of new and inventive ways to get dope into the country.<br>
<br>
On a final note. lets think about this.<br>
<br>
lets say the sin tax on a quarter of marijauna is $.50<br>
so thats $2.00 per ounce.  $32 a pound.  <br>
<br>
now lets say every month 100,000 pounds of marijauna is shipped in.  thats 3.2 million dollars a month for the government .  averaging out to $42 million dollars a year in money the government can have.  Thats just on 100,000lb average.. could be more.. could be less.  And they could put a bigger sin tax on the stuff. <br>
<br>
In closing,  all i can say is that the government has gone about the war on drugs the WRONG way.  If they wanted to win and break the cartels.. legalize it.. it will become so common-place in no time that the risk vs reward for smuggling the stuff in wont be worth it anymore.<br>

This paragraph -- and its implication that people drive drunk because they enjoy driving drunk -- is some of the worst logic ever visited upon this poor, poor furnace.<br>
If, as Jangral claims, they really aim to drive as poorly as possible, one wonder why aren't already driving stoned.  Surely the legality can't be a barrier, since pot is easy to find and their eagerness to drive drunk proves they have no fear of the law.<br>
If alcohol were replaced overnight with pot, I would theorize that there would be less accidents relating to DUI, and if don't understand this, you've probably never smoked pot.  Marijuana knocks you on your ass compared to a beer (which is ultimately why I don't like it -- I'm too much of a control freak to give up my ego so easily.  Though it would probably be healthy for me, psychologically, to do so).  A great many people cited for DUI don't realize that they're above the legal limit, and a great many people in DUI-related accidents thought that they &quot;felt fine&quot; and would be able to drive normally.  I would expect these sorts of mistakes to be more rare while using pot.  Plus, it would mean I would have to get off this fucking couch.  And... uh... the couch.  Pass the salsa.<br>

<br>

<br>
Amen...which is pretty much the argument that illustrates why pot should never be legalized; minus the violence part since it's pretty widely acknowledged that people who are high don't get violent like alot of drunks. The point remains, however, that facilitating peoples' ability to use a narcotic substance while driving is insane no matter what spin you try to put on it. <p>Jangral<br>

People drive drunk because they enjoy getting drunk, and they aren't responsible enough to not drive afterwards. As far as being too &quot;knocked on your ass&quot; to even attempt to drive, you would be shocked at the number of drunk drivers who are so far above the legal limit that they can't even manage to stand upright, yet they still manage to get behind the wheel of their car. <br>
<br>
And yes, the legality is a barrier, since you can drink openly with other people in a public place like a restaurant or a bar, and until you start your car and put it in gear you haven't broken a single law. It's socially acceptable because it's legal and convenient to go have a few drinks with people after work or whatever. The issue is accessability to the substance, and regardless of how easy you say it is to get marijuana, the fact remains that unless you can go grab a dimebag off the shelf of a convenience store, it's still a hell of a lot harder to get pot than to get alcohol, simply because it is illegal. And in my book, that's a good thing. <br>
<br>
As it's been said, there's really no use arguing further on this, as most peoples' opinions are set in concrete. If you want to live in a world where narcotics are MORE accessible to the average person, then like I said before; it's your funeral... <p>Jangral<br>

Ok, now we're communicating.  But if I enjoy getting drunk, why does it follow that I enjoy getting stoned?  As you say, people enjoy getting drunk; they will continue to enjoy getting drunk.  And the availability of pot does not affect pre-existing alcohol dependency.<br>
If there is no causal link -- i.e., you acknowledge that enjoyment of drink and enjoyment of pot are independent decisions and/or dependencies -- than arguments of the form &quot;how much easier&quot; (as in: &quot;all the alcoholics who drink every day...how much easier it would be to just smoke one little joint&quot;) make no sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3329<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/15/03 11:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3474.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: war on drus = failure</span><hr size=1> Ideally, there would be an efficient way to attack demand.  Since demand on marijuana is highly inelastic, lowering demand would be the only solution that would make a positive difference.  Attacking supply just raises the price, adding more profits to be made in the dealing business, without lowering use much.  Legalization would lower the price, and wouldn't cause that much more use of the drug, but that's not really accomplishing much either.  Lowering demand would reduse the number of people using and the price/profits would fall as well. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Most people I know do make an effort to have a designated driver when going out for social drinking.  There are, of course, the few idiots who think they're too strong for something as silly as alcohol to impair their driving, but those people are already idiots and dangerous pretty much by being in the car, sober or not.<br>
<br>
I have yet to meet anyone who smokes pot and is ashamed of it.  I don't actually <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> how much pot impairs your judgement, and unlike most people in this thread, and on the blast furnace in general, I won't pretend I do, but I would imagine the average pot-smoker would know they smoked too much, and have a buddy drive them home.<br>
<br>
People who have more experience with pot-smoking are more than welcome to offer their opinions, but as someone who drinks, sees other drinkers, and does, on occasion, go out drinking socially, and who does know a handful of pot-smokers, I'd really have to guess that a drinker is far more likely to put himself in a dangerous situation than a smoker.  I've never seen a rowdy high person.  I've never seen a surly or mean high person.  But maybe it's just my experience, and those opponents of legalization can give examples where they've seen otherwise.<br>
<br>
I mean, I'd rather have pot legal than alcohol.  Pot isn't physically addictive, I'm pretty sure it doesn't cause hangovers and other &quot;inconveniences&quot; alcohol can, and a smoker is a lot more likely to sit on his ass where is and not bother anyone than a drinker is.  Sure, I'd be pissed I couldn't drink anymore, but I don't really need to, and society would improve as a whole.<br>
<br>
I would suspect that a lot of the right-wing people, like Pecc, only know a couple of hippie losers he happened to see high by accident, and draw their opinions based on that.  I would imagine if any of his friends smoked pot, they wouldn't bother telling him because of the kind of person he is, and get together and have a good time without him.  I would further guess that he probably has friends, based on his beliefs, tone, and attitude, that are the kind of people to drink themselves stupid while alone, who have problems, won't get help, and drive and operate heavy machinery while intoxicated.<br>
<br>
A heavy drinker hides his habit from the world.  A heavy smoker lets everyone know about it.  That should tell you something about the psychology of both groups and which is less threatening.<br>
