I have read alot and been thinking about the Bard's role post-expansion, and unfortunately I have reached the conclusion that we are not much needed anymore. Will try to make my points clear here. I will use a normal group of 6 people here and not consider major raids until towards the end.<br>
<br>
Damage output: Bards have very low damage output and this is well known. We used to be allowed into groups because of reduction of downtime, but with spells like Harvest and Clarity 2 I can not see the justification of giving the spot to a Bard and not a different class. A Monk for damage output would probably save the mana the Clarity song gives by killing the mob faster. <br>
<br>
Crowd control: Enchanters hands down. If you have a good Enchanter in your group I would have given the spot to a damage dealer instead of a Bard 100% of the times. Bard is (unfortunately) a poor second here, and after witnessing some other classes do crowd control I am not sure we are even second. Druids and Enchanters can charm, Pallys can stun, Wizards can root (which I have seen done with awesome effectiveness) etc.<br>
<br>
Reducing downtime: Get a damage dealer instead and kill the mobs faster = Saved mana = Less downtime.<br>
<br>
Effectiveness of Bards: Instruments are to a large extent our weapons, yet there are very few powerful weapons in the game. After the nerfing of the dragons even these weapons have been more or less taken from highlevel Bards. <br>
<br>
Bard buff songs: Except for ressist songs for raids the buff songs add fairly low numbers to the stats. Definitely a poor trade-off for a high-damage output class (or even other classes for buffs).<br>
<br>
&quot;Speciality&quot;: Wizards got Ice Comet. Warriors got Crits and Crips. Rogues got Backstabb. SKs got HT. Most other classes got a way to have an &quot;impact&quot; on a mob fast when needed. Bard is the worse class to have if you need to drop a mob fast.<br>
<br>
Running: Bards used to be the best class to have for travelling fast across zones. With the new Kunark zones this is close to impossible because of the hills, trees etc. SoW beats our songs hands down here, way too easy to get out of song reach, lost etc.<br>
<br>
The way I see it Bards have in fact outplayed their role, and it is sad to say that if I put a group together I would hardly have a Bard high on my list.. This is not meant to be a whining post begging for a change of the Bard, I am simply looking for inputs and ideas so I get motivated to start playing the Bard again. I am sure there are more points to make here, but this is what I could remember right now.<br>

<br>
It depends.  A lot of groups don't have every class they need.  There really aren't that many enchanters floating around so we will always have a place due to the fact that groups need hastes, need crowd control, need mana regen and need speed debuffs on mobs.<br>
<br>
Even with an enchanter in a group bards are still very useful:<br>
<br>
Our attack speed debuffs are AE so they hit ALL attacking creatures, thus dramatically reducing the dmg done to the party.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Haste item + any haste spell/song = max haste</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so often, especially at higher levels, bardic haste is just as good as any enchanter haste.  Thus saving the enchanter some mana if there is even one in the group.  <br>
<br>
Manasong stacks with ClarityII.<br>
<br>
Our regen spells, especially over 50th, are not to be forgotten.  Getting 50hp/tic regen is no slouch.  NiV's + Cantana is a pretty nice stack of songs during downtime.<br>
<br>
Resists?  Nobody beats bard resists.  (limited use)<br>
<br>
But, are we a 2nd rate class?  Yes.  Are we useless?  No.<br>
<br>
The toughest thing about bards is that we are the single most missunderstood class in the game.  We make up maybe 2% of the population, even Verant doesn't understand how bards really work.  Hell, most BARDS don't know how bards work best.  There are some amazingly good bards out there but, unfortunately, they are few and far between compared to the massive rash of players who don't understand their class.  Because of that few people get to group with good bards until MUCH later in life.  So they don't really appreciate us beyond our manasong.<br>
<br>
Bard:  2nd, maybe even 3rd best at everything<br>
Bard:  Single most powerful Downtime Reducer in the game, hands down.<br>
<br>
I've had clerics comment:  &quot;Jesus, since you joined the group I haven't had to heal at all!&quot;  Or &quot;I'm using 1/3 the mana I normally do!  WOW!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Classic example:<br>
Group at Frenzy camp:<br>
Cleric <br>
Bard<br>
Pally<br>
Pally<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
Cleric said he had to leave.  At this point the whole group was ready to up and quit because &quot;We can't hold it without a cleric&quot;.  Well we tried it anyway because right after the cleric left the frenzy spawned.<br>
<br>
I went all instrument, played HoR, Manasong, Binding (not chains)<br>
(4 song twist: HOR, MANA, Bind, MANA, HOR, MANA etc)<br>
<br>
Druid snared and handled healing<br>
<br>
We ended the fight with the druid at 25% mana, got an FBSS and the tanks both at 50% health.  LOH was not used.<br>
<br>
In other words, we held frenzy without a cleric with a 4 person group.  I strongly feel that if I hadn't been there they'd have died horribly.  In fact, I heard later, that another group tried to do it with Shaman, Pally, Pally, Druid and couldn't hold the spawn.  <br>
<br>
Bards are not a &quot;key&quot; class.  But a bard in a well rounded group of 5 will often make that group more effective than adding 1 person of almost any other class.  And adding a bard to an un-balanced group will often balance it and allow it to do the things it couldn't have without one.<br>

In these events it is very hard to justify the choice of a Bard over most other classes, since the Bard songs only hit a limited number of targets (friendly as in his group only) while other buffs can be done on everyone prior to fighting (Bard songs only last while they are played and on group only). <br>
<br>
I agree that Bards are misunderstood by most people and that there are some clueless Bards around, but I still wish we were more useful at higher levels. I would LOVE to get ONE way to have a direct impact on a fight like most other classes have, maybe a song that does a huge amount of damage to a mob, drains your own hitpoints and puts you on top of the agro list for good (ergo kill or be killed). <br>
<br>

To be honest the only folks that have a &quot;real&quot; impact in those situations are clerics and tanks.  The best way to use a bard in a raid of that type is as a manapump for a caster group or a haste/resist/heal pump for a tank group.<br>
<br>
We do have a couple 'KO' songs like Denons Desperate Dirge and the Bellow Upgrade at ?55? but I agree they aren't all that impressive.  Then again, our class has always been about subtlety.  Not sure but I'm still very happy as a Bard.  Are we as powerful as other classes in certain situations?  No.  Are we far more powerful than them in other situations?  Yeah.  Overall I'm happy with my bard.  My RANGER, on the other hand... god I wasted a lot of time on him.  I really wish Verant would get a clue on Hybrids.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I both agree and disagree.  We aren't all that effective in huge raids unless there are several of us (1 for each group) and there are certainly other methods of doing raids besides using us.  But I wouldn't call us 'useless'.  My guild was in Hate last night and I felt very useful to my group.  <br>
<br>
Maybe what you're suffering from is &quot;Bored Bard Syndrome&quot; or &quot;BBS&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   IE:  When in raids we generally have 2 or 3 songs we ALWAYS play and that's about it.
