Living so close to sea, the smell of the salty water had permeated everything within. It was a smell that most Erudites didn't mind, Ayebeehm on the other hand didn't much care for it. <br>
<br>
During his schooling in the arcane arts, he learned a great many things. His chosen profession that of an illusionist. He was at the top of his class and had several benefactors interested in his further education.<br>
<br>
Ayebeehm was a prankster at heart, and this is why the enchanter loved his profession so much. Often he would scare the other erudites pale, which was no easy feat. He'd simply wait for them to walk through a door, him behind it of course, and wait for them to leave themselves off guard. He would change into an Ogre or Troll and slowly walk up behind them and say, "Boo!" theyd turn around, see an ogre standing there and lose it. It was a great ability he had and he intended to use it whenever possible.<br>
<br>
It was the dawn of his sixteenth birthday when his mother and father both came to Ayebeehm. Sitting at the table eating a maginificent breakfast, one he noted his mother hadn't prepared for at least 4 years, they spoke to him. His father said, "How are your studies coming along at the college son?" in answer he replied, "Father, I have mastered all of what the college has to offer, I am finding myself bored with it and would like to move on." His father rubbed his temples and offered, "What do you plan to do with yourself? If it is true that the college has nothing more to offer you, where will you learn? Where have you sought to go to further your education?" Ayebeehm's mother sat at the other side of the table silent through the whole conversation. "I plan to go out into the world myself being my own teacher. I will seek out others of my profession and learn what they might have to teach, and in payment teach them what I know. It will be good to get away from the sea for a change. I grow tired of Erudin, I seek adventure and excitement." With that statement his mother began to cry, and his father grew angry. His father exclaimed, "If that is how you feel about Erudin, perhaps you do not belong here. Perhaps it is your destiny to go out and die foolishly at the hands of some ravenous creature. So be it, I dismiss you to your fate, and dismiss you as my son."<br>
<br>
What had Ayebeehm done that was so wrong? He just wanted to follow in the footsteps of many other erudian heroes. Walk out and embrace the land, come back with tales of victory, if he ever came back. Heroes weren't made by sitting behind a desk reading a book, you had to do something. That's what Ayebeehm intended on doing. <br>
<br>
After his fathers' last statement, he concentrated and with a wave of his hand his fathers eyes glazed over. He approached his mother and said, "Please understand mother, I can't have father upset over this ordeal. Know that I love you and him very much, and from the bottom of my heart I wish the both of you well. When I leave, he will only remember that I have gone, not his rage, not his dissappointment. To his knowledge he will have given me consent to leave, that is all." He then kissed his mother n the forhead, gave her a hug and went to his room.<br>
<br>
Ayebeehm's room was a sight to behold. Everything neatly in place, several trinkets here and there, two walls were book cases all filled to the max, a desk next to the window with a quill and parchment ready, and a light that seemed to come from the walls themselves illuminating the room. He went through his belongings and decicively picked out what he would take with him on his journey. He grabbed his robe, his spellbook, all the platinum and gold he had saved, his fathers staff and a few canteens of water and a few loaves of bread. He bid his mother farewell, closed the door behind him and snapped his fingers. HIs father came to the door, waved at him and bid him safe travels, all the while his mother was crying.<br>
<br>
Ayebeehm didn't wave back. He kept walking toward the docks that would take him away from Erudin, away from idiotic believers in Prexus and Quellious, and away from the saltwater smell. He walked onto the transferrance platform, had smalltalk with the guard and waited on the boats arrival.<br>
<br>
The boat arrived, hardly what Ayebeehm would call luxurious, and he stepped on. The decks were clean but riddled with age, the boat creaked and moaned protesting it's continued use. He found a place at the aft of the boat where noone was at and pulled out his spellbook. Here was where he would prepare. Opening his spellbook, he arranged the pages as he saw fit. Combat spells would be the very thing for him to center on. He would need quick access to these spells should he need them, and Ayebeehm always like to be prepared for anything. He memorized the incantation for human form. He memorized his damage spells. He memorized his mind controlling spells. He was ready. For the rest of the trip he meditated to rest for the travels that would partake in once the boat docked.<br>
<br>
Upon arrival in South Qeynos, he stepped onto the dock and began to look for a secluded place so he could cast himself into human form. Beneath the docks would probably be the best place for this, and that is where he went. He cast the spell, his image shimmered in the light of the sun and he was human. It didn't feel that much different from being an erudite, save being a few inches shorter. That didn't bother him, he grew tired of bumping his head into things anyway. He set out for the arcane district of Qeynos. He needed to stock his supplies for the long journey ahead of him. He purchased maps, his magical supplies, and more food and water. <br>
<br>
Ayebeehm set out the north gate of Qeynos and off to his adventure, ignoring the children battling furiously with the rats and beetles. His adventure begins, his old life ends and the story will continue in the books of history.<br>
<br>
To be continued...<br>
