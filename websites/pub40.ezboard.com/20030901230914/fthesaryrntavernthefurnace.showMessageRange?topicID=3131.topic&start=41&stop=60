<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You forced a confrontation and didnt offer a viable solution other than a race and breaking our mes's and forcing both guilds to wipe.

<br>
Why is it that so many people in OoP seem to believe that no one in our guild had been talking to an OoP officer?  I agree wholly that the entire incident was stupid, but at the same time, I believe nothing of this &quot;we weren't stalling&quot; argument.  You have a slew of precedents set from Luclin for sitting on your ass in the way of a mob waiting for more to log on when we were ready to engage a mob.  Ainian told Nanan that if you were, in fact, ready to go, then go ahead and pull the trigger mobs and start the event.  I know my guild should have massed in Tactics at 7:30 EST, and when I got online at about 7:50 EST, you still weren't ready to go.  In fact, after 8 EST, Nanan sent Ainian a tell after I got on saying, &quot;We have force now.  Gate.&quot;  Are you honestly going to tell me I should respect 47 people as sufficient force for you to get going when you choke and fail with 70s?  Half an hour isn't enough to get the two stupid trigger mobs together?<br>
<br>
It's not like you had 70 people to begin with and HnE moved up and took the other mob without any communication with OoP.  That was not even remotely the situation.  I agree with you that communication resolves things, but when it looks like you're pulling the ol' sit in Emp's prep room nonsense, our contact is an officer who says he can't control his guildmates, and we feel like we're being jerked around by a guild that isn't ready to engage a mob we are prepared for, what do you think is going to happen?  You know, Spyryt, I understand it takes practice to get things down, but I also know that if you really had enough people to get going at 7:30 when we arrived, by the time I got online and joined the guild, you should have had both mobs at least together.  If you die too much trying to clear, or you have problems getting them together after about 15 minutes, that really isn't supportive of saying you had enough to begin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now just please do us all a favor and sit back a second and realize what really happened last night and both sides do it different next time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I will make it clear here, and I will make it clear to Antryg, I am not going through Luclin again with being told you have force first and then seeing you not engage the contested mob for the next 3 hours.  If I could be sure that when an OoP officer tells me you have force and are close to engagement that you actually will engage the mob / start the event within a half hour or so, it would really help resolving conflicts in the future.<br>
<br>
Gallaorn :<br>
<br>
Oh Gallaorn, how did I know you would once again add your commentary despite not having been at the incident?  How did I know you could not help but open your mouth and prove, once again, that you can be so stupid even the guild you defend mocks you?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You have shown zero respect for OOP and made very clear you despise them but you expect hudge amount of respect from them in return. It doesnt take a genius to see this just doesnt work.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm curious, can you in any way demonstrate how I've made it clear that HnE as a whole despises OoP?  I mean, I'm no genius, but I don't see it.  Most of OoP doesn't see it.  Hell most people with even a third-grade or above literacy level (read : not you) don't see it.  So please, post quotes and show how the leadership hates OoP sooooo much.  See if you can try this whacky idea of &quot;supporting your claim&quot; for once.<br>
<br>
edit -- Just for you Gallaorn, I will save you the disgrace of trying to say I confuse the singular and plural versions of you in your post.  I, and the officers, decide how HnE reacts to OoP.  Consequently, only hatred <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> show would affect what our guild does, not the rambling of a few ninnies.  Unlike OoP, when I say our guild is going elsewhere, we go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Let me help you : &quot;HnE slammed OoP's Bertox kill.&quot;  No, the officers in HnE asked why camping people down to Bertox was tolerated.  If nothing else, I know that I at no point claimed it was their only reason for victory, and since I more or less decide what HnE does, I'm not sure how that supports your arguments or claims.  I'm sure some idiots in the guild said ignorant things, but much like my opinion of OoP as a whole is unaffected by your inane drivel, I assume that the intelligent people in OoP ignore the banterings of idiot HnE people.<br>
<br>
Oh I know... it must have been rotating Emp.  Or almost entirely avoiding VT when OoP reached it.  Or not killing mobs just to prevent their progress (there were other gods other than RZ, dipshit).  Clearly the vehemence is obvious!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You wanna know why people lost respect for you and your guild? Look in the mirror that where most of the blame is to be place. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, I don't want to know, because I don't believe &quot;people&quot;, in general, have lost respect for me or my guild.  I'm sure a few have, but not only are they insignificant, they have to be ignorant, delusional, illiterate retards to lose respect for someone who has, in my humble opinion, a pretty damn good track record of working for fair resolutions.<br>

I find it amazing that roughly 150 people could all be in one zone for that amount of time dealing with such utter bs and not get bored and go watch television, but then again, the ways of the mighty and the strong are well beyond my ken.<br>
<br>
Also, in my circle, we have always practiced the &quot;let HnE and/or OOP do what it wants and laugh at who they recruit&quot; method of zen. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne K'harmicdeva, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valieneq>ValienEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(2/19/03 12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3131.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Funny</span><hr size=1> I was thinking to myself &quot;all this thread is missing is a Vainne UBER R BAD&quot; reply.<br>

<br>
It is a kneejerk reaction, sorry to be so predictable.<br>
<br>
Actually I thought about just diverting the thread with a long list of fake grieviances against both guilds, but I thought that would be politically unsound. Then I thought maybe a nice song quote from the Carpenters, or a lament about good people arguing over stupid things...or doing bad things...but then I thought more and realized I didnt really care.<br>
<br>
So, I threw in one vaguely veiled insinuation related to One specific instance and my old chestnut--the critique of the mighty...<br>
<br>
But mostly, seriously I am just watching with the popcorn.<br>

I wasnt there last night, in fact i left OOP and play only rarely now. I wasnt addressing the specific of your current dispute with OOP just num how dare you disrespect us discourse which was hilarious considering all the crap you guys thrown OOP way in the past weeks.<br>

Someone once told me that starting juvenile crap on the BF was forbidden because it always lead to bad guild relation  in game. Well i guess that someone was right and need to remember it.<br>
