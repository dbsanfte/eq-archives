The guild we built out of the ashes of the previous ToN kept much of what worked well for our folks, and tossed what didn't. We're different in how we approach the game from most guilds. Our &quot;turnover&quot; is low. Most of our members don't leave... those that do usually come back, as Miriai and Filk eventually did. The consistancy of our membership is one of our &quot;secrets&quot; of success.<br>
<br>
We don't have mandatory raiding. We believe that RL &gt; EQ. We had to build a DKP system that fit our style of guild. ToN has a strong social component. We have members who choose not to raid much, but contribute in other ways. Yet, we manage to be a high-end raiding guild. In my mind, the most impressive thing ToN has achieved is to progress this far, this fast, without losing our core values.<br>
<br>
Are we going to Time? Well, the answer to that is obvious by now. We raid hard, and the quantity of raiding we've done and the challenge of some of our targets (like our repeated Vulak raids) trained many of our people very well. Do we research strategies online? You bet. Our folks have lives, we try not to waste their time. The reason we often win on a first (or early) attempt is the skilled teamwork of our guildmembers as they execute and adjust those strategies.<br>
<br>
We've attracted many very capable members from many sources, including a few from HnE. Our latest recruits came to us cross-server. We're extremely selective about who joins us now, as it's easy to see the heavy raiding we do and miss the importance of the other values we hold. <br>
<br>
I suspect we don't make much sense to the other high-end guilds on this server, but it works for us, and I'm incredibly proud of our progression and what my guildmates have achieved as a team. As for the sour grapes that often appears here, some of you have the wit to be pretty entertaining. To those of you sincerely congratulating us, thank you. We worked really hard for it. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkgreen;font-family:Verdana;font-size:x-small;"><br>

<br>
I dont post offen here, but since my name was mentioned a few times, it got me curious as to what was being said, and now I find myself motivated to ramble on a bit.  Here goes.<br>
<br>
I think a blatantly obvious point is being expressed here with different people putting a couple of very different slants on the facts. <br>
<br>
Facts:  ToN has recruited a few people who have had &quot;prior&quot; experience with some PoP mobs before the rest of the guild was able to experience them.  ToN has Raid Leaders who work hard to understand the nature of the encounters so we can best learn (as a group) how to WIN.  <br>
<br>
ToN's spin:  Researching the encounters as best we can, taking advantage of whatever information we can lay our hands on, using the skills of everyone in our guild, we hope to engage the mobs with the best foreknowledge we can in order to win.   Some of that research comes from talking with others who have been there before.  However, this game is a team game and everyone has to play their part to perfection in order to pull off a win of the size and complexity and duration as Rathe.  Tadd, Miriai and Filk play the roles their classes give them as part of our battle machine and we'd do just as well with or without them.<br>
<br>
Anti-ToN's spin:  Without the presence of Tadd, Miriai and myself, ToN wouldnt be able to learn any encounters, kill any mobs, or otherwise compete. <br>
<br>
Reality is somewhere between those two &quot;spins&quot;.  ToN likes to win and we like to take on challenges and we'll use whatever information we can get our hands on to make it easier to do so.  Our guild likes winning and the rewards that come from such.  Noone ever enters a guild at the level we play at, without having learned something from previous accomplishments.  And to NOT take advantage of past experiences JUST so you can claim some kind of Pristine innocence when you engage a mob, to our minds seems silly.  PoP's been out for over a year.  There are no new encounters anymore, no more firsts to achieve.  Its just about farming gear, and progressing thru flagging so you can Farm More or Better gear.<br>
<br>
Simply put.  Yes ToN takes advantage of the past experiences of Tadd, Miriai, myself AND every other member of TON who hasnt slept walk thru the last year of raiding.  No we dont live in an isolation bubble, or try to play the game like we did. ( we dont get off on that ).  BUT and here's the sticking point for alot of ToN (i think anyway), the point that rubs them raw.  People who imply that w/out the 3 of us, ToN would still be farming HoT for velious armor.  Any successful guilds members will know it takes an awful lot of people working well together to make raids work, and by suggesting its ALL due to 3 ex-hne members demeans the worth of the contributions of everyone else on the team.  I think thats the reason this issue rubs some people raw, and why they might deviate to extremes of ProToN or AntiToN views on the facts.<br>
<br>
My opinion, is that in the general Kharma of life, its better to NOT belittle or demean others accomplishments.<br>
<br>
Changing tact slightly.<br>
<br>
I've played this game since June 2000.  Thats 3 1/2 years.  For over 3 years of that time, i was playing Filk the wizard.  Travelers of Norrath was my first guild because RL friends of mine were in it.  Alot of good and bad times passed under the bridge, and in the end I decided to broaden my horizons and see the world of EQ from the uber side.  <br>
<br>
HnE was looking for wizards to aid them in their battle with the Emperor in Ssra and I had the good fortune to have my first weekend of raiding with HnE, during the weekend they first defeated the Emperor.   I worked hard with HnE during our raids thru VT, Luclin and Pop.  I made alot of friends in HnE, and consider myself fortunate to have been there while we learned PoP together.  From our first Grummus raid to battling Quarm, I was there.  HnE was close to killing Quarm, I believe our best effort was one attempt when he got down to 22% life with a raid force of just over 50 people, when some RL issues forced my absence from EQ for about a month.  During my absence alot of drama played out in HnE, Numnayan (GL) quit, and so did Ainian (RL) among others.  When I started playing again, things just didnt feel the same.  I felt like I had Finished my Wizard.  I had earned upgrades for every gear slot from HnE.  I had every flag,  acquired every AA that meant anything to me,  seen every encounter, and barring a final defeat of Quarm, beaten every mob.  Altho, I've always felt, and others will probly agree with me, that any raid encounter where you can reduce the mob to 25% or even 50% of its life, is an encounter you can win.  So even Quarm felt done.  Filk felt done.<br>
<br>
So I did the honorable thing and retired him.  But I didnt feel like quitting EQ, just my wizard.  Now my SK, Filkinn allows me to experience the game from another perspective.  The role of a raiding SK and a raiding wizard are totally diverse and thus attractive to me.  The wizard is all about efficient, effective, damage.  My SK offen will not even dmg most mobs a raid kills.  I pull and help pace the raid.  I decided to leave HnE and join ToN because there was no place for a young 65 sk in HnE.   No gear, not many aa's to speak of, and a number of very powerful and experienced Sk's in HnE already, left no room there for development of a raiding SK.  Dacronis, Cyrano, Krazaak, and others had those roles filled well.  I should know, i saw them develop and fit into their jobs in HnE.  Part of my motivation I guess.  Dacronis is still my friend and SK mentor.   HnE did what hne does in times of drama.  They reform, regroup, rebuild, and emerge from the trials, stronger than before.  And I moved on to learn the role of a pulling SK with ToN.  I'm grateful to ToN for letting me join their guild with an untried and unproven character, and I continue to learn my role as we play in the elemental planes.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you tho.  Seeing an encounter as a wizard, doesnt Really prepare you in the best manner for seeing an encounter as a SK.  My first try at playing the SK role in the corinav encounter, was ANYthing but spectacular, even tho i'd participated in winning raids Many times.  And dont even get me started on Xegony (in joke).  Or ask my guild about the first time I called a Charge move in PoeB.  <br>
<br>
ok, ramble almost over.  <br>
<br>
I dont know why I went into the personal history stuff. (Shrug)  However I do know I'm having fun with the SK, experiencing the game anew, but I dont enjoy seeing others belittle each other over such trivial hairsplitting.<br>
<br>
Morale of the story?  Play nice and play the game for fun, and try not to belittle others for doing the same.  It was FUN to beat the Rathe council.  NUFF SAID! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3702<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/2/03 1:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3716.topic&index=84>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grats Travelers of Norrath!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;ToN was written off by most folks on this server just before Tose took over as Guild Leader.

<br>
Thanks, Filk. Always the classy one. You said what everyone knew was happening, but were too spineless to admit. I know for a fact, if I joined a guild the first thing I'd do is teach them everything I know. Why struggle, when you don't have to? It's human nature to take the easy way out, and I don't blame you, Miriai, or Tadd at all for doing so.<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, I could care less about the kill -- it doesnt affect me. My only gripe was the blatant, and obvious lies, from some members of ToN.<br>
<br>
I seem to recall me defending ToN, after the RZ kill, saying that the information for THAT particular mob was widely available. The intracacies of The Rathe and Coirnav are not. That information was obtained via ex-HnE, or, as I learned in this thread, Raeven using SEQ. I don't blame ToN for bleeding information out of the ex members of HnE. Hell, I would too! However, please don't try to play the server for fools, and try to lead everyone into believing it didn't happen. It won't fly. And it's stupid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grats on the teamwork required in beating the encounter. There's no doubt he was going to die, it was all down to exucution, and I must say congrats for pulling it off. It's not easy. The information ToN recieved didn't kill the mob for you, it just sped the proccess up. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21593&amp;alt=30620">Marshall Ainian</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I can not and will not speak for other members of ToN but I will say that while I can pretty much give a flying fig what HnE, TWC, Denu of the Star, or [..insert guildname here] thinks of ToN or our raiding methods, I do understand the frustrations of some of my guildmates. <br>
<br>
NOBODY in ToN has EVER implied that having Tadd, Filk, and Miriai as part of our family has had no impact on us or our raiding abilities. This point seems to keep getting missed in all the sarcasm, finger-pointing, and guild-bashing. What I think some people take issue with, as some other posts have noted and obviously been ignored, is the accusation that its is SOLELY BECAUSE OF 3 PEOPLE that ToN has achieved what its achieved. While I give LOADS of credit to those 3 individuals, it is an insult to every other person in ToN who has given their heart and soul at that encounter and every encounter before it to proclaim that we all played no part in besting the Rathe encounter. <br>
<br>
3 people, no matter what experience or gear they have, cannot carry that encounter. It takes a minimum of 12 clerics, a solid core of CCers, a solid core of offtanks, and an amazing pull team to pull that encounter off. I don't care HOW OR WHO the strats came from. I don't care what programs Raevan may or may not have used or if Tose was getting strat info direct from SoE.... the bottom line is, as with virtually every encounter, STRATEGY ONLY GETS YOU SO FAR. In the end, with events as complex as Rathe, its a combination of strategy and skill that gets you the win. You can handfeed the strats to EVERY guild on the server but I can pretty much guarantee that the majority of them will fail, at least for the first few attempts. <br>
<br>
Give credit where credit is due people. We never claimed to develop the strategies. We never claimed that we didn't research the event and figured the entire thing out through endless trial and error. And we certainly never claimed that we are stupid enough to not utilize the knowledge and experience of our membership.  And personally, I think a GOOD raid leader seeks out and obtains as much info as possible to make the encounter a success. That is the point after all isn't it? To win? There aren't anymore first encounters as the game stands today and strats for virtually EVERY event can be found somewhere. Virtually every guild uses info they received from somewhere... whether its from guildmates who have prior experience, hand me down infoz from friends in guilds that have done it, or simple web research. <br>
<br>
Also there have been MANY assumptions put forward here on exactly what kind of strat info we had. If our info was SOOOOO great we wouldn't have failed the first 2 times at it. Unless a guild takes EXACTLY the same force, with EXACTLY the same gear, experience, aa's, etc to an event as the guild they got the strat from, or the strategy WILL need to be tweaked to compensate for the differences.  Which means... YES, we do have brains! We can think for ourselves! We can adapt strategies that best suit OUR guild for encounters! And , *gasp*, we do on occasion find that some strategies don't always work for our particular guild and we develop new ones!!!  LIKE EVERY OTHER GUILD. <br>
<br>
Bottom line here is, you can have the best most specific strats in the world but it takes quality players to pull it off. We're not asking for your pat on the back, or for you to agree with how we choose to raid. But please don't belittle the people that worked sooooo HARD and skillfully during that event because without that skill and dedication.... we would have failed regardless of strategy and where it came from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=serraadarkangel>SerraaDarkangel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/2/03 4:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3716.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grats Travelers of Norrath!</span><hr size=1> omg.... sooo didnt intend for that to become the novel it became.... &gt;&lt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suchossuave>Suchos Suave</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.scithe.com/humor/pug.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/2/03 4:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3716.topic&index=92>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PoeB</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PS: For all those retards that can't smell sarcasm, ignore this post.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ok so everyone not wearing a ToN tag knows that the 3 former HnE members were a HUGE help to winning the rathe.  So why argue it so much?  Why even bring it up.<br>

I'm pretty sure they couldn't have beat the encounter withouot clerics...FUCKING cheaters.<br>
