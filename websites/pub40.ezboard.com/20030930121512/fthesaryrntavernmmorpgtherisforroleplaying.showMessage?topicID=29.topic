Looking at the marker he saw he had two choices, Surefall Glade or the Karanas. Just leaving the city he had no desire to go back to another one, so he took to the direction of the Karanas. The hills around the Qeynos area were quite beautiful. Rising and falling hills covered in green grass, occasionally shale extruded from a hill here and there. Ayebeehm thought to himself a fault line might reside in the area, speculated it's length, activity, last known movements. Such was the inner workings of the mind of an erudite. It helped pass the time while he made his way to the plains, so he didn't mind.<br>
<br>
His mind wandering he didn't notice the snarling wolves following him. It was only untill one lunged at him that he'd even known they were there. Two wolves, both of equal size and looking as if they hadn't eaten for weeks, snarled at him with fangs bared and white froth dripping from their muzzles. Normally he wouldn't think anything of a wolf, they were typically nocturnal hunters, but being in their rabid state they were a trifle bit more dangerous. The braver of the two wolves lunged again at Ayebeehm. Ayebeehm dodged the first lunge and sent out a dazzling spray of colors, stunning both of the wolves and giving him enough time to mesmerize the weaker of the two. He then concentrated his will and charmed the stronger, braver wolf. The wolf was now under his control and was his loyal servant. The odds now being greatly in his favor, he willed his new found pet to attack its counterpart. They ripped furiously at each other, rolling on the ground, biting and clawing at each other, like snakes coiled together they writhed on the ground. With another incantation Ayebeehm put the weaker of the two wolves down by causing irreversible brain damage. His pet he told to guard the immediate area and made way for the Karanas.<br>
<br>
Even as a child Aybeehm had been able to exert his will on other beings and people. He'd often been told that he was very charismatic for an Erudite, and had a gift for making people admire him. As a young boy he'd often played with the Kobolds running around in the forest behind the castle of Erudin. Making them fetch sticks for him and even doing tricks for the other children. He soon got bored with the parlor tricks and decided he'd learn to utilize his powers to a better extent. That day his mother enrolled him into Arcane School of Magic. The warden had taken an immediate liking to him, and noting his talents, thought he would be best suited for the arts of enchantment. And so he was here now, having finished his education, or at least what the schools in Erudin had to offer him, and was on his way to bigger and better things.<br>
<br>
Once arriving in the plains, he followed the well travelled road north. He ran into a man who called himself Brother Chintl, and asked him where he might find adventure. Brother Chintl informed him that he could find Aviaks in Southern Karana, but before giving him the directions there, tried to convert him to some ludicrous religion that so many ignorant humans thought necessary to their way of life. Ayebeehm expressed his displeasure at the attempt, and requested directions to his newfound destinatoin. Brother Chintl said, "Go east to the river, follow it North. You'll run into little or no problems taking that route, but be weary for Bandits, they sometimes police that area looking for toll to pass." Ayebeehm noted his advice and bid him farewell. <br>
<br>
Why was it that humans found it necessary to push their beliefs on everyone? Ayebeehm didn't know, didn't care to know and just supposed that it was their nature. He followed the mans directions to the river and came across a camp of Barbarians. He'd studied their kind in textbooks at the Library, but had never seen one in person. These individuals were huge to say the least. Standing at least seven and a half feet tall, they made Ayebeehm feel short. Ayebeehm stood at six feet and nine inches tall! What they lacked in intellect they had gained in their stature. Wise people in their own right, but primitive in their own way.<br>
<br>
Ayebeehm passed the camp and continued following the river north. He passed by several farm houses, crops and other sights that didn't warrant further investigation. After a days walk, he finally ended upon the bridge to South Karana. <br>
<br>
The bridge itself was a miniature keep it seemed. There were sleeping quarters, an armanent and a lookout on top for warning of impending danger. He walked up to the guard on duty and asked if there was a place he could lay out his bedroll untill morning. The guard pointed him to one of the lofts in the tower and bid him good night. Before going to bed Ayebeehm made sketches and notes on the flora and fauna of the area. The griffawns that flew around the area were magnificent creatures. Many lions and other large cats walked the plains and he noted species and genum of each. He also noted the species and genum for the wolves that he'd passed along the way and ended his notes with the highpoints of his days travel. The sun set on the horizon casting an orange glow on the bridge, accenting its craftsmanship. He rolled out his bedroll with his journal in hand, and fell fast asleep. He dreamed of the many adventures he would partake in, battles to be waged and experience in the arts to be learned. He was happy, this is where he truly belonged, out in the world doing what suited him best.<br>
