You could still own it with a good group I bet.  Especially if the puller has a full set of BD resist gear.. (Come on there are so many twinks now!)<br>

The armour there is less desirable for monks these days since other expansions added nicer stuff that is easier to obtain.<br>

<br>
Good lord, I hope I never sound like that.  Maybe you should create an uber only forum to discuss those mysteries lowbies and noobs couldn't possibly understand.  *cough cough*  Of course, nobody posting that was ever uninformed or new...<br>
<br>
and then there's &quot;And Casual players very rarely get into the whole community thing. Nor do they want to spend the time it takes to visit the various boards and be as informed as possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guy that introduced me to EQ was an EQ fanatic.  His manual was dripping pages as he crossed the room and he believed he knew every facet of the game, but his wife wouldn't let him surf and barely let him play.  He had to sneak in to the den in the middle of the night to log in.<br>
Do you really have to insult casual players like that?  Because, indeed, that's what he would be.  No, he didn't have the time to level up to 60 in a month, and no, he didn't have the access to a lot of the web sites - but he was no less a player than anyone else.  It's because of these attitudes that the mid level players and new players are a vanishing species.  Unfortunately, being level 65 doesn't mean you have manners, ethics or care about anyone else, it just means you played longer than a lot of others.  Poking fun at new players and being cruel is what has driven them away, and why the game is destined to fail.  Without new players, eventually it will die.  When EQ2 comes out, the whole scenario will change, and it will be a lot of fun to see today's ubers be tomorrow's noobs.  A dose of humility never hurts.<br>
I enjoy Everquest immensely and love being able to do things I couldn't do in the real world.  I love the companionship, comaraderie, and kinships the develop, and never tire of sneak buffing.  I hope and pray others do the same, it's a bit more fun for all.  Good luck and good journeys.<br>

<br>
Ya mentioned my quote, and so, like Growl to a Baks thread, and Viseversa, I must repond.<br>
<br>
If I made any mistakes in my post worth burning me for, it was the assertion that Mid-level = casual.<br>
<br>
I define Casual as playing for an hour or 2 maybe 3 times a week.  And I feel my defination holds true.  If someone is only &quot;into&quot; EQ enough to play maybe 15 hrs a week, they most likely arn't willing to invest even more time trolling spoiler sites and keeping up on the server drama.  They log on, do thier things, have thier fun, and log out.  More often than not they either solo, or play an &quot;instant-group&quot; class (cleric or shaman mostly, or war or ench next in line).  Or they tradeskill extensivly.<br>
<br>
If the above casual player is &quot;forced casual&quot; due to responcibilites and scheduals, why would they spend any extensive time board trolling and the like when they could be getting in that 15 extra min of actual play time.<br>
<br>
As for your example dude, with his almost trashed instruction manual.  Most of us &quot;ubers&quot; haven't touched that worthless pile of dead tree parts in ages.  Hell, I don't even know if I can find mine at this moment.  Aside from installation instructions, there really isn't anything good and usefull that comes from reading that book.<br>
<br>
And while alot of us share the &quot;he believed he knew every facet of the game&quot; mentality, to a large extent our knowledge comes from actual ingame experience, or the knowledge garned by spending boatloads of time reading spoilers, looking at maps, learning spawn cycles and loot drops, heck even skimming those mythical and mostly worthless (you know, to us, in our uberness) Quest-things.  But on the flip side, there are plenty of ignorant 65's, both with and without ego's inflated to fill the void where real play knowlege should be.  <br>
<br>
Beyond this, you begin to lose the point of the initial thread.  No-one said that Casual's are not players too.  They just do not make thier presence felt on the Tavern, probably because they have better things to do.  And if you do not make your presence felt, you cannot be taken into account by those around you.<br>

<br>
You want to talk about the mid level game? Please go ahead. Most people that have played for any length of time remember it as a pretty fun time.<br>
<br>
Hmmm Dalnir. Lots of caster mobs, you need resists (bard is good) and some kind of crowd control. If you die, you can cr with invis.<br>
<br>
Invis down to the second floor and kill everythnig...drops? eh...I dont think anything that drops there is worth more than 200pp in the bazaar now, but there might be decent cash/words etc. Its an indoor dungeon zone with tons of casting mobs...it isnt easy, it is fun.<br>
<br>
Nearest melee bind is Cabilis, OT or (I guess) FM). I know peopel that used to run there dead from FV...but gods ick, I wouldnt want to do that.<br>
<br>
The zone itself is in a cave off WW.<br>
<br>
I thnik its like 25-35-ish...I never did the third floor, we used to be sitting no the second floor and hear them wipe, it was always very scary.<br>

Well, i am a 33 Barb Shaman, looking for a good group of fun and adventurous mid-level people to group and explore with...this is my first character, but i think i've got the game down pretty well so i'd like to group with some more experienced players who have alts around my level, or other first-timers such as myself.<br>
<br>
  I'm in a guild (Society of Honor, Solant rocks!!) and we have some awesome members, but i'm a casual player untill i get a better setup. As a result, i don't usually stay on par with those friends that i've grouped with in the past, and while some of the fun high level players in my guild have alts around my level, they are often too busy or on a different schedule than mine to group together for the proper amount of TIME. <br>
<br>
  See, my theory, as i play music in RL, is that a group of (3-6) PC's in this game can be compared to a BAND in RL. So the more you play together, the tighter of a group you are...and Smokiewolf the Shaman wants to rock out the higher levels!<br>
<br>
  Saryrn seems to be a well-balanced server, alot of cooperitave playing mixed with power-leveling and actual questing and alot of plain old, in-game fun! <br>
<br>
So post a message, let me know what you think, if anyone out there on Saryrn has stopped playing long enough to read this! <br>

<br>
But if you want people to rock it up with, you definitely need a Bard! ;p I spend most of my time lurking in Crystal Caverns these days, XP is still 'okay' at 39, but the cash is bloody great. Feel free to catch me some time. Usually on in the wee hours of the morning, PST. (my evening, here in Australia.) but I can log on whenevers if I have reason to. ;p<br>
<br>
Always happy to keel stuff with other folk. Never grouped with a shammy, so interested to learn the abilities. :) Still slowly learning my capabilities and stacking with other classes/spells. :)<br>
<br>
Maybe see ya around.<br>

<br>
as far as grouping with a Shaman, you don't know what you're missing! Best slow spells in the game, plus we can buff your head off! i've tried a few other classes, but the Shaman just 'feels right' to me. i dont play all the time, but when i do, it's usually late at night, so i'll keep an eye out for ya, send ya a tell...maybe you could give me a tour of the Crystal Caverns? i always like to go into a new zone with someone a little more experienced than myself, cuts down on the tradgedy...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

P.S. Smokywolf would like to formally propose marriage to the first PC (be SHE barb, elf(!), even halfling(?), or human(no Trolls PLEASE) that brings a JBB as a dowrey.

As for the marriage... I'm looking for a Vah myself. Any class is fine by me, and I'm not picky about gender, the males and females are both sexy. I just want a kitty.

 &quot;this item is absolutely the best shammy treat in the game. I have had mine since lvl 45 and I am 58 now...It has saved me so much time, effort and mana. Like anything else, you just have to know how/when to use it...in those times when I need to solo to get xp...or just feel like being alone, tis is a wonderous thing to have! I just bring up my puppy, let him engage a debuffed mob...then happily blast away! Hardly any down time. Worth the plat? YEP&quot;<br>

it's not an essential shaman item or anything, i just think it will fit in particularly well with the play-style i use with my Barb Shaman...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 i'm doing preliminary work on my epic at the moment, as well as doing the quests for faction in Shadow Haven, AND trying to loot or buy Dufrenite for my totemic armor just because i like it and think it fits my character. so taking time out to make a new friend, explore or actually LEVEL, would be good for enhancing the EQ experience for me.<br>
