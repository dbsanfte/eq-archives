Just some food for thought:  How many good looking guys or girls do you remember that lived in the 1500's?  Now, how many artists and inventors do you remember from the 1500's.<br>

It is simply animal instinct to seek out fertile, healthy breeding stock; and most standards of beauty closely align with fertility and healthiness.<br>
<br>
Many will argue that the definition of beauty in a particular culture (whichever one they are a part of) is warped.  However, several studies have shown a fairly universal definition of beauty across cultures and demographics.  The same studies showed that even very young children, whose minds have not been fully shaped by their environments, conform to this standard, indicating that it is instinctual.<br>
<br>
So, there is definitely a natural and logical reason to value beauty and be attracted to beauty.  Having said that, though, I would still argue that that someone who says he could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> love some who wasn't beautiful is indeed shallow.  Although beauty is not without value, dismissing everyone who is of even average appearance as being unlovable means elevating the value of beauty to an extreme.  The discounting of other personal traits, which I also consider valuable, is what strikes me as shallow.<br>
<br>
Of course, when I make that assessment, I'm applying my set of values to someone else, so it is very much an arbitrary assignment.  As I see it, calling someone shallow is equivalent to saying, &quot;I think that you should form your opinions, values, or choice of actions based on this large set of factors, while you are instead considering only this small subset.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
To apply that reasoning to your second point, it would be a case of comparing the likely consequences of being better looking with the likely conseuqences of being more intelligent.  I would say that turning down your hypothetical offer, doubling one's IQ at the cost of 100 pounds, is not a shallow choice.  Most people place a very high value on happiness, naturally, and I cannot say confidently that the smarter, fatter man would be a happier man.<br>
<br>
Gaining one hundred pounds is not simply a matter of looks.  The obvious health costs would likely diminish your life span and would almost certainly diminish your quality of life.<br>
<br>
If you place a high value on achieving greatness and making a mark on the world, such as the ones made by the people who Stalpus mentioned, then the opportunity for extreme intelligence might offset the negative results of the deal.  If you prefer to live a happy, balanced life, though, it's reasonable to say that the trade-off isn't worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, in summary, I think that your first point is an example of shallowness, because it's a stance that can be reached only by choosing to value one attribute while ignoring many others.  Whereas, your second point is not an example of shallowness, because even someone basing his decision on a depth of factors could choose looks over intelligence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stalpus>Stalpus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 795<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/18/02 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Helena of Troy<br>

<br>
It becomes a question of degrees: how great of a physical loss is involved.  If you could become twice as intelligent and all that you suffered for it was a crooked smile, then sure, it would be vain and shallow to decline the offer.  As the demand becomes closer to grotesqueness, though, it becomes quite reasonable to choose appearance over intelligence.<br>
<br>
If you are given the opportunity to take that deal, even if you truly believe that it's what's on the inside that counts, the fact is that if you are hideously deformed, your quality of life will suffer because people will treat you worse.  Whether or not that should be the case is another matter, but it is a fact, which makes the loss significant.  Again, I feel that most people desire a normal, happy life and choosing to take the offer of exceptional intelligence would actually take them farther from their life goals.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't place a high value on beauty (I always prefer it when I look like more of an oddity); but I do acknowledge that there is some value in attractivness.  Generally, it might seem easy to say that choosing looks over brains is a petty choice; but after considering the context of this example, I do not believe that I can say that such a judgement is inherently shallow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saybr>Saybr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:red;'>I like cheese</span></span><br>  Posts: 1135<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/19/02 8:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We are ugly, but we have the music</span><hr size=1> I'll grant you that you could possibly be happier, and have a more content life with beauty over brains.<br>

In fact, I think that such a ranking summarizes the values of the average person.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned earlier, when you are making a comparison against your own values, the designation &quot;shallow&quot; is arbitrary.  All that I need to do to label you shallow is to say that, on the whole, what you tend to value as being of great importance, I tend to regard as trivial.  So, if you think that happiness and comfort are petty concerns, as you are certainly free to believe, then it is fair to label someone as shallow for pursuing those goals.<br>
<br>
If that is your standard, though, I think that you would judge the vast majority of humanity as shallow.  Again, I am not saying that there is anything wrong with making or expressing that judgement.  I just think that it takes the sting out of your assessment if you end up saying, &quot;You're a shallow person . . . just like 99 percent of the population.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nebbytheearthkeeper>Nebby the Earth Keeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/19/02 2:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ugly (Planet Joe)</span><hr size=1> I must be shallow because i could never love someone that made me barf when i looked at them thats like american tring to love taliban its neva gonna happen <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fushae>Fushae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/19/02 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.cox-internet.com/unforgiven2/images/EverQuest/solro.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it shallow?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If someone were to say to you that 1.

If you can love your family, which can be butt ugly and mentally deficient...  I'm sure your lover can be as well.  That's the thing with love, it makes you see people for more than just their physical appearance.  Their beauty as a person over powers any physical appearances.  Your love of them as a person will go past their physical appearance, if it's real love atleast.<br>
<br>
Of course, other folk may still be sexier than the one you love, but you don't love the sexy girls, just wanna bed 'em.<br>
<br>
As for saying that we crave what would be good for breeding, that's a load and a half.  Most of the beautiful girls in america are unhealthy by being underweight.  That is, going by your average = not beautiful.  The exceptional tends to be really thin(actresses and models)...  Im sure we can all agree that they're not the best candidates for breeding.  So that rules out instinct driving us to craving beauty in america.  To go with that thought though, it seems being shallow was created by intellects to mock those that follow instincts.  Physical craving over emotional or mental craving, so there's no real bad in being shallow.  It's just like a preference of red over blue, or green over black. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saybr>Saybr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:red;'>I like cheese</span></span><br>  Posts: 1136<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/19/02 5:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it shallow?</span><hr size=1> Saybr has a penis.  (Someone asked.)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you doing this study?&quot; you ask?<br>
<br>
Last night I had an argument with my 26 year old brother for about an hour and 20 minutes.  I finally just hung up, since I'd been sitting in my driveway for 20 minutes and we were going in circles.<br>
<br>
My brother maintains the following:<br>
<br>
1.  He could never love anyone who wasn't physically beautiful.  This mean no ugly, average, or plain people.<br>
<br>
2.  He'd rather be pretty than smart.<br>
<br>
3.  That since he's spent the time and pain on his appearance (he competed in bodybuilding, and is very stuck on how he looks), he can expect his mate to be the same, without being shallow.<br>
<br>
I maintain that right, wrong, or indifferent, using &quot;physical beauty&quot; as his first screening criteria is shallow, by definition.  Deep down I think he must agree, but not like it, since he argued for so long.  I could argue that the sky is brown with him and he'd lose interest in about 3 minutes.<br>
<br>
I understand that physical beauty might cause you to approach, or not approach someone.  But what about that average girl that you've worked next to for three years?  Because she's not stunning, you'd never consider her a potential mate?  Despite the fact that you miss her when she's not around, look forward to seeing her, she makes you laugh, etc. etc?<br>
<br>
Looks - Obvious.<br>
Personality, etc. - Needs some work to discover.<br>
<br>
<br>
By Websters, and the majority of the voters here (4-1), I maintain that he is indeed shallow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not that there's anything wrong with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
And the first person to say that I used &quot;maintain&quot; too often is getting bitch slapped.<br>

An interesting question here might be whether your bro would continue to &quot;love&quot; an amazingly gorgeous babe when, after 4 years together, she got her face caught in a conveyor belt.<br>
<br>
Might wanna' ditch the whole &quot;shallow/not shallow&quot; arguement, and focus on exactly what his definition of &quot;love&quot; is.<br>

I'll take brains anyday of the week.<br>
<br>
I disbelieve the concept of love in the first place. Lust turns to tolerance then to just plain habit. Now that is going to stir up the old traditionalists. Just like when you had your first pizza for an example. You said to yourself &quot;Damn! that was one awesome pizza!&quot; Later on...you nit-pick about the sauce.<br>
<br>
At least with brains you can come up with new arguments as you grow old become habits to each other.<br>
<br>
Personal choice is what it is. Call it shallow, call it whatever, it's all personal choice.<br>
<br>
