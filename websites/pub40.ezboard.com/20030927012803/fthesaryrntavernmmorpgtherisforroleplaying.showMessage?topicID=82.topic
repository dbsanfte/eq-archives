She Lurked Through the Shadows of the Ruins th Lizard men called home like she had done so many times before, But this time was going to be a bit diffrent. This time she was going to tempt fate And destroy Cazic-Thules Anchor to this relm or Die trying... <br>
She knew right where he was, and after hours of ducking down Corridors and being Blessed by an Old drunk dwarf who had just tempted the fates himself by destroying The Lizard's crusader--I made my way to the chamber in the heart of the ruins. <br>
The room he was in Was well lit which made my job a bitch but nothing was stopping me now! The Shpare in the middle of the room was glowing a sickly green which made my heart race and my skin crawl But I was ready for anything. <br>
I heard the chanting begin up above as the Lizard shamans started There Rituel that would bring a being made of pure fear to OUR Norrath, I wasnt about to let it stay! I was ready to pounce My Target and then there was a bright flash of Light and I screamed out in pain as He grabed me and sent pure fear through my entire body. I flew into the wall And I knew then That Bristlebane wasnt getting me out of this scrape... <br>
Its claws Shimmerd With my blood, and even though it was faceless I could feel it grinning at me It knew as well as I did That I tempted The fates one time to many And I cried out <br>
&quot;Innoruuk you basterd why didnt you make me stronger&quot; <br>
And then I heard him speak... <br>
&quot;My child blame only yourself for it was you that turned your back on your brothers and sisters.&quot; <br>
He Laughed. <br>
&quot;It was you that turned your back on your father and Strayed from hate in hopes of being accepted By those pointy eared tree hugging sons of...&quot; <br>
Then he sigh <br>
&quot;its your fault that you thought That Bristlebane would care for you as I would have...Hell he cant even deside what color to paint his home how the hell is he supposed to take care of you child...&quot; <br>
at that momment I did what Any Tier`del would do...I Renagade or Not I filled my heart with as much hate as I could muster and Unleased an Attack on that beast of pure fear That would make an entire army wish it was at home in its warm safe beds...I didnt do it for Inny I did it for me, or was that what he wanted... <br>
<br>
As I died I heard Innoruuk Laughing, Rallos Boosting, The Marr's Chatterd, Veshean Snorted, Brell said a Prayer&quot;Whores and Ale&quot;, And The Mother of All Cried cause she lost my soul...And she losed it twice. <br>
<br>
Then Karana Spoke... <br>
&quot;There is A Storm brewing in my heart... <br>
The Wind has A womans Voice--Sweet as A Rose... <br>
The Lightning is Playful--As a Pixie young... <br>
And The Thunder Spoke as Bravely as Any Man... <br>
Bristlebane You should be ashamed of yourself for letting this one be taken by the fear...cause now she is mine and YOU should fear Her!&quot; After Karana was done talking a tear ran down his weatherd Cheek... <br>
<br>
And It begins to rain <br>
<br>
<br>
Ixie Darkpixie-Clan Brutel/Familjen/Order of the Black Rose/Grand Dragons <br>
<br>
&quot;Power comes from the heart for most men...But With That wench its coming from her fowl little mouth!&quot; <br>
