<br>
Do you guys have some friends or know people who lie so much, they actually believe themselves? lol, It is quite funny, yet really pathetic<br>
<br>
Here is a nice story to get you guys through the work day today. A group of unimportant newbies that lie so much they actually believe themselves. Felt like posting so everyone could get a kick.<br>
<br>
<br>
four or five days ago, I go down to droga to camp a named. Full spawn, noone even remotely around. so, I kill a ph. and few others for exp. 20 min or so repop times.  a group of people come down.  Unguilded, probably hydra team. Rodruax, chanticus, trackimus, some other idiots. They tell me, earth seer is camped. I said, yes, by me, thanks. They go no, we were here before. I said no, it is a full pop, noone was around and I'm here now. They go we had to go up top for a while to grab some people. LoL, you believe these idiots?<br>
<br>
So, me, being the nice person that I am.  I said fine, Being that I killed the ph I am going to kill whatever pops next. If it is named I am killing, if it is ph, you guys can take camp back that you supposively said you had. These idiots actually said umm, no, its ours please leave, or you will have SEVERE competition. You are ksing, leave now, lol.  so, I said you know, Now, I think I am staying, Thanks. So the battle begins.<br>
<br>
Round 1, Team gimp 6 of them vs khrono, khrono wins ph though.<br>
<br>
Round 2. Team gimp 6 vs khrono, khrono wins ph.<br>
Round 3, Team gimp 6 vs khrono, khrono wins, ph.<br>
Round 4, Team gimp 6 vs khrono, khrono wins, ph<br>
<br>
I Guess they left after that, they gave up.  Then the idiot trackimus charges into the room that I am camping and tries to train me for no reason at all. Dumbass should have checked to see if I was invised or not, and of course I was, and nothing sees thrus invis in droga. So, he failed miserably. And as the mobs were whacking him The wizard from above ports them out. So, that was pretty pathetic. - Let me give you advice. It's pretty damn hard to train a druid with us having 2.5 sec egress, and exodus also. You better make sure the mob is gonna 1 round me for 8k if its gonna train me. :P so,<br>
<br>
<br>
2 days ago. The Droga Saga continues........<br>
<br>
I go down to camp some other named. full pop, noone on track, noone anywhere near the area. I go into the room invis. I kill  3 mobs and clear the small area for myself to work in. Team gimp trackimus, chanticus, and few others proceed down to me like 20 min later. They start yelling in ooc, khrono go somewhere else, wah, wah, this room is camped.<br>
How do these people call camps, when they are not even at them and someone else is? Unreal.<br>
So, after him spewing out his pointless drivel in ooc, they proceeded to the room I was in, and were killing the stuff where I was. I said, guys, I was here first, I am camping it. LOL, they go no we are here, we are camping it. So, I said, Okies, go for it then.<br>
<br>
There was at least 7-8 of them this time.  2-3pets, and a DCED light blue pet. So, yea, I got ksed on the named that popped next round, that I Clearly popped. A 100% flat out deliberate ks. They got the item.<br>
So, Since I was about to get ksed, I petitioned, gms did nothing as usual, what can you do. I had my fast cast spells in, but 7-8 people to much for me :-P. Being that I had all my fast cast spells loaded  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I totally forgot that I took out my ensnare spell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They stood there killing for exp, and I was killing a mob for exp also. The mob got low on hp, and proceeded to run away from me. And, umm a slight accident was about to occur. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The mob took took off out the door, and brought back about 20 of his friends. <br>
<br>
:: Khrono:: throws the ball down the lane.... And BOOM its a Strike. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Complete wipeout of team gimp. GOD, I fukken fell off my chair, I never laughed so hard. It felt so fukken good too. And you know, I will Bet ANYTHING deep down they knew they deserved it. So, after the few tells I watched one of the gimps drag his friends into a safe room. 2 minutes later the named spawn again, back to back with same item, I got my item anyway.<br>
<br>
Now, Tonight 2 days later for no reason what so ever, I see this idiot rodruax, spouting off crap in the bazaar,khrono kses, khrono kses, wah, wah, wah. I get these tells I am going to get you. LOL, if its the last thing I do he says. I am going to make you quit EQ. I am an ex military officer and I have gotten more medals in 1 week then you could accomplish in your whole life, and some more funny $hit. I have some of screenshots of tonight. It was to funny. Man, if this fool only knew what I looked like in RL. I would pound him to kingdom come. <br>
<br>
He says, I am going to get my alts in heaven and earth, and get you. I have 200 people that are watching you, yes, he says, I know lots of people. I said, 200 eh? he goes yea 200 people. lol<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope this story has brightened your day. I may be a quiet person, and a farmer  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and who isn't?, but you all know, i never ks anyone, and I help out where I can and I am a relatively great guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, as my title states. These people lie so much they believe themselves. Where the hell do these idiots come from??<br>

They seem to be just creating new rules as they go, like for example when I was soloing with my necro, Vhagnard the other day I had some jackass griefing me over a spot in PoD that I was pulling to claiming he had been there for hours (although he had not) and that he was camping the goos and such that I had been pulling..... camping wandering mobs....How exactly does that work that you camp wandering mobs in an outdoor zone, so does that mean if someone calls campcheck that I should call out my Loc. Just seems like a whole new group of idiots plaguing our server.<br>

I hate it when people ASSUME they are entitled to a camp because they came to that zone with the intent of camping it. <br>
<br>
Former military guy?  Remeber your 6 p's.<br>
Proper planning prevents piss poor performance.<br>
<br>
CHECK THE CAMP before you drag your hydra army and all your friends to a spot.  <br>
<br>
Next time you show with 8 or 10 maybe Khrono will have to invite someone to help hold the camp to ensure he isn't KS'ed by you fools.<br>

<br>
After killing about 15 goos, I see 2 druids with their dc rats making their way along the wall, over to me. I don't even get what khrono got, all I get is &quot;CAMPED&quot; in say a few times.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
Finally I get a tell. Seems these 2 druids have claimed roughly half the zone as their camp. What's so funny here, is that there are costantly mobs around. It's not as if I am clearing the area out of mobs, there's tons of them.<br>
<br>
I state that I am not here for exp, I am only after a quest item, once I have it, I will gladly let them have half of the zone back. Then I get &quot;We'll let you know if it drops, this is CAMPED.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was done at that point, and just kept on with what I was doing. Sometimes trying to talk things out, just doesn't work.<br>

Had been killing PHs for a hour or so when mob pops.  I pull it back to camp (where my shaman was, by rock on the first fly island) and when I get there theres a group from some minor european guild who prompty attacks the mob to KS it.  It was pretty purposeful as there shaman kept on getting in front of me to block my arrows.  They looted the key part and promptly left.  I actually did get there group leader to admit that I had pulled the mob and they KSd it.  Because of that, a GM went ahead and gave me the keypart; I had already spent 6 hours total on that camp and didnt feel like doing it again. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>

They moved in to our camp in Veksar, I asked if I could help them, and where they are headed. I get the response of &quot;whatever camp we want&quot;. They moved on because I think they realized that my group was in no way a group that woould be easily trained or KS'ed from. <br>
