He noticed that the horizon seemed to be shaking, then realized that it was only his head moving by the force asserted from the grinding of his thick teeth. Over to his left, a large mountain rises into the clouds, but it's brown and dotted with trees. A thought passes through his mind, &quot;Just ain't like home&quot;. From the right, he hears the sounds of laughter as some Halflings dance and shout to the music of a young bard. Catching him off guard, he smells the odory stench of Black Burrow Stout coming from their direction. A deep Gufaw begins to rise in his massive chest, as he thinks of when he last smelt that stench, but as suddenly as it started to rise, it dissipated. <br>
<br>
Valek stepped into the hallway. He tightened the Cloak around his chest. &quot;Bloody rags&quot;, he says to himself. &quot;How am I supposed to impress her, she already thinks I'm a baffoon.&quot; Passing the inn keeper, he says &quot;Last night here Mate.&quot; The inn keeper glances up from his book, &quot;Don't forget to turn in the key!&quot; Valek says &quot;How can I forget?...&quot; As he steps out onto the street. Suddenly alarmed, a sharp pain throbbs in his shin and he staggers and grabs his knee. &quot;O forgive me ser! I didn' men ta harm ya.&quot; Valek looks toward the sound of the voice and sees nothing, then he smells the bitter odor of cheap liquor. His eyes follow his nose down to his waist and he finds the source of his pain. A halfling lays on the ground mostly face down in front of him. Valek realized that a cheerful melody is playing extremely loud, and people are dancing, laughing and drink all around him. The halfling stands up and says &quot;Wow, Ya nearly broke tha back o' my wooodn' heel! It's loose as a' goose naw ya see&quot;? The little man twist his foot a little then slowly begins to fall toward Valek. Valek reaches out with one hand and catches him by the back of his shirt. &quot;Excuse me? Hail?&quot; Then as quickly as the lil man had stumbled into his life, two hysterical halflings loop there arms under the arms of the Black Burrow stenched Halfling, and drag him over to a bench on the street, and roll him under it. <br>
<br>
Alaya hands three platinum coins to the attendent. &quot;Thank you my lady,&quot; says the attendent. She slightly bows with gracefulness that seems almost unholy. Time seems to stand still as her movements enchant, and horrify him at the same time. The attendant finds himself staring at the eyes of the beauty before him in an eerie silence. Sweat beads form on his upper lip. He notices that he hasn't been breathing. Forcing himself to swallow he makes an annoying gulping sound. &quot;That will be all&quot;, Alaya says with a quick blink. For a moment he starts to say something, but finding himself speechless. He turns, bumps into the door, opens it quickly, and exits the room in a tenth of a second. Shuting the door behind him, he looks down into his hand at the three coins and says &quot;Party time!&quot; <br>
<br>
Jayzul walks out of the stables. &quot;Thanks fer tha stable&quot;, he says to the watchman. &quot;Aye. She'll be fine for the night. Do not fear.&quot; Jayzul nods and walks past the watchman. The watchman looks up at the towering feirce one before. He hears the clinking of heavy mail armor, smells leather tailored from a bear, and feels the ground sink as the war tatooed figure walks past him. The watchman glances back at the stable, and suddenly feels a deep sadness for the strong steed. Know that a normal sted would never have made it all the way from the North in one trip; mainly because of the massive rider upon its back. As Jayzul leaves the stables, he notices that there is great celebration in progress. Singing, dancing, drinking, and laughter makes a slight roar over the city. Jayzul feels the wind pick up, and catches a scent in the cool breeze, coming from the north. Tension builds around his chest and neck. He feels his grip tighting around his spear. Jayzul instinctively scans his surroundings, eyes narrowing, and probing the horizon. The sun is setting in the distant West, turning the sky pink, purple, and mostly orange. Facing the north he inhales deeply, closes his eyes and looks to the left at the deep, red, setting sun. Almost with out thinking, words roll off his tongue. His hand draws a symbol in the air before him, &quot;Katim calora fink naji!&quot; A sudden rush of heat floods through his vains, bright sparkling spheres of purplish energy spin around him, and a beatuiful, glowing, lupine aura baths him like a shower disipating at his feet. <br>
<br>
The bartender turns and says &quot;Wow, Looks like your ready for another one eh lil fella?&quot; The bartener begins to smile then his eyes meet with the eyes of the young Dwarf before him. Cold black eyes pierce him, chills run up and down his spine as the smile turns into a slight gape. The young Dwarfs face flushes a deep red. The bartender very slowly slides a bottle of short beer towards the young, red faced, Dwarf. Suddenly, the bartender feels his hand stop moving and streaking pain shoots up his arm. He gasp painfully, spital burst out of his mouth sailing over the Dwarfs armored head. The eyes of the bartender fall down, settling upon the source of his pain. Barely half way around his wrist is the Dwarf's hand with a grip like a vice. Realizing that he had offended the young Dwarf, he strained the words out of his mouth, &quot;Thiiiss one's ahonn me ssssir... aaAaaHa.&quot; Then Blurting in agony, he manages a whisper. &quot;There all on me sir...&quot; <br>
<br>
Dust swirls in whirlwinds as the sun kisses the desert horizon. &quot;Come awnnn!&quot; Larock shouts. &quot;We're running late az it tis!&quot; Looking over her rightshoulder she sees her Warder silent and stiff like a statue. His eyes are hollowed, narrowed, and piercing. His thick, deep gray, fur is dotted with the desert sands, giving him a dull, shadowed look. His nose is lifted, and he's slowly inhaling a deep instictive breath of air. &quot;Come!&quot; Larock shouts. Immediatly, he runs to her side, nose still lifted, consuming the scene. Larock rest her right hand upon the wolf's head between its ears and caresses him. He stares into the distance still searching. A low deep rumble builds in the wolf's chest his mouth begans to drip with drool. With vicious, long, white fangs exposed, a piercing growl errupts, and then turns to silence. Larock remains silent as well, still caressing the wolf; no words come from her lips. She knows something is desperately wrong just as the wolf does. The wolf emits three short quick high pitch wimpers. She lifts her hand off his head. Larock readys her dagger at her side. As the wind picks up it catches her deep redish brown hair and twist it in the wind. Sand brushes against her cheek and she squints her war tattoed eyes. Her family markings surround her eyes with a dark red blind fold shape that narrows into points at her temples. Upon her chest is a symbol that looks somewhat like a flickering flame, also deep red. Sweat glistens upon her brow. She raises her hand to block the setting sun from her eyes. Unable to see anything a wry, she closes her eyes, and raises her hand, makeing a rolling motion, soft words flow from her lips. A bright sparkling energy pulse eminates from the wolf. The she repeats the motion and words again, and the same pulse eminates from her tall, strong, lean body. &quot;Go!&quot; she shouts as they bolt toward the city which is but a speck in the vast distance. <br>
<br>
Laterns are being lit all through out the city of Qeynous. Torchs are being hung on walk ways, placed upon stands, and fastened upon fistures. The last sliver of the purplish setting sun vanishes under western mountains. Camp fires dot the city as the hustle and bustle of trade and business slows, and the night life is born. Adventures enter pubs and inns preparing for the cold night, as the celebration continues. This is the annual gathering to celebrate the birth of Qeynous, but this year it's also the day of a Hafling Wedding, of one the Haflings most noble young couples. The Qeynous Celebration is not really much of the reason why they do this every year. It's really just any excuse to have a hugh get drunk party. This is always a big drunken festival which draws in poeple from all over Norrath. The vast number of people brings vendors and merchants of all kinds to provide food and supplies to the masses for the three day event. The usual sicknesses follows when different cultures gather; passing viruses and sickness amongst the people, therefore, clerics and doctors follow the masses to profit from the illnesses. Even the qeynous guards rotate three hour shifts to be able to spend more time at the party, and they spend their shift in a drunken state of uselessness. Usually by the second day the Guards can't see far enough to gather any useful information from their surroundings. All together, the celebration is one of the most profitable events on the western hemisphere. <br>
<br>
&quot;Halt!&quot; Larock shouts. Blackpaw stops in his tracks. Larock stares toward the city, but seems baffled by what she sees. The flickering campfires in distance are not what her attention is focused on, but around the city. She is elevated a few hundred feet above the city in the hills. She notes a enourmous,dark ocean of movement, closing in from all direction around Qeynous. Confused by the massive motion she kneels down on one knee bye the Large, heavy breathing wolf. &quot;What is that Blackpaw?&quot; He emits one quick wimper followed by a quick high picth bark. &quot;I know, it's eerie.... Let's move in closer, but stay down.&quot; <br>
<br>
Captain Tillas laughs and shakes his head, &quot;Ya know, I think that's tha stupidest think I ever herd.&quot; &quot;Is true Cap'n. Me and Liutenant Morella was der.&quot; &quot;Well, Lietenant Bess, love is strange, ya know. I guess if a Barbarian woman 'n Gnome man ar' truly in luvv, then may tha God's blesz em.&quot; The two guards stagger towards the gate. The Captain mubbles to the liutenant something about using the facilities and walks behind the shadow of a nearby tree outside the wall. The liutenant pulls a bottle of mead out from behind his shield, which is propt up against the city wall. The Captain stubbls around the corner of the city gates. &quot;What tha hell 'er ya doin' soldier?&quot; &quot;Uh... I uh...&quot; The Captain snatches the bottle from the hand of the Liuetentant. &quot;We's on duty Lutanten.&quot; says the Captain. Glug, glug, glug, the captain tilts his head back, and takes three big swigs. &quot;Ahhh.. I's liks meed!&quot; The liuetenant starts to laugh with a deep gufaw, but suddenly the Captain's body is jolted stiff. Mead begans spilling down over his chest. The lieutenant's laughter fades into confusion. His jaw hangs open, and mead dribbles out of the side of his mouth. Straining to focus his eyes, he makes out the shape of the Captain before him. The torch mounted on the wall flares up in a mild breeze. The lietenant leans forward and a deep surging fear shoots through his body. A deep flood of adrenaline pulses through him, and he begans to violently shake uncontrollably. His eyes begin to water, and a horrific grimace appears on his face. He notices a warm liquid slowly oozing down his cheek. Immediately, he knows the liquid is from the horrific figure before him. Adrenaline forces the effects of the alcohol aside, and his eyes clearly see the seen before him. The Captain stands ridged before him, there is blood with mead running down his chest, and over the Ring Mail pants upon his legs. Protruding from the his forearm at an angle slanted to the left is about a twelve inch long shaft with feathers on the end of it. The shaft first pierced through his upper wrist, then through the tip of the bottle shattering glass in his mouth, then through his tongue, and out the bottom of his chin. Then directly under his left collar bone, through his heart and out the left side of the rib cage. From the side of his chest the arrow head is exposed, flowing with blood like a red fountain from his side. Lieutenant Bess gasps with fear. His mind fails him. After an eternity, the Captain falls forward onto his ruptured face. Finally, the military instinct takes over the lieutant. He turns to run to the Alarm bell, but he notices that he can move his feet. He looks down and notices that hugh roots have some how grown up around his feet, locking him in position. He tries to shout for help but an ocean of vomit rises up in the back of his throat choaking him. Sweat beads form all over his entire body. At the same time, he feels freezing cold with chills surging through him. Realizing that he's about to join the Captain's fate he reaches for the sword at his side, but as reaches for it an arrow tacks his hand to his side. The piercing pain throbbs in his waist and through his hand. Unable to move or ring the alarm bell he trys to shout for help. &quot;Heuaaahaugh.....&quot; is the only sound he is able to make. The rising ocean of bile and soured mead erupts from the back of his throat, drenching his light mail and tunic. Once again the attempt to shout for help is paused by the massive heaving as the ocean expells from within him again. Cold sweat forms all over his body and his skin sihnges from the scorching fever that engulfs him. Realizing the futility of his efforts to escape the fate that befell the Captain, he briefly thinks upon the godess Tunare. He hears a whistling noise coming from the darkness above him, followed by three quick thuds. He glances down and sees that an arrows have peirced his heart, right shoulder, and his abdomin. Slowly, his sight fades and he slautches forward unable to fall because of the massive roots around his legs. Then, just as suddenly as the roots had appeared, they turn to dust, allowing the Lietenant to fall into his final rest, slaming down like a tree upon the Captain. A criss crossed mass in a pool of mead, blood, and vomit. <br>
<br>
Trytan, bored of the celebration, exits the inner court and walks toward The Fish Ale Tavern. Towering over the celebrating crowd, he surveys the area. He notices that there seems to be a strange feel to his surroundings, &quot;Soming's wrong,&quot; he says. Trytan's eye's dull, seeminly in a state of trance........... &quot;You Sicken me! Your weakness grows stronger! You make me sick! You don't even have the instincts of your mother! I swear, if I your mother and had not lived alone together in the peaks for the past 10 years I'd swear you weren't my Blood! YAAH!&quot; Trytan ducks, tear streaming down his face. &quot;Please daddy don't!&quot; &quot;RAAGGA!&quot; His father Sword Slashes through a tree next to Trytan, slicing completely through the eight inch thick tree. The small oak tree falls over and crashes to the ground opposite them. His father sheaths his sword and kneels down infront of Trytan, grabs him by the upper arms, and pulls him in close, eye to eye. Trytan stiffens his face and holds back the tears. Trytan stares into the eyes of his father. Snow melts in his fathers eyebrows. The deep blue tatoos surrounds his father's eyes, and they curl into circles that end in points on his cheeks. Scars and pits cover his father's face. Creases dig deep into the upper cheeks and under his eyes. Teeth exposed, his father bares his rage. &quot;Do you understand why I'm so furious?&quot; Trytan says &quot;No sir.&quot; &quot;You MUST learn to use your instincts. We are Barbarians. We have been blessed with size, strength, and great stamina. We are a powerful people, but our INSTINCTS... they... are... our GREATEST STRENGTH! ...&quot; Trytan's father loosens the grip of his massive hands from around his son's upper arms. He removes his hands from his son and stands up. He notices that his sons arms are not bruised, but barely even red. He rasies an eyebrow at his son and makes note that the boy is naturally tuff. Trytan's only 8 years old most fathers don't put their sons through this test until the age of 10, but Trytan had already mastered all of the scouting technics, basics of weapons, fire making, and survival training. In edition to all of these advancements, Trytan was the same size as the other 10 year old boys, and slightly larger then most. His father shouts, &quot;Again!&quot; Trytan walks forward and picks up the dagger off the ground. He silently advances forward down the trail with eyes closed. After about a hundred paces, he stops, his neck stiffens, and his knees bend. He sniffs, sniffs again, cocks his hand back like a catapult, and launches the dagger with every ounce of force that is with in him. in the distance Trytan hears a screech quickly followed by a knocking thud. He here's his father's footsteps rushing towards him. &quot;Look Trytan!&quot; He opens his eyes and to his left about twenty paces away. A Humming Bird with a dagger piercing its skull is pinned to a tree. His father stands silent for a short while then says &quot;Ya instincts are very strong my son, but ya'r very young. I will teach ya ta youse 'em, develop 'em. Ya'll be a Fierce Warrior, one of the Wolves of Halas, I tell ya!......&quot; Then the glossy trance fades from Trytan's eyes. He inhales deeply through his nostrils. Still a sense of Uneasy covers him. He instinctively adjust his breast plate, tightens the latches, as well as on his legs and arms. Rolls his head around once upon his massive neck, causing it to make a cracking, popping sound, and takes a long swig from his favorit flask of water. <br>
