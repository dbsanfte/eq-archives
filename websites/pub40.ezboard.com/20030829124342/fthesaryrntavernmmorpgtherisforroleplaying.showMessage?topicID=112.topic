Me and a friend had a nice arrangement going, the both of us would team up on whatever lizzard like creatures we could find, we would both split the loot from thier bodies and would both increase our skills in combat. <br>
    We had been doing this for quite some time now. Me and Jabik knew our weeknesses, our strenghts and overall knew eachother well enough so that we could work as an excellent team...or so we thought. <br>
    While we were eating our lunch ob the shore of the lake we noticed a very small amout of Goblins, Sarnaks and Iksars wondering around, this was strange but we did not wonder the cause. Jabik ran to the Goblin mines in search of prey. In a few short minutes he came running back with 2 goblin warriors following behind him. He summoned the roots of the earth to hold one goblin and we proceeded to attack the other. It fell easily to our combined strenght and I turned to the other to engage it. This goblin put up little of a fight due to him being held down by the earth, only while attacking him I heard Jabik scream in pain. <br>
   I turned to see Jabik was being attacked by another goblin, who was dripping with water. At his neck thick red blood flowed from open gills. Jabik stood not a chance against this fiend. I watched in horror as my partener was being beaten to a pulp. In a rage, I threw myself onto the goblin in a flurry of attacks, hoping to get him away from Jabik. The beast threw me into the water and I sank like a rock. Realising I had only one chance for air, I walked along the bottom of the lake, hoping I would make it in time to help Jabik. When I got onto the beach, out of breath and soaked to the bone I saw Jabik lying on his back, a trail of blood flowing from him into the water. The strange gilled goblin was nowhere to be found and the rooted goblin had been released. <br>
   I ran over to see how Jabik was doing, he gasped for air, tried to raise an arm but had not the strenght. I knelt beside him and took a good look, only to realise he had no chance of survival. He looked at me with pain in his eyes, his body was in such tatters I could no longer tell he used to be a proud barbarien. He gazed me into the eyes and muttered &quot;finish...me&quot;. My eyes widened with despair, I shook my head and pleaded to the gods not to take his life. I looked down at him again and knew what needed to be done, he was in far too much pain and could not last much longer. I picked up my massive axe in both hands, placed it over his head, closed my eyes and whispered &quot;Im sorry Jabik&quot;. MY axe gave down with a mighty crunch. I stood up, trying not to look at his corpse.<br>
   I began to walk away when I felt something enter me. I felt a strange strenght flowing through my veins. But why I asked myself? How could I gain strenght from taking the life of an innocent? My axe seemed light as a fether, my armor seemed like silk clothing. I began to run, hoping I could run away from the deed I just commited. Instead was only amazed at the speed I had gained...what was this new strenght in my body? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=112.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=112.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying>MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
