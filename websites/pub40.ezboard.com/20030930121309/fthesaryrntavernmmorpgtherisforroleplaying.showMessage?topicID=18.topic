Not many people of the Everfrost Peaks take the road that I have taken, but I will share my story and fill you in on why things are as they are. I grew up in a poor family, my mother spent most of her days hunting and trapping snow leopards. Their hides were worth a modest amount of coin, but with the cost of feeding me, and the cost to heat our drafty hut, it wasn't enough to keep us fed well. Being put in this situation tends to change you, and it did change me. Desperate times call for desperate measures. <br>
<br>
My father spent most of his time adventuring the lands of Norrath seeking fortune and fame, unfortunately this came at a grave cost as he was slain while exploring Innothule swamp. The foul Ogres ran him through simply for making the mistake of being seen. This did not fare well with my mother, and she in turn began spending more time on her hunting, perhaps in some sort of self-pity. This left little time for me. Over time, my mother spent less and less time with me, and I spent more and more time alone. My mother tried to teach me the art of magic, but either I wasn't wise enough to understand, or didn't take a liking to it. I vowed that I would never be a warrior like my father and die the death he did. <br>
<br>
This left me only one choice, and since I had been headed down the path anyway, it was my destiny to be a rogue, a pickpocket, a common thief. This seemed only natural to me, as I often had to steal food, clothing and coin to make my way. My mother simply didn't provide for me, and my father couldn't. Early on in life I left my roost and took the dangerous trek across the land. I made the run through the plains of Everfrost, through the depths of Blackburrow, along the paths of Qeynos Hills and into the plains of Karana. At such a young age I faced many dangers, but with my chosen profession I had little trouble sneaking by my would be foes. I continued to run further yet, through the Gorge, into Runnyeye, and out into Kithicor Forest. And to make this short, ended up as safely as I'd began to Freeport. <br>
<br>
Upon entering Freeport, I had a young cleric by the name of Krelarii bind me to the area. It would be such a long run back should someone or something take my life. After Krelarii blessed me, we both ventured into the Eastern Commonlands. He said he knew the area well and knew where we could make a good team. After speaking with Krelarii for awhile he told me he was from a long lineage of holy men. His father a Paladin before him, and his Grandfather a Cleric. At the end of the story he notified me that we had arrived at our destination and would be waging war against the foul Orcs that plagued Freeport. The Orc camp that we had traveled to was a small shanty, 3 tentlike structures had been erected as some sort of camp. Standing out front of the camp were 4 Orcs, this being my first time to see such a beast I had no idea what to expect. So I asked Krelarii what could be expected. He informed me that the Orc Oracle was indeed a beast to be feared. He used magic that could slow you down, burn you, freeze you and send lightning coursing through your body. I thought that would be the worst, but he told me that was just the beginning, he told me that Orcs were as strong as two normal men, and hit twice as hard. Just when I thought the bad news was over, Krelarii pointed out that the toughest and meanest of the Orcs was the Orc Legionnaire, standing a full two head taller than the rest that surrounded him, he looked to be very powerful indeed. I also noticed that he had the longest "tusks" if that is what you wanted to call them, long teeth protruding from the lower jaw, perhaps meaning he was the dominant leader? <br>
<br>
After seeing that the camp was indeed full of orcs, we decided to wait for more help to come. Krelarii told me that this wasn't an unknown camp, but despite the attempts to bring it down, the orcs still came back. We walked to an inn nearby and bought food and drink, and relaxed until we heard shouts for help. It was a tiny voice shouting in a shrill tone, and with an accent similar to Krelarii's. Upon running full speed back to the orc campgrounds we saw a halfling being tormented by the camp. They were pushing him around, calling him names in their strange tongue, ripping at his clothes and pummeling him before pushing him into another orc. He was obviously in need of assistance. Without any though in my mind I stood behind the massive Orc Legionnaire, who stood just as tall as myself, nearly eight and a half feet, and drove my dagger hard into his backside causing a significant amount of damage. At least it seemed to me at the time to be a significant amount of damage, the legionnaire turned on one heel and bashed me! I was caught by suprise and it stunned me, damn my foolish bravery. With my element of suprise gone and my presence alerted, another orc started in on me as well. The Legionnaire was very fast and agile, dodging most of my attacks and it seemed I would never inflict much damage on him. He pummeled me over and over, bruising ribs and knocking me backwards, to my dismay he turned around and put his back to me. Why would he do such a thing? Not wasting any time I drove my dagger yet again into his back, this time closer to the spine. This did the trick, the Legionnaire fell face forward into the ground below. I started to cheer but noticed the halfling we'd come to rescue was pinned under him and tried to help. The minute I diverted my attention to him, the remainder of the orcs tore into me. As my last bit of energy was draining from me, I managed to take down one more, but knew death was very near. Krelarii had his hands full with an Orc Centurion and needed help. I could do nothing to aid him, I was crawling away to the inn as fast as I could when I heard the orc cry out in pain. The halfling we'd rescued has just rescued me, he had diverted the orcs attention long enough for Krelarii to finish of the Centurion while I hid and rested. With a burst of force the last standing Orc Apprentice was sent 10 feet through the air and collided with a tree, killing him instantly, Krelarii had again proved a worthy companion. <br>
<br>
Laying broken and bruised, laboring to breathe I explained to Krelarii the condition I was in, how badly I was pained and that I would no longer be able to continue the effort. He simply laughed and told me that I would not be so fortunate. With a chant and a smile, Krelarii's hands started glowing a blue light, the light circled around him and then started to circle around me. Sparkling light, flashing light, swirling light. Looking down at my bruised arm the black and blue faded to a light yellow and the pain ceased. He chanted again, this time my ribs felt as if they'd never been broken and my breathing was much easier. One last chant and it was as if I'd never been in battle, I felt rejuvenated, alive and well. I thanked him but our newfound friend butted in and started thanking us profusely. He said he would have surely died and wanted to thank us somehow. His services were ours to be used in whatever manner we wished. Krelarii and I looked at each other, not sure of what to think. We did it because we knew it had to be done, not to gain anything from it. I looked at him and stated that his services were not necessary, that we'd seen someone in trouble that needed help and offered assistance. If anything what we wanted was his friendship, and companionship in our war against the orcs. <br>
<br>
This turned out to be a fine day indeed, but reflecting back on it, it seemed that I was indeed doomed to follow my fathers’ path. Perhaps not in the face of the enemy, but certainly behind where my dagger would strike true. Krelarii, Robbert and I gathered our belongings and headed to the inn for a good nights sleep. <br>
