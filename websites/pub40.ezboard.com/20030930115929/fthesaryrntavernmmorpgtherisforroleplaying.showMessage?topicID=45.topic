Panicing that his wife had set off one of his gizmos  he ran to the bedroom. “Amer get the cleric I am having the child” Hersa screamed. Puzzled Amer questioned “child? We are having a child?” Long silent pause.. “Oh MY GOD  AAAHAHAAAHAA”  Amer screamed as he went running for the cleric.<br>
<br>
	Bursting into the clerics House Amer started screaming gibberish, which gnomes are know for when the get excited about something. Gorther jumped out of bed, “what in name of B r e l l S e r i l i s, is going on”.  “HELP, HELP, CHIHELPLD, AAAHH, HECHLILPD…” SMACK, Gorther slaps Amer as hard as he can knocking him to the ground. “Now speak s  l  o  w  l  y  Amer, if I am to help you I need to know what is going on”. Amer slowly explains the whole thing. Now panicing that it took 20 minutes to get the story out of Amer, Gorther grabs his stuff and runs out in a hurry.<br>
<br>
<br>
	Amer get back to his house to find the door securely locked. Banging on the door and shouting obstinacies at the cleric for stealing his house, Amer started to attract the attention of his nabors.  One of his good friends pulled him into his house and gave him some spirits  to calm him down. Drinking spirits gets Amer into a talkative mode and he begins to ramble. Several hours later and MANY spirits later Amer is passed out on the floor.<br>
<br>
	The next day Amer awakes from a disturbed sleep. “YAWN…ahh what a good morning friend, I had the most disturbing dream last night.”.  “OH really you must tell me all about it over breakfast”.  Amer when on to explain the whole dream. After Amer was done his friend explain the truth and Amer promptly passed out again.<br>
<br>
	Several days latter Amer had finally come to terms that he was now a father. Now came the daunting task of naming the child. Amer and Hersa fought all day over a name, for their new son. Hersa had decided her son would be a great warrior some day, while Amer had decided that his son would be a Tinkerer just like him. “Hargroth is a great warrior name”. “No women he is a tinkerer I can see it in his eye’s Jarth will be his name”. Well this went on for many hours till they finally decided on Rala.<br>
<br>
	From the time Rala was very young he underwent the training of a warrior, and followed the teachings of his Father in Tinkering. He was top of his class in the Young warriors Guild, though he was weaker then most of the boys he was much faster and very nimble so they could not hit him in the mock fights they held monthly. Rala also became well known among the tinkerers as a prodigy his first invention was a small spider that recoded conversation that it heard.<br>
<br>
	Through the years as Rala aged he began to despise fighting and soon droped his warrior training, but continued to tinker. One day while creating a new device he sent his father to test it out in the field, though a lot of Gnomes devices explode killing the creator,  Rala’s never had so his father had no problem testing it for him. BOOOM!! Rala’s lab started shaking and Gizmos and Gadgets stated falling to the floor. The whole Gnome Community ran out to the testing field to see what had happened. All they saw was a great crater where the field used to be. Rala went out to look it over, staring at the ground he heard a thump and looked to his left and screamed in horror as he looked at his fathers severed head staring at him in pain.  Rala grabbed his fathers head and ran into the woods and was never seen again.<br>
 <br>
	As the years passed the horror of the accident had passed the Gnomes lives were fairly back to normal. Occasionally rumors of people seeing Rala in the woods were reported, but mostly ignored. Rala had run to the minotar caves out side his city and started to research how he could bring his father back from the dead. In his research he learned of a god that may be able to help him, Praying to the god Bertoxxulous every day. Finally after years of prayer Bertoxxulous finally  came to him and granted Rala his wish, the ability to raise his father from the dead. <br>
<br>
	Happy now that he had been granted his wish he returned to his city where he had once been hailed a hero. Only to find the people would not talk to him or let him near their houses, forcing him to seek out others that worshiped the god of Bertoxxulous. Traveling far into the depths of the city he found a small cave with many animated skeletons. Amassed that they did not try to kill him as the ones out side the city did, he ventured in. shortly after entering he heard a voice, “Rala we have been waiting for you, Bertoxxulous has told us that you would seek our help.”. “What? How? Never mind I will not question the teachings of my God” Rala mumbled confused. He walked over to where the voice had called him, stunned that there were so many that worshiped Bertoxxulous, he ran around talking to all of then to gather as much knowledge as he could. Only one would answer any of his questions and gave him a spellbook and some spell scrolls to help him start his journey.  “I am to go on a journey?” Rala asked. No further info could he get from anyone here.<br>
<br>
	Rala ventured out of his city to start his adventure. He sat down and started meditating like the Guild leader had thought him and memorized the 2 spells he had received. Testing his new spells Rala found that one would make him stronger, and the other would steal the life of another to heal him.<br>
<br>
	Many days Rala practiced his new spells, by killing rats and spiders. The money he collected from selling the body parts of the animals he had killed was fast gone being spent on food and drink to keep him alive.  Rala would stop back by the man that had helped him from time to time to see if he had anything else he could teach him. Rarely Rala would save enough money to get a new spell from the man. This helped a lot, the first spell he bought was the spell that Bertoxxulous had promised him would allow him to raise his father.<br>
<br>
	Rala hurried out to where he had stored his fathers head, holding it in his hands he began to cast the spell. To Rala’s horror his fathers head vanished and a small weak skeleton appeared next to him. Rala tried to question the skeleton, to no avail. Rala decided that the skeleton may come in handy fo carrying extra stuff that he had acquired since it seemed to follow him where ever he went. Handing his new pet all the body parts he had received from the rats Rala went on killing. During a fight he noticed that his pet was attacking the rat he was fighting. “mmm, handy indeed this pet will make me the most powerful being in all of Norrath!”.<br>
<br>
	Rala slowly began to gather more spells and become more and more powerful, killing everything he saw. Soon though Rala would venture to the minotar cave that he had sought shelter in so many years ago. As he was fighting the minotar’s he had met his first outsiders. A dark-elf Wizard by the name of Tukken and a few of his friends. This Wizard intrigued Rala he had items he had never heard of, in his never ending quest for knowledge, Rala questioned Tukken endlessly as they killed the mino’s and drakes in the area. But all to soon Tukken had to depart and promised he would, have his father Tukk give Rala a robe for being such a good friend.<br>
<br>
	A few days later Rala decided to leave his wonderful city and see the world. Shortly after leaving SteamFont Mountains he enderd the dark woods of Lesser Faydark. As Rala wandered these woods not knowing how to leave he ran right into a Dwarf in the shiniest armor, and with the biggest sword he had ever seen. “How do I leave this place?” Rala queried the hearty Dwarf. “Rala, Tukken as told me about you I am Tukk, Here take this robe as a show of my appreciation.”. Rala tanked the Dwarf as he was shown the way to the Dwarven lands of ButcherBlock Mountains.<br>
<br>
	Rala soon learned that he was not welcome by the dwarfs since he followed Bertoxxulous’s teaching. But he stayed here and killed the new and interesting creatures for a while but soon got board again.  He was able to sneak his way onto the docks, waiting for the Boats for many hours he prayed to Bertoxxulous that the boat my come soon. All of the sudden he was standing on a dock, and heard Bertoxxulous tell him welcome to Freeport my son, the city of corruption.<br>
<br>
	Rala enjoyed this new land meeting many new people. Many people we very attracted to his new white robe, many offered large amounts of money for it, but to no avail, Rala would never sell a gift he had received. Rala ventured to the land of Ro and the common lands. Soon he met a ogre for the first time, curious as usual he wandered up and started questioning the ogre. The ogre Ojornn threatened to eat the little Gnome, but Rala confident in his power stood his ground and kept asking questions. Soon they were fairly good friends and would hunt together all the time. Ojornn asked Rala if he would like to join a Guild of mercenaries call The Norrathian Legion. It didn’t take Rala long to decide, if Ojornn was in it then he would be too.<br>
