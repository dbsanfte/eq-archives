There is no braud band avalable where I live. I looked, I asked, I thretend. Thats just how it is. And even though there aint, I was still able to bust out to level 65, see my first AoW kill, see sleepers for the 1st time, see all the way to being there to kill the emp and watch ToS blow the crap out of stuff I could only dream about a year ago. So apperently haveing DIAL up dosent mean SHIT when it comes to accomplishment in EQ dose it? Not that haveing bruadband will fix any of the 'issues' I was haveing eather. Good try though. Why dont you tell me to buy a car so I can get somewhere in walking distance. I'll still get there, I still beat your short ass there, so I guess I am doing SOMETHING right.<br>

<br>
All this crying about necros being 'nerfed' Who are the other necros that are crying? I see just you little man. And where is north east? do you mean PoV? Oh yah there is some bad ass exp, I mean shit, I was hanging out in PoTactics and HoH and CoDecay... damn I'm a MORON why would a necro want to be in a zone with undead where they can charm and slow and beat the crap out of mobs. Fuck that, lets kill spiders and rocks, who for some reason have a stupidly high magic resist (yep they resist my instill doubt skill all the damn time. Oh wait, the skill is worthless no wonder.)<br>
<br>
Maybe if you are lucky someday a(n) HnE or a OOP or some other necro who obviously knows more then you do will sit down and maybe be kind enough to make you a 'Necro for dummys' video and you'll be able to see what you were doing wrong. 30 seconds longer, fucking cry me a river. Go save up, get your 64 or 65 undead charm and tell me how hard it is to solo when you have a mob that hits for 300. No I mean it. Do me a god damned favor. just try it once. I fucking dare you to grow some balls and TRY to do something other then the old school OT/Spirocs snare kite trick necros have done since FUCKING DAY ONE. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.rochester.rr.com/stalpus/euda/youduh.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

But then again, I don't see many people trying to fear kite cuz of the tiny ass little areas you have to work with.<br>
<br>
nerfed my little bitch would be something like... Oh I dont know... pets last year who took exp based on damage they did, pets running through a zone and agroing mobs left and right. Dots not doing full damage to MOVEING mobs, cuz apperently like a broken bone in PE you can RUN off damage over time spells. But you know what, if you have a spell like <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3316&amp;source=Test">Word of Terris</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> which can last for what? 3 to 30 min and you can charm up to a level 64 undead mob... maybe you just need to TRY harder and stop bitching, maybe you need to re-think your strat for being a necro. Maybe you are too used to haveing something nipping at your ass and you are just too used to getting OFF on it.  Maybe you arnt as big as you think you are and you need to spend a couple more weeks in the kiddy pool. <br>

But if you want to sit in the mud on a hill and kill rocks for phat metalic liquids and kill spiders and chear and gloat over spectral parchemtns, then be my guest. Go to town boy-san. cry like a bitch, instead of finding a weakness and makeing it a strength, piss and moan and touch yourself and ask mommy to make it better. <br>

a 60+ mob won't be immune, it will get resisted...Try fearing a valor mob euda. You can't fucking do it.<br>
I know what the hell i'm talking about, you're just an idiot. The only way to get the fear effect is to use Blind. Yes blind works.<br>

You know you can fear kite the green con dire charmable mob....I wonder why! Maybe because it's low level green con mob!<br>

and WoT had a -100 on it to start off. So lets see..thats HALF FUCKING WAY to being unresistable. By changeing that they stoped the bascily DEAD BANG garontee that a necro could just get a mob back under controle, right? Dose it still work? YES. Dose it have some lame +30 magic resist like other spells that enchanters and druids or other spells you get that make resists EVEN easyer? NO. It has been set to a base resist of 0. ZERO.<br>
<br>
All they did for THAT spell was take away your TRUMP card. I guess you should look into some Avoidance, Midigation and HP AAXP to counter that. But then again I guess every caster in the world has Lighting reflxes 5 and ND3 already. Now then what else did they change about charms that fucked it up past that?<br>
<br>
Back to fear. So a 60+ mob resisted a spell. Its not IMMUNE, meaning that it will ALWASE have NO effect, it mearly resisted the spell, in this case being fear. So apperently it resists FEAR alot. Lets just look at this again, resisted, not IMMUNE. Not the spell will ALWASE HAVE no effect what so ever, mearly that that cast did not hold, that casting of the spell did not have the desired effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright lets TRY again, SHALL WE?<br>
You said that charm was nerfed. Nerfed what then? Is it impossable for necros to solo in PoD as they did befor? DO WE HAVE ANY necros in the house who can tell me exactly what happend to spells like WoT and how they effect soloing for THEM as of RIGHT now vs befor the patch last week?<br>
<br>
Dose anybody happen to know WHY fear is often such a resisted spell that apperently dosent work? Why spells such as stun seem to hit the mark but fear is 'allwase resisted' however the mobs are not Immune to it, and what exactly this means?<br>
<br>

<br>
Instead of following that ONE dudes 'rant' with all of 2 replys, why dont you fucking walk us through your own experance to back yourself the FUCK up? Why don't you count out all of your aaxp and spells from 61-65 and what a normal Exp day is in PoV vs CoDeday for you? Why not break down on how much awsome bad ass exp you USED to get, with examples and the like vs your new school +30second trauma to get that next point now-adays.<br>
<br>
You just keep saying they 'nerfed' charm. At least this dude said something reguarding the resist change, and the fact that you all don't get a 'undead tash?' was it? You are tellin me you don't get any spells at all that debuff magic? <br>
<br>
And last I checked Rangers, Druids, Mages and enchanters all dont seem to need to fear kite to get thier exp on, so apperently fear isnt as nessisary as you think, could it be a 'worthless' spell in PoP? After being the bread and butter of the Necros for 3 and a half years? Well Bread and butter for fearkiteing necros... there are alwase the ones who didnt use it.<br>
<br>
NO seriously I am curious hows about you take your thumb out of your mouth and you take a second to, insted of calling me an idiot, as aperently I know nothing, and break it down in your own words, Spanky.  <br>

You just keep saying they 'nerfed' charm<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
You're the one who keeps bringing up charm...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Want some examples?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok!<br>
<br>
<br>
Example 1<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>or yet again kin CoD charming and killing shit in there?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Example 2<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm a MORON why would a necro want to be in a zone with undead where they can charm and slow and beat the crap out of mobs. Fuck that, lets kill spiders and rocks, who for some reason have a stupidly high magic resist (yep they resist my instill doubt skill all the damn time. Oh wait, the skill is worthless no wonder.)<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Example 3<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Maybe if you are lucky someday a(n) HnE or a OOP or some other necro who obviously knows more then you do will sit down and maybe be kind enough to make you a 'Necro for dummys' video and you'll be able to see what you were doing wrong. 30 seconds longer, fucking cry me a river. Go save up, get your 64 or 65 undead charm and tell me how hard it is to solo when you have a mob that hits for 300. No I mean it. Do me a god damned favor. just try it once. I fucking dare you to grow some balls and TRY to do something other then the old school OT/Spirocs snare kite trick necros have done since FUCKING DAY ONE. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Example 4<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>nerfed my little bitch would be something like... Oh I dont know... pets last year who took exp based on damage they did, pets running through a zone and agroing mobs left and right. Dots not doing full damage to MOVEING mobs, cuz apperently like a broken bone in PE you can RUN off damage over time spells. But you know what, if you have a spell like Word of Terris which can last for what? 3 to 30 min and you can charm up to a level 64 undead mob... maybe you just need to TRY harder and stop bitching, maybe you need to re-think your strat for being a necro. Maybe you are too used to haveing something nipping at your ass and you are just too used to getting OFF on it. Maybe you arnt as big as you think you are and you need to spend a couple more weeks in the kiddy pool.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Example 5 <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lets see as i recall -200 to a resist = unresistable right?<br>
and WoT had a -100 on it to start off. So lets see..thats HALF FUCKING WAY to being unresistable. By changeing that they stoped the bascily DEAD BANG garontee that a necro could just get a mob back under controle, right? Dose it still work? YES. Dose it have some lame +30 magic resist like other spells that enchanters and druids or other spells you get that make resists EVEN easyer? NO. It has been set to a base resist of 0. ZERO.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Please give me more examples of you talking out of your ass. Do i need to post a link for fear too for you to stfu?<br>
<br>
<br>
Euda try using complete thoughts in sentences maybe a little grammar. Maybe that way you don't come accross as someone not knowing what the fuck they're talking about. Or you're just a retard<br>

You're the one who stated 1st that it didnt work. You haven't backed it up you just file back to this one dudes post. I have yet to see your support and your examples of it. I want to see your experance with it. Dont live through some other dudes post like a god damned soccer mom. Take a god-damned chance and see whats wrong FOR yourself and then chronical it. Or is something like that too much work for you? Too labor intensive?<br>
<br>
I want you to tell me WHY and show me HOW you were effected and more then &quot;x was nerfed and y is useless.&quot; Like why are you getting expeance in PoV when you can be in some other tier 2 or 3 zone for better exp and parchment drops, such as Tactics, CoD or HoH? <br>
Have you tryed the frogs trees and giants in PoS? I want to hear what you have done that caused you to formulate this 'I have been nerfed to hell, help me Im a gnome and I'm being opressed.' dance that you are doing. Rather then be a punk ass bitch and cry about it. Why dont you take it up the ass for a second and PROVE it?<br>
