<br>
but im here to post anway some time later..<br>
<br>
Umbra you big muscleing peice of shit, You have never lead a raid, you have never inspired, how you became a officer in oop im not sure.  I remember you quitting for a long time, then back during the emp days when a lot left for hne you came back like some kind of hero, the savior of oop. LOL you saved nothing you are all talk man. you sir get the grade of middle finger.<br>
<br>
Antryg the biggest liar i have known in a decade, you sir far exceed the reputation of sir robin in monty python.  You are a coward, you are spineless, your words mean shit.  I remember back when robon quit, and several others, you the guild leader applied to hne then backed out cause zhareen would most definately not get in hne.  When you became officer i told you i thought you would turn oop around and i would stick it out to the end. I believe i achieved my promise, cause really you failed Me and the rest of oop, twice.  Half the time your online and ignore your own guild, you do not seek to be a guildleader or anything that has to do with lead but you do seek the glory typical for scum to rise to the top.<br>
<br>
Nanan good guy, good bard, lack of play times is only thing i could say bad about you.  I got along with you a lot better then half the guild seems to think lol.<br>
<br>
Boggrak you were the glue of oop, you were the only officer that had any balls.  IM sorry you have to put up with a skank whore like zhareen.  you will always be the main tank in oop, I give a rats ass about fattyfat tanking fennin you put in the time and most of the effort to get us to were oop is now. salute.<br>
<br>
Bigma HUGS, have  a rum and coke for me.<br>
<br>
Ebonsol, your one of the best players in EQ, and i belive that holds true in real life, you are a good fair guy and well respected.  <br>
<br>
Zhareen the fat bitch with no tits and takes it out on the rest of the world, while you were playing alluria in raids for the war council and helping them kill shit and eventually the emp of sraa only you could kill the same shit in oop at the same time and still become officer.  I have never respected you, you are RUde, arrogant, bitch whore. and just think you are the recruitment contact. yes you are the officer in oop that is not really an officer yet is. I remember complaining about you to antryg and he told me to be rude back that was his answer for the shit you say in guild chat in tells  and on the boards, look where that got me ? ( see antryg related part on this post). go to hell skank.<br>
<br>
khaldor my friend my foe zhareens bitch!  I swear if i wanted to play eq again and be in oop it wuold be just to spite your dumb ass! yes you the asshole who thought i did not deserve a dagger that you wanted even though i had 30 some dkp more then you. Selfish prick comes to mind, i dont know why anyone would want to be zhareen's bitch but you seem to like it, does andvari know of this ? or are you his also?  anyway you little imbred migit bastard.  I now dub you sir BITCH!<br>
<br>
Taiji you are have got to be the shittiest monk on the server, you cant pull shit without training, i guess your kinda of an amusement monk in oop, i mean we need someone to call a dumbass right ? <br>
<br>
Ronne frown! U suck, u will always suck, half the gear you have was cause you were an asskisser, i guess when we went to dkp thats why you quit playing for a while cause you knew how it would affect your gear and it showed even when you came back.  you do pull better then taiji though i must admit, wait a minute !!! never mind your the dumbass who trained the two birds in plane of fire back to back on the same raid on accident to us and whiped us.  IDDIOT !<br>
<br>
BDAAN i swear oop is perfect for you now that i think about it looking at the names i listed above.  yes bdann only  you could make a gay guy go straight.  U are an embaracement to the server, out of all the people in on the server only you make my list of dumbass bastards that are not in oop!  <br>
<br>
TOOR this is way overdue!! and you knew it was coming buddy ! you were a selfish prick.  you were the most anti american anti anything but swede i have ever seen in my life.  I remeber one day  in guild chat talking about america in conflicts in the world today.  You talked a lot of shit, and i made a reference it must be nice to live in a country that doesnt give a rats ass about anyone but themselves, and you got angry and silenced guild chat cause the conversation was not anyfun anymore cause well i was right.  FUCK you fuck you again and fuck you! I don thave a problem with anyone in sweaden but you, your dick and thats about all i can say.<br>
<br>
see in my time in oop i was one of the few who had the balls to say shit that others were affraid to.  I gained many friends and i made many enemies.  Sometimes the truth hurts and thats just the way it is.<br>
<br>
maijung, andretta, folin, opale, uniad, fealorn ( the spoon ),  and several others .. all good friends, proud to have been in a guild with you all!!!<br>
<br>
Ariennae, one of the people on saryrn if you were to call a friend you were it, hugs good luck!<br>
<br>
oh and ebonsol if i recall you said you wuold like to hear an update on my status.. here it is, I have moved, I will graduate in dec of 2003 with my associates degree, I already have a high letter of recomendation for Officer Canidate School for the United States Navy, and of course im in the Reserves till then.  Im one of the people who want to be in the military because I want to help make a difference.  <br>
<br>
God bless the USA and my fellow solgiers in Iraq/kuwait and abroad.  <br>
<br>
peace<br>

<br>
I don't normally read the BF, however after hearing you had a flame about us, I decided I had to go read wtf you had to say. Unfortunately, this isn't the level flame I had expected. Then again... it is devante, what should I expect other than a bunch of lies and bullsh*t that doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
Your the rogue who bitched me out for only allowing officers to loot on raids, the one who bitched and whined whenever a main got something over your gimp alt shaman, and who spewed enough sh*t in guildchat to make up for 90% of the rest of the guild. You don't have any ground to talk about trains with ronne (which wasn't true btw), since your suspected of starting a few of your own. I especially enjoyed your attempt to become an officer which immediately got laughed out. <br>
<br>
I'm glad your gone, and now that you are gone stfu and stfd.<br>

Why, oh why must people feel the need to post a line like this? It's as if they instantly think that because they don't read it, they are better than everyone who does.<br>
<br>
What's the matter? You feel your brain will melt at the sight of anything inflammatory about another human being? I guess your feeble little mind can't handle reading the newspaper or turning on the news then either. <br>
<br>
It cracks me up how people come here and say 'well, I don't read the furnace&quot; or &quot;I don't post here because ...yada yada yada&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you don't read here, or post here due to any particular reason, then why be a fucking hypocrite and be posting shit like the above line. Just shut the fuck up, go back to your normal day of not posting/reading the furnace, and leave the rest of us nutcases be.<br>

 Ibiduin the thing about somthing over my alt your a tad bit wrong see loot in oop is main hydra trial recruit.  I feel sorry for you I really did forget to post your name on the origional portion of my post.  You are another dumb ass who cant do anything on your own, you have to have your hand held when mommy takes you to the store. <br>
<br>
hydra &gt;  so fuck off, once again I did not make the rules.<br>
<br>
Bdaan your the only person i know that takes so many personal attacks from your own guild openly doesnt say much for you.  Really considering that fact when you reply on my post i laugh.<br>
<br>
Oh and if anyone thinks Umbra is made of gold your wrong.  In all honesty I got along with him great till my last day in OOP.  I guess everyone can have an off day maybe that was it, regardless this is how I feel about him now.  <br>

I know Umbra far better than any of you (save for Morloc), and I know that you made comments towards him that not only you had no business making, but if you actually followed through on your implied threats, you'd end up a very bloody mess.<br>
<br>
Besides, the greatest detriment to Umbra's ability to help OoP isn't a lack of commitment to the guild, it's the abundance of commitment to his marriage.  I'm sure the people who matter in OoP know that, anyway.<br>

wonderful comeback. yeah, I need mommy to go to the store, and this from a person I've never met in real life. I killed your basis for saying shit, so you had to resort to something you made up. Oh wait... you made up most everything above too. <br>

Oh... and to garhbad. I made the reference to not reading the BF not to sound superior. I mentioned it cause devante choose to flame a bunch of people a place they don't read. example : I highly doubt toor will ever read this, unless someone tells him about it.

Of all the shots you took though, I just wanna say Toor is one of the best leaders I've ever met in EQ and he's 10x the player you ever was/will be. His opinions about america are commonly shared in europe as well. Not to derail this thread, but maybe you should consider how it would be to live outside the USA and see some big country across the sea is trying to police the world: police, judge and executioner all in one !
