Mind you, I've only done a couple dungeons &amp; have yet to actually explore the Takish one.<br>
<br>
I like that they're not the easiest things to do, except if your some people (you know who you are :-P) who just pacify everything, to get to the named boss mob, just to get points...  Expect pacification to be resisted ALOT more in the next patch.  I've found that if you do the dungeon straight up, kill as you go, your generally ok.  A little luck is a factor.<br>
<br>
Sometimes drops of items to collect can be tedious.  You can get no drops for 10 mins = 15 mobsish &amp; then the next 3 mobs all drop a part.  The Commotion that leads you to a boss is a bit bizarre too.  You can hear &quot; it &quot; through wall sometimes &amp; it lead you to dead ends, which I'm not sure is a bug or part of the variance &amp; crawl aspect.<br>
<br>
I've not done all adventure types yet, such as rescue etc.  Until I've played all dungeons &amp; done a couple adventures per I can't say which I like more atm.  I did like MMC though, but apparently its what everyone says is easiest to do &amp; most are doing those ones.  I'm curious as to the items some of the more remote dungeons merchants bring up.<br>
<br>
The only thing I don't like is the points not being able to be spread between dungeon types, minus a few generic things like spells.  What's going to happen is people aren't going to do dungeons not of their paticular dungeon preference type (which atm is MMC, cause most seem to think its the easiest).  I'm not pointing fingers, but Findail, has 26 wins &amp; 1 fail (at least of last night) with the 26 wins all from MMC.  How this will affect things later I'm not sure, either of grouping or whatever.<br>
<br>
Best thing so far to me is NO RESPAWN.  I love this, that I don't have to watch me back of mob timing, after you've progressed in.<br>
<br>
Overall I'm enjoying it alot, but who knows what it will be like in a months + time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xamm>Xamm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/12/03 9:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5403.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Expansion - pros and cons</span><hr size=1> I've yet to try any of the dungeons yet.

<br>
For the &quot;Joe Average&quot; player, like me, I find the normal dungeons a challenge that keeps you engaged and concentrating to the very end.<br>
<br>
So far, my opinion: this has been the best expansion.  I am extremely pleased.<br>
<br>
With only a few adventures in each, I found Rujarkan to be the easiest, and Deepest Guk to be the hardest.  Though, I will take MMC over others when I have my wife with me.  She just mows down the undead.<br>

(Can't remember the name) I have succeeded twice and failed miserably once. The failure was our first attempt and we didn't have a well rounded group. I have also completed one of the Bottom Guk adventures. All of these have been rescue missions. It is really a rush when you are down to 10 minutes and you just found the main room. 10 mobs to clear and still lead the princess or whatever all the way back to the exit.<br>
<br>
As a Rogue, I am loving this. It is also cool that finally I am back in high demand like in the Velious days. I have found that pacify only works about 60% of the time, and wastes too much time anyway, so we never really use it. I find it gratifying to see a chanter work his/her magic. Storm a room, everyone assists, and chanter works like mad to control the other 5 mobs.<br>
<br>
The only thing i don't like is the wait for corpses to pop. Twice we have taken a shaman as our only healer and no paladin. Both times we had a death or two and had to finish the mission, then leave he dungeon and sit on our hands for 30 minutes while waiting for bodies to pop. The whole chest/trap deal is going to be really cool when we get more accustomed to the battles and can finish them quicker. It will give me more time to work my roguely magic and possibly find more charms, etc.<br>
<br>
For now, it is a breath of fresh air, and I can't wait until I get off work so I can hurry home, log on, and 10 minutes later be back on an adventure. Best release since the original software IMHO.<br>

I'll squeeze him &amp; hug him next time I see him, just to prove it *wink wink*.<br>
<br>
I was merely stating a fact with the whole dungeon concept.  People are getting  picky on what they will do.  Last night while getting a clr, we had 1 that still was lfg, cause he / her would only do MMC dungeons, absolutely no others.  So, we picked up another one that was willing to do our preplanned one.  We had 5 &amp; were gearing for a guk one &amp; cause some had not tried that one yet.  Now this isn't really a slight or opinion decision.  Its the way the points work.<br>
<br>
You sorta are focused to 1 dungeon &amp; get as many points as possible due to points not spreading out between the 5 campments, minus generic stuff.  I'm not sure what the points max is at any dungeon, so who knows how many adventures you'd have to successfully gain to see the limit, before you may try a new dungeon on top of when you spend em.<br>
<br>
Its the only flaw I've found so far, by design to what I'd personally want.  Its not really different to normal dungeons, as some people refuse to hunt in normal zones over others.  Don't get me started on PoJ :-P<br>
<br>
I think I just had envisioned the campments being sorta related on their skill / points system, rather than totally seperate.  This being a totally personal opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kotos>Kotos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/12/03 1:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5403.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Expansion - pros and cons</span><hr size=1> My apologies, its all text.<br>
<br>
The Adventure Point system not quite as rigid as that (AFAIK).  You have to earn points in one camp in order to see better items in that camp.  However, you can spend points earned at any camp, at any other camp.  You just have to convince the local camp's Merchant to sell you the really nice stuff he/she has (by completing adventures for them).<br>
<br>
So, for the first little while, people will either stick with what they know and feel comfortable with, or will try and earn points toward a known item thats only sold at one camp.<br>
<br>
There's now a spoiler thread on the Safehouse about which merchants sell what items.<br>
<br>
So, if I was Findail (for example), and I wanted to get my lvl65 song Call of the Muse, I would spend all my time at the only camp that has a merchant known to sell it until I got it (not in BB btw).  I would also watch out for random hugs and squeezes.  On a side note, I don't think Vainne would respond well to being called George, but thats pure speculation.<br>

And there are a nice variety of mobs that continue to surprise us (like minibosses that mez your tank ^^).<br>
<br>
The biggest flaw, and Enrapture might have picked up on this, is that only certain expensive spells are at certain camps, that is, the cleric's level 64 group reverence spell is on the BB camp vendors. because we can only get the spell if we get enough points at the BB camp, you will find that just about all 65 clerics will only want to group at one camp, BB. This can really put alot of people off and I hope (everyone shoud lfeedback it) verant removes the restrictions on puchasing goods cross camps. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for the pacify exploit, I havnt tried it myself (only one of my runs have been a boss fight, the rest have been collect the xx items) but I can imagin except for the rare times you cant target a mob, it is pretty easy to run to a boss with pacify. It would suck if they had to make it resist just for that, maybe they should impliment a LDoN only version of pacify that has low resist and longer recast times.<br>

On the contrary, I would be honored to be named after George. Do you even know him? I mean...did you?<br>

His life was short and brutal, and he died to save us all. And ignore the rumors about the luau.<br>
