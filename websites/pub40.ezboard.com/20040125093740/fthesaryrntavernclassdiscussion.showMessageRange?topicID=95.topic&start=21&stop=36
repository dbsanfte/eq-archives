I also made a gnome necro, got to lvl 8 or maybe it was 9 but anyway, i hate mana, there is never enuff mana and it runs out quickly so i got bored. Also i made a bard because friend's bard was kicking ass but bards are hard to play and can't tank for crap, also it's hard to find a group sooo.. i droped the bard.<br>

<br>
I started an enchanter, cuz after having had shots of my friends (Jantalic's) enchanter, I kinda liked it.<br>
<br>
Tho I still continue to pull with my enchanter but its worse now cuz I keep trying to hit the heal spells I no longer have when I see my group members health go down.<br>
<br>
Chose a chanter cuz they are supposed to be one of the more 'involved' classes where as are clerics are one of the 'boring sit on yer butt and get up and cast a spell every once in a while' classes, so was a change from the norm for me.<br>
<br>
So guess, cuz it was fun, cuz it seemed like a new challenge but also cuz after playing me ranger, I wouldnt ever pick a non-essential class again to play this game with, cuz sitting at zones for hours on end with LFG up just didnt do it for me with my ranger.<br>

When progress in getting levels became slower, I decided to try a few twinks. Took a druid to 11 since I'd thought at times I should have chosen one instead of a ranger. Nope - didn't suit me. <br>
<br>
Then I tried a wiz for stress relief. Figured when idjits peeve me, I'll just go nuke stuff. Played her to 17, mostly in Unrest. Challenging at first but got pretty routine. I missed being able to &quot;help&quot; others with buffs, too. Nothing I could do but nuke... Haven't played the wiz in months.<br>
<br>
So I've started a chanter. Just hit the magic 16 the other night. Breeze! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm really enjoying her. Chanters are HARD to learn to play well, and I like the challenge. I also think I'm going to enjoy being in demand, since life as a ranger does not often give you that feeling (at least not from folks that don't know you really well).<br>
<br>
I still mostly play my main, but my chanter is in no danger of being retired in the near future. She's fun! Only major hassle so far (besides that cursed spellbook again) is that chanters have soooo many spells they should come with quickloaders. I may get burnt out just changing spells. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ulaerielarcanium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laeriel Arcanium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/12/01 8:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you all pick your secondary's class?  </span><hr size=1> I started playing a Shadow Knight on Morle Thule way back in earily 2000, then when saryrn was made i created a character to play witha  bunch of my friends from veeshan(RL Friends), Laeriel who is my main.

So I made a Half elf ranger for the change.  Took awhile to teach myself how to pull, but I soon found that the ranger class is infinitely more fun to play.  Considered by many as non-essential class, but I've found that a ranger who knows his role is highly useful in most groups, and is actually sought out in some situations for dmg / snare.  Tracking is also invaluable in certain zones  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .

Got a little tired of being totally reliant on groups, so I decided to start a necro, that I could use to go and solo when I cant get a group with the cleric or ranger.

Personal decisions aside...<br>
<br>
For a secondary, just pick something as far different from your primary as possible. It gives options and at least the style of play may be different enough to get you through the boredom of the lower levels. <br>
<br>
For a mule, use the SAME class/race as your primary so that it can use body slot to hold class specific secondary armor. My primary is a Shaman with a full set of Totemic, however, the mule wears it 99% of the time without tying-up bank slots.<br>

I just make other characters now and then and screw around with them until i'm bored.  The highest is only like 14- Dangleberry my Troll Shaman.  Not sure if i'll play him or not, I'm trying to decide which of my alternates to concentrate on (when I'm not playing Mantrid of course), there's Bitey the halfling Rogue, Kaaii the Human Monk, and Clouster the Iksar Warrior.  Kaaii is already at level 10 i managed to buy him a FBSS and having a 51 druid available on a separate PC helps that hehe.<br>
<br>
I'm probably going to focus on the warrior or the rogue- the reason being that they seem to be quite appreciative of any equipment i can hand down to them.  Thinking of putting everything on my Iksar warrior - FBSS, Arbitor's Combine Greatsword, lol wait that's all the spare equipment i have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rogues seem like they have the potential to be tons of fun though... <p>Mantrid Dronemaker<p>

Made a few different characters to start - question of learning the game.  Eventually landed with a necro I really enjoyed.  Soloed my butt to 52...that's when it started to really get boring.  Necros are not really welcomed in group (besides guildies...but small guild means few chance).  So it was time to get a real secondary.<br>
<br>
In my days as a necro I'd spent a lot of time acting as resident mezz box for my groups.  Yes necros can mezz and be pretty good at it too if you didn't know already.  Since I enjoyed the role so much, I decided I might as well make a real mezzer with the proper tools.<br>
<br>
Necro was raped, stole his stuff, get the chanter going and then deleted the necro.  If I didn't delete, I'd always go back due to the fact I'd spent so much time on it.  And chanter would never progress.<br>
<br>
Well, Louath is lvl 34 now, strong and kicking (well, mezzing at least) and back in Lower Guk for a second run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So for me was just finding something I'd really enjoy playing and would not always be stuck alone in my corner.<br>

(*recruited Louath Tuesday in NFP for my ass/sup group*).<br>
<br>
My main is a cleric.  I wanted a class that would be so needed in groups that he would be able to go to many neat places.  Problem is that he needs to group.  Plus most of my activity is following someone to some room in some place and sitting against a wall, standing only to buff or heal.  (I do nuke a bit (evocation 200+) and bash sometimes.)<br>
<br>
My first alt was a necro.  He was fun for soloing.  Although I got somewhat bored with him and left him at 21.<br>
<br>
My second alt was a rogue.  He is probably my favorite alt.  It is fun to be on the damaging end of the stick.<br>
<br>
My third alt was a wizzie.  I like him too.  He has the advantage of being able to solo and being somewhat desired in groups.<br>
<br>
My cleric stays poor because he tends to hand down his neat stuff.  Drives my wife crazy.<br>

By 14 I was bored and realized that my wisdom sucked and I never put points into Channel (Oh man was it fun...I couldnt cast ANYTHING) so I gave up on a caster and played a warrior until 21, I got annoyed in unrest when I would take ghouls for the group, we'd get overpowered, I'd get rooted and left for dead. So I quit that and started Sanas, I put all my warriors equip on him and play him til 11 or 12. Again I got bored because of there lack of tanking ability much like Nanan. Then I started a mage for no apparent reason and played him until 13. By then I had been playing EQ for a while and a friend of mine had come across some GeB's and let me have them. I sold them for at the time a huge amount (Paw of Opalla and 12k) so I decided to go try my bard again and decked him out in Full Lambent and a Yak (at that time they were rediculously expensive, I think on the verge of 10k each) I started playing him a lot (when you had that equip soloing in Oasis wasnt hard) and eventually got him up to 30. Again I got bored and started a cleric, played him til 15 and guess what happened? Got bored...started playing my bard again, got him to 35...hell got bored again...started a rogue just for kicks because I had a ton of extra gear lying in the bank that would fit him. Played him til what must of been level 12 when I got bored again and started a monk because everyone was starting monks by then, played him til 22 when I took a break from EQ for about a month. Finally I foraged a 2nd computer from stuff I had around the house and borrowed a friends druid to get sanas in gear and level him up. Powerleveled him to 40 then started grouping. Played Sanas mainly from then on out. <br>
<br>
after writing this I realize it doesnt do much with the topic and more my history, but I chose all my secondary's out of sheer curiousity mainly, to see what it was like. <br>

ps...there was probably a mountain of other characteers that never made it past 5. <br>
