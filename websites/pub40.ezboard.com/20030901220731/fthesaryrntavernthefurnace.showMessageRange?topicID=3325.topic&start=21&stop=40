Whether it was wrong or right.  Who won.  I'm not trying to refer to those elements at all.  I agree with what Maneta said in her last post.  What I am trying to point out is that the policy people loved so much is the same policy people hate so much now.  TWP(The worlds Policeman) policy was the same policy that got us into almost every fight in modern times.  The point is when people applaud TWP against Germany and then bash it against Vietnam they are being quite hypocritical imo.  Its the same policy.  You can't have your cake and eat it to, there is no perfect foreign policy that would please the world.  People wanted us to be TWP in WW2 but now its wrong?  But next week it will be right again?  bs.  People wanted the US to be TWP.  So here we are.  Now people critisize the US for being exactly what the world helped to mold it into.<br>

Its interesting that G.W. has now stated they &quot;need more time&quot; to show irrifutable proof of WMD, when just prior to military action, Hans Blix said the exact same thing months ago when he made his report to the UN security council.<br>

If there were WMD in iraq, France's delay certainly helped sadam conceal them.  At the very least, the delay made it easier for sadam loyalist to secure liquid assest that they are now using to pay attackers and organized resistance in iraq.<br>
<br>
There is one thing that really pissed me off as an American.  From what I could tell from the news, France blocked strong language UN resolutions which were totally inline with the consequences outlined in the previous UN resolutions from the gulf war.  That is, setting an ultimatum on wmd inspections and allowing for war if Iraq didnt comply.  To me, it appeared that France was turning a blind eye to Iraq's breach of Un resolutions from the gulf war because it had a financial stake in Iraq.  <br>

It was petty grandstanding to draw attention to themselves and imo they put their own(the politicians involved) self-interests above what they knew to be right.  They played on the fears of their own people which were brought on by their own &quot;Media Propaganda Machine&quot;.  If you want to talk about &quot;Media Propaganda Machines&quot; you should be looking inside Canada.  Your own gov't supports squashing American language and culture.  In the US squashing Canadian culture or language would be called a violation of the 1st Ammendment to the Constitution.  Not to mention discrimination.  I like how outsiders try and play off everything as a media brainwashing.  Like people in the US are some how not as intelligent as the rest of the world, then in the same breathe they call us arrogant(hmm hypocracy?).  I am especially annoyed by the French and canadian media's(and the goverment's for that matter) constant reminders about how arrogant the US is.  Been to France lately?  6 years ago I went to Paris on a business trip.  You have'nt fucking seen arrogance until you've walked the streets of Paris asking people for directions to a bathroom(or anything for that matter).  I can't say everyone in the city is that way(I did find someone who gave directions) but I can say I would have had much MUCH better luck asking people in New York or LA in a foreign language than I did in Paris.  I was refused service in a restraunt by an English speaking waiter because I would not(could not) make my order in French.  In America that's called discrimination.  It would'nt happen.  Not to mention where I'm from if that happened half the room would get up and walk out and never come back.  Anyways, I don't disagree that the whole WMD thing is a clusterfuck.  If Bush was lying I'm right there with everyone else calling bullshit.  But you cannot categorize 271 million people as being any one thing.  Whether its arrogant, stupid, or racist.<br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jamesoregan.com/Selling_Film/government.htm">www.jamesoregan.com/Selli...rnment.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Canadian public policy did try several years ago but succumbed to Mr. Valenti. (Jack Valenti, chief US movie lobbyist and world traveler in defense of the US right of penetration into foreign movie markets.) In the title match, Copps vs Valenti, the Canadian economic wrestling team failed to keep their eye on the prize and reduced themselves to simply another corporate player in the face of the Valenti Posse. They forgot that they represented a sovereign nation, one that had placed quotas in two other cultural arenas: music and TV. For a cursory look at US understanding of barriers to economic activity, consult THE 1996 FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS REPORT.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There's just one example that I could find on short notice.<br>
<br>
The usa has always pushed Canada around.  Why? Because they can.  Canadians suffer from a staggering lack of patriotism.  We are our own worst enemy.  Half the industry where I live is owned by foriegn companies (a local utlity here is in fact run by Aquila, an enronesque company)<br>
<br>
<br>
So the lesson here is<br>
<br>
1) Canadians let it happen<br>
2) then we bitch about it<br>
<br>
but<br>
<br>
this does not make the Canadian media the demon-spawn that you seem to be implying Loch.<br>
<br>
<br>
The real meaning of all this is that when people have power, no matter what race/nationality, they will more often than not abuse it.  Power of guns or power of the media no difference, it will be abused.  And those of us sitting at home in front of the PC will whine a bit and begrudgingly buy it. (though some morons will undoubtedly swallow everything hook line and sinker)<br>

&quot;It has, however, been opposed by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA—whose President, Jack Valenti, I refer to as &quot;The Godfilmer&quot;). Whenever there has been proposed legislation to get films on more Canadian screens, the MPAA has pressured the American government to pressure the Canadian government not to go ahead with it. To date, the MPAA has been wildly successful.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This puts me on the wrong side of public opinion, which has it that the Canadian film industry well and truly sucks. My response to this stance is usually, &quot;How would you know?&quot; Most people have little opportunity to see Canadian films, which are shown on only three percent of screens in the country. Roughly three percent is non-North American; the balance comes from the United States. Since access to Canadian films is severely limited, most people's negative impression of them is based on hearsay—as well as the Canadian propensity to knock anything home-grown—or, at most, one or two negative experiences with Canadian film. This is like saying American films are horrible based on a single screening of The Wash.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, this was written by a Canadian, so it must be BULLSHT right?<br>

<br>
Yea...Canadians stifle American culture. Just look how american movies dominate our theatres!!  Fucking Canadians!!<br>

<br>
You left off Canadians, I'm sure we've hated the Canadians at some point.<br>
<br>
Seriously though, the US is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't position.  As the last real remaining super-power, we're condemned for something, no matter what actions we take.  People can't agree on anything else, why the hell would people start actually agreeing on global policy?<br>
<br>
Should the US have gone to war with Iraq?  Who really knows.  What is clear, is that the UN was ineffectual in supporting it's on resolutions, like a parent who stands there saying 'You're gonna be in trouble if you do that again...' over and over and over again.  Right or wrong though, US intelligence showed he had WMDs and Bush was convinced it was in ours and the world's best interests to do something about it if the UN wasn't.  Even Hillary Clinton, who speaks out against almost anything Republican, says she can't fault Bush for acting on that intelligence, because it's the very same intel Bill got when he was in office.<br>
<br>
Does the US often act in it's own best interests, of course it does.  Does every other country do the exact same thing?  Yup.  People are pissed off at the French because they played their little games to protect their illicit oil deals with Iraq, figuring if we lost, Iraq would still be their buddy and if we won, we'd forgive and forget.<br>
<br>
I kind of see Saddam as the Rthen of the middle east.  He was more interested in being defiant than anything else.  If he really did have no WMDs, he sure put on a good show of acting like he did.  This whole situation could have been resolved 10 years ago, but we bowed to international pressure and instead of ousting him, we allowed the UN to handle the matter.  Whatever his reason for doing it, he was openly defiant of UN resolutions and played nothing but games when it came to having or not having WMDs. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5948">Duke Krazaak Crushbone</a> &lt<a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a>&gt<BR>

Is that the best you can come up with?  I reacted in the manner that I did due to your intense hostility (which seems to be based on ignorance about Canada, since youve provided no facts just opinions):<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; If you want to talk about &quot;Media Propaganda Machines&quot; you should be looking inside Canada. Your own gov't supports squashing American language and culture. In the US squashing Canadian culture or language would be called a violation of the 1st Ammendment to the Constitution. Not to mention discrimination&quot;<br>

The Canadian Gov't supports squashing American language and culture. I provided my rebuttal.  And the best you can come up with is that im childish?  <br>
