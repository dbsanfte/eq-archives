After much exploration through the twisty caverns, we managed to hack, slash, blister, bathe, and encase our way back to the entrance of the foul place. While we had managed to come across a few small items (including a dusty ransacker's pack found upon one of the spectral guardians we waylaid), we felt a calling for greater spoils, and immediately plunged back into the dungeon in search for more. <br>
    Soon we found ourselves in a large cavernous room with one broken door. The druids of our party began to detect a presence other than that of the regular arachnids or undead we had been accustomed to slaying that night: we began tracking a tortured librarian, who, by legend, was said to hold powerful treasures, including a tome which could grant strong magical powers to one who might make use of magical crafts. We began our search for this creature, looping our way around the walls toward the being while slaying monsters with relative ease. Soon we stepped into (and nearly fell through) a large room with the majority of the floor deteriorated. There was a passageway at each of the walls, but a pit separating the way inbetween. As we began to consider solutions to this small dilemna, for a moment I pondered the magnificence of this place in its prime, seeing the fragments of marble left scattered about. <br>
    We were close to our bounty--I could sense it especially.  I glanced at my party members as to see what they were thinking.  Muhobbit, a stout dwarven warrior, stared somewhat apprehensively into the pit, but I could see in his eyes that his mind was considering the next fiend that would fall victim to his blades, and not how we were going to cross the pit.  I sat on the ground and began to stare, gathering my thoughts.  Berrie stepped in front of me, a pleasant and content looking halfling.  She seems to have a smile and a hug prepared even in the most dire of situations.  In this particular one, she had bat wing, and my body lifted as she chanted a few words of levitation.  A puny task it would be to cross now, a small leap of faith. Soon we were all ready to make our run across. On the wall to the right where we had entered, a small walkway of intact flooring stretched out across the room, giving us a great chance of making it to the far wall. <br>
    I walked out to the edge and judged the distance across--definitely possible. We began crossing one by one, keeping our heads looking upwards as we floated along. Kenuvin was the first to cross, the eldest in our group, and a great druidic leader and brother.  We all followed suit one by one, but alas! Saynt lost his footing just as he reached the edge and sank to the floor of the pit. We quickly decided to join him in the pit to keep the ranks together...and what fortune became of this misfortune! Soon after we sank to the floor we discovered a pathway leading far down into the earth...to what appeared to be a large open temple. We began to see guardians and minions of Xolgoz...a strange name...and strange beings they were. Ethereal forms created to guard a place that must have been abandoned for a time that Tunare only knows! Our magics paired with Muhobbit's brawn were successful in putting these spirits to rest, however. <br>
    We were able to easily navigate around what developed into a large compound of temple walls and rooms, full of these minions and various undead.  After some time, however, Saynt and Muhobbit became weary, and had to make an untimely departure. This was a major handicap to our exploration group, as Muhobbit was our only warrior, and Saynt, though not with knowledge of magics as strong as Berrie and I, was a formidable druid brother that I considered my equal. As I watched our dwarf and halfling friends step into their mystic portals to safety, our party was reduced to three druids. <br>
    We decided that it would be wise to make our way back up towards the entrance, but as we rounded the large marble walls that appeared to be the area we had begun at, we found ourselves only further into the depths of the dungeon, and soon at the steps of what appeared to be the main cathedral of this evil place! We could see guardians and minions in every direction, and we were soon accosted by some of the wandering patrol. Through well placed snares by Kenuvin we were able to avoid their harmful touch, while our druidic magics decimated their evil energies. I scouted around the cathedral, curious as to the purpose of this building. I marveled at the terrifying, yet magnificent handiwork put into the creation of this building. Emmaculate stained glass, yet in the shape of ghosts and demons. I could see Berrie shiver somewhat at the sight of this place, though it could have been easily from the feeling surrounding it as well--she wasn't smiling.  I could see the aura of powerful magic being cast from inside this place, and began to wonder what power lie in this place. <br>
    One by one we began to dispatch the beings surrounding the building as to make our way to the entrance, but as I was chasing a fleeing guardian I became separated from the group. Suddenly I sensed Kenuvin's life force dwindling at an alarming rate! I quickly abandoned the task at hand as I rushed back down the corridor towards my party. I gasped as I saw a huge clawed fiend slash a gaping wound into Kenuvin's side. This could be none other than the dreaded Xolgoz himself! It appeared to be a large mass of simply muscle tissue, fangs, and razor sharp claws. Whoever created this monstrosity didn't even think to bother with skin! Throughout our entire adventuring that night I had never seen such a demonstration of power, and this was a truly formidable and threatening opponent. <br>
    I quickly began to recite the incantation of healing I had memorized, but with a an anxious tone I'm sure as I sensed Kenuvin's life continuing to slip away--my casting was taking too long! Just as I was about to give up hope, I saw blue magic swirling about Kenuvin as his wounds began to close. Soon I completed my spell and he looked even better. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Berrie manage a small smile at me, though the look of concern on her face was great and now was most definitely not the time for celebration! Kenuvin quickly made distance and slowed the beast down with his magical snare, which would be the vital determinant in our victory. <br>
    The fiend desperately tried to claw out at us, but his fleshy legs were bound such that his movement was much too easy to predict. We formed a triangle around the being and began to unleash our most destructive spells, the extremes of nature, from sheets of ice to baths of starfire. The creature, bombarded on all sides, found it difficult to determine who to come after. Wave after wave of blasts bombarded the creature, but we watched as it still made after us with consuming ferocity. However, over time we eventually drained the beast of its energies...it could only take so much punishment from the elements. As he stiffened after being encased in the final rift of frost, starfire struck and melted away the ice, along with any life he had remaining. Xolgoz slumped to the to the dirt floor, a strange mixture of wet, yet charred flesh. Kenuvin quickly rushed over and knelt in front of the corpse to inspect for plunder. We all gathered around the smoldering corpse to see a rather grotesque but fairly powerful weapon. <br>
    Of the mass, the fang from this beast was easily distinguished as the prize of this kill. The weapon could be wielded by none other than a highly skilled warrior...though upon further identification we discovered the mere possession of it would grant strength, agility, dexterity, and stamina! After a quick game of dice to relieve tensions and discover who would take the fang, I knelt down in front of the body and tore off the fang.  The corpse seemed to melt away into the soil, and I felt a magical bond upon putting the item into my bag.  I knew then that it could not be traded amongst mortals. Immediately I thought of our dwarven warrior Muhobbit and sighed.  If only he had stayed but a while longer!<br>
    Despite our victory the battle was not over. In fact, with the leader being destroyed, his minions seemed to be very upset with us...we soon found ourselves fighting guardian after guardian while being weakened from our long battle with Xolgoz. I called upon the roots of the subterranean cavern to my aid and was able to hold some of the monsters at bay, but soon we found ourselves backed into a corner. <br>
    We quickly decided that it was time to make a hasty retreat. I used most of the remainder of my magics securing the monsters with the engulfing roots, while saving a small amount with which to gate. I watched as Berrie faded away, then prepared my gating incantation. I watched Kenuvin but didn't see his action. I was still unsure as the folds of time and space became undone and I stepped through my magic portal and into safety. Berrie was fine, I was fine...but what of Kenuvin? I have faith that he made his escape and will be adventuring with us again soon. Meanwhile, I decided to make the best use of the Xolgozian fang that I could. <br>
    I made my way to my home town of Kelethin and waited almost as anxiously as I did when I was a child for the lifts to drop to the forest floor. I ran towards my guild and directly to the heartwood master. As I opened the door I could hear him casting.  He first thought I was there for some training, and after assuring him I was not, he prompted me to one of his vendors, who thought I would be interested in some small patchwork boots she just got in.  Flustered, I simply pulled out the fang and wove it in his face...it was very memorable, interrupted his spell and everything! I decided to place the fang in my home druid guild as both a tribute to Tunare and to the fine works of my druid brother and sister. We will return to that place one day and reap the treasures we originally sought to gain, plus many more. Until that day, we have one great keepsake to share, as well as many great memories.<br>
