In the distance phantoms and apparitions could be seen. Iksar skeletons cackled through the night and golems grunted their protests. <br>
<br>
It took many long hours to track down the entrance amongst the ruins that lie in the Emeral Jungle. Searching for any sign of civilization other than the vermin that inhabited the ruins. Looking at the map we'd bought, and pulling out the sextant we knew we were close. Our shaman cast his favors on us and we were running like the wind to the coordinates on the map. We'd almost overlooked it as another pile of ruins untill we'd noticed the entrance.<br>
<br>
Walking into the ancient ruins of the City of Mist, aptly named from the mist in the jungle,  we laid our eyes on things that were the abomination of the living. Moving through the streets of the once life filled city proved to be easy untill we were assaulted by several ghosts. Apparently these ghosts didn't like our invading of their once sacred city, deemed protectors before their lifes ends had been met, they were bound to protect their city even after death. Habidagus shouted a few arcane words and the apparitions were surrounded in a white fire, causing significant damage. Having a high cleric in your midst is a great honor,  I'd learned to respect and trust this person with my life, as well as risking my life to save this person. It was a mutual understanding and was never brought about in words. Again he chanted his banishment and again the apparition was brought down to it's knees in a flash of white. Several times this happened and at the end of the first skirmish several ghosts had been slain.<br>
<br>
I bent down and inspected the corpse of this once great warrior reduced to etheral lifelessness. Why did the dead still have need for gold? A question I'll never be able to answer other than to say it is only the nature of the living to have such wants. The other corpses yielded nothing of importance and we made our way deeper in. At this junction was a high stone archway and a gate blocking our way, guarding this gate were several more ghosts and a few skeletons. Practicing the incantations I'd been taught in my limited clerical schooling, I protected myself from the sight of the dead. I ran quickly by the undead foes with no notice from them. This was good, I was in a position where I had the advantage. Searching further in I could see that we had no opposition, these three foes were all that stood between us and our destination. I signalled back to the group and they came charging at the lifeless with full on bore. Lothe struck the first apparition with his mighty sword, Habidagus cast his incantations causing significant damage, our enchantress put the others in a trance while we laid destruction to their companion. The shaman chanted a few words, and a blue sparkle swirled around the apparitions, fast at first then slowing rapidly. From that point on the apparitions moved as if they were covered in glue, very slow and every movement looked like serious effort. With this advantage we brought the foes down with little to no effort. <br>
<br>
Leading the rest of the part to where I'd scouted was easy, there was no opposition barring our forward progress and camp could be set. The fires being lit and the tents pitched I decided to scout around our immediate area for any possible dangers. Walking through the next coridoor brought me face to face with the likes of something I'd only read about in storybooks. A huge haze golem towered over me, casting it's featureless gaze upon me. Immediately I knew I had to run back to the camp for help. The golem released a loud grumble, almost like an alarm and 3 more minions of this lost city followed him. I shouted back to the group and let them know of incoming danger. Once reaching the camp I wheeled around drawing my sword and chanting the words that would adhere the golems feet to the ground. It didn't understand it's predicument and I acted upon that by engaging it's companion. A very large Sarnak skeleton bored down on me clawing at my breastplate and arms, I parried the first attack, riposted with the second and laid in a gash on his right collarbone. This didn't seem to phase the monstrosity and it's fierce attack insued. I was running out of breath deflecting it's oncoming blows, Lothe had his hands full with the other phantasm that had disturbed his meditation, and it appeared I would be fighting this foe on my own. Again and again I brought my blade bearing down on lichen covered bone, splintering it here and gouging it there, my attack was just as brutal but I was running low on stamina. The trek through the jungle and previous battles had taken it's toll. Calling for the power given me by Karana I forced the skeleton back a few feet away from me, stunning it and giving me enough time to invigor myself. I ran back at the abomination and sliced and chopped as if I'd had a good nights sleep. Power was seeping back into me and it felt good. Lothe had just finished his opponent off when the golem had broken free of it's magical binds, none to soon as it bore down on me with the strength of five men. Stunned by the bash it delivered to my head I couldn't attack, shaking it off I laid the killing blow on the skeleton that was now attempting to run to safety. The golem was persistent in his beating on me and I would soon crumple under it's sheer might. Lothe taunted the beast, calling it a pile of walking dirt and it attacked him instead of me. Habidagus chanted his magic incantation and I was bathed in a blue light. Feeling wounds heal as I had so many times before I stepped back into combat to assist Lothe in dispatching the golem. While the beast hit hard, he was no easy target to miss. Standing taller than an Ogre and being nearly twice as wide, the beast didn't show any signs of pain as I hacked away at it's backside. Habidagus closed his eyes, waves his hands in a gesture of power bringing them down over his head, back and then forward in a thrust towards the creature all at the same time shouting at the top of his lungs, "Karana, I call forth your power to cast judgement upon this foe! Channel your storms fury through me so that it can feel the reckoning of the gods!" and with that a suprising amount of flashing red electrical lightning was slammed into the Golem, killing it in one blow. <br>
<br>
We were all very spent after that battle, it took considerable time to recouperate. The wounds weren't severe, but did require attention. We suffered little as Habidagus cast his healing magics upon us. We all needed time to rest and regain our focus. Setting out my bedroll, sword by my side I slept while Lothe watched over the camp. We switched shifts all through the night and I was never really able to get much sleep, but what little I did get was welcome. The eerie sounds of the undead howling and cackling echoed in my dreams and it wasn't any better when I awoke and the same sounds emminated from the city. Morning arrived and we packed up camp shortly after having a ration breakfast. While it wasn't tasty, it served it's purpose filling the void that was my stomach. <br>
<br>
Not knowing what lie ahead, and not risking an untimely death, Larel used her powers to see through the eyes of others. Who she could see, she could see through their eyes. Looking around from creature to creature she sized up that we had three or four enemies waiting to ambush us around the corner and two more guarding the bridge leading to our destination. Arming ourselves and preparing for battle, Habidagus cast Karana's blessings upon us, and Larel gave us a pre battle quickening that would allow us to fight much faster in combat. Urrorr cast his shamanistic enchantments on us and we were strong as two men and agile as a cat. Nyxia ordered her fallen warrior to follow, and in we went. The battle was very short and all foes lay at our feet. Our speed increase met with the beasts almost non existant attacks left them powerless to defend themselves. We meditated a bit longer to regain what little stamina was lost during the fight previous, and met the foes at the bridge. Vapor golems were a bit tougher than their haze brethren, but still offered little challenge to the expertise of the knights that opposed them. Walking across the bridge and to the door of the structure, we ran into a problem.<br>
<br>
The door was locked. We hadn't forseen this being a problem, and surely there must have been a key somewhere to this door. We slaughtered all of the golems and undead we'd encountered, demanding the whereabouts of the key to this door to no avail. They said we would die before we found a key to the door. With the lack of a key we wouldn't be able to gain access to the structure that lay ahead of us. We bid Habidagus farewell as he opened a gate back to civilization so that he could inquire more about the dungeon and perhaps find a rogue skilled in the arts of lockpicking.<br>
<br>
We set up camp and waited for Habidagus' return with the rogue and reinforcements.<br>

Fighting small skirmishes from time to time keeping the area around the structure secure, we waited. Then it came, a telepathic signal if you will, "I am coming" and it sounded just like Habidagus. I informed the others of the signal I'd received and we packed up camp and got ready for combat again. Habidagus had just entered the city and was shouting looking for a response. At the top of my human lungs I yelled out to him "We're where you last left us, we will fight our way to your position!" several seconds later he shouted back, "No need friends, I've brought some new recruits and this would be an excellent time to test their prowess!" So we waited.<br>
<br>
An hour or so later Habidagus walked up, looking a little roughed up but otherwise okay. With him were four more individuals that he introduced. "Kulgan, the Barbarian to my right is Denlar, Berserker from the northern plains. To my left is Ninen, the rogue we've been looking for. To Denlar's right is Segorn, Arch mage of Felwithe, and the one standing before you is Baks. I didn't notice Baks at all, he was a tiny Gnome standing only knee tall to me. I'd learned in the time I'd been walking Norrath that size didn't mean much when it came to power. Habidagus later informed me that another of his profession would be joining us later. This was good news, we could get started with exploring the huge structure in front of us.<br>
<br>
Ninen set to work, lock picks being manipulated this way and that, then a loud click announced that the door was unlocked. Ninen said, "That'll cost ya, I broke some of my finest tools getting that archaic thing open!". The door opened into a grand hall with a throne at the end of it. The throne looked as if it hadn't been used in a century, and was covered in cobwebs and was leaning to one side as if a great battle had ensued in a distant past.  "I'll check 'er out" said Ninen, who suddenly disappeared from view. A few minutes later he came back with news.<br>
<br>
"Looks like we've got a nasty fight ahead of us. Damned things still pay homage to a non exsistant Lord or Baron, they're all lined up as if they're guardin' somthin'." Getting prepared for battle we went over our strategy. Lothe said that he would go inside, get their attention and then use his powers to make himself appear dead. That would allow the rest of us to catch them by suprise, and give Larel a chance to do her handy work. It worked like a charm, Lothe fell dead to the ground and the abominations stood there milling over his corpse. Almost believing that he was dead, he gave me a wink and stood up behind the two remaining creatures bringing his blade down on Golem's backside. They turned to meet his advance and he barreled through the golems, knocking one over and moving the other to the side, he ran to us. Both golems regained their wits (if they even had any) and began to charge at Lothe. Immediately upon their arrival they were overwhelmed with odds so far set against them they had no chance of winning. This is when I first realized what profession Baks had taken. A blast of cold air emmanated from Baks, icy cold wind rushed around us as he made his final hand gestures and brought the huge comet of ice to bear on the first golem. It caused significant damage and we then knew our first target. Ninen snuck behind the injured golem and inserted his three foot blade directly in the middle of it's back, causing it to wheel around in his direction. I brought my blade down across the creatures exposed neck and took his head off with a clean slice. Denlar had taken up assault on the second golem and was showing signs of wearing down. At the point I thought he'd surely collapse his eyes glazed over and he went into a steel slinging rage. Driving the huge golem back, Denlar slashed and hacked and kicked his way to victory. The golem fell to the ground unresponsive and Denlar continued to hack on the beast. When he was done there were several large chunks of clay laying where there once had been a huge creature.<br>
<br>
Segorn hadn't been prepared for the battle when it started, but knowing that we had the odds on our side, began his summoning ritual. He began by drawing two overlapping triangles on the ground circled by a double band of rings, chanted a few words and set it ablaze in fire. The fire spired up twelve feet into the air as he spoke his will. He pulled a gem out of his pouch and threw it into the middle of the diagram. The huge column of fire slowly decreased in power and drew closer and more compact on the diagram. You could see the beginnings of substance in the middle of it all, two arms, a torso, white hot cracks of magma and liquefying stone forming into a big lump of slag. The beast that lay before him was a fire elemental. I'd seen them before but had never witnessed one being summoned into existence from the alter planes. It was quite a spectacle to behold. He didn't even notice that we were all staring at him. Segorn told the beast to guard him, Kebekn acknowledged, "Guarding with my life oh splendid one" in a fiery hiss of breath.<br>
<br>
Lothe used the same tactic over and over, each time bringing more creatures into our midst. Skeletons and phantoms and pools of toxic substance all fell under our might. It was the last creature that had us all terrified. Lothe had fallen to the ground, an unconvincing death ploy, the huge steel golem, black as night continued to land massive blows into him. Lothe was being injured far too fast for him to hold up long. Habidagus cast his blessing on Lothe and he was healthy once more. The black giant was bearing down on Habidagus intent on ending his life, we all simultaneously bore into the creature with all our might. Nyxia bid her pet into battle, Segorn did the same, Denlar and I advanced on the huge creature and Baks began to cast a spell. Ninen slid in behind the creature piercing at it's almost impenetrable exterior. Fighting this thing was tough, so tough that we had to result in melee combat only while the casters regained mana. Baks shouted over the clang of swords against steel, "My magic, it's not doing anything to it. It's unaffected!" Nyxia replied, "I know, I had the same problem, nothing will stick to that thing." Denlar shouted, "Aye, it may resist your spells but not the wrath of my blade!" and brought his sword down to bear on the creature again. I was getting very fatigued and I could tell that the combat was taking it's toll on all of us, just when we thought the thing was dead, another golem just as before popped up in it's comrades stead. Battling with this one went more smoothly as we knew exactly what had to be done. Spells had to be altered and fighting styles changed to accommodate the new foe. This one went down quicker but on the death blow, yet another stood in it's place. How long could we keep this up? As long as we had to, we were going to survive at all costs. Nyxia's pet was showing battle damage and Segorns summoning was showing signs of fatigue as well. We weren't going to last much longer. <br>
<br>
Lothe laid the death blow to the final golem and we all gasped in shock as a phantom arose from it's corpse and began to cast a spell. "I am Lord Ghiosk and you will pay for what you've done!" The bolt of fire struck me in the left shoulder and sent me to the ground sprawling. Ninen slid his blade into the back of the Phantom causing little damage. Denlar brought his blade down on the phantom and his blade sliced cleanly through the apparition causing little to no damage.  "How do we beat a foe we cannot hit?" I yelled, "Retreat!" Staying with the phantom to buy time for their escape, I stood toe to toe with his ravaging blows I couldn't hold this up much longer and feared I'd be slain if I didn't make a break for it. Running through the streets of the city was confusing. I couldn't remember the way back to the entrance, all the fighting had dulled my thought process. I couldn't remember. I needed to remember. Slowing my run, exhausted and the wounds taking their toll I prayed to Karana that he oversee me after my death. At that moment a blue pulse of healing energy came out from my hands and covered my body. I was healthy again and ready to fight. Looking up seeing the ghastly image of Lord Ghiosk running at me, I darted around him and slid down a corridor. Running through it I ran through the fountain and over the other side. Around the wall and to the gate. I knew where I was now! Pushing through the gate and running over the bridge I lept out the door of the main city entrance. The others brought the doors to a shut with a slam and stepped away.<br>
<br>
Panting and out of breath, I sat there. Dizzy from the exertion, I passed out.<br>
