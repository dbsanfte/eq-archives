I think you've skimmed over it and either purposely or otherwise, missed the answer to your question.<br>
<br>
You are/were (hard to tell, some people said you were retired) in HnE, which gives you quite an extensive knowledge of the raiding game.<br>
<br>
Let us take another zone example, Temple of Veeshan.  In this temple, there are 3 seperate wings.  In one wing, the notable boss mob is Dozekar the Cursed, in another wing, there's a few boss mobs, Lend, Telk, Gozz... and, in the final wing, there are about *twelve* Boss Mobs.  <br>
<br>
Lets say a guild, lets call them Fires of Heaven... are raiding in North, and thier own members have even spoken that they have no intention of going to either the west or the east wings.  Should Township Rebellion wait outside until FoH have done raiding so they can continue with thier completely unrelated mobs.<br>
<br>
Lets take another zone example: Kael.  One guild, can be going for vindi/statue/aow, while another guild does tormax, not a problem at all.<br>
<br>
Lets take one more zone example: Ssra temple.  From what you are saying, if a guild are there killing rhag 1... then rhag 2, and then maybe some TM's in mines, that no other guild should be allowed to zone in and kill the other nameds, that this guild do not intend on killing. Or, on the flip side, Guild X is going Emp, Guild Y cant come in and do rhags?<br>
<br>
Titans of Saryrn do not kill the 2 Blobs before aten much... They have said this themselves.  They had no problem with us coming to kill the blobs and the other named that would be logistically almost impossible to get to on the way to aten (back clearing for 3 hours, anyone?).<br>
<br>
So basically, what we have here, is TWC going after 3 mobs, that were contended with *nobody*, ToS were tired, they wanted to get to aten, rescue the princess, and have a good nights sleep.  TWC wanted to get something done for the night, which was, a tower boss (thx boots for me &gt;&lt;) and 2 aten blobs.<br>
<br>
As for aten blobs dropping shit loot? Well, the best way I can describe it is if you were shitting $600 bottles of red wine one day, and shitting gorilla shit the next.  You have things like Shield of Energy, which is 100/100, FT6, a 125/125hp belt with AoB effect, FT4 100/100 cleric useable masks, and then (the gorilla shit), You have those fucking mass food/water things.<br>
<br>
So garb, if you have any further questions, or wish to elaborate on why you're uncomfortable with TWC taking 3 uncontested mobs, be my guest, I will answer your questions to the best of my ability.<br>
<br>
Kordin, if you or your raid *did* intend to back clear to get TXD, and KTXAHR's, then my entire post is bullshit, however i'm so certain your raid did not, at that point, wish to do these 3 mobs, if you wanted to clear them tomorrow or the next day is a whole new ball of wax itself.  So Kordin, if you could, to help garb understand the circumstances, post here about what happend in VT, once more, so we have a crystal clear picture of what went on in Vex Thal.<br>

<br>
Garb, well you didnt answer the question, but you didnt go harp on your straw men very badly either.  I guess you haven't completely suck into whatever pit you were tetering over when you first posted in this thread.  Don't worry man, eventually people will forget you lied and then spent so much effort to avoiding admitting it.<br>
<br>
If you had just said that we had no buisiness in the same zone as them I wouldnt have minded at all.  That is your opinion and you're entitled to it.  However when you say we were &quot;breathing down their necks&quot; you're gonna need the opinion of someone who was actually there.  Nobody who was there has backed you up.  <br>
<br>
So is your next post going to include your admittance that your original statement was bullshit?  The way it works would be that you would include something in your post such as: &quot;When I said you were 'breathing down their necks' I was lying.&quot;<br>
<br>
Avengered says, &quot;Seani, u keep giving advices &quot; -- The closest thing I have given to advice or commands or instructions is what everyone knows and that is how to wait for warders to repop before you kill a named.<br>
<br>
&quot;U can allways call gm and get it fixed since we dont have time for that&quot; -- Wow you dont have time for that?  With the way you guys treat the zone you apparently think everyone else has the time for &quot;calling the GM and getting it fixed&quot;.  What makes you so special?<br>
<br>
&quot;u last wipe to AHR there the fault is all yours&quot; -- I disagree, it was only partially our fault.  We sat around for hours without being able to go in due to warders which were bugged because ToS killed TVK too early; that is your fault.  Obviously though we made the final decsion to train through the zone, can't deny that.  <br>

<br>
I'm amazed how this comment was deliberately misunderstood - or am crediting you all with too much intelligence and you are daft enough not to understand this.<br>
<br>
Either way I will try and clarify what was trying to be said. Certain events / zones / or parts of zones are usually considered geared for a single raidforce, and some people consider VT one such as it has a linear content (for the most part) With those particular events / zones etc then it could be considered bad manners and pressurising to be waiting for another guild to finish whether at ZI or coh spot etc. <br>
<br>
I am fairly certain that it wasn't meant that you can't kill cursed if someone is killing emp - as ssra is not a linear content zone (except the rhags - sort of).<br>
<br>
Anyway I do hope that can stop the stupidity of flaming someone for using the word zone when he meant linear content.<br>

One of the main points brought up in this thread is that VT may be &quot;linear content&quot; for some guilds, such as TWC and TJ, but the way ToS plays it is in fact 2 separate lines which they do on two separate days.<br>

We, took the center, and while near the top, TWC zoned in and, from the bottom of said tree, started picking off the mobs at the sides. (well, they left the twins, can't blame em, they are definitely mobs you do when you are board, and don't have alot of folks on to raid. A painfully slow process of clearing lots of mobs, and the loot is equal to that of entrance mobs to such a zone.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.twcny.rr.com/jeffd/sig713.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kordindwarvenwrath>KordinDwarvenWrath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:green;'>Tavern Patron</span></span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/26/03 2:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=269>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kael &gt;TWC&gt;GoL</span><hr size=1> When we decide to do all VT in a single day, we are more likely to kill Aten blobs after Aten Ha Ra with the people interested in raiding more that day. <br>

<br>
Blobs happen to be near AHR but are indeed not lineair<br>
<br>
/shrug we have skipped blobs on some occations for the fact we just don't want to spend the extra time raiding and are basicly mostly interested in AHR when we hit the zone.<br>
<br>
Leaving the mobs on the alternate route to AHR/blob twins up doesn't effectivle split the zone into 2 lines although it does make it harder for a guild to do a 1 day clearing the next week. Then again PNP doesn't say you have to clear VT in one raid the last time i checked<br>
<br>
Skipping non essential mobs doesn't &quot;fuck up&quot;  the zone. It's only inconvenient to TWC /shrug that is not a concern to anyone but TWC<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
IMO zoning in with full raidforce is nothing but the standard pressurizingtactic (hope they make a mistake and wipe because of another guild breathing down your neck) and/or the standard lagging tactic (lets get as many people together in a small space and hope the clerics lag too bad to heal etc)<br>
<br>
Too bad you can't sit next to AHR room and lag em out in VT :-P <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qualan>Qualan</A> at: 7/26/03 3:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarenna>Sarenna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/26/03 3:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=271>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kael &gt;TWC&gt;GoL</span><hr size=1> Seani - I have no understanding of how ToS or TWC do VT (to be honest I am not sure I am very interested in your methods / tactics / routes), I know that when we do VT we tend to head as fast as possible for AHR - sometimes leaving the blob twins up, but lets be honest we only do VT if we really can't find anything more interesting to do.<br>
<br>
My point was that it struck me as being deliberately obtuse to have a go at someone for using the word &quot;zone&quot; instead of linear content in his post - thus bringing out some rather bizarre comparisons in ssra / tov etc. <br>
<br>
Oh well hope that is clearer<br>

seani says &quot;- &quot;u last wipe to AHR there the fault is all yours&quot; -- I disagree, it was only partially our fault. We sat around for hours without being able to go in due to warders which were bugged because ToS killed TVK too early; that is your fault. Obviously though we made the final decsion to train through the zone, can't deny that. -&quot;<br>
<br>
hmm so it's our fault a mob has spawned that we kill and it depops the warders (if the warders aren't there then it's obviously a programming error by SoE) now the fact that TWC could have asked us where we had got to in the chain of mob killings when we left would mean that you would have been able to figure out which mobs were due.<br>
<br>
You didn't do this did you seani, you rushed in to kill the mobs and totally fucked yourselves up your ass and got royally reamed.  Don't be so fucking retarded - when the mobs have spawned and there are warders on track it would be &quot;reasonable&quot; to presume that they are the relevant warders for the mob.<br>
<br>
If you don't like SoE's bugs in a zone - feedback / petition or quit playing.  It's not our fault you can't figure out which mobs have and haven't been killed, if you had actually asked us we might have told you, perhaps in the future we'll just tell ToN...<br>

don't blame ToS for your retarded fuckups <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=venchantra>Venchantra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/26/03 5:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=273>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kael &gt;TWC&gt;GoL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now, if you had read the sentence that you decided to quote me on, it read something like this &quot; Take 33 people with HnE quality gear and they would be destroyed by Tier 1 time .

Usually because by the time we get to Aten, it's late. We really don't want to stay up in VT until 5am clearing mobs that we could kill the next day (unless another guild kills them).<br>
<br>
The longer we spend in VT, the lower our raid force gets, so by the time it's 2am in the morning, we just want to kill Aten and be finished. <p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www4.tripnet.se/~feline/div/deril/deril2.gif&quot;      </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eudamanslayer>EudaManslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1334<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/26/03 7:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3411.topic&index=275>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kael &gt;TWC&gt;GoL</span><hr size=1> ToS plays how they wana? what the crap is that about?

However you guys are the ones who actually killed the named mob before his warders were up.  YOU are going to be the ones who keep fucking it up every god damn week until you start waiting for all the warders to pop for a particular named before you kill that named.  How fucking difficult is that to understand?  <br>
<br>
&quot;now the fact that TWC could have asked us&quot; -- why in fucking hell would we need to ask you what mobs you killed?  First of all we usually have someone in the zone that is tracking and monitoring where you clowns are.  Second of all we can just look at what mobs are up and which are not up and which warders have already been screwed.  Of course we did also get the loony GM comming in and telling us that mini-aten had already been killed.  Didnt sound right to us but I wouldnt put it past you guys to move to mini aten before killing either of the wing bosses.  The GM was so convinced that he just depopped all warders in the zone.<br>
<br>
&quot;you rushed in to kill the mobs and&quot; -- Didn't I already say we actually spent hours trying to get a GM before we could move in?  How does waiting 3-4 hours with a full raid force sitting around amount to &quot;rushing in&quot;?<br>
<br>
&quot;when the mobs have spawned and there are warders on track&quot; -- What part of &quot;GM despawned all warders in the zone&quot; don't you understand?  There were no fucking warders on track you imbecile.<br>
<br>
&quot;perhaps in the future we'll just tell ToN&quot; -- Ya, I bet they're just DYING to be the ones that come in after your mid-afternoon clusterfuck respawn half-clears and having to get the GMs to despawn warders.  Thank god for them that you guys are gonna tell em exactly what you did to fuck the zone over.  <br>
<br>
Qualan says, &quot;Too bad you can't sit next to AHR room and lag em out in VT&quot; -- Actually its very possible to train through the entire upper floor into aten's room.  Next time I'll have our 70 zergs do that so we can lag em out.  What's really too bad is there are no other mobs in aten's room that we could train them with while they were fighting.  That would be the best cause then we could just wait for them to get her down pretty far, and just take over after they die to our train, like we do any time we want a mob someone else is going for.
