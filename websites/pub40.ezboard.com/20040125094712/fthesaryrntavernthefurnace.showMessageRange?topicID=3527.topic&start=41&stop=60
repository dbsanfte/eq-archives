<br>
Theres also a big difference between your guild and the guilds this thread is reffering to.  Using an RZ strat for this guild would be the same as HnE using a Quarm strat.  It was their current challenge as Quarm is yours.<br>
<br>
&quot;RZ has been killed by over 100 guilds for months now, Quarm on the other hand is still unspoiled end game.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't personally see the relavence to this part.  How you can gauge the level of wrongness(hmm) by what other guilds do or have done is beyond me.  If it's wrong and gimp, it's wrong and gimp.  It does'nt matter if your killing Aten, Quarm, High Priest, or Nagafen.<br>
<br>
&quot;If HnE were to fall so far behind that enough guilds killed Quarm and we still didn't know what we were doing then I'd stay fuck it, who knows how other guilds do this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The way guilds fall behind is by getting lazy and taking the easy way out.  Not putting the work in and not learning whatever(gay as it may be) new technique or strat the content had to offer to you had you not been a lazy loot whore and taken the time to play the game.  Not to mention it should(unless you are dillusional) take away any sense of accomplishment you may have gotten from beating the mob(which is the only thing that really fucking counts in the end).  Sure all the L12 Rangers will think your the man in your new phat gear.  But real players of this game will know you did'nt earn it and that your not what you claim to be.  It's not the loot that says your the shit.  Its the fact that you can defeat the mob that drops the loot that says your the shit.  That last sentence was really disappointing.  I vouched for you after your recruitment period was up and I can honestly say there is no way, regardless of how badly we needed Rangers (which we did), that I would have vouched for someone who would steal a strat from another guild just to get some fucking loot.  It's just fucking weak.<br>

God, get off your self-righteous horse.  You were still with HnE when we were doing Emp.  We were behind the other server leading guilds and for a while we tried doing him the way other guilds did.  This was with screenshots, directions, and one HnE member playing a toon on the other guilds Emp raid to see what was up.  In the end it didn't work out and we ended up killing him our own way.<br>
<br>
You were an officer at the time, so get off your hypocritical bullshit horse.<br>
<br>
In the end the only times any guild kills a mob a truly original way is when you're in the leading pack of guilds when there are no xserver chat and leaked strats (As HnE has been the majority of PoP).  Its always a bigger deal and honestly I feel more pride when we kill mobs our own way, but that's more often than not a function of being among the first to get the kill.  Anytime we fail on a mob people post ideas for how to improve on our next attempt and sometimes people say things like &quot;my friend in &lt;random uber guild&gt; says this works well so maybe we should try it next time&quot;.  If it's a good strat the raid leader might put it into his bag of tricks, if not kick it to the side... but I've never heard anyone saying you shouldn't use an idea because some other guild did it first.<br>
<br>
Kio, I thought you were a bad ass officer.  We haven't had the combination of wit and humor in leadership since you've left.  I'm sorry to hear you feel this way about me.<br>

Tell me, who leeches more...<br>
<br>
1.) Someone who applies to a guild that is doing Quarm, gets elemental flagged and time flagged by same.<br>
<br>
2.) Someone who stays in a guild doing the content with the proper progression even if that means they don't see PoTime for another year? Or more?<br>
<br>
For the record I don't care which camp you decide to go with. It's a game, as long as you don't get all self righteous with no justification, we don't have a problem. I myself am no tactician. I still have trouble finding the basement in ssrah. Or for that matter, the Grey.<br>
<br>
There are very very few people in this game, or on this server who are actual groundbreakers: people that solve quests, figure out mobs, and fight their own battles all the way up.<br>
<br>
If you want to have this conversation, only those people should be having it.<br>
<br>
If you're flagging your recruits, who havent &quot;earned&quot; anything at all, then you need to be quiet and humble. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loftel@thesaryrntavern>Loftel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 285<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/9/03 11:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3527.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> Kioti that was some dumbass posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balith>balith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 346<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/9/03 12:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3527.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with TOS on this one. When you get maybe 2 shots at RZ a month you have to use the info you got from guild members and other sources.<br>

It was diffrent for us. H and E did not cock block us so we had the chance to spend 2 weeks of rather torturious time learning what not to do. It sucked at the time but when we finally killed him I was glad we had the chance to kill him the old fashioned way. <br>
<br>
But they have to deal with us and H and E reflagging new recruits, TWC still needing a ton of swords I bet and I think one more guild that just got in. <br>
<br>
At this point enough of old H and E and OOP and TWC members have leaked into the next level guilds and they will know how to kill mobs. Its a reality and with the mob contention can you blame them for doing what they have to in order to get out of any cock blockable encounter.<br>

That kind of thinking, my friend, is what keeps people like you from ever being the lead dog.  I guess you are the type of person Loftel who enjoys the view fromwhere you stand. Don't have to learn how to do things, have the information spoon fed to you.<br>
<br>
Let me guess, you use cheat codes a lot on console games too huh? <br>

No way I believe this... you still have to have the ppl behind the strat to execute it effectively... justing having a guideline as to how approach a particular mob is still not being baby fed the mob (i.e. e-bay) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30057"><br>

When it got into the Alpha series Gen, Zangief, Adon and Guy were da order of coolness/badassness.  Would be cool if Capcom made a final one that looks like one of the Alpha series comprising of all their characters from all the SF games. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=452034"><br>
