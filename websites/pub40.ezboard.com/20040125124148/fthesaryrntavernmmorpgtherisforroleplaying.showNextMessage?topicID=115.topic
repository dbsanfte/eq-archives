<br>
I had never know my parents.<br>
<br>
I was found when I was younger by Tundra Jack who was roaming the frozen area of Everfrost on a stormy day. He found on his path a caravan which has been attacked by goblins. Then he found me.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were the only survivor&quot; he told me a few years later, &quot;nearly&quot;. He introduced me to Margryn Macguire, the leader of the Shaman Guild of the frozen city of Halas, who took care of me.<br>
<br>
When I reached the age of reason, Margryn revealed to me all informations Tundra Jack has been able to gather on this dark day. It  seemed that my parents and me were on a journey for Halas when we were attacked by a horde of goblins.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Tundra Jack wasn't able to save my parents. He learned from the golins that it was their objective to kill us, to prevent us from reaching Halas because my parents had some important informations about them. The action had been lead by a High goblin, but Margryn didn't told me his name because she was sure I would take my weapons at once to go to make revenge. She ordered me to calm down and introduced then to me a young High Elf Wizard.<br>
<br>
- Please meet Fanelaine. She will travel with you for some time, young wolf, and will train you, stated Margryn. Do not forget that Revenge should not be your goal, but Justice. Go, Dahna, and make honor in the name of the Wolves of Halas.<br>
 <br>
And I left.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of my travel, I was a little nervous and a too much impulsive, I was making much error which been worth us some memorable troubles in the area of Everfrost, my hate for goblins being the explication, but Fanelaine always found solutions to that. She first appeared to me calm and incisive, sometimes even a bit too much critic, but as I traveled with her I began to rely on her, her calm and serene side overriding my tempetious mind.<br>
<br>
We were a good team. We faced the warlike orc and shaman orc which came to invade Everfrost, drove out the mammoth giants to nourish us... other companions joined us, remained for a while moment, some left, others remained and founded the Guild of the Wolves of Tundra in which I am currently...<br>
<br>
Then the end of the area Everfrost was in front of us, symbolized by the tunnel of the caves of BlackBurrow, the gnolls den. I knew that the army which had invaded Everfrost has created this passage to come there. But I needed more informations.<br>
<br>
From this moment there, I needed to operate alone. When Fanelaine went away to take care of some other businesses in Everfrost, I made my way in BlackBurrow, should I retrieve what I want by the force or not. After a tough battle against the Commander of Gnolls, he revealed to me that the ambush troop came from the plains of the Karanas, and beyond the mountains of HighPass. <br>
<br>
Then I went in the areas of the Karanas.<br>
<br>
The brigands in the area told me that the ambush troop was under the lead of Chief Gan'Shralok from a cursed and haunted, the Forest of Kithicor. I caught Granin O'Gill on the way, a Barbare traitor who had betrayed Margryn. He told me before I made justice that the only reason  of the murder of family was that we held certain information which could damage the Chief Gan'Shralok reputation, especially my brother.<br>
<br>
I remembered that Tundra Jack didn't found the body of my brother in the caravan's ruin, and has concluded that I was the only child of my parents. I did not know if he was dead or alive, but I was to go to the forest of Kithicor to get the answers of questions.<br>
Once the Plains of Karana crossed, I moved towards the mountains of HighPass, the only way to reach the forest of Kithicor.<br>
<br>
There I found Fanelaine, which, in a smile, showed me the way to go to the abrupt mountains. We remained a short time together, short moment of serenity and preparation before the final confrontation. <br>
<br>
The Justice was to be done. I do not remember much more once I entered the forests from Kithicor. The confrontation between Chief Gan'Shralok and I was terrific, and during the fight he nearly took advantage on me.<br>
But I was saved by the intervention of a mysterious man who helped me to battle my Nemesis. Once Justice was done, he disappeared as fast as he came.<br>
All he said to me was : &quot; We will meet again, Tanja Roh, the twin wolf&quot;. My quest was finished, but I had put all my forces in this encounter, and I could not find any more the strengh to keep on living.<br>
But with the assistance of Fanelaine, I found another goal in my existance, I was to find my brother, even if I would have to search in all Norrath...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
It was still snowing and cloudy in the city of Halas in the evening. A young and slim woman wrapped in a large cloak landed on the barbarian harbour from the raft The Gwenavyne , the only way to the outside world. Apparently foreigner in this cold country, she came near a vendor who was about to close his stall.<br>
<br>
- Excuse me, sir, could you show me the way to the church of the Tribunal?<br>
<br>
The vendor glowered her dubiously, then went back to his work.<br>
<br>
- What kind of elf would like to mess with the Tribunal? Said the vendor.<br>
<br>
And the woman to whisper:<br>
<br>
- Perhaps could they help me to find...the amazon wolve.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
Not even a breathing.<br>
<br>
All is white.<br>
<br>
Cold.<br>
<br>
Alone.<br>
<br>
Is it already the end?...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
- The Tribunal allows you to speak, please introduce yourself, enunciated loudly Margryn Macguire.<br>
<br>
From her impressive stature, the Chief of the Shaman guild considered the foreigner indifferently. Compared to her, she seemed feeble and diminutive, her skin was white as snow, like the High Elf. Inversely, her face was harmonious and calm was showing a strong willpower. She kneeled before her in humility and reverence.<br>
<br>
- You are not from our country. You do not even seems to be from the verdant country of Faydwer, even if you have the seeming of these people.<br>
<br>
- The true sight of the high Shaman cannot be fooled, said the young woman in a smile. Unfortunately I cannot reveal my identity that must remain secret until the end of my mission. All I can say is that I am not a spy from any clan, or guild. I came here by my own will. You can test me with your magic if you do not trust me.<br>
<br>
There was a long silence. One of the Margryn's advisor asked:<br>
<br>
- Perhaps we should proceed as she say, we must be sure that she is not a spy.<br>
<br>
Margryn rejected his offer.<br>
<br>
- It is ok, I trust her. And I can also guess why she make this long travel to meet us. Tell us your request young one.<br>
<br>
The woman took an amulet from her bag, and showed it to everybody near her.<br>
<br>
- I request the assistance of the Tribunal in order to find the owner of this item. This item is called the Symbol of the Tribunal and would have never been detached from his owner, it is a sacred reward given by the Shaman guild for the faith and loyalty. If someone can give me some informations where I can find her, let met know. I am seeking for the amazon wolve. I am seeking for Dahna Siteris Tanja Roh.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I am so tired.<br>
<br>
Why am I keeping up? It is an endless quest with no meaning.<br>
<br>
I don't have enough strengh to stand up again.<br>
<br>
I don't have enough strengh to seek again.<br>
<br>
If I could remember...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
- I must thank you for all the informations you provided to me. I will try to have good use of them.<br>
<br>
The mysterious woman was about to leave the chuch, when Margryn called her.<br>
<br>
- Please wait.<br>
<br>
Their glances crossed. The face of the high shaman showed some sadness.<br>
<br>
- When you will find her, please tell her that we are proud of her. She will be always welcome within us.<br>
<br>
They smiled.<br>
<br>
- I will. A wolf never forget his family.<br>
<br>
And she was gone.<br>
<br>
- Was it reasonnable to give her all these informations? asked one of the Margryn advisor. And what if she lied to us? Wasnt it our task to retrieve the Shaman Dahna?<br>
<br>
- I do not think so, replyied Margryn. Dahna and her have the same reflection in their eye. The same power. There should be a link between them, a link more powerfull than the bloodline or the guild...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I remember now.<br>
<br>
I was seeking for the one who saved my life in the Kithicor Forest. The one who was always by my sidein my childhood. My brother.<br>
<br>
I crossed all the continent, I walked on all the road looking for any sign of him.<br>
<br>
Finally, I landed on the frozen world of Velious.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in these dangerous plains, there was the Tower of Knownledge, the Tower of the Frozen Shadows.<br>
<br>
It was said that all the answers were lying there. All of them.<br>
<br>
And there, I finally found my answer. So afflicting. So painful. The truth...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
- Finally I am there. I am at the entrance of this tower. But it will be difficult to enter with all the dangerous creatures nearby...<br>
<br>
- Hail Dahna.<br>
<br>
- Y...You? What are you doing here?<br>
<br>
- Dahna, my friend...I could say the same thing for you.<br>
<br>
- I have choosen my decision. I will go there to find my answer.<br>
<br>
- I see. In that case, let me help you in this part of your travel. I will translocate you in the last floor of the tower. I suppose it is what you want.<br>
<br>
- Thank you very much, my friend.<br>
<br>
- Promise me to take care.<br>
<br>
- Fane...<br>
<br>
And Dahna faded away. The high elf wizard took a glance at the white tower, alone.<br>
<br>
- ...Dahna, I wish you good luck wherever you go. I hope that our path will cross again.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The following events happened very quickly. Only listening to my instinct, I rushed in the dark maze, climbing the frozen stairs, and finally went to the lair of the master of this place, the enchanteres Tserrina Syl'tor.<br>
<br>
Imbued with knownledge of the world, she was already waiting for me.<br>
<br>
- Here is a mortal in quest of truth. Your thirst of knownledge is so important that you dare enter my domain?<br>
<br>
Her magic spells were already set. I couldn't do anything. A powerful and invisible force hit me. Fire and thunder stunned me. I was barely able to stand up, wounded and cornered...but I didn't want to give up.<br>
<br>
- I will give you the answer that you are seeking for so long, but it will cost you the life! Shouted Tserrina.<br>
<br>
And while she casted the final spell that would finish me, she whispered to me:<br>
<br>
- He does not exist. He never existed in this world. All was the result of your imagination. Your brother is not.<br>
<br>
These last words shocked me, and before being knocked unconscious, a tear appeared on my pained face.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
- Here is a soul that wandered and will wander for eternity, said Tserrina, looking at the near lifeless corpse of the shaman. It does not even worth a study. Minions! Toss her body away!<br>
<br>
- If I was your I would not command that.<br>
<br>
A silhouette appeared in the shadows of the wall in the room of the drama. It was the cloaked woman. She sighted a brief moment at the view of Dahna's corpse lying on the ground, then looked at the enchanteress.<br>
<br>
- Indeed, this soul has wandered for long. His time has come. But it is my duty to grab her back where she is from, not you.<br>
<br>
Tserrina glared at the cloaked women threateningly, but she didnt make a move.<br>
<br>
- I did not sense you, and I am one of the most talented enchanteress in all Norrath. What could a so powerful entity do in this place, and why coming for this helpless soul?<br>
<br>
- An enchanteress, whatever powerful she is, should know when not to engage if all the forces are against her, shouldn't she?<br>
<br>
And the cloaked woman to smile mysteriously. A circle of light then surround her and the corpse of Dahna, and both step in the aura. Then they were no more.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
No more cold, but everything is still white around me.<br>
<br>
No more pain, but I don't feel anything either.<br>
<br>
Or...perhaps some weariness. yes. I am tired.<br>
<br>
I open my eye. Something appear different in this monochrome world. A young girl. She is looking at me. Her eyes seems to look through my body, to my soul. But, am I not already dead?<br>
<br>
- Are you the valkyrie that will bring to the realm of the dead? I asked.<br>
<br>
She smiled.<br>
<br>
- Perhaps. But for the moment it does not have any value on who I could be. I would like to ask you : who are you?<br>
<br>
- Me? My name is Dahna Siteris Tanja Roh, Shaman of the Tribunal...and now I just realized that all my life was dedicated to a vain quest...<br>
<br>
- Vain? I do not think so. You have been raised by some people who considered you like their own child, in a real family, even if you have lost your true parents. You have met reliable and trustful friends, you have took part in many happy or unhappy adventures...no, I do not think that your life was vain. The only problem was, you tried to aim a quest that was not possible to end in this universe.<br>
<br>
- Aim?...my...brother?<br>
<br>
- As the enchanteress said, your brother has never existed...but he was not only in this plan. I can give you the possibility to leave this world. And to come back in the one where you were born in reality.<br>
<br>
- I am not..from this world?<br>
<br>
- You are not. But you lived here for some time, and you have learned a lot. You could apply your knownledge if you come with me. So? What is your answer?<br>
<br>
I look again my surrounding. We are floating in the sky, above the world of Norrath.<br>
<br>
I can see again the world where I lived, I can see the people that I met, I fought.<br>
<br>
A smile can be seen across my face. I do not regret anything. I have fully lived my life.<br>
<br>
I am turning back to the one who must gather again the heroes.<br>
<br>
- Let's go.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
A falsehood shield with two crossed spears is lying at the feet of the Tower of Frozen Shadows, a writing can be seen on it : Her last stride as a wolf.<br>
<br>
The End. <p>-- ~|~ --
