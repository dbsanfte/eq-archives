It has enhanced Events, Staff, interfaces ect. It also costs around 39.95. American.<br>
<br>
So, obviously not nearly as many people will be using this service as the Live EQ Servers, and Verant has announced there has been a whole different Legends Staff.<br>
<br>
In some players opinions, this is almost a stab in the back from Verant, who still has many bugs to work out in EQ(Bazaar system, ridiculous lag, ect.) and people are still paying 10$ American to play EQ. <br>
On the offhand, Verant states that this will benefit ALL users, via the new items, skills, ect. trickling down into Live servers.<br>
<br>
Users are allowed to switch their chars from Live to LEgends servers w/ all items, I'm not sure if the same goes vise-versa(although you could make a killing in NFP that way). Also, I am fairly sure the 50$(?) server move charge applies.<br>

Everything on the Legends server should be free. Server Xfers Should be Free. its just stupid.<br>

Nobody is going to Start out on Legends servers from nothing. its only going to be higher level chars that want to see it. there will be no real noobs. there will be slim/no low level chars that arent twinks. its bullsh.it and stupid and its just another desperate attempt to make money.<br>

<br>
From a personal standpoint, if I take into consideration the amout of free time I spend on EQ having fun for $10.00 a month and try to compare that to other activities I do to have fun (Snowboarding, mountain biking, running, watching a movie, going out to dinner or having drinks with friends) and the cost of those activities, I find that I have an extremely large value for my time spent on EQ. About the only things that really compare with the cost of EQ is reading. But even then, I'm more than capable of reading more than one book a month if I spend as much time reading as I do playing EQ and very shortly the cost of the books themselves will start to cost more than $10.00 a month.<br>
<br>
At $40.00 a month, things start to compare but even then, if I spent as much time on other entertaining activities as I do on EQ, I still feel that the cost will top $40.00 a month.<br>
<br>
Do I disagree that the game could be improved? No. I disagree with people who comment that they should have all this and more available for them at the low cost of $10.00 per month.<br>
<br>
Just my view of things. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9396">Bodhi Kierstaad</A>: Warder of Saryrn

Now I do not generally agree with alot of what Verant does, but hey, if YOU feel like the benifits of the Legend server are nice, have fun! Personally, I can't play enough to justify $480 a year, but I get by with $120 a year fine.<br>

How entertaining is it to get your corpse stuck in a wall and no guides are online to get you out. You log out to preserve your Rez timer only to find that because you are stuck in the wall, the rez timer is bugged and continues running. And to top it off, the guide can't rez you after the timer runs out...The GM won't be back on line for 3 days because she is off to the fan faire, so you ask the guide to get a chat GM. He comes and basically calls you a liar because the rez timer expired and wont rez you and you end up losing 3 days worth of experience. This happened to a very close friend of mine who no longers plays.<br>
<br>
Is that what you think we only pay $10 a month for? The Legends server is BULLSHIT straight through. It is just a way for Verant to seperate you from even more of your money...And guess what? For $40 instead of $10 you get to hear the GM say &quot;Sorry, I can't help you&quot; it just costs you more to hear it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukaerel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaerel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 720<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(2/8/02 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is your opinion on EQLegends?</span><hr size=1> $10 is two pints of Guinness or a movie ticket.  I pay more than $10 for coffee from Tim Horton's in the run of a week.  $10 is about half the cost of a lift pass for a day of skiing on a local hill.  It's about the amount of money I made while typing this post from work.  It won't even buy you a decent steak.<br>
<br>
What do I expect from Verant for $10 a month?  Not a hell of a lot.  They do a damn good job of keeping me entertained for that $10.  That small amount of cash brings more hours of entertainment from EQ than everything described above combined.  Yes, a small percentage of people have problems that cannot be resolved without GMs and are unlucky enough not to be able to find one.  Very few truly *need* a GM to solve.  (A necro would have retrieved that stuck corpse much quicker than a GM.  Don't depend on the GMs and you'll be disappointed and stressed much less. :)  The vast majority of players get way more entertainment from their $10 than they would if they had spent it elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Don't like Legends?  Don't play it.  No one is forced to spend 4 times the cash to play on this server.  Getting angry at Verant for implementing it won't change the fact that they did; it only succeeds in raising your blood pressure. <p><B>Kaerel</b> - Gnomish Sorcerer<BR>

Think about it and do the math.  In a somewhat free market environment you don't necessarily get what you pay for but what the market will bear.  <br>
<br>
If we buy into legends before they make good on their old promises, they WILL NOT LIVE UP TO ANY NEW PROMISES because they don't have to.  It will not be EQ's fault, it will be our fault cause we have not made them do it.<br>

So develope a back bone and demand what you paid for and were promised in the first place.  Or you will never get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uicejackel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>icejackel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(2/13/02 12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> LOL</span><hr size=1> I have 100k that says this stupid legends server won't have anymore support from gm's or gm's with an ability to do anything other than say they are sorry or can't help you.<br>
The biggest complaint most people have with this game is the lack of gm support, be it problems that need addressed such as ks, bug death, other bug issues etc...<br>
Then when you actually do get a tell from an actual gm they are totally clueless to the game and how it really works on a high level basis and are a waste of time. Crap after taking 3 hours to explain you killed a freaking blue con mob and were solo and in the zone alone and didnt get any xp they tell you &quot; ah thats interesting I will have to get someone in the appropriate department to look into that&quot; WTF???<br>
I could care less who looks at it as long as its fixed in the future, but what bugs me the most is you have to explain to the gm how to use a computer and what a video game is, let alone explaining how one actually does things in this particular game before you can actually explain what happened and caused you to petition in the first place.<br>
Of course I don't refer to any veteran gm's about the stupidity of the game only to noob gm's like we are forced to live with!<br>
/em shouts ASHLANNNE..... CRAZECO....<br>
/em cries<br>
Oh and to top it off this whole guide issue of using players to get some sort of empathy since they &quot;know&quot; where we are coming from, to tell us sorry nothing can be done or I will escalate your petition a gm should be in 3099, please stay online...<br>
You all think this will change b/c you can name a farking fs dagger, jackoff's fs dagger!???<br>
I can see it now! The ksing and the situations that will cause.<br>

Keep in mind that going outside and doing an outside activity has many more benefits than just mere entertainment. You get to increase your health, as you walk and our outside in the sun breathing air, You get to increase your chances of meeting someone of the opposite sex and living a normal life. You can increase your vocab and street smarts or life smarts. You get to see whats going on in the world, and many other benefits to giving up EQ every once and a while. Sure whats 10 bucks a month to be entertained right? I mean you spend FAR more living a normal, healthy life, but remember NORMAL and HEALTHY are pretty big key words here. You cant forget to work in that GREAT benefit you pay for of being constantly frustrated, constantly doing WHATEVER it takes to get that 1 level higher, only to get the next Expansion and realize your not quite good enough. Hey and there is that joy of running HALF WAY across the world to get a corpse. OR getting smoked by a mob who will let you NO WHERE near your corpse. I dont really know why, but I fail to see the joy I once found in EQ, but I guess it takes SERIOUS time off to realize, there is more joy in real life and Everquest will never offer you what real life and real emotion for truely IMPORTANT things is. Dont let EQ suck more money away from you than it already has. I think sucking away your time is more than enough. Remember something new always refreshes your &quot;joy&quot; for the game. Legends is jsut something new to keep you entertained or addicted or whatever you want to label it.<br>
