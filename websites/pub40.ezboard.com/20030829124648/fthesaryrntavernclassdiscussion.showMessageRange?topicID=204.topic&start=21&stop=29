that high....with the right &quot;raid buffs&quot; we can hit hit 1600 atk meaning yes we do outdamage 60 warriors by a considerable amount.....warders protection, natures precision alone push our atk beyond what most warriors can get.<br>
<br>
on the flip side though our normal self buffed AC at 60 is between 1100 and 1250......far surpassed by a warriors 1350+....not to mention our considerably lower HP.  <br>
<br>
So what that leaves ya is i high damage machine (second only to rogues...bout even with monks) .....with the luxury of things like soloing...(chloro, heals, snare, root) not to mention epic slow...make rangers an incredible soloing class...highly underated in that dept.....rangers are the only class in the game that actually have the luxury of soloing a blue at 60 with 3 methods of comparable atks... melee, spells, or archery...all 3 about equally effective...and combined are insanly deadly if you know what you are doing.....<br>
<br>
As far as raids go a ranger is on the top of the melee food chain in damage done.....if you want streamlined...sure go for rogues and warriors....(one ranger is plenty to cast CoP on all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but rangers are definatly a nice class to have in there to damage along side the rogues. MELEE.....but verant in all its glory gave rangers some things called Trueshot(disc), Endless Quiver, and Archery Mastery(AA skills).....which if used right and with the right bow is the single most powerful reliable damage dealer in the game (yes even more than manaburn)...for 2 minutes vs that uber mob...a ranger IS god.  <br>
<br>
Anyways....both rangers and warriors are good classes....god knows a ranger will never be the TANK a warrior is.....warriors will always be able to take hits better...its their job.....a rangers job is to use every and any method possible to them to kill a mob....so if you like getting beat on and hitting taunt over and over....warrior is the way to go ....but if you like having a little more fun with your characters...rangers rock <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

ohh btw Suretass......i have close to 4500 hp raid buffed and im a ranger ....so eat your heart out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I play a Half-Elven warrior on the Saryrn Server, and my boss (who started EQ about the same time I did) plays a Half-Elven Ranger.  So through the levels (I'm currently 51, he's 47), it's been pretty easy to track the changes while we progressed.<br>
<br>
Levels 1-10<br>
<br>
Pretty similar, actually.  We both hunted in the Qeynos-QH-Blackburrow-Everfrost area mainly, taking down gnolls, skellies, and rabid animals.  I could tank a little better, but he could track, and we always stayed about even.  ADVANTAGE: Even<br>
<br>
Levels 11-20<br>
<br>
Here's where the ranger spells came into play.  I was still stuck in the Blackburrow-Everfrost areas, while after 16 or so, He decided to take his skills to Oasis, SRo, and even LOIO.  He leveled a bit quicker, and got snare (which helps with bow kiting), and I made more cash in the Everfrost areas.  All in all, he reached his 20's before me, which opened up the door a bit sooner for more adventure for him.  ADVANTAGE: Ranger<br>
<br>
Levels 21-30<br>
<br>
Another one of those pretty even matchups, his ranger spent the majority of the time in LOIO, OT, and a little bit of SK from time to time.  His snare-bow-kiting allowed for more soloability, and allowed him to make up a little ground on the loot aspect.  I, on the other hand, stuck around the western part of antonica, hangin in Everfrost for the mammoth tusks (nice cash), and adventuring out to HHK, SK, Paw, and even Runnyeye.  While his offensive skills let him level solidly in outdoor zones, my defensive skills let me hang in those tough dungeon fights, allowing some awesome grouping experience and a nice little chunk of change.  ADVANTAGE:  Warrior<br>
<br>
Levels 31-40<br>
<br>
Here's where the Ranger's outdoor abilities came heavily into play.  While I was still stuck to HK, Paw, and taking new adventures in Sol A and sometimes LGuk, he was spending most of his time in RM, FM, and IC, bow-kiting and scoring nice groups for his tracking abilities.  The levels went by at about the same pace, and our money was pretty even.  <br>
ADVANTAGE:  Even<br>
<br>
Levels 41-45<br>
<br>
This is where all my dungeon experience came heavily into play.  LGuk and Sol B were the key, allowing me to get a nice little bankroll and pick up a couple really nice items.  My levels went by a little quicker, and he was hunting mainly in OT and DL, where cash is scarce.  After 43, when I gathered a nice little collection of armor and weapons, I picked me up a Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate, which allowed me to solo from 43 to 46 in about 3 days in the yeti caves in DL.  ADVANTAGE:  Warrior<br>
<br>
Levels 46+<br>
<br>
Here's where it all comes down to standing and fighting.  Late 40' and early 50's in DL, CoM, KC, and even spending time in Old Seb and Chardok, I'm able to stand and tank with the likes of the big boys, while he's still taking his common turns in DL, picking up occasional groups when tanks, healers, chanters and shaman are already filling spots.  Warriors are in more demand, which means more groups, which means more time fighting and more experience.  We can take a lickin' and keep swingin', and when the going gets tough I can still (most of the time) save the casters in time and get to the zone before things get too crazy.  Dungeon experience is key in higher levels, and your abilities to stand and fight are essential.  ADVANTAGE:  Warrior<br>
<br>
Now, don't get me wrong.  There are plenty of times I would've loved to have the tracking abilities, spell casting, and overall playing abilities of my ranger companion.  But all in all, even through the boring times of calling out /ooc's for groups, the big thrills always come in the heat of battle, which I experience much more than my ranger friend.  In the higher-end game, each class develops a specific role, and rangers fall short in desireablility behind most of the other melee classes (yes, sometimes even after Pali's and SK's).  Warriors have the defense, Monks and Rogues have the offense and scouting-pulling abilities, and bards are welcome by even the best casters with their ability to assist in most tasks in the absense of another support class.  Rangers simply fall short of most of the important skills needed at higher levels, with the exception still being perhaps their ability to track (which does still hold a strong value in some outdoor zones)<br>
<br>
My advice is this... If you are gonna play an occasional character who can prove helpful to most situations at lower levels, without worrying about the advancement to the higher-end game, then a ranger is surely the way to go.  However, if your goal is to experience the toe-to-toe melee abilities of taking damage, standing in the front lines and giving everything you've got to every fight, then a Warrior, my friend, is what you want to be.  <br>

5) And since you're pretty worthless without equipment, you can go dick around in lowbie dungeons while the CR crew tries to dig you out of whatever kind of fun mess you've created. (You should see some of the nice sets of soft wicker armor I've collected in The Warrens while the rogues dragged, and the clerics rezzed. Impressive!)<br>

Warriors are laidback and fun. You should have one. <br>

I just found the tavern and I'm catching up.<br>
<br>
If you want a class that's not boring, go ranger.  I have a 54 ranger, and access to a 55 warr that I play occasionally.. the ranger is way more fun.  As things are, I've been main tank for my group up until maybe 2 levels ago, when we started hitting planes and I just didn't have the hp's... In can tank in every old world zone we go to, though.. and most of the time I do a better job of keeping aggro (and health) than the warrior... this is probably because the warrior's gear is crap, but you get my point.  A ranger is a lot more fun... for starters, spells allow you to control aggro completely (snare if you want it, jolt if you don't)... there's also the added bonus of being able to solo easily all the way up to 45 with minimal downtime (just get a mana regen buff and you can heal yourself up without any downtime, while that warrior is trying to bandage himself and even then can't get above 50%).<br>
<br>
The downside to a ranger is that nobody ever wants them.  When the rest of my group isn't on, I'm pretty much stuck to soloing (slow at 54) or working on tradeskills, cuz /ooc ranger lfg just doesn't work... at least not till 62, I'm told.  If you've got friends that you play with regularly, I'd say go for the ranger and you'll be set.
