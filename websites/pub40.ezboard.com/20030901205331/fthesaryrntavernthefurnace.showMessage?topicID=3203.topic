The guilt in knowing that I've helped drive someone who could have been a productive member of society into the quivering wretch that we see before us now lately has become to much for me to bare in silence. I urge all of you out there to come clean, it is truly good for your soul.<br>
<br>
First off; thought, since you all are part of it, an explanation really isn't necessary, I must make mention of how the conspiracy is setup.  It's like your standard terrorist network, with cells that generally don't know each other.  Using cleverly written personals and want adds, we communicate and strategize.<br>
<br>
I was inducted into the conspiracy at an early age, I believe through subliminal messages in the cartoons on TV.  After sending away for a Decoder Ring and got back not just the ring, but also a spy monocular, I knew I had been accepted.<br>
<br>
Early on, my duties were very minor.  I tried to train birds to crap on his car only after he washed it.  Sadly, either the birds were too stupid, or my training wasn't sufficient.  All I was able to do was to teach them to target his car all the time.<br>
<br>
Once I grew old enough to get my driver's license, I was assigned into a better position.  I was to drive either incredibly slow, or as fast as possible, in each case as recklessly as I felt comfortable with.  I was given a large variety of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and the like with which to do this with.  I do not believe I was the only one on this assignment, and soon learned to work in concert with the others for greater effect.<br>
<br>
As with all things, that assignment eventually had to end.  I was rotated into my current assignment of making sure all his pets are well fed on chocolate, laxatives, and a special concoction that causes large quantities of gas when ingested.  On occasion I got bolder, and slipped some into his actual food for laughs.<br>
<br>
My superiors felt I could be entrusted with a few other minor assignments, as long as they didn't interfere with my normal one.  As such, I was given the job of messing with his laundry.  This includes stealing single socks, adding dark shirts to his whites, changing the temperature controls, and the like.  I also mess with his TV reception, adding ghosting, static, bleedthrough, and many other wonders of modern broadcasting.<br>
<br>
Once again, I plead with my co-conspirators, Speak openly about your experiences, lest the pressure become too much and affect your own lives.<br>

<br>
It is hard to admit that now that the blinders have lifted from mine eyes, but I was. A pawn of the man, used to destroy Rthen's happiness.<br>
<br>
Listen to my sad tale, gentle reader, and oh muse, let me not break any strings in the telling of it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. Financial independance. They want wealth, they want a nice place to live, and they want you to provide that for them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When I was but ten years old I noticed that Rthen had a nice house and a goodly allowance. Although I was pre-pubescent, I batted my lashes at him until he bought me a soda and let me play in his treehouse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. Social Status. They want you to fit in with their friends and provide social contacts to raise them to a higher level of social status.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
With the turbulent fancy of youth, I made Rthen join the football team in junior high, so that my standing as a cheerleader would be assured.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3. Freedom for them, slavery for you. It is fine for them to have friends and do stuff without you but you need to be predictible. You need to be avliable. Women in this day and age are 5 times more likely to cheat on their mate then men are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This tale is the saddest, gentle reader, and most full of variant themes...let me see if I can summarize those last dark days of high school for you all.<br>
<br>
I was attending Suzie's slumber party, which turned out to be co-ed. I didnt bother to invite Rthen, choosing instead to make out with Bobby, who had a varsity letter in track and was going to Harvard in the fall. However, after a few hours of this, fickle me, I called Rthen at home and was most dismayed to discover that he had gone out for pizza with his family, and was not sitting by the phone waiting for my call.<br>
<br>
I realize these slights pale against the wrongs suffered by Rthen later in his life, but now that my small part in it has been revealed, I must tell of it and apologize.<br>
<br>
And I do still wonder, what malevolent organization, whose hand guided my youthful indiscretions? Is it truly &quot;the man&quot; at work here or some more sinister force.<br>
<br>
At nights when I cannot sleep I see the goddess' dark face and hear her mocking laughter. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne K'harmicdeva, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elektraii>elektraII</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/2/03 11:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3203.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/mosleyrs/PiggyBack.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The time has come...</span><hr size=1> hahaha, you crack me up Vainne <p><a href="http://www.familjenguild.com/dspMember.php?Name=Elektra">

Its amusing to see that you folks have created such a fictional world around the name Rthen.<br>
<br>
If this helps you pass the time more easily in your boring and pointless lives then I suppose there is little harm in it.<br>
<br>
The inital goal some of you had in diminishing my play experience because that caused you some sick pleasure (to know another person was in some way harmed by your actions in or out of game) was only partly sucessful.<br>
<br>
I still play a varity of characters on several servers (including this one) and I still enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
I have also attended numerous Fanfaires.<br>
<br>
What is also amusing is how many of you will talk @#%$ here but in person are so very willing to have a beer at the hotel bar and act like this is all a joke.  <br>
<br>
Grow up...or don't.. either way you all know you are acting like children.<br>
