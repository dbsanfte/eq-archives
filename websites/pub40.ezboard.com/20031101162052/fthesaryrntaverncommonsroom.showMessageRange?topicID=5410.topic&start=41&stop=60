Commonly used effects? Probably commonly used because people like them ala you're bashing peoples taste.<br>

poorly formated? Jpeg? is that a bad format these days? They are too big and out of ezboard regulation? How are they poorly formated? None of them are all fucked up and make you get side scrollers, I don't see your point.<br>

At the same time, I gota say Lum, your sig is trying to hard, trying to do too much, looks way too busy, and as such fits the same definations of ass that your pushing on others.<br>

your arguements have no merit. Its like trying to argue a band is bad based solely on the fact that the songs are over 5 minutes and there is a rule that they can't be. Art follows no standard.

The lens flair comment was never directed at you, nor was it commented as being in YOUR sigs. I just said it was one of many overkill effects people commonly use. <br>
<br>
And also.. you are formatting the sigs into a 4:3 format, that makes it hard to size down to a message board friendly sig format.<br>
<br>
A sig friendly format is banner sized. Mine is a perfect example, it uses a small height to reduce infringing on page length, and takes advantage of width which, unless you go extreme, works fine since rarely does a sig image trail off the edge of the screen requiring horizontal scroll bars. The benefits don't stop there, because my sig uses half the pixels as your's (and everyone else's) I can use a smaller file size and still retain quality. This not only helps with faster download times for people pulling the image up (remember people are pulling more then one sig up, if everyones is 50+k, it will still take a bit on a fast connection, especialy since many peeps servers are slow as all hell), but also less bandwidth for the host server. I'm lucky enough to have free web space from road runner, some people have to pay for even a small web account, and they have bandwidth restrictions. <br>
<br>
celest, on a positive note, the facial touchups are a nice technique. I used alot of advanced color tweaking in mine (compare the rust on the hammer to what it actually looks in game) but hadnt done much of any kind of painting. Im better at manipulating images rather then drawing on them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celestialsky9>Celestialsky9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/23/03 9:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5410.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Signature Art:Updated</span><hr size=1> They can easy be cropped and or sized down to be oh what is yours 482x182 or something where as mine are what 512x200 oh yours what 37k mine are around 48k? not a whole 10k difference oh no! not too much larger but they CAN be sized down easily dont know what your talking about and as I said those requesting signatures ask for ALL different sizes these are just my beginning size because I like them that size its not like omg it cant be changed or we'll all die sort of thing your acting like its not possible to change it easily which it is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  also no I dont see a noticable difference in his weapon other then maybe you copy/pasted a new layer over it made that small part go vivid light instead of normal to cause the rust effect that or you faded opacity and painted over it with some brownish red color but I really cant tell because not much of your signature has been altered except a few different backgrounds mashed together and a faded opacity AHR statue with Ssra statue ect ect ect its an ok sig for not wanting to do much to make it look real,  great for those not wanting a &quot;prettier&quot; sig wasnt it? also this is a FULL size Picture not those sigs those arent even close to it<br>
