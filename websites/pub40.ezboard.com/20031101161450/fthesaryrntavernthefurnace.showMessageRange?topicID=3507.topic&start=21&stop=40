<br>
That's not why the majority left.. It's actually the opposite. The old members were the ones being treated like crap, not the new members. Those are the people who left first, way before the guild was &quot;dissolved&quot;. I don't really consider myself an old member or a new member, I was in the gray area of being guilded since before their first NToV but after the guild originally started, not that that matters any.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and another rumour is that the old leader made like a bandit and took guild bank and guild BoC with them &gt;&lt;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There were only two guild leaders, the old one and the new one. Milon, the old leader, imo, would never even have left the guild in this way, let alone take the guild's property along with him. I didn't know Milon as well as the people who formed the guild with him, but I feel that I knew him enough to make this assumption. As for the new leader and this rumor, I have no idea whether or not this is true. The only people who could know for sure are him and any officers that might've known as well. There was also a rumor floating around that the leadership was spending the guild funds weeks before there was even discussion of disbanding the guild, but once again, I have no idea whether or not this is true because I have yet to see any of the items that he supposedly purchased using guild funds. <br>
<br>
As for the BoC, who knows. A friend who was an ex-FotC as well told me that he spoke with the new leader about it and the leader said that if it was being given up, it was going to Fira, an ex-FotC officer who followed everyone else to Isengard.<br>
<br>
I sure hope I see Fira with a BoC in her hands the next time I see her, because I'd rather see it in the hands of a ranger than used to fatten the wallet of our former guild leader. Actually, I'd rather see it go to Muggzy, the guy who MTed for us a good amount and also went to Isengard.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm still not happy about the way things were handled and how the leadership just flat out left us, and to top it all off, turn right around wearing a guild tag. That's just a kick in the face to any of the members of FotC who were actually good players.<br>
<br>
But thats just how I see it, I may be wrong...<br>

<br>
There are a few things that I can actually clarify just a little, since I was an officer before I left.....<br>
<br>
As far as the leadership using guild bank to purchase items for themselves....is not true...At least to my knowledge....Milon and his wife were pretty much the &quot;BANK&quot;...Nilladara was in charge of the spell bank as it were....What happened with the items that were in the &quot;bank&quot; I have no clue...Prolly still there...<br>
<br>
And as far as the BoC....I remember a good thread on here about a guild ks'ing FoTC on AoW and the end result was a BoC that they were going to use as a guild wpn....That was after Milon had left already....I know that Milon had a BoC already...But from my view...He is the only one that ever used it since he was the guild MT...<br>
<br>
Since I had moved Naekkon to another server, I had thought of putting Epyionn back into FoTC just to have some old friends to talk to in GC...I had even talked to Rokjaw about this a few times....BUT, I had heard &quot;ALOT&quot; of negative things being said from the &quot;old&quot; members about how things were being run....So I was a little leary about tagging him as FoTC again...<br>
<br>
Then one day I was talking with another friend who has left Saryrn about FoTC and found out that Nilladara...Whom I think is one of the nicest and best peeps that was in the guild....had decided to step down as an officer and to leave the guild...And naturally this upset me since she was like a figurehead for the guild...Along with Rokjaw.....Then my friend told me that Shalladiah had said to Nilla....&quot;its a good thing that you are leaving...since you didnt do anything for the guild in the first place&quot;....OMG I was pissed....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...<br>
<br>
I once thought of Shall as a friend, but after hearing that....He could go hump a fukkin tree stump for all i care...*hope he gets some splinters*<br>
<br>
All in all, FoTC ...WAS a good guild...they had good leaders that had a goal and a direction in mind...UNTIL Milon left and Shalladiah took over...<br>
<br>
And I'm sure that I will get flamed for some, if not all that I have posted, but who gives a shit anymore right?<br>
<br>
And to all of you &quot;old school&quot; and some of you &quot;new school&quot; FoTC that I know...GL no matter where you go and hope to chat with you sometime...<br>

<br>
A respected officer Rokjaw got flamed on thursday and left leaving Shall Otana and Fira as only officers.<br>
<br>
Friday Shall announces he is tired of being Gl. Saturday Shall joins Isengard, erases most of FoTC website and disbands FoTc by Sunday morning.<br>
<br>
As to guild funds and BoC I hear Otana who is Shalls RL wife used to borrow guild chanters to sell kei cause they were broke before Milon gave FoTC to Shall. there musta been a bunch in guild bank. Rumor says Shall has new gear like a fungi but i guess we never know<br>

Shitty ending pulling plug and not giving members a chance to stay if they wanted to.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>they were zergin strong, now there's like.... 100ppl left in the guild?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Fate was not a &quot;zerg&quot; guild. Our guild management roster usually totaled between 150-160 people (counting hydras, low level alts and traders) and our average raid force was about 30. On a good day, we could get 50 on and raiding.<br>

<br>
This is correct. So many of the original members cycled out as we got new members that it became a handful of original members in a guild full of strangers. That is a big reason that I think we did not succeed. A lot of people didn't care about each other or bothering to make friends with each other, there was nothing to keep people holding on.<br>

<br>
First of all, if you were a member of the guild near the end, you would know that everything was not fine and everyone was very aware of that. We were in the process of trying to fix things and lay down new rules. Disbanding and/or leaving FoTC was not something that the leadership planned, in fact it was announced the same day that Shalladiah realized that he was no longer enjoying himself and only still remained because he felt obligated to the people and guild. As the only two remaining officers, I said that I would not take over the helm as GL and that I felt very close to the same way that Shall did. Fira did not have enough time to dedicate to such a large task. We all did nothing wrong here, to any of these people, other then by making a choice to leave FoTC and go back to having FUN in a game that we PAY to play. As for fleeing to go to Isengard, a group of close friends had a pow wow and decided they wanted to stick together and find a guild they could all enjoy. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and another rumour is that the old leader made like a bandit and took guild bank and guild BoC with them &gt;&lt;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They guild BoC is being given to Muggzy, who was basically the guild's MT. Tinymity who was also as often the Guild's MT at raids, already has one of his own. As for the guild spells and funds, the officers were just told to sell any of the spells they had and keep the money for themselves. There was nothing in the guild bank other than the BoC and whatever was left after supplying peridots, emeralds, pearls, coffins, essence emeralds, etc to all of the members at each raid.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Milon, the old leader, imo, would never even have left the guild in this way, let alone take the guild's property along with him.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I wouldn't be so sure about that. While Milon was an awesome leader, he did not pass down anything OTHER than the GL tag to Shalladiah. Not one platinum, not one spell, nothing. He left very much so in the same way, also. No one knew what was coming, everyone thought he was happy and that things were going great. He logged on one day and much to all of the officers and members surprise, said he was no longer enjoying himself in the game and that he was leaving to play SWG and felt that Shalladiah was most capable of being the GL and taking FoTC where it wanted to go. I have nothing bad to say about Milon, but that is the truth.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There was also a rumor floating around that the leadership was spending the guild funds weeks before there was even discussion of disbanding the guild,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is untrue, we never spent any of the guild funds on anything other than spell components for buffing, CR, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for the BoC, who knows.

<br>
Someone asked Shalladiah if he would DKP the BoC off, he told them that if he did that Fira would be the one to win, since rangers are on the list of classes that can use it and he had the most (300+) DKP in the guild. The BoC is going to Muggzy, who was the guild's MT and used it most often.<br>

<br>
As far as you being an ex officer of the guild, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I believe during the week or so you spent as an officer.. you ended up quitting because you felt that the members treated you with no respect as well as your schedule not meshing with our raiding times. You started a few threads on the officers forum about people's attitudes, the way they treated officers and how you couldn't handle it. The same reason the officers/leadership left in the end.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Then my friend told me that Shalladiah had said to Nilla....&quot;its a good thing that you are leaving...since you didnt do anything for the guild in the first place&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Heresay from your &quot;friend&quot;. What he said was that he &quot;wasn't surprised because she hadn't been playing anyway&quot;. She hadn't been online, leading or raiding more than a few times in 2-3 months.<br>

<br>
Perhaps, we all put a lot of time, effort and heart into the guild. It may not have lived up to be what was expected of us, or as good as Milon did it, but we did our best and we tried our best to be fair. In the end, it really doesn't matter.<br>

<br>
To your second post of emotional outbursts. You simply do not know what happened and you are assuming that what your &quot;friend&quot; has told you is the truth. It's not. I'm disappointed that you would not speak to Shalladiah, who was your friend, and ask him what happened. I don't mean to put you down, but I thought you had more sense and smarts than all of this. I am really disappointed in you, someone I respected, trusted and used to call my friend as well. I reiterate that Shalladiah did nothing wrong to Fate of the Chosen, the officers or it's members. He simply decided that he wasn't having fun in a game that he pays to play and that he wanted to move on. He will not be getting a name change, because he has nothing to hide or run from -- he will not be leaving the server as you did either. He is being burned at the stake for making a choice (to leave and have fun again) and for lies/rumors that someone has spread.<br>

<br>
Lol, Shall's drinking had nothing to do with it. That's just pathetic. At most, his typing got worse when he drank. It was not a problem in the guild. So many officers and members left for reasons such as: They were busy irl and did not have time for EQ anymore and quit, they quit EQ for SWG, they did not think that Fate was progressing fast enough and left for guilds that were, personal reasons/problems with other members, etc. Finally the reason most of the officers quit was that we were tired of the general attitude in the guild and no lengthly &quot;pep talk&quot; or new set of rules could fix it, we could have kicked out half of the guild but that was not something we wanted to do. We were tired of the greed, whining, complaining, arguements/fighting, drama and stress. So we left.<br>

This is mostly correct. However, it wasn't Shalladiah. The website wasn't touched. The news page clicked over to a new month which has no info entered, try clicking on the previous archives link. I erased most of what was on the message board that didn't have to do with what was going on, so that members who were casual players did not miss what was happening. I disbanded the guild on Sunday due to the fact that only about 15 mains that actively play were all that were still in the guild, the rest were inactive players and low level alts. Only one person stepped up and said that they would take over as GL, the person was a semi casual player and received zero support that I saw. We did not want Fate to go back to being a newbie guild or a total joke. It had seen and accomplished a lot in it's short existance, it was just not meant to be.<br>

The guild funds were not as fat as you may think. A month or two ago, when I was saving platinum for my fast lizard mount, Mezheart offered to let me use his character when he wasn't online to sell KEI. I gratefully accepted and I bought that and a few other things. The money I earned by doing that was my own and has no relevance or connection to the guild bank whatsoever.<br>

They were given the choice, people chose to leave, save very few active members. One person stepped up and said that they would try to be GL, no one supported it. Most of the members and ex members supported, understood and agreed with our reasoning for disbanding the guild. Those who didn't, they will survive and move on eventually. It truly is not the end of the world.<br>

I wish all of the ex members of FoTC all of the best. May you all find good homes and enjoy the game. To those who were the root of (or added to) the problem, I hope that you realize what an impact your actions were and choose to change how you act in the future. I hope that you will learn from this, mature and grow. Remember that this is a game, played for fun and entertainment. I have no hard feelings with anyone from FoTC, I just want to move on and have fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=552260" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/OtanaSig_SaryrnServer.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=otanadesdemonia>Otana DesDemonia</A> at: 9/1/03 3:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanmers>kanmers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:blue;'>Tavern Regular</span></span><br>  Posts: 344<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/1/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what the fuck happened with FOTC</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lynkk isn't in FS anylonger <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What I will do is give a few tid bits of why FotC crumbled, and this is coming from the oldest active member of FotC before it's disbanding.<br>
<br>
Over time FotC slowly lost old, well respected members for various reasons, but mostly from in guild conflicts.  In that same time, these old members were replaced with new folks who really had no true love for the dream that the guild was built on.  Rinse and repeat that about 30 times and you'll start to understand that the general attitude of the member base was that they didn't really care about the guild, or it's problems.  They only cared about loot.  FotC was always loot hungry, and to say it wasn't would be misleading.  There were a handful of very good members who stayed through thick and thin, regardless of loot, in hopes of seeing us succeed, and I applaud you people.  If only everyone could have been like you.<br>
<br>
When Milon decided he didn't like the overwhelming job of gL any longer, he left the guild to Shalladiah, which in my opinion was the best choice that he possibly could have made.  No one else in the guild had the free time, or the love for the guild name to feasibly step up and take the reigns.  Shall did a wonderful job, and made every effort to make us flourish.  Many members didn't feel the same loyalty to Shall that they did Milon, and the chaos began.<br>
<br>
Towards the end, guild fights were a daily occurance.  People would walk on each other in exp groups in order to obtain loot.  The message boards were filled with drama.  People could never really figure out what it was they wanted from the guild, they'd complain that we raided too little, and then that we raided too much.  It came to a point, which was almost comical, when folks would hound me to find a target to raid, and then immediately log once I called to raid it.  This all comes to the shoulders of the leadership, and frankly, I felt we did a hell of a job taking it all in stride.  It's when the members start attacking the leadership that things have to change, and so they did.<br>
<br>
I left on my own reasoning.  I saw FotC suffering the same dreadful problems in the future unless we gutted the membership and started at square one.  I personally didn't want to resort to HoT raids again, so that option wasn't for me.  When I left, I had every intention of going solo for exp, and hope someone would pick me up.  Shall and I were close friends, and my leaving had more of an impact than I expected.  When he announced that he was stepping down, I personally called him and a group of friends together to discuss the possibility of moving on together.  We unanimously decided that Isengard would be a perfect place for us all to apply with.  We contacted an Isengard officer, got in a chat channel and the rest is history.<br>
<br>
As for loot, and guild funds, everything went with the officers.  I had roughly 8k in guild funds that I offered up to Otana and was told to keep it, which I did.  I also have a mess of dumb spells taking up my inventory and would love to unload them.  I was given the spell bank from Nilla, and that totals about 70 spells of little value.  I'd be more than happy to disperse those among all ex-FotC members as a parting gift.  They mean nothing to me.<br>
<br>
What does mean something to me, is that a dream died.  One that was started with a man that I respected.  One that was passed on to another man whom I still respect, and who wept the day he had to kill it.  We loved that guild, whether you believe it or not, it doesn't matter to me.  To all ex-FotC members, new and old, we experienced a lot together.  We joined a guild, spent a lot of time together, and honestly, for the most part are better for it.  Just take one thing with you, if you take nothing else.  Your actions carry a much larger impact on others than you may realize, so think about the team when your about to do something that affects everyone.  Don't take people for granted, or their willingness to endure you.  Good luck to all of you, I hope that you find what it is you are looking for.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=467339" target="top">Rokjaw Preechurfysts</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=759383" target="top">Orinn Brainslayer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=785834" target="top">Pasty Gregorin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tose>Tose</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/2/03 12:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what the fuck happened with FOTC</span><hr size=1> I wish you all well in your next guild, take the lessions you learned for good and ill and remember them.<br>
