<br>
How's the view from the cheap seats, folks?<br>
<br>
It's easy to criticize when your country has no military responsibility outside it's own borders. Tell you what, the next time some petty third world dictator decides to commit genocide against some people he hates, we'll let Norway or France handle it by themselves since people there are so dissatisfied with how the US has been trying to keep the peace over the last few decades. We're on the front lines all over the world, so until you deploy your soldiers along with ours instead of behind them, your opinion really doesn't count for much. And no matter what kind of spin you put on how things happened, the bottom line is that the people of both Afghanistan and Iraq are better off now than they were before we got there.  <p>Jangral<br>

<br>
Yes as its been said time and time again our system isn't perfect but its the best thing going. This only backs that argument further. The world is filled with restrictive governing bodies, only need to look to countries that forbid women to read and the like to see that. <br>
<br>
Now for the direction I assume you were headed towards with that statement. It seems obvious the reason they did not allow foreigners to study chemistry was for fear of them using the knowledge to perform heinous acts. They perhaps went overboard with their actions denying someone access to knowledge on the principle they may misuse that information they would not be handing over anthrax to the student to do what they would with it chemistry is a major part of life and career possibilities to deny them access to it I'd hope they'd have reason to believe the person had ill intentions rather than simply because they are a foriegner. Then again perhaps if we didn't allow foreigners to take pilot lessons 9/11 would have been prevented but you can't predict everyone's intention and the what if game gets you no where if you don't have a valid reason to believe things could have been different.<br>
<br>
 As far as the competing university's actions its a pitiful attempt at publicity. Allow the student the education they want through your university but if you grant them a scholarship solely on the basis of them being publicly known as the downtrodden you're no better than the other university especially if you choose to argue this on the basis of discrimination. (Could go on about reverse-discrimination but thats a whole new can of worms, but speaking of the RIAA this incident brings to mind the case of the 12 yr old girl who got sued for downloading mp3s and the online mp3 company reimbursing her for the settlement with free downloads from their company, blatent, pathetic publicity)<br>
<br>
We've made similar mistakes like this in the past in our country we too had basically PoW camps for our citizens who were of Asian descent due to the government thinking they couldn't trust them. Our leaders just as the leaders of every other country are capable of being in error it is the responsibility of the people of our nation to stand against our governments actions if we oppose them. The biggest problem in the current system of the US is the people, there are too many sheep within our borders. A majority of those who oppose Bush and think he's the worse thing to happen to our country since Hiroshima its probably safe to say are the same people who were hanging their flags out all of a sudden after 9/11 and singing Bush's praise at his quick response thinking he was the best thing since sliced bread. <br>
<br>
There was a large bump in the road in Iraq things didn't go as everyone expected. The American people wanted a magic wand waved and for us to miraculously save and liberate the Iraqis and thought the Iraqis would be so grateful they'd love us forever and we'd all live happily ever after. Welcome to reality this is war there are no happy endings there is only destruction and hopefully a lesser evil winning out over the greater evil. <br>
<br>
I'm sure you've all had numerous teachers tell you in the past, as have I, that history repeats itself this seems like Vietnam to me. We go in believing we'll make the world a better place things don't go just right, soldiers die, citizens turn against the president, Troops get pulled out, we don't change a thing, we win the battles but lose the war along with all we have invested. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Actually no, pre-emptive strikes is a completely new policy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
True we don't initiate the conflicts we get involved in but this was started when Iraq began its attacks on Iran. They did not adhere to the terms of the treaty and rather than show weakness the US took it upon itself to enforce those terms even without UN backing. If we had conducted Desert Storm on our own this could have been avoided but we decided to perform it as a world outreach trying to get support and backing from everyone else. Iraq at the time did not know what they were up against and soldiers did not want to serve Hussein it should have been swift but we showed our weakness then, we caved in to other countries wanting Hussein to stay in power and as a result we now have come to this point. If we back out now we still have the bad publicity and the problem will still be there, it is time to solve this particuliar problem once and for all even if it does lead to more US military deaths. <br>
<br>
Why must we wait holding back our hand, why can we not be the aggressors for a change. Does waiting til they hit us directly really take us from being the good guys to being hellspawn? Look to WWII countries falling to germany, Japan attacking China and the US sitting on its hands in neutrality with its arms embargo, it took the Pearl Harbor massacre on our docked ships to get us involved. There will likely never be a war or conflict that we do not eventually enter into so why not cut to the chase and stop it before it starts.<br>
<br>
If you think waiting til we're hit or allies are hit or some poor defenseless country is hit before we take action will prevent us being viewed unfavorably/hated you're mistaken. We're hated around the world, they watch our movies, listen to our music, read our literature, eat our fastfood, oogle our women all the while cursing us to hell. Thats the price we pay for being who we are. We're arrogant, we're independant, we're free, we're democratic, we're blind and we're at the top of the food chain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That was funny  Coiled copperhead ready to strike? Please, more like a toy snake with a battery that makes it hiss.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok lets say we left Afghanistan alone, left Iraq alone, left everyother country/regime that has a vendetta against the US and has access to arms alone. How long do we have before they finally build up enough force to pose a threat. A copperhead won't strike you as long as you have it in your sight you can stay out of its range but its when you lose track of them that they pose the biggest threat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Self preservation yes.. of Bush and his buddies.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
How does entering Iraq serve to preserve Bush and his administration? War more often than not hurts a president's public image, there are several people who want to believe there's a peaceful alternative to meet aggression/threat with anytime you enter a conflict you're going to catch heat. People will think you didn't act swift enough, operations weren't conducted efficiently, you didn't take it far enough, its none of your business to be there, there's no excuse for the loss of life, or complain about the money spent on it.<br>
<br>
We bitch now about the patriot act but when 9/11 happened it was the American people screaming never again. We have no idea what we want, do you want a governing body you can sleep safe at night knowing your privacy is protected or do you want to know something like 9/11 or Oklahoma city bombing won't happen again. People raised hell about the longer waits in Airports after the security changes following 9/11 but yet they want to be protected.<br>
