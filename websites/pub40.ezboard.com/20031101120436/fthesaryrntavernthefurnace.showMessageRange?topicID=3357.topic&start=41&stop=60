Course that does not in any way prevent this:<br>
<br>
I am rezzing one day get a call and show up to find its another cleric (mild /boggle). I do the clicky thing, get the plat, heal and buff, then I see the guy summon a Drolvarg (/arches eyebrows). I tell him thanks for the donation, almost have enough to finish my solstice earring now. Then he says to me, Wow, wish I could find a good guild and get my epic. I tell him I have a great guild they got me mine plus some very nice armor, and I am happy to be a member. I am thinking he seems a decent enough fellow, even if he could not rez himself. I am still thinking about this lizard though...so I tell him I wish I had the plat to buy a lizard. He says, oh $40 on player auctions I got this a solstice earring and some gear.<br>
<br>
What, can't he buy his fucking epic too?<br>
<br>
Somethings you just gotta work for I suppose. Hats off to Froggerx on having the cajones to put up his future Magelo...but man are they gonna hurt if:<br>
<br>
1. he fails dismally<br>
2. he succeeeds on the backs of those in his guild, by taking all the drops for himself on raids.<br>
<br>
...or to be the topper:<br>
<br>
He uses his guild to try, screws them all completely, and still fails. <p>Fundin Stoutheart<br>

when did I say anything about PA, and aren't you the cleric I brought up to PoA to kill princess with heh? We just ported up,I gave instructions, we killed,we looted, jumped off, ported off. Sure it was me?<br>
<br>
How do you get your &quot; verified magelo &quot; and does it keep track of your ingame progress like once a week someone to inspect and /who all you?<br>

<br>
I never meant to imply you used PA....that was some cleric I rezzed a while back, not you. <br>
<br>
And I am not saying you are gonna screw your guild over, that is for them to judge, but this is the blast furnace, so a little conjecture is not out of the way.<br>
<br>
More and more I find people have their own notions of how the game is played. Many people appear not to be above getting into a guild to get what they can for themselves then leave to join the guild the really wanna be in (but would not take them til they had this or that or got to some level). This I have seen.<br>
<br>
I am sure I have read where guild leaders and officers have lined there alts or friends with gear that should go to mains in the guild, but this I have never actually seen.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against you...like I said, gratz to you on having a dream, and double gratz if you can get there.<br>
<br>
Oh and the Magelo thing...yes, you synchronise your profile as often as you like using the client they provide. course you have to buy the premium service to get that. but I think they lket you use up to three seperate EQ accounts on one premium Magelo account. I think. Don't quote me! <p>Fundin Stoutheart<br>

Yeah yours came to mind! I look to your Magelos (HnE and others too) to know what I need to work toward. I worked damn hard making Fish Rolls and selling Spider Silks to get what I have. I used to think 250pp was a LOT of money and wondered how people got so much money. I just spent 17K buying my 59 pet and new darkness spells. I'll be damned if I am gonna pay 9K for the last work for an attempt at making the spell when I can just pay an extra 3K for the spell. Anyway that's off topic.<br>
<br>
I look at Nunnayan's and other Necro's Magelo to see what I need. I have gotten quite a bit since then thanks to them. I think Frogger's is bad because it is bad form to go up. Use the alternate profile's if what you are trying to do is wishful thinking.<br>

It shows pride showing what you have and humbleness to show cloth...

On a side note Spyrit/kugan changed his AA's in magelo, dropping his hp down alot but making his goal more realistic. Still 10 and a half levels and 49 aa's in 2 weeks will be fun for you.

<br>
It wasn't particularly screwing people over...well then again, actually, Explode beat me out on a haste neck once. Kinda funny...how he was &quot;hacked by his oringal owner&quot; a few weeks later and went back to being in PbP.<br>
<br>
Then along came Brash as a recruit!!<br>
<br>
Most of that Ntov stuff was probably going to rot, but then again, there were probably actual REAL recruits that could have used some of it...or at least real players that didnt have some weird issues going on with their roomates, and &quot;hacking&quot; and so on that never made any sense.<br>
<br>
But no, you never ever use anyone...<br>
<br>
I have all the respect in the world for any guildleader, but I am very confused by the contrast between what you say and what I have Seen you do. I do understand that the &quot;my roomate/brother/cousin/cellmate was playing me&quot; argument is an accepted and useful one, but in your case it still raises more questions than it answers and in the end leaves me teotally confused...so please explain:<br>
<br>
1.) Why do all these people think you're a scammer?<br>
2.) Why did Explode get tagged ToN as an alt of Karoork and then turn out to be you after he got a fair amount of gear (and singlehandedly changed our &quot;hydras on raids&quot; policy?)<br>
3.) Why then, when Brash applied, didnt it ever come up that he was:<br>
a.) you<br>
b.) the guildleader of Purified by Pain<br>
4.) And then there was some sort of scandal that I don't know the details to, and dont really care about anyways, but its my understanding that basically you and Karoork just blamed each other...and then suddenly you had to go get new characters?<br>
<br>
I guess my real question is whatever-your-name-is, why do you lpay the game like this? What makes it fun for you? Because from an outside perspective, all of this scheming to get loot on characters that you dont even have anymore...(were they banned? sold? stolen? remind ,e..I've forgotten)--it seems like a lot of work for pixels. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandarie>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 3169<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/10/03 6:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3357.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HnE</span><hr size=1> heh <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/NandSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
