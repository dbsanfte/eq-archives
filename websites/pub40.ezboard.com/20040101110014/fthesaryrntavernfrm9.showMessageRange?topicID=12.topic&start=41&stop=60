1.<br>
<br>
  Kurron Ni the thief<br>
<br>
Talk to Kurron Ni, who can be found near the docks in the Outpost, in the OverThere. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kurron Ni' <br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'Out of my way, stranger, I am on a delicate mission. Interfere with my search and I shall relieve you of your head! Bother me no more.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What do you seek?' <br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'I have traveled here in hopes of finding a soul worthy of assisting me in completing my mission.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am worthy'<br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'I doubt it, but I have been wrong before. Before I share with you the details of my mission, however, you must first prove your worthiness. Agreed? <br>
<br>
You say, 'Agreed' <br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'Very well then, my new friend. I have an acquaintance that stands in need of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires the breast, greaves and helm to complete his set. I also must pay back a loan that has come due in the amount of 900 platinum. Return this to me and I shall share with you my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that will be earned at its completion. Show your face here without fulfilling my request and I will offer you on the altar to Innoruuk himself. Be off!<br>
<br>
The Darkforge Armor items are all seperate quests. For the Breastplate you need Decayed Mail and Decayed Breastplate, and 2 bars of enchanted platinum. The two decayed pieces of armor are dropped in Temple of Cazic-Thule. All you need to do it get a big group of people around the temple. Then split up into groups and kill everything. You will probably come across at least one decayed mail and decayed breastplate. The two bars of enchanter platinum you can get from enchanters. For the Greaves you need Decayed Left Legplate, Decayed Right Legplate, and two bricks of Melatite. The decayed is dropped in Temple of Cazic-Thule and the Melatite is dropped off of clockwords in Solusek A. People can be found selling them for 50pp. For the Helm you need Decayed Helm, Decayed Visor, and two Freeport Militia Helms. Freeport Militia Helms can be gotten rather easily by sneaking into East Freeport and waiting for the guard that walks by the dock (provided no one is camping the guards by the gates). He is pretty low, and is far enough away from other guards that, as long as you have him darknessed and kill fairly quickly, he won't aggro any others. <br>
<br>
Take the three items plus 900 platinum and give it to Kurron Ni. He will respond: <br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'Well done, {your name} , I honestly didn't expect to see you again. Yes, yes, this is perfect! My mission is nearly complete! <br>
<br>
You say, 'What mission?' <br>
<br>
Kurron Ni says 'My mission was to find a pathetic shadowknight and bring him closer to Innoruuk. You volunteered. By exercising my superior powers of persuasion, I have now taken from you a fine suit of armor and enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping neither soberly nor alone for quite some time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. My mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall take your head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal rogues! <br>
<br>
At this point Kurron Ni will start attacking you. He is a level 55 rogue and resistant to all spells except for disease and poison DoTs, and the Wizard Lure Spells. You will need around one group of level 50-60 players. You might want to bring more because you definitely do not want to die on this part of the quest. <br>
<br>
Once killed, loot Letter to Duriek from his corpse. <br>
<br>
Duriek, I have searched this godless pit for what seems to be an eternity with nothing to show for my efforts. I pray to Innoruuk that you have made some breakthrough in your research. Please update me as to your progress. In the meanwhile I have run into some unexpected expenses and will need some funds to carry on. An additional ten thousand should suffice. Regards, Karnett <br>
   <br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   <br>
2.<br>
<br>
 <br>
@  Now off we head to Paineel, to locate Duriek. He is upstairs in the tower, which looks out onto the newbie grounds. Hand him the note and he will tell you the story of his apprentice. Ask him &quot;what apprentice&quot; and he will give more background information. Next tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you to prove your worth. First he asks you to get him a Cough Elixer as he is getting older and is in need of one. Head off to Neriak and talk to Smaka who can be found in the Foreign Quarter. He can make special cures but they do cost a lot. Pay him 1000pp and he will create the Cough Elixir for you. <br>
<br>
Once you have obtained the Cough Elixir, hand it to Duriek and he will inform you that he was trying to create the Corrupted Ghoulbane, but alas he is in no condition to search out the necessary components anymore. He needs you to first locate a Tome for him, which is dropped by Ratman Guards who can be found in the Hole. Once you have obtained the Tome, hand it to Duriek and he will then tell you the items you must collect to create the Corrupted Ghoulbane. <br>
<br>
The four items he requires are the Blade of Abrogation which is obtained through a quest in the Plane of Air, the Soul Leech which is dropped by Cazic-Thule in the Plane of Fear, the Ghoulbane which is dropped off the Shin Lord in Upper Guk and the Decrepit Sheath. To obtain the sheath, head off to the Qeynos Sewers and locate Teydar who spawns in the middle of the Blood Sabers lair. He will tell you that he is in need of some items before he will hand over his loot. He would like you to bring him a Decrepit Hide which are dropped by Ashenbone Drakes in the Plane of Hate, a Drake Spine which is dropped by Rharzar, a rare spawning Drake in the Rathe Mountains, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar. Handing all three items to Teydar will result in the Decrepit Sheath. <br>
   <br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   <br>
3.<br>
<br>
  Now head back to Duriek and hand him all four items, and he will reward you with the Corrupted Ghoulbane, and will then tell you to go and talk to Lhranc who can be found in the City of Mist. Lhranc spawns in the middle hut near all the Goo's at loc [0,<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . He will tell you that he is in need of three items before he can forge the weapon for you, the Heart of an Innocent, the Will of Innoruuk and the Head of the Valiant. <br>
<br>
Off to Toxxulia Forest to locate Knarthenne Skurle who spawns near the docks. If you hail him, he will tell you that you do not have the heart of an innocent. If you ask about the heart of an innocent, he will hand you a soulcase and tells you to combine the soulcase with the heart of someone who is pure. Now we head off to the Hole and head down to the Jail Area. Locate Caradorn and he will give you a lot of background information. Basically Caradorn just wants to be released from this hell and needs you to locate the key for him. The key to Caradorn's cell can be found on various Mimics who can be found past a secret door near the bank. Once you hand Caradorn the key, Kyrenna will spawn and they both will attack you. Loot Kyrenna's corpse and you will discover the Blood of Kyrenna and the Heart of Kyrenna. Place the heart in the soulcase and hit combine, it will become the Heart of an Innocent. <br>
   <br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   <br>
4.<br>
<br>
  For the second item we will have to head off to Kerra Ridge and talk to Marl Kastane who spawns beside a hut in town. There also seems to be two different versions of Marl. The first will give you a quest and upon completing it, will spawn the other Marl. To see if you have the correct one, ask him &quot;what prophecy&quot;. If it's the first Marl, you have to deliver a letter to Gerot Kastane who can be found in Paineel. He will in turn hand you back another item, which you hand back to Marl. You will gain faction and the second Marl will spawn. <br>
<br>
Once you ask Marl, &quot;what prophecy&quot; he will give you a background story on Glohnor and Lhranc. If you tell him &quot;I will complete the ritual&quot; he will tell you that you need to create a Dark Shroud. To do this you will need the blood of an innocent. Hand him the Blood of Kyrenna and he will reward you with the Dark Shroud and will tell you to give this to Glohnor who can be found in the Hole. Handing this item to Glohnor will cause a Mummy of Glohnor to spawn, which you must kill. Loot the Mummy Wrappings of Glohnor and the Head of Glohnor from the corpse. Return to Marl and hand him the wrappings (again make sure it's the second Marl) and you will be rewarded with the Will of Innoruuk. <br>
   <br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   <br>
5.<br>
<br>
  Head back to Paineel now and talk to Gerot Kastane. He will tell you all about the Head of the Valiant and say that all he needs is the head of a valiant warrior. Hand in the Head of Glohnor to Gerot and he will reward you with the Head of the Valiant. <br>
<br>
Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc. He will turn into a living version of himself wielding the wicked blade and attack you. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon, Innoruuk's Curse. <br>
   <br>
 <br>

Rharzar is a bright green drake, who runs quite fast.<br>
<br>
Walkthrough is mostly correct, but a few differences.<br>
<br>
Soul Leech is dropped by Dread, Fright and Terror in Fear.<br>
<br>
The live Lhranc no longer spawns wielding Innoruuk's Curse.  When you hand the undead Lhranc the Sword, Will, Head and Heart, you recieve a coin.  Once you kill Lhranc, Marl will spawn right outside of where you found Lhranc.  Handing him the coin will get you Innoruuk's Curse.  Because Lhranc no longer wields IC, he quads instead of doubles, making the final step significantly more difficult than before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ureiaku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reiaku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/15/01 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shadowknight...</span><hr size=1> Lharnc is a pain in the ass, for every time he lands a hit, you take 500 damage<br>

I would rank him up there with some of the most damaging NPC's.<br>
<br>
1. Sirran &amp; Other 2k hitters...<br>
2. AoW<br>
3. Lhranc<br>
4. Vindi/OOMVelk<br>
<br>
His weakness is his HP's... I would estimate about 15-20k, so go all out.<br>
<br>
He was taking down L60 Warriors with 5500 hp and 1250 ac in less than 5 seconds.

My Guild is like the Masters of Chain Casting Pets, and Theres no fucking way we could do Lharnc with mages/necros, he would rip thru them faster then people could recast<br>
