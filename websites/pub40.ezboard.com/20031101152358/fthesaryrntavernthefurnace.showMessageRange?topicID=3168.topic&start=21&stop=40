<br>
And so we are expecting doctors to be perfect now?  It's one thing to sue if it was negligence by the doctors allowing the girl not to be saved.  But incorrectly estimating the extent of the injuries is not necessarily negligence.  Do you honestly believe doctors are infallible?  If a hospital cannot locate the cause of a disease quickly enough, should they be sued?<br>
<br>
Of course not.  They are doing whatever is possible to help people, to the best of their abilities.<br>
<br>
Should a football player get sued because they were trusted to make the game-winning catch, and missed it?  No.<br>
<br>
This is almost the same situation, except it's alot more emotional because someone died.  But just because its a sensitive situation doesn't mean common sense should be thrown out the window.<br>
<br>
The doctors performed to the best of their ability.  Sueing them for not being perfect is ridiculous.  It is this kind of crap that is causing medical walkouts in this country.  The last thing we need are physicians afraid to help people out of fear of what may happen if they fail. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205399">My Gear Sucks less now!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eudamanslayer>EudaManslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1074<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(3/14/03 6:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3168.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That's it!</span><hr size=1> yah what ever, people watch Hockey for the fights.

Naw Check the contracts of the players. They are probobly held responsable untill they leave the filed of play. If the NHL player contracts don't hold them responsable for injury out of the ring, and tickes stait that the by being at a hockey game that you as a spectater have to waver any rights and cant hold the league or players or the areana lyable for any damages. Then its a closed deal. If the league or the tickes dont say that then its sue land, come one come all. This coffee it too hot!

Talk about a high pressure workplace.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's why doctors carry malpractice insurance.<br>
<br>
And cases like this are why malpractice insurance is so expensive.  For some specialties, it can easily run over $100K per year.  It's gotten so bad that some doctors in Pennsylvania stopped performing certain types of surgery last year, to pressure the governor to enact legislation addressing the problem.<br>
<br>
And expensive malpractice insurance is one of the reasons (not the only reason, but one of the reasons) that health insurance premiums and health care costs generally are so high.  <br>
<br>
So who pays the settlement in this case?  In the long run, you do.  <br>
<br>
Disclaimers on the ticket?  Please.  You can have language that is crystal clear, you can make the guy sign the damn disclaimer and initial every word to make sure he read it, you can even paint &quot;you might die sitting here from a puck&quot; on the back of every seat.  If a judge doesn't think the outcome is &quot;fair&quot;, in his own view of fairness, he won't give a damn how clear the warnings were.  Welcome to the U.S. legal system today, someone else is always to blame.  As someone else said earlier, there's no such thing as an accident any more.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eudamanslayer>EudaManslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1076<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(3/14/03 7:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3168.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That's it!</span><hr size=1> How many people have died in Hockey games?

No I don't expect anyone to be perfect. However I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> expect someone to be able to perform their job.  It's doctor's jobs to save people's lives, they use all their training and knowledge and put it to use saving somebodys life.  If a person is beyond saving that is one thing. But this little girl, according to how I read the article, could have been saved if the doctor was able to interpret a brain scan properly. Someone who works as a doctor should be able to interpret a brain scan properly, and realize how fatal this condition could be, and must be able to take appropriate steps to save the life before it becomes too late.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Alright, you're right, I'm not into hockey, 80-100 is a bit of an exaggeration.

<br>
Hockey as a pro sport has beenarounf for well over 50 years. In that 50 years this is MAYBE the second time anyone has died due toa puck flying into the stands. Saying they know it's dangerous is silly. Of course they know it's dangerous, that's why the release of liability is on the back of the tickets. It's just like Auto Racing, the stadium, nor the racing teams and drivers involved are not responsible of something flys off one of the cars and in to the stands and severes your head from your body. <br>
<br>
This was/is and should always be considered a freak accident. There is no controlling the puck if it goes ricocheting off of someone's stick. That's like trying to control the flight path of a baseball midflight. <br>
<br>
Your comparison of the car slamming in to you to this is irrelevant. The car accident could have been stopped before it even happened via more training etc.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think putting up a net could have stopped this, much the same way that putting up a net at a baseball park will not always stop the ball from going in to the stands. <br>

Even the best trained poilets can crash planes, even the best trained soldiers can screw up and cost thier squad lifes. In the millatery if you screw up and it COULD have been avoided you get hung for it, if it was beyond your controle you may get off the hook or you may get a coutmartial right? This boys and girls is LIFE. And as MUCH as you all hate to admit it Life is lived on a CASE by CASE system. Every moment we live it s diffrent from the time befor it.

I disagree.  It's a doctor's job to treat someone to the best of their abilitiy.

The irony ofcourse lays in the fact that that person who died was infact contraged out by the mafia and the player was just doing what he was payed to do.
