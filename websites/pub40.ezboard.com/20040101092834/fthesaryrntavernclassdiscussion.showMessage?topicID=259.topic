(And yes, I expect to get flamed a bit for making it.) <br>
<br>
I think warriors are probably the most disadvantaged class in this game. Don't get me wrong, I love playing my warrior - there's nothing I like more than pulling and tanking - it's just that it feels as though - balance wise - the game favors those who can cast or at least have some casting ability. <br>
<br>
Now if you look at the role a warrior plays in a well-balanced group, at the higher levels we play a critical part - punching bag - that few others can assume. But how much of the game is actually played in these situations? <br>
<br>
I gotta be honest, I somewhat envy the flexibility that I see other classes have with regard to playing style  Assuming you have a job, or school and a life outside of the game, and don’t want to jump in and out of groups as your schedule permits, soloing with a warrior is a pain, plain and simple. And now that we've worked so hard to get our HP's up, recovering from tough battles can take forever.<br>
<br>
I think when the game was created, it was assumed that people would be grouping most, if not all of the time - it being incented with group exp bonus's etc. But the playing style of the various classes has evolved over the years as individual have discovered the best ways to play their particular class. Kiting, DOTing, whatever the strategies, these methods were probably not intentionally built into the game, but are advantages/strategies that have been discovered over time, and each thereby gives the class that can do it, another small advantage.<br>
<br>
But with the warrior class there isn't that much &quot;new strategy&quot; that we can employ. As a result, I think that to some extent as the other classes have developed creative soloing methods, we have fallen behind the others somewhat from a balance standpoint. Maybe the difference is that warriors are more one dimensional – tanks in groups – while other classes are more multi-dimensional and can play a variety of different roles, depending on whether they are in a group or not. <br>
<br>
Here I am trying to get my HP's as high as I can so that I'll be a better tank, but the higher my HP's get the longer it takes to heal up when I'm down to 10%. (granted it takes me longer to get down to 10% but that's besides the point.) Most other classes are running circles around me when I'm forced to solo on the battlefield. (Ok, this is turning into a longer vent than I had intended, but I might as well finish.) <br>
<br>
So here's my solution: <br>
I seriously think that the recovery rate for warriors should go up as their levels go up. Look at it this way, if you took me - an average Joe - and some decorated Green Beret and beat us both down hard - to almost dead - I sure and hell don't believe I'd be back at 100% strength faster than he would - that's BS. (Remember, he'd have a lot more HP's than me.) In reality his recovery rate from training and fitness should be many times faster than mine. (And I'm in good shape!!) <br>
<br>
Translated into the game, it should not take a lvl 50 warrior 4, 8, or 10 times longer to recover from a near death experience than it does a lvl 5 warrior. (bandaging can help speed this up a bit, but it can still take forever.)<br>
<br>
This improvement in recovery rate would go a long way toward balancing out the warrior class with the others, by significantly reducing our down time. I'm not suggesting a huge number, but even a 5-10 hp's per tick at mid levels would make a dramatic improvement. We would still need healers when tanking in groups because the improved recovery rate would not come close to the damage a big mob or multiple mobs can deal. But we also wouldn't need an hour to recover from a really nasty fight.<br>
<br>
One last thing, I know that the casters need to recharge their mana, which can take some time, but since everyone has KEI these days, these short waits sure don't compare to the waiting that we warriors have to endure. <br>
<br>
And once again, don’t get me wrong, I love being a warrior – I love the pulling, the tanking – it’s all a blast. I just wish we could hold our own a little better as a class.  <br>
<br>
Any thoughts?  <br>
Do you agree that warriors are a bit under balanced in the current game?<br>
If not, what class is?<br>
And while we're at it, which classes might be over-balanced? (I'll toss out druid as an answer to that one.)<br>

<br>
Warriors are also completely nessessary for all big game hunting.<br>
<br>
Warriors are not a solo class, its that simple.  They can solo, but so can any class; they just can't do it well.<br>
<br>
Its a bad place, and not really that fun for the players, but warriors ARE balanced with that in mind.  Now, if you wanted to make a &quot;we don't taunt enough&quot; or &quot;we don't do enough dmg&quot; stance, those are more valid issues.<br>
<br>
And as for your &quot;casters get Kei to help them regen mana faster!&quot; thing,  there are spells that give regeneration....  True, they don't last almost 4 hrs per hit, but they're out there. <p>Ninen of Saryrn<br>

<br>
I agree that warriors are not a solo class.  But I'd wager that none of the classes were &quot;intended&quot; to be solo classes initially. Or the thought was that each would be balanced from a soloing perspective.  <br>
<br>
I think the plan was to have people group. It just turned out that the other classes figured out how to solo (using pets as mini tanks, DoTing, Kiting etc), and the warriors - given our limitations - never could.<br>
<br>
I think that you made a good points regarding damage dealing and taunting.  And in fact, if we were better at damage dealing, we'd probably be a better at soloing.<br>
<br>
If they doubled or tripled our recovery speed - due to warrior fitness/training (or doubled the bandage healing rate) I don't think that it would unbalance the game. <br>
<br>
It wouldn't make much difference in the high end game or in groups because we'd still need the healers and casters. But it sure would let us solo a bit more. <br>
<br>
I don't think that would make things unbalanced in our favor because we're playing catch-up in that area.<br>

<br>
Better Taunting... there was nothing more maddening / frustrating and downright embarassing than getting your agro stolen from you by the cleric / druid / Shaman who was trying to keep you alive....<br>
<br>
No Stun From Front - ALL RACES... or at least mak it an AA skill you could buy..<br>
<br>
Better Natural Resists - the innate magic resistance we get is cool but ti should count for all resists.... IMO<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Specialization - All classes that can cast spells get this... why cant melees &quot;specialize&quot; in a chosen combat form?  like Specializinf in 2H slash (Faster swings -  innate Haste with that weapon class (that WILL stack with all other haste items/buffs), Higher Skill cap, maybe a  +5%  to  10% in that chosen skill?<br>
<br>
All of these Ideas could be added to the game as innate abilities or even AA skills that could be bought with Aa points.<br>
<br>
just a few ideas from a retired warrior... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
