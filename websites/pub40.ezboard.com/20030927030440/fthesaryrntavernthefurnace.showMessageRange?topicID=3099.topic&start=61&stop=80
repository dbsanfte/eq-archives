Well I know for almost certain that the cleric and the monk are not on Saryrn. pretty sure that the war and shaman aren't either. If you read the links above from the other server, it shows the cleric and another alt or 2 there.<br>
Thank god for small blessings...<br>

I laughed so hard i was crying and woke my wife up wondering what was wrong. <br>
<br>
As for Minymii.. i think we have a new sport forming on the Saryrn server and BF. The game is this: Who can KS Lodi from it and cause it to post the most incoherent babble on the furnace. <br>
<br>
I read its posts and imagine a person banging furiuosly away at the keyboard, blood vessels throbbing at the forehead, sweat pouring down in rivers as the mental state begins to detoriate. As the perceived slight festers a simmering anger boils over into a fuming fount of hatred.. and then the sexual references begin. Im thinking that somewhere in its tortured past it had an orgasm during a raging fit of fury and these posts are the only method to induce the anger necessary to attain that pinnacle of sexual delight. <br>
<br>
The only down side to this is that when Dateline or 20/20 or 48 hours does the story of Minymii and why it killed itself the rest of the world will not know the true story. Some family member will get on the tv and tell us &quot;That damn game killed&quot; it. No one but those of us who have witnessed the tortured ravings of a being so desperately needing professional help will understand that it wasn't the game that killed Minymii (and the cast of alts it pretends are real people), it was Minymii itself that finally imploded and killed Minymii. <br>
<br>
Minymii: Understand this- every post about someone KS'ing you only makes whoever you are ranting about more liked by everyone else but you. Its become a badge of honor, a status symbol if you will, to be flamed by you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryjal56>Ryjal56</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(2/5/03 7:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thank you Brkat</span><hr size=1> I think it's a bit too late for you to send people to us in Nexus to question why we are trying to give you a bad name.

<br>
Minymee 54 Rogue <br>
Loveseeker 60 cleric <br>
Babilove 60 monk <br>
Inasiat 60 sham <br>
Bliss 59 war <br>
Enlitment 30 druid<br>
<br>
It struck me that this list is in conflict with the following passage revealed to us several days ago.<br>
<br>
&gt; So let them post say what they want but remember used your @#%$ head anyone that ask me for help or port or heal or res or kei or anything the get it<br>
<br>
Either:<br>
<br>
a) Someone is witless enough to ask a rogue for KEI.  (OK - maybe this isn't a stretch, I get asked for SoWs all the time.)<br>
b) Minymii is not bound by the normal class rules of EQ.<br>
<br>
The fact is, the passage says &quot;the get it&quot; (they get it)!!<br>
<br>
So, it must be (b).<br>
<br>
I was inspired by this revelation, and when a really nice int-caster piercer  (Mindpuncture) dropped when we killed the &quot;High Priest&quot; last night, I asked for it.<br>
<br>
I figured &quot;most people just consider me a buff-babe&quot;.  Now, I can be a backstabbing babe too!  (nearer my god to thee!)<br>
<br>
Next, we move on to Seru.  The battle is going well.  I didn't jump out and start meleeing Seru right away - wouldn't want to KS the guild with the dagger they'd just awarded me.  All of a sudden people started going LD all at once.<br>
<br>
The server had crashed!<br>
<br>
I went to our guild chat room, we're all bemoaning the fact that the CR from Seru would be a real treat.  All of a sudden Minymii-rogue appears in our chat room and says, &quot;Brkat, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate your translations.&quot;.  When the servers came back up we all got customer-service rezzes.<br>
<br>
I thought, &quot;This is a sign!&quot;<br>
<br>
As encouraging as all of your support has been, this did more to spur me to continue my efforts of conveying the words of Minymii to the readers of The Blast Furnace.<br>
<br>
And so I embarked on demystifying this short communication last left us by Minymii.<br>
<br>
&gt; Well Its funny it is only the same 10 ppl in here.<br>
<br>
Minymii recognizes that her more vocal followers of The Blast Furnace currently number ten (10 ppl).<br>
<br>
&gt; But the funniest is people like Spyrit that is Kugan's Alt.<br>
<br>
She recognizes Spyrit as &quot;the funniest&quot; and names the forms in which she may be found.<br>
<br>
&gt; Come here after being hated so much and trash other ppl hoping that his reputation goes up in skill level &lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
Minymii indicates that as a follower of &quot;The Love Goddess&quot;, Spyrit may become more respected on Saryrn.  (I'd guess Spyrit would also have to stay away from &quot;Mom's Hand Lotion&quot;.)  (Minymii- commandment  #1).<br>
<br>
&gt; Or Xlabikx who liked my sister and totally would do everything for her till she figured out in a conversation that he was gay. I mean how many guys would know all the different types of armoni brand cloths? NONE. <br>
<br>
I think this is probably the most important information conveyed in this short monologue.  Hiirem and I were talking about the Armani-fabric/sexual preference thing.  Hiirem suggested that it might just have meant Xlabikx was a lawyer.  Once again, Minymii has provided &quot;Enlitment&quot;.  She has told us all that this is a sign. If you're the opposite sex of the Armani-fabric aware person, &quot;there are no rooms at the Inn&quot;.  This is really sad since Xlabikx, in denial of his true self, attempted to court Minymii's sister.<br>
<br>
Minymii-commandment #2 - &quot;Know him by his fashion sense, if he can match colors, he's gay.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure this is a value judgment to &quot;The Goddess of Love&quot;, only a signal so far.  The guidance of Minymii will help to keep you from dissatisfying relationships.<br>
<br>
&gt; So keep posting im starting to get a kick out of this thread.  Btw thanks for the great interputation. It was suttle but few mistakes. And Well to nicely put for the amount of anger behind my post. <br>
<br>
I am once again encouraged by Minymii's kind words.<br>
<br>
To recap, we have two commandments:<br>
<br>
Minymii-commandment #1 - &quot;Don't use your mom's hand lotion.&quot;<br>
Minymii-commandment #2 - &quot;Know him by his fashion sense, if he can match colors, he's gay.&quot;<br>
