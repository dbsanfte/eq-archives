<br>
Around 2 and 1/2 years ago I ran a tiny guild on Saryrn called &quot;Nightwatch of Norrath&quot;.  A member of my guild managed to ninja an item in an exp group in KC.<br>
<br>
This action was not endorced nor supported by me or my guild.<br>
<br>
The guild that the exp group was from (Isenguard) immedialty started demanding the removal of the member and 20k plat from me.  We asked for proof (screen shot.. logs), we also wanted time to discuss the situation with Scartak.  I was simply harrassed in tells and OOC when I asked for these things.<br>
<br>
No time was given and flames immediatly were posted here.  I was a bit taken aback by all this.  it was my first time having to deal with such an issue since the other server I played on seemed to have much more honerable people.  I would not have had this issue in the first place on Nameless.<br>
<br>
I had made my mage the main focus for me and he was on Saryrn so I decided to make the best of it.  <br>
<br>
All I wanted was proof and time to discuss the situaiton with my guild.  No consideration was given by the community.  Also, to make matters worse Scartak denied the incident completly and up and until that point had been an honerable guild member.  This made it tough for us to remove him.<br>
<br>
Eventually though we discovered that he was not the &quot;original&quot; Scartak and the leadership did remove him after a vote.<br>
<br>
The last 2.5 years have been a intersting constant flame fest mostly started and maintained by this community.  My efforts to reconcile with the community have failed.  <br>
<br>
I blame myself for trying to start a character on this server and I blame the community for driving away many honest and decent people thought the years.<br>
<br>
I never ninja looted a thing in my enture life on Saryrn or any server.  To be treated as a common criminal is just plain silly.<br>
<br>

 Damn Rthen, you really are a constant source of amusement!!   Pissed??   No, sorry.. only in that psychotic little mind of yours. =)  You don't have the ability to actually piss me off.  That would take a lot more than you are capable of. I laugh at every post you make. <br>
<br>
 We're still waiting for the actual names of ANYONE that got banned or suspended from Isengard over the years though.  There won't be any.  There's no way you can 'remember' something that didn't happen in reality. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, just what exactly do you suppose Isengard has not accomplished that you supposedly have in game?  Do you even have a clue as to where Isengard is in the PoP planar progression? Do you have any idea what gods we have killed? Any idea what Tier we are in when looking at the list?  I seriously doubt it.  Don't try to flame people on their accomplishments or lack thereof, when you have no information.  It just makes you look even more ridiculous than you already are, if that's possible. I'm not sure it is.<br>

<br>
<br>
1st off you and many others that have posted on the flame threads I have become involved in over the years have had nothing to do with the original dispute.  You have inserted yourself into the drama and the dispute for various reasons, some being:<br>
<br>
1.  Wanting to score a quick popularity point or 2 with those in power on Saryrn.<br>
2.  Simply because your a evil drama craving prick.<br>
3.  Because you have a superiority complex and feel whatever shitty advice you could possible give to me actually is worth adding to a dispute you had nothign to do with.<br>
<br>
Many of you become upset because the perls of truth I hand to you are too much for fragile young adult egos to deal with.<br>
<br>
Simply STFU and agree with the popular opinions setup by the &quot;leaders&quot; unless you want to get burned is the rule here on Saryrn.<br>
<br>
Yes the guild leaders, officers, and server clebs will use what you say here to ruin your play experience.  This is what they consider fun, ruining people's in game experiences once they drag you into a fight that you cannot 'win'.  <br>
<br>
I must say though arguing about events in a computer game is stupid and eveyone here is guilty of that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't dislike you because you ninja looted something.&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL I never ninja looted anything.  To even imply I did shows a complete neglect for the facts.  Which by the way seems to be common on this server.<br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;I don't dislike you because you didn't respond quickly enough when it was reported to you that a guildie had ninja looted something.&quot;<br>
<br>
I laugh at this one as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh and this one made me laugh: <br>
&quot;I dislike you because you are a babbling, misogynistic moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
Child, if the gang here on Saryrn disliked Bob the level 20 ranger. or better yet.. if popular opinion was that Wonder bread was bad and must be avoided and flamed about you would eventually have joined in.<br>
<br>
You are a young person who simply has no real free will of your own.  you are however a shinning example of what garb and the gang here love to see.  An impressionable mind.<br>
<br>
You see without this game they would be left with having to deal with real life.  Which for them is a hellish thing.  They need the drama and flames that cause, it gives them purpose and enjoyment.<br>
<br>
What gives me enjoyment is pissing people off that tried so hard to ruin my fun over something I was not at fault for. <br>

If only you knew, you sad little sociopath, if only you knew.  You are so far off base, and have so little idea of who I actually am, it's really quite comical.  <br>

If you think that I agree with &quot;popular&quot; opinion you should talk to my guildmates, I am quite often the rabblerousing dissenter.

&quot;If only you knew, you sad little sociopath, if only you knew. You are so far off base, and have so little idea of who I actually am, it's really quite comical.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why should I care?  You have no fucking clue who or what I am and no one here knows who anyone else is for sure either.<br>
<br>
I had 1 sick fuck find me in real life, they got removed in cuffs and I learne dnever to put real infor on any e-mail account signup.<br>
<br>
Lets just say.. I imagine you to be a 18 - 25 year old that really acts 8 - 12 years old.  If I am wrong and your some 35 year old 350 pound fat ass that is behind the PC laughing his dork laugh and thinking he has one over on me then all I can say is I am not off the mark much.  Just in age. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you think that I agree with &quot;popular&quot; opinion you should talk to my guildmates, I am quite often the rabblerousing&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok.. now were using words like rabblerousing? What is next &quot;Horseplay&quot;.  Your just a stupid dorky freak.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I have never in my life (which is a bit longer than you seem to think, LMAO) been accused of going along with the crowd, rather I am sometimes accused of sticking to my own view even when everyone around me disagrees. &quot;<br>
<br>
Who gives a shit.. a 350 pound dork is a dork at any age.  Especially if EQ means so much that he needs to suck up to people to be popular.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Let it sink into your pea brain. I dislike you because, based solely on what you write and not on what anyone else thinks&quot;<br>

Hey jackass..what I write is in self defense.  if you take the fuckign time to read you would have noticed that people that had no fucking clue who I am or why people hate me started flamming me.  People like you.  You are so fucking clueless, welcome to &quot;group think&quot; asshole. <br>
<br>

&quot;, you are eminently dislikeable. It's one of those &quot;perls of truth&quot; that your fragile ego obviously is unable to handle, so just go on inventing your absurd little rationalizations about why you're such a great guy and why everyone can't stand you.&quot;<br>

<br>
The difference is, they don't give us much of a reason. You give us all the reason in the world to flame you. They don't act like retards in-game or on this board. You, on the other hand...<br>
<br>
I've flamed quite a few posters on this board, well known or otherwise. I do believe I've flamed Seani, some of my own guildies (current or former), and quite a few 'popular' posters. If given the chance, the majority of people would do the same.<br>
<br>
However, the thing is, the more well-known posters here are not known for being retarded, such as you are, but rather for various other humorous traits and basically not fucking up in public. So nobody has a real reason to flame them.<br>
<br>
However, if it's any consolidance, I'll obess about you for the next few weeks and create fake e-mail addresses and e-mail myself some supportive letters, and delude myself into thinking I'm such a popular guy, swarmed by women daily, with slim to none body fat, and $150,000 cars.<br>
<br>
And I'm pretty sure I have no reason to gain 'popularity points' with anyone here seeing how I never talk to anyone here in-game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rthen2001>rthen2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Village Idiot - please show<br>your sympathy, email me<br>at Rthen2001@yahoo.com<br></span></span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/28/03 11:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: title</span><hr size=1> <br>

Thats pure bullshit.  You know it is.<br>
<br>
I'll respond to the more insane claims you just made and leave the rest alone since believe it or not you guys are wearing me out with your level of pure bullshit.<br>
<br>
1.  &quot;and delude myself into thinking I'm such a popular guy, swarmed by women daily, with slim to none body fat, and $150,000 cars.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said anything like this ever.  My feeling is you are insecrue about somehting and because I happen to think the community here sucks and is rather silly in their holy war against me you are making shit up like this to compensate for your insecurity.<br>
<br>
I am a very average guy with an average car, average job.. etc..<br>
<br>
If your tired of driving your shitty car, sitting on your fat 350 pound ass, and screwing women that you need to pay cash up front for then I suggest you move out of mom and dad's house and get a fucking life.  That would be step 1 perhaps.<br>
<br>
Now that could be a generalization but so far I have met 4 of you fucks in real life at the fan faire and I can assure you the impression I have here rang true.<br>
<br>
I find it amusing though.. buy me drinks at the bar but flame the shit out of me here (you know who you are).  LOL.. and you wonder why I say its all about popularity and kissing up.  Oh the fucking bullshit on this server.. how can you guys even live with yourseleves.. must be hard.<br>
<br>
I bet you would all end up flamining yourself with an alt account without question if suddenly you were deemed &quot;unpopular&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  &quot;However, the thing is, the more well-known posters here are not known for being retarded, such as you are, but rather for various other humorous traits and basically not fucking up in public. So nobody has a real reason to flame them.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Fucking up in public?  The only thing you guys know about me is the fact I refused to take the abuse here without defending myself.  If thats too much for you freaks then you need to grow thicker skins or perhaps not open your mouth and flame when you had nothing to do with said issues (e.x.  Scartak).<br>
<br>
The communtiy made a mistake.. the community continues to make mistakes.  Most of the people I have talked to that play on Saryrn hate the server and wish they could leave with their gear to another one (not legends).<br>

I'm insecure about nothing. My job is nothing extraordinary, I do shop work for an Air Conditioning company. I earn 14 dollars per hour, and typically work 30 hours per week. And I go to school 20 hours a week, with hopes of going to an university in fall 2005.<br>
<br>
I live with my parents, and I am 20. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm a college student, it's not like I can afford to live alone, especially when I have to save up for an University that my family will not help me pay for. I used to weight 299 pounds, but I am now 261 pounds after quitting EverQuest. I have a nice car, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe, which I got from inheritance of some sort.<br>
<br>
I dropped out of high school when I was 16, and in hindsight a extremely bad move of my part. Using this information against me is completely worthless. Because I am ashamed of none of it. Some I regret, of course, such as gaining 112 pounds after playing EverQuest, and dropping out of school, but commenting on such will only get you mocked at by me for being downright idiotic in an assumption that I am offended by any of it.<br>
<br>
While I was one of the more well known posters back then, I most likely am not considered one of the more 'respected' or 'popular' people in game or on the Saryrn Tavern. This is because I have ebayed my characters, which is basically 'political suicide.' But once again, it's nothing I regret, but I'm not foolish enough to think that I am on everyone's good side.<br>
<br>
It is BECAUSE you defend yourself, that people flame you. The choice is, either keep posting or don't. If you stop defending yourself, and start being a productive member of the community, then while at first you will get flamed  here and there for no particular reason, it will slowly but surely go away.<br>
<br>
When you stopped coming here, your name was mentioned extraordinarly rarely. It's so quite simple. For example, if someone flamed me for ebaying, I will not defend it. I have my own reasons for doing so, but it doesn't change the fact that it's wrong by, in a sense, 'community laws.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rthen2001>rthen2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Village Idiot - please show<br>your sympathy, email me<br>at Rthen2001@yahoo.com<br></span></span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(6/29/03 10:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: title</span><hr size=1> <br>
