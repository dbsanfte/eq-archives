He should have Listened to  Powel more.  Most people won't argue that much of what he has done HAD to be done.....but there were better methods of doing some of these things...less contraversial.  I think Powell had some better Ideas of how to get the things that needed done completed with less friction with other countries.<br>
<br>
But other than that....lets get serious here.  There are very few world leaders that have had to deal with the amount of Crapola that Bush has had to deal with since he took office.  After 911, I am surprised we have an economy at all...let alone one that is starting to grow again.  Most people can not contemplate the immense ammount of money that went through the twin towers on a daily basis.....and at each stop in teh money flow...an american company got a slice.  Suddenly on 911 this income stopped....which further hurt an allready struggleing economy..which was on the rebound at the time(BTW Bush predicted teh economic Downturn if you remember correctly).  So what'd we do?  We found those responsible and attacked.  Wether you beleive in it or not ... that was the only way to disrupt the terrist activity.  You will NEVER stop ALL terrorism....but if you can keep them disorganized....kill their infrastructure you Greatly lower the chances that an operation so BIG so Complicated can ever happen again.  Sure...we have not found bin laden yet....but only one thing is harder to find than a Desert Rat .... and that's a Very Weathy and well connected Desert Rat.  We will eventually get him, and when we do I'd very much like to be the person that throw's the switch when he fries......heck, it'd be worth it to turn the juice up slowly....maybe over a coarse of days... to get more Twitch factor out of the whole ordeal......<br>
<br>
Iraq.  A very contraversial decision.  No on can know how this will turn out...we all hope for the best.   This was a message...plain and simple.  After 911, President Bush said that we would go after ANYONE supporting terrorist activity preemptively to ensure our security.   Iraq was the proof that we meant what we said.  Noone can honestly say the world isn't safer with Saddam out of power.  Personally I beleive that the US is incredibly more safe with him out of power.   I think it is very naive to beleive that saddam wasn't aiding terrorists.  Lets look at some facts.  <br>
<br>
1) Saddam HATES the United States with every fiber of his being.  <br>
<br>
2)He is one of the wealthiest men in teh world.  <br>
<br>
3)He is in the middle East with easy access to MANY of the terrorist groups you hear of all the time on the news.<br>
<br>
4) Saddam Prefer's to deal in cash....as it isn't NEARLY as traceable. <br>
<br>
5) Saddam is a certifiable Homicidal Maniac which does NOT value his own peoples lives.....let alone lives that are shattered elsewhere in the world because of terrorist activity. <br>
<br>
Now, which of these facts DON'T ncourage the beleif that he would fund terrorism?  Heck I bet he actively sought out terrorist groups to give moeny too... <br>
<br>
True, he is still a very rich man that can cause trouble for the USA with even more reason to hate us now..... but now he has to hide like a common Criminal,.....and not behind a army and a nation.  He is NOT free to act as he was before because he is on teh run...sometimes outditancing our forces by mere hours.  Saddam Husein will be caught.  He is a creature of certain comfort......he can't live in a cave for month's on end like Bin Laden, and that will be his undoing.<br>
<br>
SO to recap, look at all the crapola Bush has had to deal with unexpectedly during his presidency.   Is it HIS fault the showdown with terrorists happen to occur during his watch?  No.  Howelse would YOU have handled the terrorist problem?  The fact is teh decision to take the fight to them(i.e. the terrorists) is what has kept us from getting bitch slapped left and right by these SOB's.  They had more to come folks....they had more terrorist acts in teh US planned.....but we interrupted thier operations.  We might have another big terrorist attack tomorrow....and if we do then I will mourn like everyone esle....but I WON'T point an accusing finger to Bush and scream that he hasn't done enough, or has been WRONG in his actions.  Because if we hadn't taken the steps that we have, then we'd be used to getting attcked by now.  <br>
<br>
Bush gets my vote in '04.<br>

You act like he is the first president to have this problem.  Have you ever watched Saturday Night Live?  Numerous comedians have made what passes for entire careers by finding some idiosyncrasy of the sitting president and exploiting it to the fullest.  This has been done to every single president since I have been alive, and since I neither worship satan or consider myself the center of the universe, I would imagine it happened before then too.  I still call Sadaam, Sadam like Sr. because I find it funny as hell.  I know its incorrect just like I imagine Sr. did, but its funny and I like it.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever seen the other leaders of the world speak in public?  There are some serious freaks out there.  Half the time the Russian leader of the day can barely stand up without putting down the vodka bottle to hold himself up.  The canadian PM doesnt know his ass from a hole in the ground but stays in office by saying cool shit like &quot;Hey I think Im going to fire up a blunt as soon as I retire.&quot;  Or the fued going on between Germany and Spain(or is it Italy) because their leaders continue to say dumb ass shit to the media.  And dont even start on the middle eastern/asian leaders where knock down drag fights in what passes for their congress are a regular occurance.<br>
<br>
When ever you examine ever single detail of anyones life under a microscope you are going to find some stupid shit that they have done/still do.  Given our past 15 or so presidents this is magnified in that office.  GW does stupid shit, Slick Willy did stupid shit, Sr. did stupid shit.  Hell, they are even about to fillet Reagan in a made for tv movie and while he was in office, he could do no wrong unless you were homosexual.  Carter was the biggest joke ever while he was in office, and now people are trying to throw Nobel Peace prizes at him and some are saying upon closer examination of his accomplishments while president, he might even be one of the top 5 presidents EVER.  Jimmy PEANUT FUCKING FARMER Carter.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is, Bush is the best of what is out there no matter how sad of a statement that is.  If the election was tomorrow he would win; whether it was for the next term or a rerun of the last election.  He would win huge.  And unless the democrats find someone real to run against him, he will stilll win huge when time for the vote actually rolls around.  All of the people that would make really good presidents are either making too much money in the private sector to take the pay cut or are on the opposite end of the spectrum and have too little money/influence to make a run at the office.  <br>

I like a lot of the things he's done but you gotta admit the man makes himself look stoopid. Half of being president is being &quot;Presidential&quot;. Jimmy Carter lost a lot of people's confidence when he admitted to getting ideas from his daughter. <br>
<br>
As for the list of Bush's accomplishments, lets think about the prior president:<br>
<br>
1. Clinton presided over a dot com boom that was nothing more than a new incarnation of a catalog. Actually making money on the internet was less important than offering an IPO. Style over substance finally gave out and the economic growth he prided himself for creating finally burst because it wasn't real, leaving a mess for the next president to clean up because Bill was a sitting duck. <br>
<br>
2. The financial crisis many states, and most notably California, are in is a direct result of the dot com bust. Politicians aren't as smart as farmers. Farmers understand the concept of a 'bumper' crop, politicians on the other hand think taxes 'will always roll in at this rate'. <br>
<br>
3. Enron did not begin its corporate fraud January 2000, when GWB took office as president. Worldcom/MCI and others were also blasted for book-cooking that dated back for years. If people can clain that GWB is somehow afforded tertiary blame for the greatest number of bankruptcies and foreclosures then in the same light Bill Clinton bears the same blame for the corruption in corporate America. <br>
<br>
4. Both Clinton and Gore received 'shady' campaign contributions from Chineese ties. Strangely enough on the Clinton/Gore watch key missile technologies were leaked to the Chineese. <br>
<br>
5. Clinton had first shot at the terrorists. The World Trade Center was attacked TWICE!!! Had Clinton been doing his job instead of getting blowjobs from fat interns perhaps GWB wouldn't have had to go to the UN and say &quot;If you don't say its ok for The U.S. of A. to protect itself, then fuck off. I don't need you.&quot;<br>
<br>
6. THE US DID NOT ACT UNILATERALY IN ATTACKING IRAQ. We had at least one country aiding us, (actually it was more, but by definition unilateraly means acting alone, so all I need is one country to invalidate this notion.)<br>
<br>

With Hillary as &quot;co-president&quot; (hahahahaha!), it also felt like a shrill female voice was SCREECHING in my ear every day. Every single god-damned day.<br>

With Bush in office, the hammer is gone and the screeching is quite distant and intermittent. Bearable and gradually fading away...<br>

<br>
I call bullshit on that one.<br>
<br>
Ask the CEOs of the Fortune 500 if they would be willing to take the paycut to be President.  If they were being honest .. which is a big if .. I'd be awfully surprised if less than 475 of them wouldn't say yes.  Those sorts of people love power as much, if not more, than they love money.  That, and they already have a lot of money.  Arnold is a perfect example of that sort of mentality, if you've read any of the recent biographical pieces on him, although he is disqualified from running for President.  And anyone s in love with money that they were unwilling to take the pay cut probably wouldn't make a good President anyway.  It's not like the President makes poverty wage.  <br>
<br>
But do go on, name ten people that would make really good presidents but wouldn't be willing to take the pay cut.  Go ahead and try.<br>
<br>
On the other end of the spectrum, you are right.  There are a lot of people without power or influence who might (notice the use of the word &quot;might&quot;) make excellent Presidents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bygzalf>Bygzalf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 737<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/28/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ask the CEOs of the Fortune 500 if they would be willing to take the paycut to be President.

<br>
Then wtf arent they running?  If they have the money and the only person they have to beat in an election is Bush, then why arent they running?  Money isnt the only reason, but its a big one.  What the president makes is a pittance compared to how much they stand to lose during the 4-8 years they are out of circulation.  Sure they already have alot of money, but when you start looking at giving away $100's of millions of dollars a year it doesnt matter to most how much you have in the bank.  This isnt even considering the money they would have to spend to get elected.<br>
<br>
If they wanted to run, they would.  There is nothing stopping them.  The Democrats would love to back someone with a chance to win right now.<br>
<br>
Truth is none of the want to run for various reasons.  So, we get no true leaders running for president.  We get career politicians and career military men who for some reason let a political machine get behind them and tell them what to think and say.  <br>
<br>
Actually, I wish Powell would get off of his ass and run. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agnol>agnol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/28/03 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Rendak: Yeah sorry I didn't cut and paste something I found on the internet.
