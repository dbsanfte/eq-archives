He is level 12 now and was soloing derv's in nro at level 9. People wrere telling met hat there is no way i should be able to do so. However, i was able to do it with ease. There is so much unbridled power in an sk that people just do not realize it. <br>
<br>
My SK is a Erudite, he has a high int as well as str. This gives him a large mana pool with an exceptional ability to do some serious damage. The spell line leaves alittle to be desired but you can very easily make real good use of the spells you are given.<br>
<br>
I would say in a fight with a red con at that level i would lose a bubble of health per fight. Now i know at higher levels i won't be able to do it but by basis of comparison, SK's are really true damage dealers. Third only to Rogues and monks respectively. <br>
<br>
Now given my SK is equipped with a MoSS, Arbitor's combine great sword, Fungi tunic blood ember and darkforge mix as well as mithril and the best jewelry money can buy. He can deal some sweet damage. Now i went back to using a M2H and Dark Reaver. I was still able to whip out 20-35 point shots per hit. At level 12 that is quite a bit of damage, add life tap and steal strength on top of it and that makes for a nasty combo. <br>
<br>
Some say I should have made a Troll or Ogre SK, WHY ?<br>
Why waste the ability to tap a precious resource like mana, by not making him a erudite. I find i have more mana than my hunting partner who happens to be a level 12 Ogre SK. Granted the int limit on Ogre and trolls pales in comparison, but that is where my point lies. An Sk is a fighting necro. Put those spells to use and don't be afraid to be the main tank. If someone says &quot;oh you are a hybrid, we wanted a real tank.&quot; Then they have never seen a real tank because an SK can soak up as much damage if not more than a warrior.<br>

The TSK has a huge advantage when it comes to melee, I will give him that. But he is a pain in the ass to play, which is why I quit him. Very little mana and I dislike being a large race. The HP difference is not that big of a deal, you will see a difference of 3-500 HPs at post 50 levels. The difference in Str between them makes out minimal damage output, which leaves only a few major differences: Large races get Slam, Trolls have Regen (very handy for soloing, BS at high levels) and Ogres are immune to stuns from the front (MAJOR advantage).<br>
<br>
I love my DE SK, he kicks some serious ass and looks wicked enough to.. well.. you get the picture. <br>
<br>
Oh and Garbhad.. a SK's life starts at 30.. believe me!<br>

<br>
The high int will be helpful at later levels, but you either seriously lack strength by comparison to ogres and trolls or your wearing alot of str enchancing jewellery which reduces your potential AC, not a good idea .. and please dont say you wear any black pearl stuff /shudder.<br>
<br>
The hit point advantage trolls and Ogres have is significant at higher levels, the ability to stun while weilding a 2 hander is significant.<br>
<br>
Ogres not being stunned from the front and trolls regen ( especially while FDd ) are significant bonuses.<br>
<br>
While erudites, humans and dark elfs in the hands of good players can be great SKs .. ogres and trolls have signifcant advantages.<br>
<br>
It will however be interesting to see your observations as the levels increase and your gear becomes less of an advantage.<br>

Honestly,3-400 HPs difference is not all that, it is one maybe one anda half rounds of attacks. I do admit that the No Stun from thefront part for Ogres is an advantage though.<br>
<br>
However,the large races have disadvantages as well. Their size in itselfis a pain. Ever tried to get to a mob as a large size when thereare lots of people around? Or ever tried to get to a mob whena couple of fat asses are beating on it? Or ever gotten otherpeople killed in dungeons? You get my point..<br>
<br>
The wholerace issue is a stupid discussion if you ask me. Play what youenjoy, if you enjoy your character you will be a better playerthan if you dislike it. Learn your character's weaknesses andstrenghts, and play on these. I would much rather have a DE SKthat knows his character in my group than an Ogre that is a newbie.<br>

You ask why choose a large race? Well I can explain why I chose ogre, and not troll, and why I'd recommend nothing BUT ogre for an SK.<br>
<br>
First, as it has been mentioned, the no-stun-from-the-front ability of an ogre is something no one can truly appreciate until they've had the ability long enough to take it for granted. I have quite a hard time adapting to other characters when I play them for this reason. When I am being pummeled, unless I get knocked back considerably, I can channel through nearly anything. Bash's from mobs are nothing more than an extra attack, and have no further ability to interrupt than a normal attack when you are an ogre.<br>
<br>
Second, hit points and STR. I see plenty of people saying how the difference is negligible. I say, you're full of crap if you think that. BUTT ASS NAKED, I have a few hundred more hp than other SK's. The fact that I must invest less in maintaining str has allowed me the option of several high-hp items. This in addition to my natural 130 STA goes a long way. Fact: Ogres have more starting stat points than ANY OTHER race in the game.<br>
<br>
Third, bash w/2hand. nuff said.<br>
<br>
Fourth, and something that I've rarely seen mentioned anywhere, is the fact that loss of stamina (the yellow bar) has no adverse affect on Ogres aside from not being able to jump. When an Ogre's stamina depletes, his combat does not slow, nor do his physical stats deteriorate like other races. You simply can't jump. That's it.<br>
<br>
Fifth, lower exp table than Troll or Iksar. Simply put, trolls offer nowhere near the advantages of Ogres. You pay a full 5% more exp for regen that really won't matter in the long run despite what Troll lovers will insist. SK's depend on taps to heal while soloing, and you get heals in a group. BFD, a troll ticks back a whole 2 or 3 more points, but has noticably worse stats to boot, and does not share the ogres physical advatages listed above.<br>
<br>
In regards to the mana issue, yes this is quite a concern. However I attest it is irrelevant if your SK is a twink. The reasoning is simple: Ogres have outrageos physical stats. With this in mind, invest nothing in INT, but rely on your gear to boost it. Currently my SK has over 100 INT, and with the completion of the epic, plus several other items in my near future, this number will rocket to 130-140; More than enough mana for ANY hybrid. Combine this with the fact that many high end hybrid items contain +mana, and you'll find this becomes a non-issue. Using the hill giant comparison as a point of reference, I can solo them with 1 cast dooming, and 1 or 2 casts of Invoke Fear; a paltry bubble-and-a-half of mana. The bare truth about an SK is that you are first and foremost a warrior. Your spells present little to no aid for a group, therefore you shortchange your SK's ability by investing heavily in INT/choosing an INT heavy race.<br>
<br>
And finally: Infravision. At higher levels SK's have spells for both infra and ultravisions, but you won't be thinking that when you're level 20 and can't see the giant who is hammering you into the sand.<br>
<br>
I'm done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uandvarishadowmist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AndvariShadowmist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bastard Bard</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/5/00 11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SK's</span><hr size=1> Hum for the stamina running down yet not slowing down part.. that is the way it is for everyone with 100+ Stamina me thinks.<br>

DE/Erudite SKs generally have 30-40 more int than Ogre/Troll SK of the equivilant level.  That translates to 3 or 4 more lifetap line spells.  In essence, it's actually like giving DE/Erudite SK an extra 150-200 hp at level 40ish with the 45 damage tap and 200-300 hp at level 52ish with the 100 damage tap.  Granted the cast time during a melee battle can be a killer but thank god for this new patch, you can now deal melee damage immediately after the spell casting is done instead of waiting for the weapon delay cycle to reset.  Besides, the high int for DE/Erudite SK means you learn skills faster incase you wish to switch from 2h slash to 1h slash or 1h blunt.. etc.  I just love my DE SK, can't you tell? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usegorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>segorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/10/01 2:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SK's</span><hr size=1> <br>
 Lothe:<br>
<br>
 The stamina thing isn't ogre specific. Any char with &gt; 100 base stamia is unaffected when the yellow bar goes to empty. Otherwisse you start losing other stats when stamina gets too low.<br>
<br>
  As for whoever it was that loves their DE sk. Great, more power to you, play a class you love. I love my HE magician, but he's basically useless for anything except COTH on raids now (thanks verant for 100% MR 200k hp mobs). From a pure powergaming standpoint, however, an ogre SK is just plain a better SK for all the reasons lothe has just outlined.<br>
<br>
   The question isn't whether a DE sk is viable (it obviously is, I know of several &gt; 50 in my guild), or fun to play (again, it obviously is, you'd have to be sick to level a sk up above 50 unless you really liked it), but rather whether it is the optimal race/class combination.<br>
<br>
   For better or worse, there are optimal race/class combo's from a powergaming standpoint.<br>
<br>
   Ogres make the best warriors or SK.<br>
   Barbarians make the best shamans.<br>
   Barbarians make the best rogues.<br>
   Iksars make the best monks.<br>
<br>
   I personally would never play an ogre. My warrior twink (lvl 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , is a barbarian because the large race thing bugs me. I hate being in the way all the time. Likewise, I'd never start a barbarian rogue as a non twink. The night blindness thing drives me ape shit.<br>
<br>
   So it really depends what you want. The problem with threads like this is people always ask &quot;what race makes the *best* &lt;insert class here&gt;&quot; What they really should ask is &quot;what race/class combo will I *enjoy* the most&quot;.<br>
<br>
   An ogre is a better sk than a DE. If I had to play a sk though, I'd prolly go DE, because I don't *enjoy* being a fatty.<br>

Thats funny, I always thought Trolls or Iksar did, since their natural regen allows for more efficient use of the cannabalize/regen trick.<br>

As for Shadowknights, I tend to agree with Lothe that Ogres make the best simply for the highest STA / HP.  300-500 hp DOES make a big deal in the post 50 game.  I put Trolls at a close second however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(1/15/01 8:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernclassdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Take on Shadow Knights</span><hr size=1> Correct me if I'm wrong, but won't the damage dealing REALLY start sucking after level 20?

Pretty sure it goes by class... But eitherway, an erudite SK in the long run will hit for a LOT less than an ogre SK...  With all these damage caps and stregnth caps, you really won't be able to tell the difference until your at a level that matters.  As for SKs being mana based, =P  If yer grouped with a necro, your screwed out of your main line of attack.  Then you go in there and pop things for 40-50 a hit with yer MoSS...  Then you think back to earlier days when you shoulda listened to Punky and made a big race.  Dunno where I read it, but a website said it best...<br>

Ogres are a step ahead mostly because of their ability to not get stunned from the front. HPs matter slightly, but I will probably never be main tank anyway.<br>

The most ever needed to be done in a fight(at lvl 43 anyways) is a Vampiric Embrace pre-fightm, Shadow Vortex for a taunt if a caster getting raped, drain if yer healer hates you, and the occasional darkness when no one else feels like rooting the mobs.  Most used spell would probably be invisibility, but just get ahold of one of them Circlet of Shadows or whatever they're called.  Instant invis for no mana.  I've got a 113 int, and usually when grouped have more than enough mana left after each pull for 5 or 6 more.  Also when trying to solo, I'm often left with 70m and like a bub or 2 of HP left(speaking mainly of the spec in Feerrott, fear kiting it).<br>
<br>
<br>
And yeah, forgot about the non-stun thing.  That can be pretty bad ass when your tanking...  I realized that when I tried playing a gnome warrior(twas fun fer a few lvls...), but kept constantly getting stunned...  Besides, a stunned tank can't taunt that well can they?<br>
<br>
Hmm... basically I guess I'm just a warrior that uses the way of the force now and then.<br>
