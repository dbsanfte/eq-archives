    -OR-<br>
<br>
<br>
B. You can sit there with your thumbs up your ass trying to figure out who to flame and blame. This is getting freaking old. I for one am just giving up on this. No one has shown any reason to blame Meg or her daughter, other then this nonsence Pelagia put on here. <br>

Anywho, this isn't really the place to get your facts straight - Isengard. The Blast Furnace is more of a place to get every possible side of a story. They give you other avenues to try. This is the place where you take off your shoes and soak your callus feet. When all is said and done, would you drink that water?<br>

What I'm saying is, Nakros is holding a poor woman hostage and claiming she is his, 'wife.'

/agree<br>
<br>
I was getting confused why they were saying that they were getting IP address off of the post. There is no way to get the IP address used to FTP from a post.<br>
<br>
Thats why I want to see from areos his httpdconfig file. I know that it will show all actions done including time ip and who. If we can cross reference that with the time that it shows all this crap deleted then we can settle this.<br>
<br>
But saying just cause you have a IP from someone that post on the message board, how do you get that from being deleted?<br>
<br>
Isengard was using the IKONBORD mb im not sure i think one of the 3x versions. I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
Guess this will remind ppl to change there passwords every other month like they should<br>

There is more reason to believe Megara was responsible for the deletion of our pages than anyone else. As Azoicia said, Meg had the means, she DAMN sure had the motive, and she had the oppertunity. So wave your little Meg flag all you want, I am still convinced WHOLE-HEARTEDLY that Megara was responsible for this vindictive and petty act. <br>
<br>
Secondly Arkadian, Megara was called vindictive because that is exactly what she is. I know that that opinion of her wasnt just formed based on this one situation. I myself am aware of several situations where Megara has acted like a vindictive, arrogant, self-righteous COW towards Isengard. If that is not your personal experience of her then so be it. But dont knock people for having that view of her as I think we all have our own reasons for feeling about her the way that we do.<br>
<br>
I'm no computer genius. In fact Im pretty much computer illiterate. But Aereos has no reason to place blame on Megara as opposed to anyone else. He is NOT an active guild member. He has no motive. But I suppose for those of you conned into believing Megara is as pure and innocent as the driven snow its easier to believe that an innactive EQ player TOTALLY unaware of the politics of Isengard has some vendetta againsy poor sweet Meg and decided to point his finger at her. Please. Give me a break.<br>
<br>
Putting the &quot;proof&quot; issue aside, as soon as I heard this happened to Isengard the first person that popped in my head that could be responsible for this was Megara. Why? Because she has shown by her words and actions that she DISDAINS Isengard and she has the ability to do what was done to our boards AND the incident with her daughter occured JUST before it happened. Throw all of that in with Aereos' UNBIASED opinion that Megara is at fault and that pretty much seals her fate imho. There are just too many reasons to believe she did it than to think otherwise. <br>
<br>
And Pelagia doesnt owe Megara CRAP. Maybe a boot in the head but thats about it. An apology??? BS. Pelagia has pulled Isengard out fo the puddle we were wallowing in and brought us to where we are now. A guild that CHALLENGES its members to grow, improve, and take down bigger and badder things. Megara takes EVERY opertunity to disrespect Isengard and disrespect Pelagia and our officers. If you arent part of Megara's increasingly smaller group of friends in Isengard you are subject to her petty bantering. And even if you ARE part of that small circle of her friends you are STILL pissed on. Thats the part that I find amusing. So if anyone owes ANYONE an apology its Megara. She owes one to Pelagia for sure, but also to our members for this pathetic attempt at hurting us in petty way.<br>
<br>
Grow up Megara. And for those of you who believe Megara couldnt possibly do this, WAKE UP. You are so blinded by your friendship and the CON that Megara has pulled on you that you cant see whats right before you. I suppose we are all entitled to our opinions. Mine is that Megara did this. If you disagree thats your perogative.  <br>

<br>
one should not increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything<br>
Occam's razor is a logical principle attributed to the mediaeval philosopher William of Occam (or Ockham). The principle states that one should not make more assumptions than the minimum needed. This principle is often called the principle of parsimony. It underlies all scientific modelling and theory building. It admonishes us to choose from a set of otherwise equivalent models of a given phenomenon the simplest one. In any given model, Occam's razor helps us to &quot;shave off&quot; those concepts, variables or constructs that are not really needed to explain the phenomenon. By doing that, developing the model will become much easier, and there is less chance of introducing inconsistencies, ambiguities and redundancies.<br>
<br>
Though the principle may seem rather trivial, it is essential for model building because of what is known as the &quot;underdetermination of theories by data&quot;. For a given set of observations or data, there is always an infinite number of possible models explaining those same data. This is because a model normally represents an infinite number of possible cases, of which the observed cases are only a finite subset. The non-observed cases are inferred by postulating general rules covering both actual and potential observations.<br>
<br>
For example, through two data points in a diagram you can always draw a straight line, and induce that all further observations will lie on that line. However, you could also draw an infinite variety of the most complicated curves passing through those same two points, and these curves would fit the empirical data just as well. Only Occam's razor would in this case guide you in choosing the &quot;straight&quot; (i.e. linear) relation as best candidate model. A similar reasoning can be made for n data points lying in any kind of distribution.<br>
<br>
Occam's razor is especially important for universal models such as the ones developed in General Systems Theory, mathematics or philosophy, because there the subject domain is of an unlimited complexity. If one starts with too complicated foundations for a theory that potentially encompasses the universe, the chances of getting any manageable model are very slim indeed. Moreover, the principle is sometimes the only remaining guideline when entering domains of such a high level of abstraction that no concrete tests or observations can decide between rival models. In mathematical modelling of systems, the principle can be made more concrete in the form of the principle of uncertainty maximization: from your data, induce that model which minimizes the number of additional assumptions.<br>
<br>
This principle is part of epistemology, and can be motivated by the requirement of maximal simplicity of cognitive models. However, its significance might be extended to metaphysics if it is interpreted as saying that simpler models are more likely to be correct than complex ones, in other words, that &quot;nature&quot; prefers simplicity. <br>

When asked to connect points A and B, draw a straight line to span the two inches. Don't curve it all around and make it a mile long only to come back and connect to Point B. The reason it is called Occam's Razor is because the theory tells you to shave away the B.S. and get down to the simplest facts.  <br>
<br>
Okay, so my view of  the simplest facts:<br>

Webadmin compares logs of the IP source of the deletions to the remaining undamaged board history, and finds 100% of the time that IP address has been used to post in the past, its been by a member of Megara's household. <br>
<br>
Conclusion: Megara's household is the source of the deletions. <br>
