And the simple fact that I was logged on was a good indication of how busy I was with more &quot;important&quot; things.<br>

However people that acted as if I owed them something (this excludes people I did actually owe something), I would ignore them. Or verbally abuse them, keeping clear of supplying reason for a Guide to intervene.<br>

So who exactly were you aiming that towards? Posting on here is normally trying to publically ruin someones name and get their opinion on the person all at once from many people.<br>
What exactly were you looking for when you posted here? <br>
Pity? Not gonna get it. <br>
<br>
<br>
You're just bitching because you picked a class which everyone likes to bug for ports/buffs/pl's etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
You don't like buffing people or porting? Noone gives a shit. We all know what its like to be begged, this is nothing new. It's very simple, your lame rant does absolutly nothing besides make people think you are a whiny bitch. <br>
1)Put people on ignore, if you're too kind or whatever just press &quot;r&quot; for reply and say &quot;no sorry busy atm&quot;.<br>
2)Play a different class, all classes are begged for crap, especially 60+. Do you think as a melee you would have a reason to come here and whine? <br>
<br>
<br>
Your flame is weak, as many have said above me.<br>
<br>
<br>
You swear alot for no apparant reason, maybe just ignorance and lack of a better vocabulary?<br>
<br>
<br>
Normally i'm a pretty decent guy, but when people make stupid flames about retarded(no i do not have to say fuck every 5 words to get my point accross) subjects and you expected what exactly?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: btw YOUR random CAPITAL letter WORDS make NO difference, STILL a LAME flame. <br>

If someone asks my wizard if he can punt, I tell them, sure, for donations.  9 times out of 10, that's no problem at all.  And the tenth time is almost always some level 65 monk who seems to think he has a birthright to free punts.  <br>
<br>
The other thing I find annoying is people who ask for a punt or a buff .. I say sure, I tell them where I am at .. and then they ask me to come to then.  Hey, I'm doing you a favor, at your request, the least you can do is come to where I am.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sippin7>Sippin7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:yellow;'>Tavern Ale Swiller</span></span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/2/03 5:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3575.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hrm</span><hr size=1> What I find annoying is when someone asks for a port, I port them, they donate 100pp, I'm ready to get the heck out of Noob_Zone_01 and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THEN they ask for SOW.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Like, couldn't you ask for SOW up front when you asked for the port???<br>
<br>
What, you think I keep SOW memmed all the time? You think I got the time to sit and mem SOW just for you now? (If I wanted to throw valuable time down a rathole, I'll go work on my shawl.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Sheesh, and then they don't even donate MORE for the SOW. Hey, folks, mana is money. You know how long it takes to regain that SOW-cast mana?! <br>
<br>
More likely I have SOE up so like the generous self-less druid I am, I go to cast that on them. BUT THEN I SEE THEY'RE TOO LOW LEVEL FOR THE SPELL! Jeez, if you're going to go around asking level 65's for ports and buffs, you could at least have the decency to be high enough to TAKE the buffs they normally keep up.<br>

The life of a druid is one of constant aggravations. I should have made a warrior and nobody would ever bother me...<br>

 It's interesting to hear this.  I prefer SoE by far over regular SoW for pulling.  It's not that difficult to use either pgup and pgdn  or mouselook for those differences in elevation.  SoE also gives the added advantage of not having to worry about lava or water in the pulling path, if present.<br>
<br>
Of course when the critter one is pulling falls into said lava or water, another problem entirely presents itself. :P<br>

My gods if you feel that pissed over &quot;being manipulated&quot; in a fricken game, do yourself and everyone else a favor. Never go outside and become part of the real world.
