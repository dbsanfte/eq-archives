Some people do actually take this board to heart, for some reason, so I'd like to let you know the truth behind the posts you read. Some morons do like to try drive a guild into the ground, probably the only reason they play this game..<br>
<br>
Everything I have written below is true to my knowledge, think maybe I should open the eyes of some. I know truth hurts sometimes... I was present at all events... <br>
<br>
Xlabikx how about you read what you write before calling people names.. if anyone here is a hypocrite, it's you. Just take a look at the title of the topic you started, then your reply 1/2 way down the page.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't you all Love Hypocrits? I sure as hell love Fotc!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fotc as a whole? I've seen some shady things pulled by you guys, but nothing to put you all onto my hate list, especially with a few close friends/old guildies<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The majority of the time you flame any FotC member you do not use their name. You generalize it to FotC; a FotC group did this or FotC did that. Whether it is 1 person or a raid force, when you say FotC you mean the WHOLE GUILD. And what &quot;shady things&quot; have you seen FotC pull exactly??? For those of you who don't know Xlabikx and FotC have history.. and he no doubt holds a grudge.<br>
<br>
In like March or April, when GoD died, Milon (FotC's GL at the time) was approached by what was left of GoD asking for a merger. We made it quite clear that it was an absorption and that FotC guidelines were to remain in place etc. Anyways like 10 of them tagged over in about a weeks time, Xlab was one of these. After 3 days tagged he made a post on our message boards (some older FotC players may remember it), &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WTF... Things need to change</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;. In this post he pretty much tore the guild apart in his words. EVERYTHING we did was totally wrong, our raiding system, our DPK system <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(we like to have fun while we give out loot, most people love the system, even though it takes a min or 2 longer than the regular)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> our recruiting system, he also said that our (then) current officers needed to be replaced, the way we talk, the way we walk.. everything you could imagine. The way he saw it, unless we became &quot;Generic_clone_raiding_guild_6045761&quot; then we didn't have a chance. Maybe he mistook our guild forum with the blast furnace?<br>
<br>
He didn't stop there.. he began sending tells to a lot of our members trying to turn them to his cause. He sent tells to members that were to the effect of, &quot;Milon is a complete idiot and he needs to be replaced, this guild will not last long&quot;. I just remember him calling Milon an idiot for sure, it was like a week after I was promoted to officer so it sticks in my mind. Anyways he said 1/2 the guild was with him and they'd quit if Milon remained GL. Milon promptly kicked him out and after a day the majority of the GoD sheep detagged and followed suit, although we did keep a couple good people. No one who had been a member before Xlab/GoD joined followed him. Just ask yourself, is this the sort of person I want in my guild? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hell no</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Maybe one day he'll get over the fact that his ass was kicked to the curb, then again he seems pretty stubborn..<br>
<br>
<br>
Hevyd? To be honest I have no idea why you have a problem with FotC, besides the whole &quot;Grend&quot; thing in BoT last week. But you've been gunning for us for months now. I know you had a run in or 2 with Sycik here on the BF.. but pretty much everyone did. He's no longer in our guild or even on this server, yet you still hold a grudge against the entire guild. I did group with you not too long ago, you seemed like a decent guy. A little immature, seemed the whole conversation on /gs was about the size of woodelf breasts.....<br>
<br>
Sorry that this is kind of long, but I want to clarify things for you &quot;viewers&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've seen a few people comment on the whole &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FotC KS'd Kland from GoL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; incident...were any of you there? If so, please chime in. I was, let me paint you a picture..<br>
<br>
Both guilds started zoning into WW about the same time and set up near DN zone in, I can't say who had the first person in zone, like it matters. FotC had our members there buffed, ready first and engaged. 10-15 seconds after we engaged we had 2-4 WW dragons add on us (I can't say for sure how many, I died straight away) and obviously we wiped. GoL were very vocal that it wasn't them, that it was some random person going into DN.. and YES we totally took their word for it. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Sound familiar to anyone? Like the 2 PoZ's that added onto us at 30% left on AoW? Ohh nm maybe we trained ourselves, according to GoL one of our people just ran off and aggro'd them because AoW was just too darn easy and we needed a challenge. --------- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>No I am not blaming GoL for that</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.. maybe it was just a coincidence, there were a few other people in the zone at the time. Seems being near GoL is bad luck though).</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
K anyway we wiped.. we dragged the corpses out.. we rezzed, rebuffed and med'd to FOM and GoL still hadn't engaged. Milon shouted/ooc'd (I don't remember which), &quot;We do not have all night, we are ready to engage again. You have 5(10? Don't remember exactly) mins to engage or we will.&quot; Milon gave them a count down every minute, &quot;you have 4 mins to engage&quot;, &quot;you have 3 mins to engage&quot;, etc. When there was about 1-2 mins left Huuse /ooc's, &quot;hey guys, what's happening&quot; and the GoL cheer goes up.. &quot;hey Huuse&quot;, etc. Obviously they had been stalling because they didn't have their MT there. At about 1 min I guess they began to coh-debuff, Huuse still wasn't at their camp and I guess they saw it as a way to hold us off. &quot;You have 30 seconds to engage&quot;, then, &quot;ok charge guys&quot;.. and we went in and killed it. To be honest, not all FotC members were ok with this, but how long do you wait??? We could have been there hours ago with a mage and shammy CoH debuffing waiting on the raid to arrive, is that alright???<br>
<br>
The whole AoW thing.. there is one thing I don't understand here. How do guilds think they have ANY right to this mob? If a guild takes the time to kill vindi/statue/idol then they sure as hell deserve AoW, whether they fail or not. If you want AoW, then you get your ass in Kael when statue pops and do the whole sequence and earn it. If a guild wipes, they deserve the 2nd chance, THAT is what pissed off us when GoL took it at 1%. 90% (there is always those who love the loot) of the guild didn't give a shit about the loot.. we were pissed that GoL robbed us of our 2nd attempt! I'm sorry but they didn't have a chance in hell of killing it with the force they had there. Had they not aggro'd it before we wiped, Otana (my RL wife who was FD) would have stayed down to rez a cleric... but she stood to try get the kill, seeing as GoL had engaged before the total wipe. This isn't the first time we've been &quot;taunted by other guilds&quot; .. on our first attempt TWC did it.. on our 2nd ToN (which we won and a storm was bitched up about it), and then GoL who killed it at 1%. At least the first two guilds had class about it. You will never see FotC hovering over a guild like a bunch of vultures.<br>
<br>
We have only tried this guy 3 times.. and every time we've had another guild in zone waiting for us to fail.. Why? What makes you guys actually think you deserve the right to even engage a mob someone else spawns? Going to take SSRA as an example, if I kill R1, R2 and then AL pops, that mob is MINE. If anyone wants to kill it too bad, even if I wipe all day long.. I've taken the time to spawn it, therefore it is mine. Sure if I leave and give up, then whoever wants it can take it.. but until that point stay the hell back.<br>
<br>
BoT .. what a shithole of a zone. From when I've exp'd there, there is usually 2 camps to each wing.. 1 at hub and 1 at the pad for those who don't know (Pad = where named spawn). Daily there are races for named and if you are camped at the pad, well there is no competition. If you are camping the hub, I'm sorry but its my opinion that you are NOT camping that PAD. KS's etc happen daily in BoT .. but the second you see a FotC tag in the mix it's a fucking conspiracy. I'm going to use SSRA again as a reference; there is a group in comm1 and a group in comm2 .. rhag1 pops.. is this automatically comm1's mob, just because they are on the same floor? Even though they need to MOVE to it.. NO it's whoever it is that gets to the mobs room first. If someone calls Rhag1 room before it's popped.. then sure.. it's all yours.. <br>
<br>
As you've all seen, there has been a few complaints about BoT and to be honest not one person has approached me about this. I guess the BF is an easier place to whine. If you have a problem with a member of FotC, contact an officer and it will be dealt with.. not that hard eh? This issue has been confronted on our guild forums, there has even been a guideline of rules concerning BoT formulated and posted.<br>
<br>
I dunno about you other guilds, but in FotC there is a rule that we don't talk shit about other guilds. I guess we'd expect the same of you other guilds, but looking at the BF.. I guess we are alone on that. Of course, it isn't easy to police, but those are the rules. If you break it, then you get a verbal warning. If you repeat it, later. To be honest a lot of the childish people who were in our guild are gone now and in the last month we've been growing into a stronger guild. Our goals are in sight - VT - yeah its a big step.. but we are working hard towards it.. and we will get there or die trying.<br>
<br>
No doubt people are going to come out of the woodwork to flame this post.. but say whetever you want, every word of it is the truth and nothing will change that. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=413678">Shalladiah</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - 65 Monk - Guild Leader of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fotcguild.com">Fate of the Chosen</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chingerz>chingerz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/29/03 10:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3433.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fate of the Chosen</span><hr size=1> Can someone summarize this in a single paragraph for the short attention span crowd? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40574">Chingerz Angsantos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> -- <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hneguild.com">Heaven and Earth</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> -- <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern">Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Maintaining your guild's reputation is something you have to pursue in game, doing it here is generally counterproductive.<br>
<br>
I agree with most of what you said, with the exception of one point regarding AoW.  He's a highly contested spawn that despawns quickly once triggered if not aggroed.  You have had other guilds shadowing you (including us) on this because there is a reasonable chance that you will fail.  Just because you spawn the mob does not mean you have the right to have him despawn.  Arch Lich is another matter, he doesn't despawn, and as far as I'm concerned, if you want to spend all day in there wiping to him multiple times, feel free.<br>
<br>
I like most of the folks I've run into from FotC, we've had a few instances of rubbing each other the wrong way, but that's completely expected between raiding guilds.  You get past it and you do your best to build relations so that you don't make each other nuts.  Unfortunately, there will always be some individuals *cough* Bokuza *cough* who have apparently carved every transgression into thier flesh so that they will never, ever forget it.  Time unfortunately does not wound all heels.<br>
<br>
As I said at the beginning, posting here about your reputation or lack thereof is not going to serve you well, really.  The usual suspects are going to crawl out from under their rocks and fling poo shortly, if they haven't started already.  The people that matter, i.e.; the leaders and officers of the other guilds, form their opinions from how you act in game.  What goes on in here is like the Jerry Springer Show, extremely cheap amusement (except when they have that Chichester guy on). <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366694">Nayl</a>

After a two wipes we were able to get him on the third time without another guild waiting for us (I know for some guilds AL isnt worth much, but he is a milestone for us).

<br>
Back to the SSRA / Arch`lich thing. Well if you have 12 people or so. You are basically un-able to kill AL (im talking FOTC not HNE) If you do not have adequate force to kill a mob do you deserve it? ask yourself that question. You yourself said GoL didnt deserver Klandi because they didnt have adequate force (Huuse not being there) Yet you took Klandi am i wrong? Well you did say most of this is fact. So im guessing im not.<br>

Im not &quot;anti-FOTC&quot;.

<br>
On the same note, about 2 months ago there was about 20 of us in Ssra doing comms along w/ a single group of ToN when Rhag1 popped.  They beat us to Rhag1 and wanted to know who our RL was to imform him that ToN had rights to AL cycle.  They beat us far and square and I'm sure by the time AL popped they would have had enough in Ssra (we left shortly after).  This morning Ted Club had a single group in Ssra and they got Rhag1.  They were unable to kill AL so does that mean they shouldnt do Rhag1? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=453758">Grendalkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,  Ranger<br>

Second, just a note about AoW and why people behave differently around it than other mobs, such as AL like you mention, is that once spawned he will despawn on a timer.  Its very difficult for anyone to wipe and have enough time for a second chance, and anyone who would like to take a turn after you wont have time if they wait out of zone or even far off in Kael. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarenna>Sarenna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/30/03 1:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3433.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fate of the Chosen</span><hr size=1> So according to Seani - DW and hne are hated <br>

even if that is true and you've finally done some quality assurance on your membership, noone outside your guild really knows this.  it will take some time for people change their view of FoTC as a whole.  time and consistent mature and diplomatic behaviour is your only answer.  until the critical mass of good opinions about FoTC is formed you're basically up a creek with a shitstick - deal with it; you're paying for the mistake of recruiting almost every willing idiot on the server. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
I don't think he meant that you would have exclusive rights to a mob even if you don't have an adequate force to kill the mob in question. I think what he was getting at is that it's wrong for people to mess with a spawn cycle that someone else starts (Rhag1/Rhag2/AL or SoRZ/Idol/AoW, etc) unless they wipe, have no intentions of completing the cycle, or leave. Like if GUILD_A has say 30-40 people in SSRA and they buff, clear and kill Rhag1, GUILD_B has no right to touch Rhag 2 or AL that GUILD_A spawned unless for some reason GUILD_A isn't going to kill them, GUILD_A leaves or GUILD_A wipes. If GUILD_B hangs around to see if GUILD_A succeeds with AL or not, then GUILD_A wipes and GUILD_B takes AL at 100% and succeeds, it would be fair game. <br>
<br>
I do agree with you that no one should be holding a mob when there's absolutely no chance that they can kill it though. If someone killed Rhag 1 and 2 with like 15 people and tried to hold off other guilds off who were already in force and ready for AL, that would be rediculous because there's zero chance for them to kill AL. If they want to try to set a record, sure go ahead and try. But if they are just stalling for time while more of their people mobilize or whatever, that doesn't really fly imo. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=552260" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vicour1/OtanaSig_FOTC.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=otanadesdemonia>Otana DesDemonia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(7/30/03 4:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3433.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fate of the Chosen</span><hr size=1> Hi Bdaan,<br>

<br>
First of all, this was under different leadership. Milon was our guild leader at the time and made the call on that raid, it was back in March or around there, I believe. Both guilds got there at about the same time and FoTC engaged first, wiped. Their raid force was about the same or possibly less than what ours was, so we decided to hang around to see whether or not we would take another turn after them or move onto the next target. They were stalling and finally Milon was done with the waiting around and yelled for us to charge. I was one of the people against his call to be honest.<br>
<br>
My opinion of vultures and breathing down necks is more like a guild coming in somewhere when you've already been a good amount of time getting set up, clearing and you're about to engage on the boss mob you came for. Then there they are, standing right behind you, the last of their force trickling in behind them, secretly chanting in their heads for you to fail. All in all, it really doesn't matter though because it will always happen. It's just part of it, I guess.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">To your second set of quotes and your comments about whether or not a guild deserves a second chance on a mob after they wipe:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
I have to agree with you, if a guild wipes and the mob regens back to 100%, most (if any) guilds aren't going to give the first guild a second chance. They wouldn't be there in the first place if that was the case. Sure, it would be a nice gesture, but how many guilds or even people for that matter are that generous?<br>

<br>
He's saying that there are 2 groups both camping different camps (comm 1 and comm 2) close to each other and Rhag 1 pops which is in neither of these two camps. Even though comm 1's camp is on the same (bottom) floor and somewhat closer to Rhag 1, it gives them no more claim to Rhag 1 than the comm 2 group who is on the second floor above them. What settles who gets the mob (Rhag 1 in this example) is which group gets to the room first and engages the mob. Whoever kills the mob first (should they have the force to continue the cycle) has the claim to the other mobs in the cycle they started, by killing the trigger mob. If the first group to engage was to wipe, they would lose their claim to the camp/mob. Should the second group also wipe, same deal. If they both wipe, I suppose it would be back to square one and whoever is ready and engages first again would get the first shot.<br>

You're right about that. Some of our members were pretty pissed off about being ks'ed on AoW by GoL and they had every right to be. However, the manner in which a few people reacted to the situation was not mature and it was embarrassing to say the least. The few people who did spazz out and cuss at GoL were addressed and warned. I think the point he is trying to make is that you don't see members of our guild making topics to flame other guilds as a whole on these message boards and that we have been for the most part pretty respectful that I have seen. <br>

Lets see, where to start.<br>
<br>
I think we should link my posts on fotc's message boards to the blast furnace. Seeing as my account was banned from them i would LOVE to see them here.<br>
<br>
<br>
What i posted was a general consensus of everyone who i talked to, most of those being the new GoD members and a few friends i had in Fotc prior to us joining. We were all going to leave the night when you couldn't kill LY crusaders. <br>
<br>
<br>
It was a pitiful excuse for a raid. I asked them to stay and wait a few days, to see if it would change.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then in comes this wonderful ebay cleric, haladur, telling me i should save my DKP for Rumblecrush robe because its the best out of VT? He's completely talking out of his ass, whatever he obviously had no idea what he was talking about. Then He starts *slurp sluping* on Milon saying how wonderful he is. I tell him how i feel about Milon, He then tells Milon and has me removed. No big deal, i was detagging that day anyways. <br>
<br>
<br>
Instead of just me detagging you also pissed off enough people to get the majority of people from GoD to leave with me. Hoorah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hell even one of your god damned officers agreed with me that Milon was a stubburn idiot, and things in the guild were done complete wrong. I was just the the first to voice my opinion. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I still have a few friends in Fotc, but most of them have left.<br>
<br>
But now you have Valdemore as an officer? haha, god help you.<br>
<br>

Fotc as a whole? I've seen some shady things pulled by you guys, but nothing to put you all onto my hate list, especially with a few close friends/old guildies<br>

And by the title of that thread, i was pointing out that a few people tagged Fotc(since it was an all fotc group), did this shit in BoT. I thought it was a great title considering the recent Fotc/gol/aow inncident. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And look what you've made me do, another long post.<br>

That because i can't spell Grendwhatevers name correctly, But i guess it doesn't matter when he cannot spell saryrn correctly in his signature right?<br>
<br>
<br>
Grudge? nope don't give a shit anymore. But i do feel the need to respond to a thread with me involved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shady things lets see, oh nevermind i don't care anymore. I'm far too lazy to post anything else reguarding fotc as a whole. That would involve more people and make this thread longer, and i just don't have the patience to read any more 9 paragraph posts about the past, especially if the majority of it is exagerations.<br>
<br>
<br>
You guys truly do have some really excellent players.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As i've stated before, i don't hate any guild entirely.<br>

<br>
<br>
and stop with the long ass posts please.... i read about 1/3 of the original post before my bullshit alarm went off, and i don't have personal knowledge of *any* of the events. Real issues don't take 8 fucking paragraphs.<br>
<br>
and please... name *one* person that actually takes this board &quot;to heart&quot; as you put it. nothing you post here will bring down FotC, or any other guild for that matter. The guilds that have collapsed did it to themselves fucking up over and over again.  <p><table width=564 align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">

Thats the biggest load of shit ive ever read, i never said half the guild was with me, nor did i say that the guild will not last long. Yes i said he was a complete idiot, he was.<br>
<br>
<br>
I said nothing about 1/2 the guild leaving if Milon remained guildleader, i didn't even say i would leave if Milon remained guild leader. I said he needs to change his way and needs sto stop being such a stubburn bastard.<br>
