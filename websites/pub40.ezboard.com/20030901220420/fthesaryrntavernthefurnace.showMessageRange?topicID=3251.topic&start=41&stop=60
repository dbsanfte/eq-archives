<br>
1. The likelyhood of my expressing that this behaivor is ok and it resulting in death threats is so remote that I would not fear for it happening. The professor that I pointed out was threatened by citizens, not the government. Furthermore, its is likely to foresee the reaction that he got considering the mood of the country at the time he made the remarks. I am not condoning the death threats made to the guy. I hope they are tracking those people down and charging them with crimes. But I laugh my ass off thinking that the reaction came as a surprise to the guy. He publicly states that he hopes our troops get slaughtered and dragged through the streets like dead animals on a parade. Come on, what level of education do you need to realize that this is going to piss some people off?<br>
<br>
2. No one prevented him from making the statement, or threatened him with legal action if he did make the statement. He was not arrested for espousing an unpopular sentiment. Students who were enrolled in his classes also planned a boycot of his classes because of his statements. They were not forced to attend his class, they were afforded the 'right' not to go. No ones free speech was violated. <br>
<br>
3. What I find amusing is that one person's 'free speech' caused a reaction in another form of 'free speech' and yet one is seen as inherently good and the other 'inherently' bad (ie the burning of the CD's). The argument that was made was that free speech should be protected, and yet they use as an example a form of expressing free speech as the result we wish to avoid. You can't have it both ways. Just because someone is anti-war or against the policy of the current administration it doesn't make everything they say or do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MORE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> worthwhile free speech than someone who supports the government. They are the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>same</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing. If you can't see that then you miss the entire point of free speech and are in the same boat as those who say &quot;Free speech is for those who think like us.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallaorn>Gallaorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1123<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/14/03 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3251.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bah you get the point no subject</span><hr size=1> Retribution from gov't or from an individual citizen or a group of them is the same thing in the end.

<br>
I am not arguing that the professor was smart or stupid, and i obviously dont agree with his point of view however as long as he doesnt do anything to kill soldiers he is entitile to his opinions ans shouldnt lose his jobs or receive death threat because of it.<br>
<br>
I guess you can pass the CD burning as free speech as in a demonstration but it imply violence and that is unacceptable. You can disagree and think gwb is a swell guy, you can stop buying their CD if you got offended thats your right. However you should not be allowed to make their life hell for the sole reason that you dont agree with them.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The likelyhood of my expressing that this behaivor is ok and it resulting in death threats is so remote that I would not fear for it happening&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So in short as long as you express popular opinions you are ok. And thats the entire point really, you shouldnt live in fear of voicing unpopular opinion is a free society built on free speech. I think it is time we live up to the same standard we impose on our governement, if they are not allowed retribution on individuals for voicing unpopular opinions why should we be able to do it in impunity?<br>

Now, the law will protect you, perhaps post mortem, but it WILL see justice served.  But it doesn't guarantee you won't get the shit kicked out of you for exercising your right... just that you HAVE the right.<br>

Wrong answer. You can't pass judgement on what is acceptable and unacceptable free speech. You take the good with the bad.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However you should not be allowed to make their life hell for the sole reason that you dont agree with them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Did the people who burned those CD's rampage on record stores and loot them? Did they beat up the Dixie Chics themselves to get the CD's to burn? I don't think so. People disposed of their own property in a way they saw fit. If that made the lives of the Dixie Chic's hell, well perhaps they should engage the brain muscle before they let out the mouth clutch. Furthermore, even if the Dixie Chic's thought about their statement long and hard and decided they wanted to be pariahs and exercise their freedom thereby alienating their fan base there is no constitutional amendment stating that any &quot;entertainer&quot; is gauranteed fans.  <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And thats the entire point really, you shouldnt live in fear of voicing unpopular opinion is a free society built on free speech. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You are correct sir. You should not have to fear for your life if you express an unpopular opinion. <br>

 Why can't people react in legal ways? That is their right. The CD burning, while 'violent' in your opinion, was perfectly legal. People that react in illegal ways will be treated like other criminals. I have not followed the story but I can imagine an investigation may have been started based on the death threats for the professor. <br>

No Gallaorn they were not in fear of there lives for the burning they were in fear of slumping record sale <br>

<br>
That was completely the fault of the Dixie Chicks.  They should have stuck by their lead singer's right to speak her opinion and never appoligized for it, ever.  Instead, they (or their promoters) decided their fan base was offended by what she said, and either forced them to appoligize or at least recommended it.<br>
<br>
I just don't see death threats made by moronic, extremeist, right-wing zealots as an indication of any kind of trend in anti-free speech in the US.  The fans that burned the CD, radio staions that refused to play their music, etc aren't in the same league as death threats.  They are in fact the other side to your free speech issue.  Sure, you are free to say whatever you like and you had better damn well be prepared for the reprocusions of it. <p>Baks Fyre, Wizard for Hire<br>

&quot;if they are not allowed retribution on individuals for voicing unpopular opinions why should we be able to do it in impunity?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Because we (the people) are the conscience of the government, and as a whole are responsible for interpreting the spirit of the law rather than the letter.<br>
<br>
If you think of Free Speech as some intrinsically “pure” ideal, you are naive. Many a silver-tongued monster has hidden behind its mask.<br>
<br>
Free speech is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> empowered by our society’s values….NOT some inalienable dogma. If someone challenges its value through abuse, society reacts as it sees fit.<br>

<br>
If its ok to burn a cd...<br>
<br>
Is it ok to burn a flag?<br>
<br>
What about a book?<br>
<br>
In countries where the glorious democracy of the people engaged in book-burning as sort of a bonding ritual for the masses, tell me--how'd that go? End well? Everyone happy? No genocide things right?<br>
<br>
Are you willing then to say that the best thing to do if someone criticizes your government, your leader, is to 1.) destroy their work. and 2.) discredit them publically. The Dixie Chicks DID receive death threats you realize, so why not add 3.) kill them.<br>
<br>
I always find it amazing what people do in the name of &quot;democracy&quot; and indeed what other countries call a &quot;democracy.&quot; Almost as amazing as those too ignorant to see certain...parallels...or avenues that might lead to a place I'm Sure they never meant to go. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~luckythedog/EQ/Vainnesig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418857">Vainne Niteblind, Saryrn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallaorn>Gallaorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:orange;'>Tavern Resident</span></span><br>  Posts: 1126<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/15/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3251.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> No subject i say!</span><hr size=1> Actually they stated in an interview that they were fearing for their lives and it just wasnt worth it so they apologized.

What got me worried, if you can even call it that, is not the right wing zealot. I know there will always be some stupid right wing activitist talking tough somewhere. Its when otherwise decent people start acting and thinking like those idiot that it get me thinking about where we are heading. <br>

I guess as we put more years between us and sep 11 the trend will die out.<br>

<br>
Free speech means that the Dixie Chicks get to say they are unhappy with President Bush.  Free speech also means that other people get to say that it's unpatriotic for the Dixie Chicks to say that.  And freedom also means that those people are free to burn Dixie Chicks albums (their own, I would hope) in protest, and are free to announce that they will no longer listen to radio stations that play Dixie Chicks music.  And I am free to think the whole thing is a tempest in a teapot, and to ignore the protesters and to continue listening to the Dixie Chicks.  <br>
<br>
Free speech means you are free to speak.  Someone else may not like what you choose to say, and may choose to dislike you for saying it.  (That's called freedom of association, and guess what, it's in the same constitutional amendment.)  Free speech doesn't mean that when you speak you are free of all consequences.  <br>
<br>
And for anyone who truly believes that free speech used to be a lot freer, my own view is that you don't have a particularly thorough appreciation of U.S. history.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agnol>agnol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(5/16/03 1:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3251.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> And Agnol sayeth &quot;There shall be a subject line!&quot;</span><hr size=1> Vainne:<br>

Lets see.. in the first list everything (but not your reasons)  but the &quot;Ex-lover's possessions&quot;, which I find amusing you think its quite all right to destroy other people's property. Ok, it was a joke I'll give you that. In the second list I agree with only one: people(alive). <br>
<br>
Darbok OMalley:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Burning the flag isnt in poor taste,its out right treasonious. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To both Vainne and Darbok, burning religious symbols or even the flag, No matter how much you dislike it or are offended by it, they are both still legal. You have every right to legally react to any such person doing things that you find offensive, but you can't take away their right to do such things. As soon as you do you destroy the ammendment. <br>
<br>
I served in the military. I had friends I've seen laid in the ground with a flag atop their coffin. I raised the flag hundreds of times, I still get a tear in my eye when I hear the National Anthem, I was extraordinarily angry when I learned the National Endowment of the Arts gave a grant to a guy who put a crucifix in a jar of urine! Why do I mention this? Because despite my feelings about all of these subjects I wouldn't want anyone who felt they 'knew better' than me to come along and tell me what I could and couldn't burn or put in a jar of urine 'for my own good'. <br>
<br>
Freedom of Speech isn't easy. It's too easy to say what <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOU</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> think should be the limits. Who the hell are <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOU</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->? And what the hell are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOU</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> gonna do when someday you become a part of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THEM</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>US</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
Because by instituting limits on the Freedom of Speech suddenly it isn't a freedom any longer. GWB said something incredibly stupid since he became president, was shown to me on one of the many websites that like to make fun of him : &quot;There ought to be limits to freedoms&quot;. Holy Cow! I never had much love for the ACLU but I hope to god that set off a five alarm fire in their offices. <br>
<br>
The funny thing is, those who are arguing that their ought to be limits are well within their rights to argue such things. Perhaps if their limits were put in place, we wouldn't be having this discussion.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3251.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3251.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3251.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3251.topic&start=81&stop=96>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showPrevMessage?topicID=3251.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showNextMessage?topicID=3251.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3251.topic&index=60><img src=http://members.cox.net/cbilyeu/tavern/notnice_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=3251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=3251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub40.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm20">User Interface Help<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm19">Mugshots<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm18">Polls<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Expansion Discussions<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm17">Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
