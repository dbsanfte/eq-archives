&gt;<br>
&gt; Last week, the Shelby County Alabama Legislative Delegation hosted a<br>
&gt; &quot;Stand Up for America Rally.&quot; More than 1,200 people attended including featured<br>
&gt; speakers Chief Justice Roy Moore, Adjutant General Mark Bowen and Alabama<br>
&gt; State Auditor Beth Chapman.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Attached is a copy of Mrs. Chapman's speech, which resulted in five<br>
&gt; standing ovations, tremendous applause and an encore. It's a short read<br>
&gt; and well worth it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I hope you enjoy it as we continue to &quot;Stand up for America!&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
 <br>
&gt;      Stand Up for America Rally Speech by: Beth Chapman<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt; I'm here tonight because men and women of the United States military have<br>
&gt; given their lives for my freedom. I am not here tonight because Sheryl<br>
&gt; Crowe, Rosie O'Donnell, Martin Sheen, George Clooney, Jane Fonda or Phil<br>
&gt; Donahue, sacrificed their lives for me.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If my memory serves me correctly, it was not movie stars or musicians, but<br>
&gt; the United States Military who fought on the shores of Iwo Jima, the<br>
&gt; jungles of Vietnam, and the beaches of Normandy. Tonight, I say we should<br>
&gt; support the President of the United States and the US Military and tell<br>
&gt; the liberal, tree-hugging, Birkenstock-wearing, hippy, tie-dyed liberals<br>
&gt; to go make their movies and music and whine somewhere else.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; After all, if they lived in Iraq, they wouldn't be allowed the freedom of<br>
&gt; speech they're being given here today. Ironically, they would be put to<br>
&gt; death at the hands of Sadam Hussein or Osama Bin Laden. I want to know <br>
&gt; how the very people who are against war because of the loss of life, can<br>
&gt; possibly be the same people who are for abortion?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; They are the same people who are for animal rights but against the rights<br>
&gt; of the unborn. The movie stars say they want to go to Iraq and serve as<br>
&gt; &quot;human shields&quot; for the Iraqis. I say let them buy a one-way ticket and go.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; No one likes war. I hate war! But the one thing I hate more is the fact<br>
&gt; that this country has been forced into war-innocent people have lost their<br>
&gt; lives - - and there but for the grace of God, it could have been my<br>
&gt; brother, my husband, or even worse my own son.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; On December 7, 1941, there are no records of movie stars treading the<br>
&gt; blazing waters of Pearl Harbor.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; On September 11, 2001; there are no photos of movie stars standing as<br>
&gt; &quot;human shields&quot; against the debris and falling bodies ascending from the<br>
&gt; World Trade Center. There were only policemen and firemen - - underpaid<br>
&gt; civil servants who gave their all with nothing expected in return.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; When the USS Cole was bombed, there were no movie stars guarding the<br>
&gt; ship - - where were the human shields then?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If America's movie stars want to be human shields, let them shield the<br>
&gt; gang-ridden streets of Los Angeles, or New York City, let them shield the<br>
&gt; lives of the children of North Birmingham whose mothers lay them down to<br>
&gt; sleep on the floor each night to shelter them from stray bullets.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If they want to be human shields, I say let them shield the men and women<br>
&gt; of honesty and integrity that epitomizes courage and embody the spirit of<br>
&gt; freedom by wearing the proud uniforms of the United States Military. Those<br>
&gt; are the people who have earned and deserve shielding!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Throughout the course of history, this country has remained free, not<br>
&gt; because of movie stars and liberal activists, but because of brave men and<br>
&gt; women who hated war too. However, they lay down their lives so that we all<br>
&gt; may live in freedom. After all -- &quot;What greater love hath no man, that he<br>
&gt; lay down his life for his friend,&quot; or in this case a country.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We should give our military honor and acknowledgment and not let their<br>
&gt; lives be in vain. If you want to see true human shields, walk through<br>
&gt; Arlington Cemetery. There lie human shields, heroes, and the BRAVE<br>
&gt; Americans who didn't get on television and talk about being a human shield<br>
&gt; --- they were human shields.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I thank God tonight for freedom - - those who bought and paid for it with<br>
&gt; their lives in the past - - those who will protect it in the present and<br>
&gt; defend it in the future.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; America has remained silent too long! God-fearing people have remained<br>
&gt; silent too long!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We must lift our voices united in a humble prayer to God for guidance and<br>
&gt; the strength and courage to sustain us throughout whatever the future may<br>
&gt; hold.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; After the tragic events of Sept. 11th, my then eleven -year-old son said<br>
&gt; terrorism is a war against them and us and if you're not one of us, then<br>
&gt; you're one of them.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So in closing tonight, let us be of one accord, let us stand proud, and<br>
&gt; let us be the human shields of prayer, encouragement and support for the<br>
&gt; President, our troops and their families and our country.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; May God bless America, the land of the free, the home of the brave and the<br>
&gt; greatest country on the face of this earth!<br>

She lost all credibility with me there. Anyone who uses the blanket statements she does to discredit anyone who disagrees with her is just sad. You wonder why people call them warmongers? Well you got your answer right there.<br>
<br>
Also, she also completely ignores two important facts:<br>
1. People should ALWAYS question and critique the leaders of a country. Following blindly is very very dangerous. <br>
2. USA is built on the foundation of being the home of the free, and free speach is one of the major arguments in this. <br>
<br>
I have no problem with supporting the troops, they deserve it. But I do have a problem with anyone saying the President should be supported no matter what. That is BS.<br>

Nobody forced USA to do anything. In fact they are acting very much on their own decission for reasons that can be, and are being, debated.<br>

As a non-religious person I just have to laugh at this because it is exactly what bin Laden, Saddam, Iran's Ayatollahs etc do. Of course Bush also said he is doing God's work...<br>

She obviously forgot to read the 484 pages of the Homeland Security Act or the Patriot Act. A LOT of freedom has been lost, and it doesn't only impact Americans.<br>

I agree with Andvari completly, if you want to support the war, fine, support the war.  But once you start name calling and denigrating those who disagree with you, instead of using coherent arguments to prove you are right, you turn into the jackass. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:comic sans ms;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82891" target="top">-=Marauder Kuat Diamonddog=-</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

His points are right on the mark.  This southern christian sheep is just stirring the @#%$ pot for effect.  She makes no valid points, nor does she hold any credibility with those that are able to reason and form ideas on their own.

Yeah because if you don't agree with everything Bush says and does you need to leave!<br>

I have courage enough in my convictions to stand up for them and put a voice to them. I have courage enough in my convictions not to follow a President blindly, but rather question his actions.

So anyone who does such is considered a warmonger? What happened to the right of an opinion. The antiwar people can do just the exact same thing, but when you say they have no credibility it's wrong because they have freedom of speech and expression. <br>

The pro-war people keep complaining about being called warmongers, yet they have no problem calling others liberals, tree-hugging hippies, anti-american, non-patriotic, pro-Iraq, pro-Saddam etc.<br>

I am not going to call anyone a warmonger (well with the possible exception of Rumsfeld), and yes I consider people who use blanket statements like that with very little credibility.<br>

Maybe you're a &quot;pack animal&quot; that only likes to be around like-minded individuals, but I happen to think what makes this country great is the diversity of cultures and opinions that make it up.  What this means, is that there will always be debate; the bigger the subject (read: a major war), the more heated the debate will be.  Intelligent people listen to what the other side has to say and consider their points; morons stick their fingers in their ears while shouting &quot;Get out of the country if you dont like it!&quot;.<br>

Aren't you using a blanket statement by labeling the originator of that letter as a warmonger? Wouldn't you then lose your own credibility? <br>
<br>
You see what I am getting at? <br>
<br>
It's her own opinion and given right to make that statement. However, you can't say she loses credibility when the antiwar protesters have said much worse and only gotten &quot;well it's freedom of speech, they can say what they want&quot;. I am talking about them already using the &quot;baby killer&quot; and &quot;warmonger&quot; statements. However, they don't lose any credibility because you have a bias based on your beliefs of how things should have happened. That's all cool, that's your right to have an opinion, but you can't base loss of credibility because they used a statement you didn't like.<br>
<br>
You singled out one sentence instead of ignoring it and considering the entire letter. <p><a href=http://www.hneguild.com/profile.asp?name=Garbhad><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~cblack87/Garbsig.jpeg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub40.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mtdover>mtdover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='color:pink;'>Tavern Floor Sweeper</span></span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(4/6/03 9:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3207.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Its human nature to be a pack animal, like it or not.

If it is FREE speech, can it BE in the wrong place? <br>
<br>
&quot;You there, you are in a non-free-speech zone. Please only verbalize things that are not of an offensive nature to anyone at anytime in any way. <br>
Have a nice day and please enjoy your freedom.&quot;<br>

Excercising free speech only in places where everyone agrees with you would lead to such closed-mindedness and ignorance it's absurd. I'm so glad others have the freedom to voice opinions that differ from mine in places where I can hear them. Like school for instance.<br>

I don't mind issues relating to persons/groups as far as connected to eq. If it gets completely out of topic-like discussing politics and pro's and con's of a war- i feel it doesn't belong in the blast furnace.<br>

<br>
I remember 11/09- That was something that was so shocking and acutely in need of a place to express opinions that the forum created a special section for it- Every topic related to it was moved there.<br>
<br>
<br>
There was a reason for it. It is called relevance to the topic. <br>
<br>
If the blastfurnace gets to be an OOT-section it will lose it value. To a certain extent it already has. I just hope moderators will get it back on track and either make an out-of-topic rant section or move the posts to a more relevant section.<br>
