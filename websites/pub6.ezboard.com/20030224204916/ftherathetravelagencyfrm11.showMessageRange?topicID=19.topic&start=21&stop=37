But even with a 9pm deadline, its still ambiguous whether or not BB assistance is required especially for guilds like us who cannot start weekday raids till 5/6pm PST.<br>
<br>
My problem is what constitutes a CLEAR need to call in BB? Sure its easy for the big guilds to say, they have all the experience behind them, but for the rest of us its only more confusion. Even at optimal conditions things can go haywire, and at a point where it looks like a guild can actually take down CT but something unexpected happens and they cant/dont. So id like to propose that there be 2 deadlines to avoid this from happening, not just one, and consider the 2nd deadline be an extension of the first provided it satisfies a certain condition. <br>
<br>
9PM DEADLINE<br>
- Guild has till 9PM PST to take down Draco and clear west wall at least to yellow tower. If guild fails to do this by 9pm pst, they must call bb<br>
<br>
- But If guild has achieved this then their last call for BB can maybe be extended to 11PM PST? Im asking for this extension because even if you achieve the above requirement - clear West wall and kill Draco, a lot of things can still happen and by giving a deadline of only 9pm gives no leeway for the guild for any unexpected errors or incidents should they decide not to call BB.<br>
<br>
11 PM DEADLINE (Extension)<br>
- If guild cannot clear to temple or is having difficulty by 11pm PST, which would be clear at this point in time, they should call in BB. And by doing so, BB time is extended to 4am PST. which gives 5 hours, ample time to clear considering the posting guild has already cleared to Yellow tower and taken draco down already. For the big guilds this is like starting the raid from the beginning but with half the work already done.<br>
<br>
Im just trying to figure out a way to reduce the number of bad calls that lesser inexperienced guilds would make and give them a clearer idea of their expected progress in the plane and present guidelines on when and under what conditions they should call BB. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufoladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>foladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/6/01 4:04:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Proposal: BB Guild Call in Time</span><hr size=1> nice idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujairnreiynon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jairn Reiy non</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dark Breed of Norrath</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/6/01 7:55:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Proposal: BB Guild Call in Time</span><hr size=1> Well some good ideas but lets get a few hammered out here.<br>
<br>
MFH, FR, BoTS, KEG what do you think of the 8pm PST call in?<br>
<br>
Need input guys.  Basically the 8pm PST call in would make the 4am rule un-needed.  We should start a new vote on the other proposals/ideas suggested here.<br>
<br>
The thing to avoid(Keep it Simple Stupid).  Is going past 2am at anytime would mean you have to start handing over the loot to the next posting entity/new rules blah blah.  That means worrying if they are up late at night.  If they can get there etc.  Its a pain and we should avoid it.  Sounds like a lee-way of 15 minutes would be acceptable?<br>
<br>
Lets end this post as it was originally for the call in time.  Lets hammer this out fast and move to the next issue.<br>

<br>
It was decided that the end time for a raid on any given day be 2am PST so it doesn't ruin the next days raid.  So basically what we're saying now is it's okay to ruin the next days raid if it means we get god loot.....does this sound bad to anyone else.<br>
<br>
As for knowing whether you can clear the plane or not at the start of a raid....no, I don't agree with this.  Things happen, especially in fear, when gods are up.  Also people have lives outside of EQ....What if you start out with 50+ people 10 or 15 of which are quite experienced, then in the middle to end of raid something happens and your numbers are cut in half due to time and you don't have an experienced puller or chanter, this isn't foreseen and it has happend.<br>

At most, by this time, they should be clearing the trash at CT's feet...and this would need to be coordinated with the next day's raid so that they know what to expect on repops.  Most times, server patches are made during the week, and usually, raids start in the evening.  Going over during the week shouldn't pose a problem...only the repops Fri-Sat would.<br>
<br>
As for the call-in time, the posting guild needs to do their best to adhere to whatever time is set; however, we all know that there will be extinuating circumstances in some cases.  I'd suggest that these be handled on a case-by-case basis. <p><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>

This isn't kindergarten, it's a game people play and *pay* their money to *Verant* to play, not the Rathe players.  You cannot &quot;take away their toys&quot; for 30 days.  Do you hear how that sounds?  Punishing paying players and not allowing them in a plane because *you* say so.  I'd advocate FFA before somebody &quot;suspends&quot; a players right to book a plane or whatnot. Yep you heard me. That would cause chaos. <br>
<br>
Seriously, the more &quot;rules and additions&quot; we tack on, is driving a lot of us nuts.  I can, at this point, totally understand Qwai's screams of FFA.  I don't want FFA, but I can understand why quite a few people do now after 2 months or more of this discussion.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of rules upon pointless rules, rules made up on the fly against certain guilds, proposal after fruitless proposal.  Yeah this is a whiny post, so sue me.<br>
<br>
My opinion is to just drop the BB altogether.  Planes have never been more problematic as they are now, and I blame that solely on the rule upon rule upon rule that we keep adding on.  The more rules we add on, the more problems we get.<br>

I agree with A....a BB guild should be called in at a reasonable time.  If A is followed B shouldn't come into play or that guild really shouldn't be considered a BB or &quot;Epic&quot; Guild.<br>
<br>
However, we all decided upon 2am PST for a reason, why change it just because a god is up.  I guess my attitude to the game is just that I personally will deal without having fat loot if it means the 40 or more people that are coming here tomorrow have more fun.  Afterall, Fun is why the 2am PST deadline was set in the first place.<br>

Also would like to ask one quick question.  Since everyone is complaining about no monitoring why not have the BB guild and the Raid guild contact an RTA admin by the 8 or 9 deadline saying &quot;Yea or Nay we need BB&quot; between 8 and 9 I'm sure we always have at least one RTA admin online, and they can keep track of who Did and who Didn't call the BB in.  Granted most of the BB guilds are probably doing it now just to cover their ass, but it couldn't hurt to make it law. <p><a href="http://www.ringofdragons.com"><img src="http://www.ionet.net/~sidhe/rod/sigs/dorasig.jpg"></a>
