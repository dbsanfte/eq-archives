<br>
Some &quot;local&quot; authorities perpetrated a heinous crime against someone, (in this case, ordering the gang rape of a child). The larger government authorities (Pakistan) arrested them for this crime against this person. Am I getting this right?<br>
<br>
How is this different from some &quot;local&quot; NYPD officers torturing someone (anal raping a man with a broken broomstick) and then being arrested by larger government authorities (internal affairs, state prosecuter, etc)?<br>
<br>
 The one BIG difference is this was a governing body NOT a few rogue cops.<br>
<br>
  One was a thought out public deliberated sentence, the other was a heinous crime comitted behind close doors<br>
<br>
The outrage comes from the fact that a Governing body of a sub-culture ( this isnt an insult it is a sub culute of the greater Pakastani culture) ORDERED. This wasnt a random act of violence by a few rogue cops.<br>
<br>
My outrage came from the INTENT of these subhumans ( and yes the NY cops who did this are also subhumans) that this was a deliberate pemeditated act that these filth encrusted flea bitten subhuman scum  to punish an individual by having his sister publicy gang raped..... sorry any culture ( or subculuture) that not only condones this but openly practices this is EVIL and needs to be wiped out as the Nazi &quot;culture&quot; was wiped out<br>

<br>
Still, the 'Rogue Cop(s)' did this in secret, knowing that if it was revealed they would be ruined [They knew it was wrong AND they thought they had the ability to get away with it]; The Council did this in public, without hiding and no thought that it was wrong [They did not know it was wrong OR they thought they had the authority to get away with being wrong].  <br>
<br>
The 'shocking' aspect of this situation is not WHAT was done (rape is everywhere, as has been pointed out), but WHY it was done (for someone elses activity), HOW it was done (Publically, with deliberation), and WHO did it (The defacto/appointed local government).<br>
<br>
Authority is abused, true.  Equating the abuse of some police officers [In secret, hidden] to the abuse of this council [In public, open] misses the issue completely.  Again, the difference is in motive and context, not the end result of rape and/or sodomy.<br>
<br>
I will accept this comparison when the NYPD Cheif announces, in advance, that they plan to sodomize someone in a public toilet to punish someone else for jaywalking on wall street.<br>
<br>
Further, Police are not a governing body.  They have authority to enforce laws, not make them.  Any 'street justice' they undertake is illegal and punishable, which is why it is done secretly.  Do not confuse 'Authority' with 'Governing'.  Do not confuse 'Breaking the Law' with 'Making the Law.'<br>

<br>
&quot;Please don't insult Barbarians, by comparing them to these..... things. They are not human. They are diseased and evil.&quot; - ShrikeAvatar<br>
<br>
&quot;Just another example of why we need another 40 days &amp; nights Flood.&quot; - Sandalorn<br>
<br>
&quot;Agree sandalorn... Earth needs the reset button pushed.&quot; - vyxn<br>
<br>
&quot;Judgement day comes for everyone, I can sleep at night knowing this.&quot; - Kit of VoLs<br>
<br>
Now, the first quote is what I was initially responding to. The others were quotes that led me to write the snide comment about religious people as it produced a viceral reaction in me regarding fundamentalists (i.e. NOT all religious people, i.e. NOT all christians). Now, its always possible that those that posted didn't mean what they said in the way I took them to mean, as I took them in the spirit of the allusions (saying, &quot;this is why we need another flood&quot; infers condemnation of the society under discussion as &quot;corrupt&quot; and &quot;fallen&quot; and as such is addressing not the individuals involved in this act, but their entire society).<br>
<br>
Now, maybe such a judgemental tone wasn't what was meant, and the thoughts were expressed in terms of &quot;people bad, correction of man's evils by God good&quot; type of thing, but what was said alludes to a much more serious expression of judgementalism regardless of the intent of the speaker. That is a problem with an internet message board like this where we only see the words. As best as I can put it in terms of an analogy, its like when a pee wee football coach calls the boys &quot;little girls&quot; as an *insult*. Perhaps the coach is only doing what they were taught, without the realization of the direct inference that by using &quot;little girls&quot; as an insult, they are perpetuating sexism and teaching the boys to view women with contempt as &quot;inferior&quot;. It probably never occurs to that coach what a causal effect of their usage of terms is. So maybe that's what was going on in those posts, people responding with cultural allusions and me taking the allusions at face value rather than what the individuals meant. If so, I apologize for being oversensitive, and beyond that, I do apologize for the vulgarity, as it was expressed in the heat of the moment and reactionary. However, I would like to point out that I did not continue in such a vein, and did not continue to post in such a vein. And those that have pointedly responded to *ME* have often been responding to things I never said, and that they assumed I said those things without reading my posts. This is the comment that &quot;started it all&quot; with reference to this issue:<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice to see the religious morons come out of the closet to make snide comments /snicker. Take a look at your own sects' histories rather than forgetting them with that bible shoved so far up your a$$.&quot; - Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
Now, after that viceral reaction, I laid out - without such rancor directed at religious individuals - several points:<br>
<br>
1. This act was terrible, wrong, and the individuals deserved to be punished<br>
2. These type of terrible crimes happen *everywhere* and have happened throughout time<br>
3. Various brutalities against women and children have been STATE SPONSERED in the past even in western nations<br>
4. There are specific cultural and historical reasons why such traditions persist in the badlands of tribal Afghanistan<br>
5. Rather than condemn an entire society as &quot;subhuman&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot; work to affect causal social change to prevent the continued persistence of these social traditions into the future<br>
<br>
Now, lets see what the responses were:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cliff's Notes on the above post:<br>

<br>
You could consider this a clear cut example of the stupidity some people have posted regarding me. The see the first two sentences, then make assumptions about what was said rather than read what was said. They assume &quot;I hate Christians&quot; and go on a tirade from that point without bothering to read what I said. First, I don't hate christians. Most of my family are christian, most of my friends are christian, I was raised in the middle of the Bible Belt, and I didn't go around burning down churches and whatnot. I hate what *some* christians *DO*, primarily fundamentalists and those that try and force their religious mores as state law. BTW, many stout christians aren't too fond of those kind of christians either. I asked what in my post was showing such &quot;ignorant judgementalism&quot; and never got a response. One can only hope the person went back and actually read my post critically with an eye to see what my points were.<br>
<br>
Now, lets see some of the reactions of other people (the kind of reactions I had assumed were going to be coming as soon as I saw this thread, and what I was responding to in the initial reply to the thread, that of the condemnation of this entire society on the basis of actions of some people and their traditional beliefs:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hell yes, I am better than them.&quot; &quot;In fact, I deem them unworthy of life, unworthy of any semblance of dignity.&quot; &quot;What if it happened to you?<br>
You'd be saying the same things they are. You'd be wishing their whole society wiped off the map for good.&quot; -Dalilah<br>
<br>
&quot;sorry Abaza I feel pretty good judging this one...<br>
judging a DISEASED SUBHUMAN culture that would permit this...&quot; - joekreeper1<br>
<br>
&quot;ANY culture that tolerates, accepts, and most of all encourages this type of act has demonized themselves.&quot; &quot;I don't want to take over these Pakistani tribes, or change them. If a culture condones activities of this nature, I want them wiped out. Closed minded? @#%$ RIGHT I am. There are no 2 sides to this.&quot; &quot;I don't initiate evil acts, I try to prevent them and when I fail, I must react to them. This behavior is not worthy of rehabilitation. It is worthy of execution.&quot; -Hutterr<br>
<br>
&quot;If you believe that the public gang rape of a 18 year old girl, because of the actions of her brother is wrong, you have every right to judge a whole people (in this case, a tribe).&quot; -Fethdar<br>
<br>
These are the types of thoughts I have wasted time out of my life to try and respond to, both reactionarily and proactively. There are causal factors for thy such traditions exist in these societies. Understanding the *WHY* can give us insight into how to effect change from within these societies. This statement does not &quot;condone&quot; or &quot;justify&quot; the act committed. I have continuously stated that the act was wrong, and I hope the people are punished for it. But hatred and reactionary calls for the &quot;wiping out&quot; of this society (and al the people therewithin), and calling the people within this society &quot;subhuman&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot; is disgusting. It is no different than any other type of racist reasoning for calling for genocide.<br>
<br>
For those that have continued to bash me for what they think I said, or what they think I meant, or whom they think I am, I suggest you go back and reread this thread and get a better perspective on what was actually said. I find it highly amusing to note some of the categories people have placed me in, considering some of my opinions on law and order. No one has ever called me liberal or a moral relativist or soft hearted or &quot;PC&quot; or any other such thing that I have ever met /chuckle.<br>

&quot;My outrage came from the INTENT of these subhumans ( and yes the NY cops who did this are also subhumans) that this was a deliberate pemeditated act that these filth encrusted flea bitten subhuman scum to punish an individual by having his sister publicy gang raped..... sorry any culture ( or subculuture) that not only condones this but openly practices this is EVIL and needs to be wiped out as the Nazi &quot;culture&quot; was wiped out&quot;<br>
<br>
Joe do me a favor, go look up some Nazi propoganda from WWII. As much as you bring up Nazis and how they were &quot;wiped out&quot; you really are starting to sound like one. The first step to commiting unthinkable atrocities to a fellow human is to start thinking of them as something less than human.   <p><CENTER>

Take a look at your own sects' histories rather than forgetting them with that bible shoved so far up your a$$.&quot; - Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
Now, after that viceral reaction, I laid out - without such rancor directed at religious individuals - several points:<br>
<br>
<br>
now WHY would anyone read further??????<br>
<br>
 Are you THAT socially retarded????? Do you just NOT get it are you that arrogant and stupid????<br>
<br>
This is like coming to a room where a dialogue is taking place  punching people in the face and screaming YOURE A BUNCH OF CHILD MOLESTERS then saying  “ come let us reason together”<br>
<br>
“You could consider this a clear cut example of the stupidity some people have posted regarding me. The see the first two sentences, then make assumptions about what was said rather than read what was said. They assume &quot;I hate Christians&quot; and go on a tirade from that point without bothering to read what I said. “- Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
<br>
GEE now why would anyone think you have a hatred for Christians buy reading YOUR WORDS? Again social retard<br>
<br>
“clear cut example of the stupidity some people have posted” - Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
again with name calling<br>
<br>
you’re missing the point Abaz people are blasting you for BEING AN ARROGANT SELF RIGHTEOUS LYING HYPOCRITE!!! <br>
<br>
Some examples:<br>
“and calling the people within this society &quot;subhuman&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot; is disgusting. “- Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
yet you say:<br>
<br>
“Believe the earth was created in 4004 BC in 7 days? Hell no. You are a f***ing moron.”<br>
<br>
“implying they believe in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement”<br>
<br>
so either :<br>
<br>
A: you believe its justified in labeling and condemning people for their beliefs as you’ve stated, and condemn people who do the same thing , This = Hypocrisy<br>
<br>
Or<br>
<br>
B: you  DON’T believe its justified to label people and condemn them for their beliefs and do it anyway<br>
This also = HYPOCRICY!!!!<br>
<br>
“I asked what in my post was showing such &quot;ignorant judgementalism&quot; and never got a response. “- Abazagaroth<br>
<br>
 Liar!!!! I’ve pointed it out NUMEROUS ( and most obnoxiously I might add) time where you’ve displayed this!!!<br>
<br>
“I do apologize for the vulgarity, as it was expressed in the heat of the moment and reactionary. However, I would like to point out that I did not continue in such a vein, and did not continue to post in such a vein.” <br>
<br>
Another lie!!!  Let’s use some examples of him continuing in this vein ( yes I know you’ve heard em all before) <br>
<br>
“Believe the earth was created in 4004 BC in 7 days? Hell no. You are a f***ing moron.”<br>
“implying they believe in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement”<br>
&quot;Creationists piss me off too much, and I prefer to not deal with NUTCASES on the web.&quot;<br>
<br>
When someone apologizes and uses the word “however or says “ Im sorry BUT……. They aren’t apologizing theyre trying to deflect anger  every letter you type digs your hole deeper and lets people see you as you truly are<br>
<br>
So in summation:<br>
<br>
1. You’re a religious bigot<br>
2. You’re a liar<br>
3. You’re a hypocrite<br>
4. You make insincere apologies trying to deflect anger<br>
5. You have limited social skills<br>
6. You’re arrogant<br>
7. You think YOU have the only correct world veiw<br>
8. You have limited reasoning capabilities or chose to ignore things<br>
9. You have microscopic genitals<br>

Ive prolly forgotten more about WW2 Nazi propaganda than most people will ever know.....<br>

I dont advocate wiping out the RACE  of people but the culture,<br>
the governing bodies, the THOUGHT PROCCESS AND BELIEF SYSTEM that allows something like this to occur<br>
<br>
unlike some people I openly Judge things and don't pretend to be &quot;enlightened&quot;  nor do i ascribe to Theories like &quot;ethnocentrism&quot; or existentialism&quot;<br>

Kel honestly im curious to know when would you think it's OK to condemn evil culture, and evil governments and call for their destruction?<br>
How should we have dealt with the Nazi's?<br>
Imperial Japan?<br>
Or Sadam ?<br>

I will not make any attempt to inflate myself, or my post, by using my superior linguistic skills to come across as more intelligent, or qualified, it only tends to anger others. <br>
<br>
In my moral opinion this was a heinous decision, perpetrated by a council of men, who abide by an archaic, and oftimes imoral set of laws. There is no excuse for the men who made the decision, or those who carried it out. Whether or not it says in the Koran that this is the way it should be, modern societies have come to a more enlightened stage of progression where they have realized that this is &quot;wrong&quot;. <br>
<br>
Calling these people inhumane, and subhuman is absolutely justified, although I would perhaps change the terminology. Inhumane, and Sub-persons, would perhaps be more correct. We can all agree that these are in fact humans, and they are no less developed biologically than we, however their progression as people is held back more than 1000 years. <br>
<br>
All major religions have had their periods of violence, the Jews when they left Egypt and shed blood to conquer the promised land, the Christians for a long stretch as soon as they took control of the Roman empire, and well into the early 1900's (although by this point it was fairly isolated as we know). The Buddhists, and the Shintoists, too had their bloody violent, uncivilized periods. What has happened though, is that linear progression has lead us to a point where we can set aside those historical flaws, and be good people. Civilization on earth as a whole has developed, and now we know these things to be wrong.<br>
<br>
What must be understood, is that for whatever reason, Muslim society has been 'stuck' in the past. They have not followed the same road as other religious cultures, and even in these days of globalization, this sect rejects modern thinking. Perhaps it is their large numbers that have allowed them to continue on this path of 'evil' or perhaps it is otherwise, I will not speculate. Their corrupt leadership, and religious leadership, denies them the proper education, and exposure to modern thought that would advance them along the path the rest of the world has taken. <br>
<br>
This is what has lead to the fanatacism we witnessed on 9/11. If you would like an excellent insight into this, and perhaps a view of the future.. read the Dune series of novels. Frank Herbert was way ahead of his time predicting the Jihad, and now it is coming to fruition. Perhaps the best analogy would be giving a monkey a rifle in a crowded city. He has the weapon, but he has no training, or education, and thus common sense, so he lacks in inhibition, and goes on a shooting spree in downtown Bigcity X. <br>
<br>
Basically what I am saying, is that these people are a product of their societies, and are not inherently evil, although they practice evil. Rather than wishing them exterminated, people should be more focused on A) Overthrowing the regimes, and religious leaders that make them this way, and B) educating the masses that they might better understand. <br>
<br>
So yes, this is a horrifying, abhorent occurance, but rather than harp on the past, dwell on the future. Rather than condemn these men, condemn the governments that sanction this, and that do worse themselves. Don't blame the soldier for the actions of his government, he only does as he is ordered. Similarly these people only do what is commonplace in their society. Is it wrong, yes, the key is getting these people to understand that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=629.topic&start=121&stop=126>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=629.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=629.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=629.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=629.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=629.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=629.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=629.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.107<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
