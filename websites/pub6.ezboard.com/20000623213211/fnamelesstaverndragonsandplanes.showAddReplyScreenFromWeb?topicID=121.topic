PoF</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">It was never solved IMO. FOW still wanted to do PoF and twisted Joorsh's Wordes around and made him look bad. And when we start doing our raid on PoF we got a cleric to the north wall and myself and 2 others loged out at the North wall. When i log back on i find a member from FOW pissing around there pulling FOW bodys to the North wall and he has the nerves to yell at ME in PoF witch Xinxi lake had posted about and made sure people KNEW we were going to try to do PoF this week. Also Lyion bud why were you so quick to put me on Ignore list? I gave you a tell saying Xinxi lake would still be going there and doing PoF you got mad at me and i told you to stop screwing with our wordes. You got even mader and said i have no say in what Xinxi lake does and said i was welcomed to your Ignore list?? What kinda crap is that? thats a bunch of BS IMO and if you tell your guild differont then there gone believe you cause i got 4 tells from differont people in your guild right after that complaining about me for swearing at you? Hrmm budy you got a problem and it isnt me. Also when we post for a planes next time i hope your guild isnt still doing a CR 24 hours after you left the zone cause thats just a piss off to see other people in a zone where they should not have been in the first place according to the 3 biger guilds rules am i right????. This isnt a flame Im just posting my thoughts on what went wrong. I do expect to be flamed by many in FoW from posting the truth on what happend now but i dont mind.<br>

Cya in happy happy land soon all<br>

I was not on earlier, so I don't know how things went down before I showed up, but this is what I understand of how things happened. I'll let Lyion speak on how all those arrangements happened. <br>
<br>
Where I came into this is as soon as I logged in I got asked in guild to help out with CR from some people who had died in fear earlier. (yes, I know, trying to do CR in a fully-spawned fear is something of an exercise in silliness) I get to the portal. Watch as several attempts are made by xinxi to get people to the north wall and camped. Finally, in one of the lulls, once we're sure things are clear, me, barfalo and aarae go in to try and ONLY retrieve the corpses in question. Barfalo leads off the mobs off, and aarae and I manage to get to the north wall and feign. We stay feigned as we watch a couple more attempted rushes. I stand, and apparently picked up some aggro on Cazic somehow, as the instant I stood I got DTed. Note that I had been talking to Joorsh pretty regularly during all this to find out status reports.<br>
<br>
Around now Aarae gets killed, as does Tilas, who's trying to rez me back in. I finally say to hell with it, and once I get word from Joorsh that everyone who made it to north wall is camped, and all feigners are dead, I head in. I make it to north wall in northwesternish area. I /quit to remove aggro. I sneak my way over to where my corpse is, among others without picking up any aggro. I proceed to loot my corpse and feign, after dragging 1 corpse also on the north wall into the immediate pile. During this entire time I keep checking /who to make sure I am the only PC in the zone. At no time was there ANYONE else in the /who list. I am still feigned, no mobs in the vicinity. Lynus then starts to log in so that he can rez tilas and aarae. While he's doing that, you log in and stand there. As you're standing there, the Glare Lord that roams near the north wall shows up, notices you and aggroes on you. You just stand there a bit before I say to move, since someone is logging in to rez, and if you just stand there, there'll be 2 deaths. You move a bit, lynus logs in, the GL finishes you off, it moves on it's patrol route, notices lynus, and despite me trying to draw it off at that point, lynus ends up dead too.<br>
<br>
About this time, I get a tell from you basically accusing me of training you. Excuse me, but I was the only person in the zone, you got aggroed by a roamer, and ultimately another guildmate ended up dead, which was bad for Xinxi too, as lynus, if he had lived, could've helped out reviving xinxi people too. So, far from what you accused me, the opposite ended up being the case. Also, I was in communication with Joorsh throughout this thing, and nothing I or the other FoW people who were there trying to get our guildmates' corpses did caused ANY xinxi deaths. I never DID get a chance to get any of the far outlying people's corpses, nor did I get the chance to drag any xinxi corpses to the wall, which I'd have been happy to do if asked. (I consider Joorsh a friend, and all he would've had to do is ask). I ended up getting a port out almost immediately after that, and never went back in.<br>
<br>
So, anyway, a few notes here. 1) You might want to communicate with Joorsh a bit more, as he knew what I was doing in there, and what was happening. 2) you might wish to confirm exactly what the situation is before you accuse someone (especially a monk) of causing trains. 3) You might try confirming if a camp spot that roaming mobs pass by is actually safe before logging in. 4) You should check on the facts of how the plane allocation actually was worked out before you accuse us of crashing an event.<br>

Lyion misunderstood what Joorsh had said, to the effect that we did not think you were doing Fear yesterday, so we began to park people in Fear at about 5pm EST. When Joorsh came online and spoke with Lyion, and let him know that you would be, we immediately cancelled our trip, despite having around 18 people already there, and 6 or 7 corpses with equipment in the zone.<br>
<br>
We were courteous, quick and polite beyond measure. The people we had sent in to die at the North Wall, obviously had to have their bodies dragged, which is why we had a rogue and a monk doing that when you went. We didnt kill a single mob, and we never asked to leave any groups in there with you.<br>
<br>
You say your post wasnt a flame, but it was.<br>
 <br>
Having read the FoW message board Ive now been told that not only were some of our members good enough to help you get your bodies to the north wall, but they died in the process.<br>
<br>
Now I dont want to be too blunt, but this whole argument is just a product of a misunderstanding. Lyion took Joorshs words in the wrong way and as soon as he was aware of his mistake we responded in the correct way.<br>
<br>
We cancelled a night in Fear when we fully intended to kill Cazic and draco again, and disappointed 40+ of our members for the SOLE AIM of being courteous to you.<br>
<br>
After we did this a couple of people were even good enough to assist you with the difficulties of your first ever break, bearing no ill will and losing XP for no personal gain. We certainly didnt OBSTRUCT you like you seem to be saying. In this respect I certainly do attempt and to turn things around and make you look bad - because in posting this ludicrous blinkered rubbish, YOU WERE.<br>

I said Xinxi Lake is still going to attempt PoF tonight he got mad and said i have no say in what Xinxi Lake does And said i was welcomed to his Ignore list. Is this commen curtisy?

For the record, Joorsh had told me Tuesday they didnt have the people to do it Wednesday. <br>
<br>
On Wednesday Aanowolf started flaming me out of the blue.<br>
I spoke with Joorsh and Ronstar, who were both polite and said they did indeed wish to do Fear.<br>
<br>
Rather than cause an issue, we ported out EVERYONE immediately so you could do Fear. <br>
<br>
4 hours later you were STILL in Sol B. So we headed BACK in to get 2 corpses, we had left so YOU could do the break.<br>
