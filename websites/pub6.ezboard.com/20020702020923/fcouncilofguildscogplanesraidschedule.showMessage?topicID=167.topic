<br>
    I would like to take time to introduce myself and to also introduce the guild of Circle Of Mist to everyone in Karana.<br>
<br>
    I am Mechy Himeros , a 57 Druid who has spent probably about 85 to 95 percent of my time soloing in the lands of Norrath. Some of the most grueling being when I soloed all of 51 in 12 hours outside karnors , all of 53 in 18 hours outside karnors , all of 55 in 28 hours in Burning Woods and recently all of 56 in about 4 days outside of Rygor Fort on Elites and the Chief where i pretty much gave away about 14 full suits of Rygor armor including the Necklaces and Orc fang earrings. Now I know alot of you know me and that I'm probably the most generous person in the game ever but I'm also the poorest druid at my level. I dont know how everyone feels about giving away say a k or 2 or some newbie or armor thats worth a few k but I've done it so often that its like second nature to me.  I'm one of the few people that enjoy sharing the wealth (so to speak) with anyone in need. I've also been known to pick up some level 5 newbie and go get em like 60 cb belts and pl him to like level 9 or so on them and then turn around and left him fight and pl him that way also for a few levels just to kinda give em a head start. If theres one thing i enjoy most about the game , Its helping others. I love doing quest of any sort and I love helping people with info on quest although I'm not as good with the info as some others in Karana. There once was a time back when i was in my 20's where I thought to myself that I would probably charge for TP's always to make cash cause I thought that it was my abilities of the class i chose that helped others benefit from reaching they're destinations in a timely manner but after about 10 or 15 TP's I soon realized that the money was really a kinda low thing to do because just as I once was letting them take advantage of myself being able to TP. In the same token I was taking advantage of them not being able to TP so it made me feel bad and I no longer do that nor will I ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
    I'm currently a huge fan of the big guilds like SF and Valoran and the like but in the same token I feel like if I ever got in one of those guilds (which I've taken some time and effort to do with no luck) that I would just be ANOTHER druid. Not Mechy. I did all this before I decided to get in a rather sufficiently lower level ranged guild than what I could get in. You may ask Why? Well it was simple. All these months of killing stuff and helping PLing people I did'nt hardly know. I grew to love that aspect of the game and the amount of gratitude you felt from someone when you helped them. So I figured.... Why not get in a guild that could use alot of help and put myself behind a rather large task. Which was to outfit the whole guild with at least one piece of what they would consider to be UBER armor and in the same token ask them if they could get me Swatches for my tailoring. Now , Some of them recieved Full sets of Rygor Armor and others only a few pieces. I gave my Wurmslayer away I had on my level 43 warrior ( Chutaka ) and i gave away a few other items on him that came from places such as Sebilis and Karnors that I picked up with Mechy over time. Now , During all this time of helping people and PLing I've also been doing pieces of my epic and I've gotten to a point where the only things left to fight are either in hard dungeons or they are against UBER Mobs's. So just as a side note , If I happen to need help from some of you to kill say the Cyclops in TD or the Seahorse in Kedge , if you would'nt mind helping me , Please send me a tell in the game so I can write down ya name and maybe we can do some things together and later on I can PL your alts some or whatever else you might need. The only thing I've ever wanted in this game is my epic and to help people. <br>
<br>
<br>
    Anyhow thats enough about myself and a little about me. Heres the guild............................<br>
<br>
<br>
    The Guild is Circle of Mist. Its ruffly 25 to 40 members strong and we have currently been in one CoG raid in the plane of Fear where only two members attended because we simply dont have alot of really high level people. Just myself and one other. I have a few friends that have joined. A level 50 Warrior named Chud who some of you might know from Dreamers and a level 44 Druid named Alator. I can tell you that in time more people from CoM would love to attend your Raids and I look forward to being there myself although sometimes I'm in the process of going to work when you start them but that dont matter. I'm a druid and once I get to work , I can do a port or two and be there in no time flat. CoM is mostly a very young guild though , we have people generally from the level 10 to level 35 range. We have several 40 to 45's and a few over 45. Our leader is Banuvien or Banuvein ,(cant remember which), and hes a hell of a leader. he dont have alot of time to be online but I will do my best along with the other officers to represent CoM as best as I can. The guild we have has been a real blast and I'm sure in time all of you will meet them. <br>
<br>
      On behalf of CoM and myself , I would like to extend a sincere greetings to all of you and I would like to thank all of you for letting us attend the Raid in Fear and the Raid coming up in Hate. Its been a pleasure to see something like this develope into such a loose organization thats more or less for the little people in the game that dont really see Planes raids or Dragons without being in UBER guilds. I would also like to extend a special thanks to Mattor who invited us in the last raid. Thx a ton man. I think Ham is doing a wonderful job on keeping this together and i look forward to meeting you as well sometime and if ya want just kick back and talk about stuff if ya are'nt real busy which i'm sure most of the time you are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Anyhow thanks again for a wonderful time online in EQ. I'll see you guys on the events =). Mechy out...........<br>
<br>

  If you need a TP or help with a special popped MoB.<br>
  Just hit me with a tell and if I can help I will.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right
