<br>
1.  All this thread proves is that is that whether the tactic was a sploit or not is debatable.  I personally don't think it was technically a sploit.<br>
<br>
2.  Regardless, the real issue here is whether the tactic was gimpy or not.  SoT is free to think it wasn't, just like a guy wearing a wife beater is free to think he looks good.  BotS, NB and others are free to think it was, and share in the laughs with Furor, Eternal Wrath and others.<br>
<br>
3. SoT should follow Dwayllyn's advice and not take it too seriously when everyone laughs at them.  It is just a game after all, yet SoT also seems to be spending an awful lot of bandwidth taking this matter seriously.<br>
<br>

The bashers or the bashees? Seems to me that someone that sits, and takes screenshots of another guild's raid, and then puts them on a Flame board either has too much time to spare, or cares too much about the doings of others.<br>
The seminal question, imho is... Why do you care how another guild kills a mob? Seriously, if it's an exploit, then Verant will deal with it. If it's not, applaud, and move on.. &quot;Gimpy tactics&quot; to me sounds like the cool kid on the block getting mad when the dork makes friends with people that only the cool kid should. Again, I will ask the question.. Why do you care? This thread was started by someone that took the time to spy on another guild.. To what end? To get SoT in trouble? To make others think that SoT isn't &quot;cool&quot;? Whatever.. Please tell me why it's important to you. That's the only answer that really matters. I am truly curious.<br>

We have the hero Sssorn , BOTS new spiritual leader , who came from a server far away to bring the local uber guild to a glorious conquest. Maybe at his home server when Sssorn breaks wind the pixelated mountains tremble and from his actions we can understand that this game means a lot or maybe everything to him. Welcome to The Rathe.<br>
At one time i thought that Sssorn was working for Verant , that would explain his ecstatic propaganda for the new Euro server<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm10.showMessage?topicID=855.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/ftherath...=855.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
or was there any other reasons for his actions ?<br>
<br>
maybe when he came to the Rathe he thought that his master plan will never be affected by any kind of competition from other guilds.  i know that BOTS stated many times that they don’t consider my guild as ‘competition’ however the fact that we can kill similar mobs thus bringing in the Rotation states otherwise. I understand that this can be frustrating and by all means feel free to try and humiliate us here or on other boards. <br>
Venting your frustration can be a healthy thing.<br>
<br>
One must admire BOTS  carefully planned response to our Yelinak killing : Fitten posting his question on the noows board a few minutes after the kill , waiting for the proper retort from his idols over there and then using his stacks of pics and diagrams and whatever from his spying sessions to try and  make a point that nobody over there actually cares about. And at the same time starting a similar thread on the RTA board to yet again start the flaming. I find this amusing coming from someone who blames us for spying on them.<br>
<br>
I can only imagine what will happen when we kill Aaryonar , besides Fitten having a stroke , and you do know that we are capable of killing him.<br>
<br>
Seems that the people at the noows board came to the intelligent conclusion that what BOTS were claiming had no merit. I knew it was just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
Also it’s interesting to see people like Falconus jumping in to yet again express his hatred to SOT. I think it’s time for him to schedule that surgery to remove his tongue from the Spider’s rectum.<br>
<br>
Btw whats the thing about us using ‘mage pets tanking’  ? saw something about this in previous posts.<br>
Being SOT’s first mage and a rather active one i’m really interested to know. Can you please ask your spies to post pics and strategy analysis because i find the idea kinda hilarious.<br>

I may add that I never liked SoT, so my statement isn't neutral)<br>
Reputation from training Tindi Losi while buffing up/fighting Zlandiclar, training RF while we were doing CR after a sad attempt on Klandicar (yes of course you did apologize and said it wasn't your intention), training RF in PoG, gimped bots in NToV, spying their tactics (can't confirm this though) etc etc..<br>
Did you really expect no one to care?<br>
After all these events of course you will have the server eyes on you and once you make another misstake they will be all over you trying to push you down the grave you've already dig. <br>
<br>
I bet if Tindi or NB would have done this no one would care, frankly I wouldn't care at all.<br>
You can kill Vindi with 12 people, you can kill Tormax with 30, you can kill Aayornar (typo?) whenever you want, and still you can't kill Yelinak in a fair fight?<br>
It's SoTs attitude that make people care. <br>
IMO SoT care about no one but theirselves (as a guild, but still there are some good lost souls in the guild) and they pretty much make sure everyone understand this.<br>
All this to blame on the clever morons of SoT<br>
<br>
The sad thing is that it's very clever morons that rule SoT. Without those clever morons SoT would be nothing but a giant killing guild that farm Kael for dwarf armor 4-5 hours a week.<br>
It's these clever morons that come up with this kind of tactic, it's these people that decide to train people every now and then and it's these people that decide to enter PoM<br>

No this thread is just standard RTA fare really.  SoT does something lame, someone from another guild posts about it so others can share in the laughs, and then SoT members post again and again and spend an exceedingly large amount of energy trying to explain how little they care, how sleepy they are, how stupid people are, how seriously people take things, how boring it is, how people are racists, and basically everything under the sun to try and deflect from the underlying comedy directed at them.<br>
<br>
This thread is classic EQ flame spin at its best.  If someone makes a post laughing at your guild, get as many of your friends together to puke on the post until it stinks so bad that no one knows what the thread was really about any more. <p>Seminal Monk<br>

One more time for those that saw it not.. Why do you care? How does this impact you personally? No one decides what is an exploit other than Verant, correct? What rationale justifies a person in wasting time watching someone else kill a mob? It's just stupid. There are no other words for it. <br>

<br>
<br>
It's called an opinion. <br>
<br>
I see it as an exploit. Someone else sees it as a gimp tactic.<br>
<br>
We're not members of a collective conscience, we can think for ourselves and form our own opinions over certain...... issues. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urarararara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaraRarara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 6:21:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: GG on Yelinak kill Spirit of Tunare</span><hr size=1> I dont come here often so I have alot to say, sorry in advance for the long post.<br>
<br>
The question being asked here is &quot;did SoT use an exploit to kill Yelinak&quot;<br>
We seem to have two camps formed so far on this.<br>
Sssorn doenst seem to think so, Emil does. Others are not sure or dont care and some had already made their minds up before the question was even asked.<br>
<br>
Sssorn says that &quot;the real issue here is whether the tactic was gimpy or not&quot;<br>
Well, this is a flame board, I guess you expect to find such questions here.<br>
As it was our first kill of this guy you can be sure the fight was messy and desperite and probably what some would call gimpy. Sure I'll admit that. In time, with practise and experience im sure we will get better and refine our strat. As you say our first Tormax we zerged him, most died, some several times, very gimpish but it got the job done. You have to start somewhere. Now after half a dozen Tormax's we can pull both his guards in 30 mins and kill him with the loss of just 1 or 2. You dont go from nothing to brilliant without making a few mistakes along the way. Im sure yelinak will be the same for us. Right now with only 1 DB wizard at the fight, this was the best we could do and I for one am rather proud that we managed to kill this old foe.  It was a fun fight enjoyed by all and was not trivial in any way as some may think. Although we attempted to minimialise his proc we didnt in any way negate it. I for one died becasue the knockback sent me sliding along the wall oor of the clerics.<br>
<br>
For Emil and his supporters on whether or not the tactic was an exploit or not I can't really say if it was or if it wasnt. Im not a VI employee so Im not in a position to make that call. But I did have a conversation with a VI employee after our 2nd attempt to try and find out more. <br>
<br>
That VI employee was our server GM, Vaylin, and I explained our strat to him in full. He quizzed me solid for 10-20 mins that day. And by the end of it he knew everything that had happened. You cant really leave anything out when quizzed by someone whos job it is to expose exploiters and even if I did want to, what whould then be the point of having the conversation with him in the first place.<br>
<br>
He explained to me that Yelinak isnt rooted, its that he has no pathing programmed and so any time he is moved from his original spot there is a chance he could poof. Whether he is moved as a course of the battle or by any other means, makes no difference. Its all about pathing and him poofing on us was just bad luck. <br>
<br>
I did ask him directly if it was ok to move Yelinak prior to the fight but as you would expect he wouldnt comit himself to a yes or no answer so at this time I dont have a screenshot to show you with the Veriant seal of aproval, sorry.<br>
<br>
What I do have is a clear concience knowing that I told the GM what we had done and what we intended to do and that he had no negative comments to make except for &quot;if you move him off his spot you run the risk that he may despawn&quot; I interpreted that as &quot;its ok to move him, but you do so at your own risk&quot;<br>
<br>
At the end of the conversation he wished us better luck next time and was sorry for our bad luck.<br>
<br>
I feel certain had he had any problems with our strategy he would have said so at the time and am confident that there is nothing wrong with our approach.<br>
