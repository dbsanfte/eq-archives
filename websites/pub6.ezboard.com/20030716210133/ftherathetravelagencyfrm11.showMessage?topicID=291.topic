<br>
That puts them after you guys in the rotation; I noticed however that the rotation indicated that you (Tindi) were up for him; if, for some reason there was confusion about who was up when AD killed the statue, let me know, and I will put them in their required spot so as not to skip you guys in the rotation. <br>
<br>
No worries either way, just want to make sure you get him if he's yours. <br>

<br>
CoN had entered Kael and had been massing up to do Vindi / Statue . AD came in and stated that they had spoken to NB / Tindi about getting the shot....<br>
<br>
We offered them statue and we'd take vindi..(we bit it this time due to a lagged heal..bleh).<br>
<br>
Anyway...AD was under the assumption that if the guild scheduled gives you the green light..its yours regardless of who is there at that time. I tried to explain to Extrafth that if you are not there at the time you ask permission, and another non rotation guild is there and ready...then the guild there gets the shot.<br>
<br>
In the end AD got the kill..and congrats on getting on rotation.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to clarify this though, since there seemed to be some confusion on the matter last eve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghalidsoulsaver>Ghalid Soulsaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/15/03 4:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Statue Rot</span><hr size=1> I do believe you are correct Karas.  Since there were two guilds not currently on the rotation then it would be a race or situation to be worked out between those two guilds.  A rotation guild giving a non rotation guild a shot at the rotation is just them saying &quot;We won't come gank him from you...have at it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Best respect for a situation like that I would think would be for the first guild to take their shot at Vindicator (CoN in this case).  If they succeeded they got Statue as well.  If they failed on Vindicator or even Statue, then I would see no real issue for the next guild (if they were currently in zone and ready to go) getting their shot.<br>

Good to know, though.<br>

We showed up, and CoN were in Left arena, I immediately started talking with Karas.  I understood that just cause a guild gives a shot that we don't have 100% clearance, was just the 2nd day in a row, we had asked permission and &quot;called off the wolves&quot; in a way, (aka TL and NB) who could have easily killed them with half the people it took us to do.  And was really bothering me, we gave no pressure at all, we zoned in to 16 CoN in zone, 30 minutes later we had 28 people and ready to pull vindi, but as per the conversation I didn't pull CoN still had 16 people in zone and no warriors.  But we waiting around for 2-3 hours for them to get setup and pull, offered any help with pulling, kept all their respawns killed to help them out.  They failed on Vindi, and 5 minutes later we pulled.  I felt really bad, but soon as they died, whole guild was like, they died it's our turn to try right?  So we pulled and killed, many things were said in ooc, lot of it not meant, I tried to shut my guild up, and karas his guild.<br>
<br>
From time we pulled vindi to time statue was dead was no more than 1 hour <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyways, was a fun night, thought I would share the story of the night, let Karas know I was not confused but rather sadened to see yet another day of calling off the wolves and seeing another guild in the zone ready to take the mobs out that we had asked the bigger guilds to back away from for the day for us to have a shot. <p>Extrafth Saliva<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> 65 Ikysaurus Monk<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=110448" target="top">Extrafth's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137290" target="top">Ralkeem's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And was really bothering me, we gave no pressure at all<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well...that's in the eye of the beholder...heh..when you are getting multiple tells from the guild asking you &quot;are you doing Vindi soon?&quot; or &quot;I have to call people overseas to log on so we can do this, and its getting expensive&quot;...or &quot;I'm so tired of calling ppl off only to find others here&quot; etc etc....I'd say that's pressure....<br>
<br>
Normally..If I zone in...see vindi up but hear &quot;We're going to be doing him&quot; from a guild that has 16 at least in zone, its safe to assume more would be on the way...so I leave.<br>
<br>
That is what, from my standpoint, upset me at the time. Sure...there are races to mobs...but these days for mobs like statue / vindi...its not like that. Most will either say &quot;shoot me a tell if you cant take him&quot; or the like.<br>
<br>
<br>
Regardless, whats done is done....we'll have a shot again someday soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=291.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=291.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=291.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.threadControl?topicID=291.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=291.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=291.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11>Guild Representatives Forum</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
