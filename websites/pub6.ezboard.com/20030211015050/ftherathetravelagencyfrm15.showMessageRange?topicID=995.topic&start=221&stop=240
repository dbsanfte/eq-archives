<br>
No, I think it's just a little bit of confusion maybe.  The fact that someone in our raid had mentioned that we were heading to forest earlier and we actually were sitting at the waterfall.  She had been with us before to pull Strong and we pulled to the ocean that time.  So, it's easy to see where that confusion might set in.  Since we were in some forest at the time and we couldn't see any ocean front.<br>

<br>
The above quote is from Kits 1st post, 1st message, 1st sentence, which started this whole thread.  Now if you are going to dish it be bitch enough to take it!  You call Kuras a motherfucker??  Accept the return volley of flames and stop your whining!!!!!!!  This is &quot;FLAME CENTRAL.&quot;  Kit you are not perfect and what you THINK you know is not necessarily the actually FACTS.<br>
<br>
I talked to Rikko in game and he said he did NOT train ED.  Personally, I believe him.  I haven't seen any proof in this thread that he did any such thing.  Rikko does indeeed have mad skills and if it is VoLS decision to have him pulled nameds in PoS so be it.  However, it IS easier to pull and split them with FD pullers.  Try it sometime, that's what this game is about.  Trying things to see what works well.  Hell, might even try having an enchanter pull nameds in PoS.  Oh wait!  Done that, right Rikko? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Bitching about camps?  VoLS AND ED, wait until you get into BoT and have to put up with the likes of BoTS members in there.  I'm not going to comment here, I'll leave the enjoyment of that experience for when you get flagged for BoTS.  Ask Rikko, he knows the shiznit in BoT.  If anyone wants help getting flagged (for PoV/PoS or BoT) from any guild (VoLS or ED or anyone else), I'm there to help you out.<br>
<br>
Only thing I see Kuras did was THREATEN to train you.  A THREAT and the actual ACT of doing it are different things.  I've read through the entire 11 pages of posts and looked at all the screenshots, examined all the logs, and still can't see where there is one shred of proof that Kuras actually trained you.  Kuras is one of the best players in the game.  I'm not talking about just his skills and sheer knowledge of the high end game either.  He IS a nice guy, helpful, and considerate.  If you think different then you haven't grouped with him or spent some time talking to him.<br>
<br>
I wasn't at PoS for this particular raid so I am not going to try and say who did what.  If you were there, then there's a 99.999% chance you don't even know what happened either (at least not the full story).  There have been so many contradictions from people that were actually there (on both sides of this argument) it's laughable.<br>
<br>
If it was taking you guys 3 hours to pull the named ocean giant, then that's sad.  It shouldn't take you guys that long.  Courtesy (which many of you are professing to possess) would dictate that you let someone else try him.  He'll respawn!!  Oh, and pull from the ocean, not way over by the waterfall (use that advice on future pulls, it might save you some time and several CR's. It might even save a flame thread on the RTA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Someone wanted to quote me about Kuras training his own guild, and then interject their opinion as being my own that I might be proud of that.  IT WAS A FRIGGIN' JOKE!  Watch some sitcoms, read a nice humor book (Tim Allen's books are great), or even read your Sunday comics.  The concept of humor should come back to you.<br>
<br>
All the screenshots and arguments about who was where and which ranger was where and where a giant was loooking... OMFG!!!  Nobody knows dick about what happened!  However, here's a hypothetical (emphasizing hypothetical):  A ranger trains a bunch of giants to a camp (yes I said a CAMP) of some really nice group of people that have come together and formed a guild.  This ranger has proximity agro so these giants agro on other players already engaged in fighting.  Said ranger decides to TURN AROUND to witness the mass carnage caused by his 1337 training skills.  Someone takes a screenshot.  Wow, we have a ranger where the mobs AREN'T behind him (such obvious proof that the ranger in fact DID NOT train the nice guild).  You don't like my hypothetical series of actions?  Post your own hypothetical.  What does it prove? JACK SHIT, that's what.  What did my hypothetical prove? JACK SHIT, that's what.  Use some common sense and stop blindly defending your own guild.  That goes for both VoLS and ED.<br>
<br>
Now to those of you that want to attack my entire guild?  STOP IT!!  You WILL piss me off.  Was there some immature posts for (and on behalf of) ED?  Uhm, yeah.  But you better reread your own posts.  There were plenty of stupid and immature posts on both sides.  You think I'm a shitstain because I'm in ED (and will remain in ED) as well as supporting my officers and my fellow guild members?  Fine, that's your opinion.  Now have the balls (or falopian tubes) to come up to me in game and tell me that.<br>

<br>
... I wasn't on the raid, but I was in /tells with a VoLs member at the time this occurred and you know what? My conversation was halted big time while I listened to a rant about ED and their ks-ing and train threatening.  <br>
<br>
Then I log on here because, well, I'll admit it, this place is the best soap opera in the world and I LOVE IT!  <br>
<br>
And lo! and behold, what do I see? A VoLS member (not the one I was talking to at the time) giving EXACTLY the same story as the one I got on the day.  Wow, I think... guess it must be true.<br>
<br>
But like the good girl I try to be, I wait to see the other side of the story... does it come? Nope. What comes is 12 pages of drivel (every word of which I have read - please note my above comment about loving this board) which pretty much adds up to ED confirming for me the fact that my first thought was the right thought. They did it and they're too gutless to admit it.<br>
<br>
I hate to see guilds like ED, hell, any guild, shoot themselves in the head like this... what I hate even more are guild leaders/officers making their guild look like total and utter dipshits while the truth is, most of their members probably don't even know this thread exists.  <br>
<br>
What I REALLY hate is people who sprout bullshit and expect us to believe it's roses.<br>
<br>
Sorry, ED, you really haven't done yourselves any favours here. Right or wrong, you've carried on like morons, providing nothing of worth other than an occasional giggle at your stupidity.  What's worse, you've shown yourselves to be inarticulate fools who believe saying &quot;fucK' in cap locks is the height of wit and that &quot;white trash&quot; comments will make people go and throw themselves off buildings.<br>
<br>
WTG, ED... mission accomplished. I think you've proved VoLS' point better than any screenshot or log could ever do. Hope it was worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mareenadeviant>Mareena Deviant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/20/03 9:22:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=995.topic&index=224>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Disclaimer</span><hr size=1> &quot;Inarticulate&quot; comments not directed at those who have managed to string 2 words together, but rather at the ones who fail to understand that their points are much better made if they actually appear in a language others can understand  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kluztzul>KluzTZul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows- 3 years of FS!</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/20/03 10:29:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=995.topic&index=225>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kuras the retard</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To Leth, Travaill, Klutz, etc, etc:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I would rather all of you forget the whole incident so we can all go back to playing the game in a friendly fashion. I would like to think we can all zone into a place and see either ED or VoLS members there and know that neither will hold a grudge.<br>
Otherwise I will play in fear of being trained simply because I wear a guild tag.<br>
Enough of this posturing and BS.<br>
<br>
The truth is the people involved each know what they think happened. I was there, but I am certainly not going to get into a bitch contest over this event as honestly only Rikko and Kuras know exactly what happened.<br>
That many of you here choose to not recognize a called camp is your own business. Let it be known if you so choose to play that way dont bitch in the future if someone pulls the named you spent &quot;camping&quot; for hours. I dont claim to know what happened in this event except by hearing what I heard in Tells, guildchat and OOC ( since I was there ) and by reading through all this drivel that explains nothing. Each participant has their own idea of what happened, leave it at that and move on. Bitching here isnt going to change anything.<br>

I stopped reading this post since the first sentence of your side of the story is a complete lie.

<br>
As noted in my logs, there were conversations before and during the entire event. And that conversation I tried to keep calm and civilized.  The fact that Kuras resorted to lowering himself a bit lower in the cess-pool of Norrath is on him.  The only reason I posted any logs at all was because nobody else seemed to be able to come up with some hard evidence in either direction.  The logs indicate all channels.  These flames were never directed towards ED as far as I could tell, not by me anyway.  <br>
<br>
Kuras, I'm sure your a outstanding person on a day to day basis, but to me this action just shows what your capable of.  And your personal attacks on Kitcha for bringing the truth of the incident to the boards seems a bit childish. <br>
<br>
Again, read the logs, they are what happened as it went down.  <br>

Sounds as though the pulls were crossing and becoming confused. That happens in a lot of zones.<br>

It also appears that the GLs of both guilds were already involved and trying to sort this out.<br>

So Kit bringing it to the flame board before her GL could work it out seems out of line. And the responses to her pre-emptive flame have been out of line.<br>

I think my GL sending thier GL tells for 30 minutes until it finally had to be /ooc'd that thier GL would not respond to tells to get him to even talk to our GL says that we tried and they brushed us off.<br>
<br>
If you want childish, how about the fact that our GL went over to thier camp and was told she was ugly and to go away.  LOL.  Pretty funny huh?<br>
<br>
It still doesn't change the fact that they decided to take over an established camp without doing a camp check, tried to train us, then picked our named off our puller and trained themselves in the process and came back screaming we trained them.<br>
<br>
My bringing it to the flame board is about as out of line as the high horse your sitting on.  That's why the flame boards are here.  If you don't agree with flaming then stick to general.  I had every right to flame them, what they did was and is  wrong.  <br>
<br>
We got to keep our camp, we got the kill, we got the drop.  Why then come here and flame them you ask?  Because I was mad as hell at what they attemped to do, laughing in our faces the entire time they tried doing it.  They want to go around and disrepect camps and rules then they can expect to be dragged through the mud here as a warning for all others.<br>

If you'll had used the time you've spent with point and counter-point and posting false logs and pictures proving the opposite of what you're saying and posting pictures of kuras whining about the pacifier in his ass (that was hillarious btw) ya'll couldn't gotten at least a level or two and a handfull of AA's.  Is it really worth all this just to hear some guy you consider a dickhead say &quot;My bad.&quot;?<br>
<br>
It's not like you're fighting for your guild's rep, either.  Everyone involved looks stupid.  Even people like me, who waded into this stupid thread, looked at all the stupid people, and said &quot;God DAMN you fuckers are stupid,&quot; look stupid for just being a part of this stupid thread.<br>
<br>
...don't listen to me though- I don't even know what you're arguing about, short of &quot;boo hoo, the guy who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>isn't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the little red circle trained me,&quot; because most of this thread is completely fucking incomprehensible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
