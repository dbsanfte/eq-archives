For some people, it apparently gives them the impression they can walk around like the top fly on the shit pile of life.  Arrogance, my friends ...that is the topic for the day.<br>
<br>
The Old and the Rest of us:  Congratulations on getting level 61+.  Seriously, I mean that.  You should be proud ...proud, but not arrogant.  Do not let the very fact that you are 61+ distort your view of yourself, the world around you, or your place in the world.  You weren't the first, you aren't the last ...there is absolutely nothing uniquely identifying you from anyone else who is 61+ that didn't exist when you were a rank amateur trying to find your dick to piss with at level 1.  Now that you have hung onto the scrotum sack of your guild long enough to achieve some semblence of identity, or have played with yourself for so long you've perfected masturbation into an art form, you somehow believe you are beyond reproach and are higher on the food chain than God. I cannot stress enough how wrong you are.  Everyone below your astute level does not worship the ground you walk on.  <br>
<br>
Someone once gave you the time to educate and assist you in your climb to royal assdom, they didn't call you a 'newb' just because you asked a simple question, they might have even helped you with little or no regard to their own benefit.  You weren't born with the inherent knowledge of every spawn time, mob strength, mob path, or bug \ exploit in Everquest.  Someone taught you, someone helped you along the way and you have apparently forgotten ...there is no 'i' in 'game', but there is a 'u' in 'fuck you'.  <br>
<br>
It's been said time and time again that any no-brain-dumb-fuck can get to level 65 these days ...and looking at you, I believe it.  Climb the hell down off of your high-horse, or pull your head out of its ass.  There is ZERO reason for you to believe you are better than anyone else, except to show how much of a real life ignorant, self-centered loser you are.  Please do the world a favor and have a fatal seizure or blow a brain cell or something.<br>

Your ignorance disturbs me. Humans play this game. Blaming a level is like blaming a car instead of a driver in a car accident. If a brand new level one were to swap positions with me, swap my time played for theirs, swap my experience and skill for theirs, it would still be their personality that made decisions - not their level. The human behind the character making choices.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what spurred this rant but comments like that makes me wince. Did pride and arrogance suddenly appear when the Internet came out? Funny, pride and arrogance were key themes in The Illiad, circa 2000 BC. Humans have been victims of human nature for as long as man as a race can remember. All you can do is try to appeal to the better side of people - and diatribes like this aren't exactly appealing. Mainly appalling. You need a hand, ask for it. You want a favor, ask for it. Someone gives you a hard time, vent to a friend. But why come to the flame board on one of the older and more established servers where the average level is very high, and rant about high levels? Particularly when your rant includes a statement that says their accomplishments do not matter in the slightest, when your rant's subject matter is that you have a problem with those accomplishments?<br>

Pride, yes ...definitely ...you should have pride in your accomplishments.  ARROGANCE is the topic, not PRIDE.  Two different words, two different meanings.  Now, I personally don't know Michael Jordan or Bill Gates and there is no question that both are richer and more talented than most people on the face of the planet.  The real question is, are they ARROGANT?  I don't know.  There are rich, talented people in this game ...proud people ...but they aren't arrogant pricks.  It's the arrogance I'm calling out ...not the talent, or the riches.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If a brand new level one were to swap positions with me, swap my time played for theirs, swap my experience and skill for theirs, it would still be their personality that made decisions - not their level. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is so much bullshit, you must have acres of the stuff lying around for situational use.  If you put a level one person who hasn't played a single minute of the game into a level 60+ toon, that person will believe he's played for years within a matter of hours.  He will believe he is better than everyone else lower level than him simply because of his level.  There is no pride there ...he didn't earn those levels himself ...it's all arrogance, plain and simple.  Ever heard of EBAY??  I can guarantee you this test scenario would prove me right 7 times out of 10.<br>
<br>
You cannot tell me that a person's level does not have to do with the value they place on other people.  How many times have your heard someone level 60+ call someone level 50+ a 'newb'?  Level 50??  I don't even bother asking any questions anymore in a zone I'm unfamiliar with.  Sure, SOME of it is individual personality ...certainly if they are arrogant in RL, they are sure to be in game as well, but a lot of it is due to the fact that a level 61 feels some kind of 'power' knowing that pretty much every thing outside of PoP is trivial to them.<br>
<br>
You are assuming I am calling every single level 65 arrogant.  That is as far from the truth as possible ...but arrogance does, in my experience and observation, directly correspond with the higher level ...either because they ARE higher level, or they are a lower level twink with a higher level main.  Although it is possible that they exist, I have yet to meet a new (never played before) level 30 who literally believes themself above other people in their level range.  I know a lot of very nice level 60+ people ...I also know of more than a few (entire guilds, in fact) who wouldn't give any one below level 59 the time of freaking day.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm not sure what spurred this rant ...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Take a look at any discussion on this forum about flags recently?  I simply cannot believe that some people literally do not want anyone else to be flagged for tier 3 and tier 4 zones because they are afraid of what those zones might turn into.  Does that not scream arrogance and elitism to anyone else other than me?  How about any conversation regarding the new researchable spells up to level 60?  There are those who believe this is a BAD THING because, well ...they want to be one of the few people with that previously rare spell.  Follow any topic regarding parchments and runes ...same thing, people seriously believe themselves better and 'more worthy' of getting spells and a full spell book than the other 99% of the entire server to the point where they would be completely happy cutting off that content to those people.  That is arrogance, in my mind.<br>

Now, tell me again what part of that accomplishment makes you better than everyone else?<br>
<br>
My rant is aimed directly at those people who are arrogant, elitist pricks.  No one event or incident spawned its creation ...just a lurker's belief that some people, certain people, need to step the hell off and get over themselves a little bit.  It's a game ...whatever you have done, whatever you think you have 'accomplished' ...you need to remember that you play with other people, not pixels.  <br>

They may come across incorrectly as snobs when in fact, they are too busy being dazzled by a particle of dust that just floated by, fascinating them to the point of distraction, and noncommunication.<br>

<br>
Couple questions for you: If any dumb fuck (as you put it) can get level 65 then why arn't you?<br>
<br>
If you asked a question and someone shot you down, well, welcome to the club. Those before you asked dumb questions, made mistakes, and they got back up and carried on without flaming everyone who is 61+ for being arrogant masturbating bastards. <br>
<br>
Really whats the point to your complaint?<br>
<br>
You asked a newbie question and someone called you a newb? Well you apparently ARE a newb... is that something to take offense too? no.<br>
<br>
Now if you have been a long time player and asked a newb question then maybe there is something to be offended over.<br>

Trying playing this game for 4+ years  and spending time in zones like oasis(yippie alway kiting the sgs down the beach) solb, kanors castle, and in todays times BoT.  Now replace all those mobs with 250+dps  mobs being trianed around. You might then see the point of wanting to keep some order in certain zones. Its bad enough now with some of the zones where you got people kiting mobs in graveyards and like the other day a druid kiting a mob in hoh decided to root it right on the zone portal. Thats plain stupid and that person has no reason being in a zone like HoH pulling dumb stunts like that, let alone getting access to higher tier zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ssarvhok>Ssarvhok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/25/03 2:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1065.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  mhmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whoosh, you missed the point entirely.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Actually, I was trying to figure out what you were getting at. You made it clear with the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Take a look at any discussion on this forum about flags recently? I simply cannot believe that some people literally do not want anyone else to be flagged for tier 3 and tier 4 zones because they are afraid of what those zones might turn into. Does that not scream arrogance and elitism to anyone else other than me? How about any conversation regarding the new researchable spells up to level 60? There are those who believe this is a BAD THING because, well ...they want to be one of the few people with that previously rare spell. Follow any topic regarding parchments and runes ...same thing, people seriously believe themselves better and 'more worthy' of getting spells and a full spell book than the other 99% of the entire server to the point where they would be completely happy cutting off that content to those people. That is arrogance, in my mind.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, pretty much, there you have it - human nature. That's not elitism, that's basic human nature. I spent six years figuring out how to make this farm produce food - now you move in next to me and want to know how I got my crops to grow from this crappy soil. I could tell you, but is it in my best interest? It certainly is in YOUR best interest, but is it in MY best interest? Another farm means another competitor. A neighbour means a chance of your herding animals breaking out and 'accidentally' getting loose in my crops. Strange men eying my wife. My daughter. These are at the back of anyone's mind - is it in MY best interest? The simple answer is no. I have a farm and it's running well, I don't want anyone moving in next to me and disrupting it, especially with the catastrophes they can bring purposefully or accidentally. They might help me during flood or famine, but I've done pretty well on my own till now, they can go it on their own just like I did, and if they fail where I succeeded and have to move back to where they came from, then I suppose they didn't make the cut. Now, is that ELITISM? <br>
<br>
Why do you hear &quot;We're better than you&quot; when it is said &quot;We put our time in learning it, you can do the same. We put our effort in killing it, you can do the same. If you can't cut it like we did, then that's life - try again next month.&quot; ?<br>
<br>
That's what I hear when I read those threads. The thought of teaming disturbs some higher level players because they put in their time as a team to defeat the mobs blocking entry to those zones (which you still can quest a key for) and they see people attempting a multi-guild zerg - killing beyond their means. Getting access to places they couldn't access without help. Getting spells in days that took them MONTHS to camp. Finding that the merit that they've shown overcoming obstancles is diminished by cheap tactics (zerg!) or fixes Verant made that trivialized months of their hard work.<br>
<br>
I don't neccessarily agree with them, but I can see their point of view, and I don't find it elitist, I find it to be natural human behavior. <br>

To make matters worse, the gods have decided that there was entirely too many crops so the land will only produce half as much crop from either of our farms now, basically giving us a quarter of the crops as what you had when you got here.  Since you've been given almost unlimited access to this really crappy soil for so long, you have now figured out a way to make new soil on another farm and can bring that technology back to your old farm to grow more and more crops (because we both know you would be stupid to completely abandon your old farm, right?).<br>
<br>
Yeah, I can see where a second farm would be the biggest of your troubles and the best thing that can be done is to keep that second farm from 'disrupting' your farm.<br>

Most people's goal is to simply have fun with EQ even though there is no end, so in effect, the joke isn't on them. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I get bored and make new characters because exp at high level is a pain but if I stuck with one character I would have been 65th a few months ago but no matter what level I am I have fun playing. <br>
<br>
I get bored with the &quot;End Boss&quot; syndrome of other games myself. When you defeat him, its like you don't want to play anymore because it is over with now. The final chapter is solved. It gets stale beating the same game over and over again.... I couldn't count how many times I beat Final Fantasy part 1 over and over and over till my brain rotted. I could write maps for that damn game.<br>
