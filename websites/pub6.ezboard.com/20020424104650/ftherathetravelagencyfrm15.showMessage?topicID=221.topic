I have been playing for over a year and have grouped with quite a few from this guild at different times and with different characters and had never had a bad experience with them until now.When I asked her why she ksed she replied that she had been expecting an invite. So I invite her into the group to discuss the matter. I asked for the BE  that Fibrand dropped and was told one of her guildmates may need it. After about 8-10 minutes she asks  who wanted the BE? I replied that I did, and she said&quot; the guild told me to roll you for it &quot;. To which I replied ....And I am asking that you give it to me because I pulled him and was fighting him. There was silence for about 2 minutes then she left the group invised herself and ran off.I sent a tell and got no reply . I had to log  for a short time  when I returned  a friend who was with me at the Fort earlier said that she had spoken with Mudder and that Jasmanna was told to  return the BE to me as it was the right thing to do. Again I sent a tell to Jasmanna ...no reply.I kept trying and after  an hour or so of sending a random &quot;hello there&quot; got the message she was not online.  Monday I log in and see her on so I send a tell ..still no reply. I had some others send her tells and they were getting an afk message which I was not so I am assuming that she had me on /ignore as well as a couple others who were with me that day. When  my guildmates contacted her  she would reply until the issue of the BE was brought up then they were ignored. I have not been able to reach Roggulbuk or Mudder personally yet to discuss this. We did talk with Trolo Monday night and explained we were all being ignored so asked if he could send  her a tell. Apparently she told him that noone had contacted her about it. It is very hard to communicate with someone who has you on ignore(this is a fact). I have never posted here before, but have never met the kind of individual who can just KS   Ignore the group they Ksed from  and from what I understand not comply with her guildleaders  wishes and act as though she had done nothing wrong .Although I am curious of the guildmates she spoke to Sunday who instructed her to roll me for the item after Ksing it  from me, I do not hold the guild responsible.  One or a few people  should not determine how a guild is looked  upon although it definitely reflects back onto them. As I wrote earlier I have had alot of fun with other members in the past . I simply want to point out an individual who has shown me she has no spine and no honor and happens to be wearing a (Clan Bashemded) guild tag. Please be aware of her actions. I may someday come across another BE but it is the principle of the whole thing that bothers me the most.

Doing just fine, Chief Ry'gorr pops and we decide that we can take him.  Long story short, with some difficulty we finally killed the Chief.  Three avengers spawned and charged.  Right away miss Thang runs to the corpse, loots the battlemail, and goes LD far away from the fort and avengers.  An hour or so later thinking that we forgot about her she logged back on. We all attempted to send her tells, and just like Axe she ignored us.  Maybe she was just afk? No.  Tried to contact her about it several times over a week.<br><br>Clan Bashemded....you need to fix this Bitch.  I was at the orc fort about 14 levels ago...3 or 4 months ago.  Apparently she is STILL doing this, and it's quite obvious that this is intentional.  I have no beef with your guild, but keeping this PoS on your roster leaves a bad impression of your guild on me.  On others too, I'm sure.

It surprised the hell out of me when I read this post because it happened to me several months ago.  She did to Axetare what she did to my group almost word for word...cept she didn't even say anything to us.  To do this once is acceptable, I'll just call you a 'dick' and move on.

Mudder also recieved assurances that the item would be given up in any regard, to pacify the offended party. That was the last we, as officers, heard about it until now. <br><br>I tell you this so you can understand why more direct, and involved action wasn't taken. We were under the impression that the matter was resolved, or was going to be with due haste. <br><br>Clan Bashemded does not have high standards for membership. We believe that everyone deserves a chance, to see what they are like. But mark my words, we have DAMN high standards for remaining a member, and this incident, especially with the followup remarks here, breaks that standard. <br><br>I don't like to have to apologize for members of the guild whose tag I fly proudly.
