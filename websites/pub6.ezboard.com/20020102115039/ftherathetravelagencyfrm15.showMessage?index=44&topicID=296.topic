Fact Doz was rooted at one point.<br>
Fact Doz was unrooted because of certain sploits and gimp tactics that trivalized the fight.<br>
Fact if SOT used gimp/Sploit tactics(wich in my personal interpertation of the rules as i have seen them used I would agree it could be considered a exploit) there will be a response from verant in one of a few forms<br>
Either <br>
A. Yel will be unrooted<br>
B. He will be made immune to knock back spells or things like BFG<br>
C.SOT will be reprimanded in some fashion or way for continued use of such then one or both of the above will happen.<br>
D. Verant quit giveing a flying $%^ about this stuff and will let it go. <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Vincecross Dhark'baen 57 Necromancer <br>Vincecrs Dhark'baen 51 Warrior<br>

<br>
 as for the rest of you not even on the same faction as we are *bots/sot* , you can reply and keep up your fantastic @#%$ bitching or you might want to take the dildo outta your asses and put it in your mouths so you could stfu, eh? no ? yes ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upahraith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pahraith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/17/01 2:42:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: GG on Yelinak kill Spirit of Tunare</span><hr size=1> Question.. Mebbe you can call me a noob.. I'm newly lvl 59, and still don't have uber gear other than my Ragebringer.. &lt;and according to some, it's still not as good as I can get&gt; But, why does anyone really, truly care? Why waste your time watching another guild fight a mob? How do you, personally, benefit from doing so? If it's an exploit, then Verant will deal with it.. If it's not, then hurrah.. The idea of using the valuable play-time I have to &quot;spy&quot; on another guild is abhorrent to me.. Why not spend your time doing things for your own guild, or trying to better your own toon? I have some good friends in BotS, and I am currently a probationary member of SoT.. I am biased on the side of SoT, but still wish for the respect of my friends that happen to be BotS members. That being said, this is the silliest @#%$ post since the &quot;so-called Euro time advantage&quot; I live in Texas, but work nights, so SoT's time frame fits me perfectly. I've been on more raids, and seen more new things in-game in the past 2 weeks than I ever have. <br>
So, to tie this all up, I'm afraid I must repeat myself. Why do you care? What good does bashing another guild do other than trying to puff yourselves up? And, if you need to blow your chest out in a manner such as this, then you're not as self-respecting as I thought BotS was. If this is an attempt to reveal the use of an exploit, why not just petition, and be done with it? You're making asses of yourselves, and you don't seem to care. I'm not sure that would make me feel very self-confident. <br>

I'm laughing so hard. I have a question. What are you prepared to do about it? You seem to have put a lot of thought into what SoT did. What are you going to do now hall monitor? You think that disbanding SoT is going to happen over this? Think again pal. <br>
<br>
  You think anyone in SoT cares about what they say on the Noows message board? Those guilds have jack to do with The Rathe. Sooner or later SoT is going to be killing a majority of the mobs on The Rathe. Consider yourself lucky that most are on some type of rotation. Or they would leave you logging on to playing your twinks and sitting around thinking about killing some mobs. Tell you what less complaining about SoT and sit back and see if your emails get the one thing your dreaming of the most which more than likely is the disbanding of SoT.<br>
Which BoTs seems to be one up on them anyways. <br>
<br>
  Sssorn consider yourself lucky to even use bandwidth on this old duct taped server we call home. Fitten your a troll , a fairly intelligent troll but a troll none the less. Emil is the only person that comes here with some sort of topic that you can actually consider a point. He always makes quality arguments and statements to back his views. You people are  lucky to have him in your guild. The rest of you Sheep including Falconus are a joke. Think about this next time you hall monitors are typing your fingers to the bone. Does anyone give a f u c k about what your typing about on the Rathe server. More than likely not. <br>

<br>
What does it matter whether or not SoT used gimp tactics to kill a mob?<br>
<br>
In the end the fact still remains, Yelinak died at the hands of SoT.  <br>
<br>
You might think its gimpish.. you might think its exploiting, but in the end who really cares? It's a game.  No you can't take the uber loot you get off yelinak to the grave.  No the uber loot you have in the game doesn't mean jack @#%$ in RL. To get sooo angry and riled up about killing some pixelated monster in a made up fantasy computer world is beyond me.  This isn't exactly a life or death situation here. We were having fun killing a mob that we've never taken down before.<br>
<br>
We are not exploiting any bug in the games design, verant put these spells in the game, we use them to our advantage.  If using our brains to devise a way to kill yeli the easiest way possible is gimp then so be it.  Work smarter, not harder.<br>
<br>
Will your posting here of how gimpish our tactic is cause us to change our strat for killing yeli?  <br>
Only if we really care about gettings BoTS approval stamp on our raids, and frankly I don't give a @#%$.<br>
<br>
Will SoT get disbanded for &quot;gimpish&quot; tactics? <br>
As far as I can recall... The only guild to have been disbanded on the Rathe by a GM would be none other than BoTS...<br>
<br>
Whats the real point in bitching about the way we killed Yelinak?<br>
We killed him one way, you kill him another, other guilds will kill him another way...  however you do it.. yeli ends up dead, and the guild who killed him gets the loot.  Guilds can take turns killing so there's a fair share of loot.  Whats the big deal, let us have our fun killing a dragon, and then it will be your turn.  I'm beginning to think a few people weren't taught about sharing when they were little kids.<br>
<br>
Sooner or Later, EQ will die as other online games have.  When that happens hopefully most of us will say well that was a good game, and I had lots of fun playing it.  Unfortunately some people may just be too wrapped up in finding the next thing to flame someone about that they've missed out on the actual fun in the game.  I feel sorry for these people.  Game's are for fun, if they are causing you additional stress and worry.. whats the point. The way I see it, we're all (hopefully) playing this game to have fun, yes part of it is to get better gear, but whats wrong with giving others a fair shot at it too.  Stop bitching about gimp strats, time zone xploits, zerg tactics, and other random bullshit that you've thought up to flame others with and just play the game.  Live and let live.<br>

So far, every post by a member of SoT has been an attempt to hijack this thread away from the original topic, which is only natural human behavior when a person's actions are brought out in a negative light.  Much like moving this discussion from game mechanics to issues such as your opinion of whether someone should have sexual intercourse more frequently or not.  If the post isn't trying to tie something in EQ to some real life behavior (or lack thereof), it is trying to redirect this issue by pointing fingers elsewhere.  Look over there!<br>

You might think its gimpish.. you might think its exploiting, but in the end who really cares? <br>

Verant evidently does if it falls within their definition of exploitation.<br>

Unless you are blind, daft, or both, you would check up on history before posting.  Other than the Dozekar, Sontalak, and Zlandicar rotations (if they exist), I personally have been either the initiator of rotation discussions or at the least a major participant in every other rotation negotiation that has happened on our server.  To name a few, The Calender, Trakanon, Dain, and Tormax as well as the ones that are still ongoing such as the Statue, Sleepers, and ToV-N.  I have not once been approached by any member of Spirit of Tunare to discuss any rotation except after my last post on their behavior.<br>

but whats wrong with giving others a fair shot at it too<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Absolutely nothing is wrong with that.  I believe we tend to give SoT more than fair tries at all mobs they attempt that we also have interest.  How many Dain attempts did SoT make before killing him and when were they taken?  How many times did BotS say anything about that?  How many Tormax tries?  How many Aaryonar tries has SoT made?  [We actually believe SoT has had much more than fair try on Aaryonar because to get to him you have to kill Ikatair and Eashen.  Because SoT tries Aaryonar for a while (almost) every time he spawns, we have seen Ikatair and Eashen (both mobs who have drops that we want/need) twice in the past two months or so.  However, this is the first time we've ever mentioned it to anyone other than ourselves.]<br>
<br>
I would like to hear an official word from Verant saying that this wasn't exploiting and I'd be happy -- and no, your varied tales of what Vaylin said don't count because you already have posted two versions of what he said.  If they said it wasn't an exploit, then so be it.  Would any self respecting guild use those tactics after? Probably not.  Because much as you have said above, this game is about having fun and Verant is right:  Encounters that have little/no risk are not fun.  Fighting Yelinak as he was intended to be faught and winning is a rush every time we do it.  It isn't about the loot he drops for us because it is actually not as good as other, easier targets that we routinely kill and we honestly will survive if we never see him again.  However, we still enjoy the battle and the items he drops are still desired by some of our members so we continue, and want to continue, to raid him.<br>
<br>
PS:  I'm still waiting to be contacted by a member of SoT to discuss a rotation on Yelinak, but I guess I will be the one to have to contact them, as usual.  I also have seen a number of posts from SoT members that seem to imply that they actively seek to share as little as possible.  Comments such as we post because we are afraid that we will &quot;lose all the imporant mobs&quot; and such.  I don't know what we fear if we have rotations on mobs.  Besides, I'm not sure how we'd &quot;lose all the important mobs&quot; unless SoT did things such as control the spawn times and use Euro-time advantage to make sure that this happened... But of course, as they have expounded upon many times, they don't/wouldn't do any such thing as that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><P>
