<br>
Samfolk recently applied to my guild, Legend of Marr.  I immediately gave him an officer vouch, because I have known him for a long time, and have always thought he was a great bard, and had fun grouping with him.<br>
<br>
After a little bit of talking to him, and raiding with him, I *KNEW* it was not the old Samfolk.  I started asking him questions about some of his old friends .. names he would not have forgotten.  People such as Pandy, Nope, and Naturalis.  He did not remember any of them.<br>
<br>
I then asked him if this is the Samfolk I knew, and he told me no.  He told me that it is his RL brother.  I talked to Pandy, and she told me Samfolk sold his account.  He told her a week prior, that he was going to be doing just that.<br>
<br>
I then questioned Samfolk, and he said that his brother was going to sell his account.  But then the buyer wanted the account info first, before he would give him the money.  Samfolk decided no, he is not going to do that - and gave the account to is brother, to possibly sell later.<br>
<br>
At first he told me he was the ORIGINAL owner of Samfolk, then he gave the account to his brother (Joe) almost a year ago.  Then he decided to come back .. then, the story changed a little bit, to what I said above.<br>
<br>
The thing that gets me is .. Samfolk had a mule on a 2nd account, it's name is Samrr.  I have both Samfolk and Samrr on my friends list .. I saw Samrr online the other day, and Samfolk was on at the same time.  I sent a message to Samrr, and he had abosolutely no idea who I was - he did however, tell me his name was Joe (See above, the new samfolk claims his brother Joe is the original samfolk).  I also sent a message to Samfolk asking about Samrr, and Samfolk had no idea who Samrr was.<br>
<br>
One thing I know for sure, is that the REAL Samfolk would not have sold me his Singing Steel BP and Legs for 40k, after he paid 40k for the BP to begin with, and would never have gotten rid of it, until he could get better.<br>
<br>
I am still at a loss for the full story, however - Kit is right, Samfolk never said things like kk, hon, or anything like that.  This guy is too nice. <p><center>Veteran Aandiian :: 60 Warder :: <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35287">Profile</a>   |   Dharia :: 50 Cleric :: <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=287506">Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwanlail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wanlail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/9/02 12:16:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=679.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well, you know what to do...</span><hr size=1> yea this isn't the real Sam... or atleast i don't think so.

<br>
In retrospect, I'm glad I havn't seen this guy for so long. In the five plus encounters I had with him, long ago, he was nothing but immature, greedy, annoying and above all, a dick. I've had a group trained out of seb, pulls stolen with charm, and a myraid assortment of other @$$munching behavior out of, what I imagine, is the 'old' Samfolk. Hopefully the new guy is only greedy and dishonest (as would appear by trying to convince people he's the original owner to get his epic).<br>
<br>
Offhand, who the HELL would pay 1k for a *bard*. Jeeze.<br>
