Post missing names here from the pictures and I will come back and edit them if you see I missed someone. If you click on the pictures it will open up larger ones. My personal quest for the journey was try to see how drunk I could get my friends Cappan and Tedany and succeed beyond my expectations. Thursday morning I headed out to the airport to fly out. They upgraded me to 1st class, so I made sure to take advantage of the free drinks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Cappan and Tedany were nice enough to get me at the airport and I was feeling no pain. I did get bitched at for arriving at 5:30 during rush hour <br>
<br>
Thursday night a bunch of us just got together in bar in the Lobby of the hotel. Here are Eander, Babiedeliah, Livius, Tytannia, forgot, Alondra, can't tell, Aoyama (standing), Vehsoon.<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/1-Bar-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/1-Bar-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
We ended going out to dinner that night at this restaurant on the Navy Pier at some sea food place. Here is Tytannia and Lois having a drink, but Tytannia was having to drive back later so could not drink the good stuff. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/2-lois-tytannia-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/2-lois-tytannia-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Here is Livius, Cappan and Tedany there. I think Livius has a thing for rogues or something. He was trying to plant a wet one on Cappan all night. I think Cappan is starting to feel the effects of our drinking now <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/3-liv-cap-ted-small.jpg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Well then it was back to the bar for us after getting our batteries recharge for more drinking and meeting of people. One thing we all hated was that bar charged a lot for drink. A draft Sam Adams was $6.86 there and cocktails were about the same. Here is Tytannia, Lois and Livius. Cappan has his back to us and not sure of the rest. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/4-bar-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/4-bar-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
I realized from the angle of my last picture you could not see drinks. Well can't have that in a picture. We were all drinking beer mainly but Cappan loved those Malibu and Cokes. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/5-bar-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Okay as people started to feel no pain they started to get a little friendlier. Here is Lois, Livius and Tedany. Notice the smiles on their face. I think it was because I said I would buy another round. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/6-liv-lois-ted-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Next day I had to go pick up the badge they make you carry around. Here is the registration area and they had demo's playing on that wall during the whole conference. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/7-registration-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Here is the Plat Lewt store and Tedany picked up a couple of shot glasses here. We definitely have to find something to put into them later. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/8-platlewt-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/8-platlewt-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Had a few vendors down below. That green glow coming from a machine was the Nvidia booth. At the back wall was the sign up for the new Lords of Everquest tournament.<br>
 <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/9-comp-stores-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
We then decided to hit one or two of the panel discussions they had going on. This was the LDoN one I think. One feature they added to LDoN, that they admitted to here, was that not all dungeons would spawn 20 items to collect so don¡¦t do that adventure. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/10-panel-discussion-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Well then of course it was back to the bar for more drinking. Ran into Belafas, Zuljinn, Some dude playing with himself, Voott, Phalynk, Seldin and Cappan just showing his head.  <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/12-lobby-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Oh wait that was not some dude, but none other then Vhalis playing with himself. Why does he have such a big smile now. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/13-lobby-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
That night we had a big get together in the main ballroom. The Rathe went and move all 4 of our tables together here to take over this section of the floor. They had overpriced beer and some free food to eat here, but it was not too appealing. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/14-reception-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/14-reception-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Some guy really got into the costume contest they had going on for that night. It would take at least a full bottle of Jack before I thought about doing something like that. Oh some wanabe drinker from another server here stopped right next to me to take a picture also and set his drink next to my foot that I knocked over. Can you say Alcohol Abuse. How can people part with their alcohol? Heck if I had seen it I would have picked it up and drank it. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/15-catdude-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/15-catdude-large.jpg" target="top">Large Picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
We then ran up to the rooms and brought the laptops down to the bar because we found out they had wireless access there. I was only able to login once myself with my own system because it was then taken over by everyone else from The Rathe wanting to say Hi to their friends who were playing. <br>
<br>
<br>
They had some guy running around from the Safehouse slapping these stickers on people's backs and it was Danaldil who got nailed with this one. Bunch of sissy rogues only hitting for 573hp. Heck, I can nuke better as a wimpy enchanter and that is not saying a lot. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/16-backstab-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Well it was starting to get a little late and last call was happening so we headed up to the room to finish 1 or 2 more drinks. Here is Livius, Cappan and Tedany. I asked Tedany if she was having a good time here at her first Fan Faire. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/17-liv-cap-ted-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Now isn't she so cute and happy now. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Well next day it was back to the action with the Live Quest to see if The Rathe could keep up its winning tradition. They had all these guides dressed up as NPC. Cappan came running up and grabbed a beer out of my hand shouting, &quot;Give me that I need a Soul.&quot; Well I guess the NPC he gave it to like his idea of a soul because he got 3pp for it. Damn it though, he took my beer and made me go down to the bar for another one. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/21-npc-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Did meet up with Joekreeper there that morning and here is a shot of him and Livius. What is wrong with this picture? If you said Joe does not have a beer in his hand you were right.  <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/22-joe-livius-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Lois finally got up after sleeping in a bit today. I asked how she was feeling this morning (er afternoon really) and she said not 100% yet still. Well lucky for her I was around, because I went to the bar and got us some drinks. Her motor got running after that and boy is she a lot of fun to be around. <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.yourguild.com/faq/pictures/23-lois-small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
After the live quest we decided to go hang around and drink a bit more. At this time I did have a compromising shot of Zarfian, but it seems that picture got corrupted. Oh well he knows *grin*  <br>
