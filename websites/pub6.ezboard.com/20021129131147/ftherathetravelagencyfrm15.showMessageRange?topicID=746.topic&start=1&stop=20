I am a relatively easy person to get along with - but I do have my hot buttons, and today one of mine was pressed.<br>
<br>
Should people act with a sense of integrity while in EQ?  When I ask that question what I am mean is should people have just a simple respect for other people's camps?  Should people listen to ooc and shouts and tells and do their best to resolve conflicts?  Or should people just rampage through Norrath with their big swords and ignore the people that play behind the keyboard?<br>
<br>
This morning, to fix some of the bugs from last night's patch, all zones were respawned but servers were not brought down.  When GMs announced this, I had 4 members of Clan X plus myself make a run to HS to see if Drusella had been respawned.  While 2 of them were afk for a few min, 3 of us (Vortigern 60 Druid ... Sulpicious 60 Monk ... Rixma 60 Rogue) zoned in and discovered that Drusella had not spawned (Vort can track her from zone, has done it before).  Nevertheless, I wanted to make sure for myself.  So sneak hide to her spawn point and no Drus.  We were also the only 3 people in the zone at the time.<br>
<br>
However, we decided we were gonna take East wing anyway.  I got back to zone in with Vort and Sulp to get ready to hit east wing.  Just as we were on our way, a group of Legend of Marr (LoM) zoned in.  As soon as they came in we made sure to say in ooc that east wing was claimed.  Someone on their group said, &quot;okay go ahead Clan X taking west wing&quot;.  I had already started back into South toward East wing so I had not heard the say, but I made sure to say again in ooc that we had claimed East Wing.  With the understanding that it would be no problem, I zoned out at East Wing zone out to help someone for 10 min, our other 3 people were INC to zone.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqclanx.com/hs.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Slinkity managed to get into HS while I was out of zone and told me that LoM was telling us we couldn't claim the camp with just those people there.  I didnt realize there was a number requirement for claiming a wing of HS, especially since we have done East Wing with these people before.  Nevertheless, LoM moved from South Wing to East Wing over our protests in the zone - we were in east wing at the very entrance.    We were simply waiting for our shaman to zone before moving, a matter of a few minutes but they moved past Vort and Slink and Sulp anyway.  These three people can take east wing alone.  <br>
<br>
I made it to their location and I myself protested, but got nowhere.  They ignored our initial claim on the camp as you can see from the screenshot above.  Then once we said look, this is our camp we have claimed it, they rode over us insisiting that we didn't have the manpower to take it out.  I asked to speak to their guild leader - spoke to Xedd for close to an hour.  After speaking with Xedd for that amount of time, he finally concluded to let us deal with it and he was going to let his group decide what to do.  I don't think that was a good decision at all since this one member seemed to find every excuse in the book NOT to let us in there.  <br>
<br>
And this is what gets me the most.  The mob that we were all waiting for wasn't even up.  Drusella Sathir has a spawn time of 3 days, and is usually taken out as soon as possible after servers come up so the likelihood of her spawning today was slim to none.  We were there for the WING, and knew that Drusella wasn't spawned.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that WHY in the name of TUNARE do people feel they can run over anyone they want to JUST CAUSE THEY CAN?  Do people have a sense of right and wrong at all?  Just because people can't see the human you are behind the keyboard, does that give you the right to act INHUMANE?<br>
<br>
This is not about rules and regulations.  As far as Verant is concerned, it isn't KSing till you agro the mob.  Well, the mob we were both after wasn't even up so theoretically our two groups could have had a pissing contest in East Wing till Drusella spawned in the next few days.  What a waste of time.  This is not about Verant rules but about HUMAN DECENCY.  <br>
<br>
I am the guild leader of Clan X.  I would NEVER allow any of my members to Kill Steal, train, or take someone else's called camp.  I have had to tell my own guild members that they were WRONG when situations like this arise.  And they are told to do what is right, apologize, and give back a camp or risk being deguilded.  Part of Clan X is to respect EVERYONE in Norrath, not just our own members.  Some guilds out there understand this, and others don't seem to care at all how they treat each other.  I simply don't understand that.  And what happened today pisses me off beyond belief.<br>
<br>
One of the guilds that has impressed me here is BotS.  This is not a kiss ass to BotS in anyway, but an observation that they DO try to right their own wrongs, EVEN if they are the most uber guild on the server.  They care about their reputation enough to admit when they have done something wrong and try to make it up to those that were wronged.  (A BotS member attended a Clan X raid awhile back and took one of the spells we looted which was quite valuable to our guild.  Before we could get it back it was scribed in his spell book - BotS made up for it 10 fold, giving us 10 spells in return for the one taken and apologized.  THAT my friends is honorable.)<br>
<br>
I didn't see this honor at all in LoM today in Howling Stones.  They basically told us to shove it and did not listen to our protests.  <br>
<br>
I am angry.  I would not tolerate this behavior from anyone in Clan X - they would be deguilded immediately or told to fix the situation.  After over an hour of discussing these issues with Xedd and Ssarvhok (the monk who took our camp), I left Howling Stones with my guild members so I could cool off.  Xedd told me to send him ScreenShots of what happened, but he made his decision to support his guild regardless of who was right or wrong, and now I don't see the point of it.  The damage is done, we were told to basically kiss off with little to no concern of the long lasting damage that this caused.  <br>
<br>
My message is basically this.  I think it is imperative to walk in Norrath with respect for your fellow players.  I require it of my guild members or they can leave.  I require it of my group members or *I* leave.  It irks me to no end that there are others out there that don't care at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uslinkity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slinkity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/27/02 8:07:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=746.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The HUMANANITY of EQ - does it matter?</span><hr size=1> In answer to your question - Not to LoM obviously.<br>

Sorry about the generalizations. I'm sure, given the right situation, even the people that did this to us today, can be nice folks. They all just happened to have LoM tags... And so did there guild leader.<br>

I appreciate your post though, and thank you for your words of understanding. That, at least, is something.

Call it anyway you want it but 2 people sitting afk at the zone , the 3rd person zoned out for whatever amount of time, You invested nothin to the camp except time , you never even killed a mob. <br>
<br>
Unless you were proactive on your claim of the camp you have no claim. <br>

IE I can be at Velks zone with me and my pet waitin for a cleric and call Frenzy all i want , should it be respected if another group of what ever maked up can take it? Hell no.<br>

<br>
Ok, the mob your both after, drussella(sp), isn't even up and your after the wing..obvisouly LoM is too uber to want anything in that wing right?  Maybe they wanted the wing too despite no drussella.  <br>
<br>
Btw, Ssarvhok is an officer in LoM. Leaving a Minor<br>
 &quot;camp&quot; decision up to him should be just fine.  <br>
<br>
Every guild/person has disputes about camps or loot it's almost a fact of EQ life.  Let it slide and go on, maybe a sharing or rotation of the wing could've been installed but i don't see a need to &quot;flame&quot; someone over this.  <br>

Vort and Sulp and I had already started killing *see the Screenshot* and were preparing to enter South wing to go to East.  We were waiting on a shaman and chanter to be inc within minutes but we could have started that immediately.  When I ooc'd that we were taking East wing, I ASSUMED (apparently stupidly) that we were fine with that wing - if I had known this would have been a big issue I never would have left the zone for 10 minutes, but taken what was OURS to begin with as we were there first and could have handled it easily, we have done it before.  I would have pulled and handled south wing with vort and sulp if I had to PROVE that I could handle it, but no one in any other zone sits there and says, &quot;Okay you have 7.5 min to prove to me you can handle this camp.&quot;  I assumed that BECAUSE the camp was called, it would be no problem.  I would NOT have zoned out if I had known we were gonna get run over like this.  People call Disco or Library at zone in Seb and say they are moving down in 3 min while waiting for people at zone and it is UNDERSTOOD and OKAY.  But apparently different rules applied today.<br>
<br>
Ssarvhok made it clear apparently right away that we could not hold East wing alone (how would he know).  He didn't start arguing about it after 45 min in South Wing, but immediately upon entering the zone.  There was no attempt at communicating, &quot;Hey, I don't see the force here to take East Wing.&quot; which would have resulted in &quot;Full group here in 10 min, but we are going to start pulling now&quot; as well as the fact that I would not have left for 10 min to help someone outside of the zone.  There was NO ATTEMPT at just being nice and ASKING - just a &quot;forget you guys, we are taking it&quot; attitude.  THAT is what this post is about.  And that attitude is NOT what I would consider an officer's attitude!  If my officer's did that they would be out of the guild.  <br>
<br>
Again - this post is NOT about the rules of Verant, but about being HUMAN and NICE!  Respectful.  And talk to people as if they are your team members - but I guess if Ssarvhok had ASKED us or TALKED to us he could not have actually taken that wing.<br>
<br>
One of you suggested a sharing or rotation of the wing - Ssarvhok was adamant about the fact that the wing was his and basically told us to kiss off.  Sharing attitude?  No way.  I attemtped tells in private with him to discuss this before talking to Xedd, but he had a rape.pilage.burn attitude about the whole thing.  We never would have treated anyone from LoM that way.   <p><a href="http://www.eqclanx.com/" target="_blank">

Vortigern called east wing as stated in the screenshot.  LoM then stated in say that we had called west when it clearly shows we called east.  Vortigern then ooc'd again (not in screenshot) : No, we called east. They then proceeded south without calling a camp.  They had to have stayed around the drop in to South because shortly after a druid entered and the rogue came back out to get her in South.<br>
<br>
Figuring something was going bad, Vortigern then again in occ stated that we were looking to go east.  Someone from LoM stated that they were just after Drusella...to which we responded that we were as well.<br>
<br>
Rixi then stated that CX had East claimed and zoned to go help someone out.  (I don't know what she does...she is always doing something for someone....dern big hearted rogue)<br>
<br>
Seeing that we had already claimed East, as you can see from the picture, Vort and I floated over to the East platform.  The two of us then proceeded to start to clear east wing while waiting for the rest of our party to get in.  We had the 1 wanderer, 2 golems out front of door, and 3 of the 4 static mobs down in the entry room of East.<br>
<br>
Out of nowhere, one of the LoM people was heard yelling for help....probably to direct their group up the tunnels leading to the east fake one-way wall coming from south wing.  At the time I was fighting the respawn of the wanderer at the entryway with my face to the door (I play 1st person).  When I turn around...it's just in time to see the BL's pet in their group stating: calming down master...as it's attacking the last mob in entry room that I had left up due to respawn.  Pet calmed down needless to say and ran up and through the picture with the mob tailing it.<br>
<br>
The rest of our group zoned in as this was going on, and then that is when LoM stated that they had claimed the camp....yadda yadda.<br>
<br>
Those are just the facts.  It's a shame that for some it has came down to not honoring camp checks.  In some instances it doesn't hold weight....like in a zone such as they kept giving example of: Lodi in IC.  Sure...you can't kite that mob for an hour while you wait for your fighting party to get there.  But in an indoor zone where claim has been set, there is destinct camps, and mobs have been cleared I didn't think that was the case.  That is called leapfrogging in my book.<br>
<br>
What has been done has been done, and hard feelings will probably come out of it.  I would love to see people in this game not step on one another because of whatever reasons, but it does happen and we don't live in a perfect norrath.<br>
<br>
I'll just continue to do what I do....help those worthy of helping and stear clear of those that aren't. <br>

I wasn't going to respond to this post but enough misinformation has cropped up to warrant a response. Some facts in their order of occurance:<br>
<br>
1) We are told all zones will repop (which in fact did not happen), and I (me, Ssarvhok, not LOM the guild) asked a few friends to come kill Drusella with me.<br>
2) Upon zoning in we find 3 Clan X in zone, who call east, but are sitting in hub.<br>
3) We start clearing south, figuring that if nothing else it's exp, but if we get to where we can take it and they don't have the force, then we can rightfully do so.<br>
4) 2 Clan X in zone as we move past the 1 way drop to South Wing. Rixma zoned out and left.<br>
5) Our enchanter accidentally zones out, we go back to zone in and start all over again. Still 2 Clan X in zone, who had used the Lev Trick to get up to East Wing entrance... but hadn't moved in. Just sitting there.<br>
6) We clear to East Wing entrance. A good 45-50 minutes had gone by. /Who all rixma = Chardok. Well geez, that's no where near here. Calling a camp and then running to chardok! There are two Clan X sitting at the entrance to east. Not all the spawns in the entrance are cleared.<br>
<br>
At this point, I made a decision to go ahead past the one way wall - the point of no return (which is what I consider camping a wing - once you move in, not dawdling at zone in) and ... still only 2 Clan X in zone, still sitting around.<br>
<br>
Around the time we got the Undertaker Lord's room cleared, 5 Clan X had zoned in and the tell spam began.<br>
<br>
I told Rixma and Slinkity both repeatedly:<br>
A) There is a difference between making and validating a claim, you made a claim but did not validate it.<br>
B) It is small minded to blame an entire guild on one person's actions. I am always ready to take responsibility for my actions. LOM did not take your camp.<br>
C) It is hypocrisy to cry &quot;loot whore, all you care about is loot&quot; and demand a camp be given up so you can have loot.<br>
<br>
Throughout the entire time there were lovely flames in /ooc from Clan X. I told LOM not to respond, and had an hour long conversation with Slinkity and a shorter one with Rixma, in which case I told them both the same three points over and over. My guild leader, after hearing both sides, left the decision up to me. The responsibility, I will repeat, lies with me, not Xedd, not LOM. <br>
<br>
I'm not neccessarily proud of my actions but I'm not afraid to take responsibility either. We had a chance at a mob that I've been after for 3 months, Clan X sat around, I took the chance. There's that painful old cliche, &quot;Ya snooze, ya lose.&quot; The zone never did repop, so Drusella never repopped, so now I get to try to fit her into my schedule again. I'm sorry I hurt so many feelings over this (&quot;LOM doesn't genuinely CARE crycrycry&quot; no, actually we do, or at least I do), but *shrug* I made the call and I'll live with it. It wasn't neccessarily nice, but nor was it illegal. As I said before, I'm not going to claim Vex Thal and demand BOTS step out of my way so I can clear it... they'd be waiting a month or two before I even got my key. But if one necro can solo all of HS, then one monk can DEFINITELY solo all of Vex Thal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
