hi all. i am posting here in search of a little bit of help from truly interested players. i have been tossing an idea around in my head and now that i have assembled a guild of quality rpers i would like to see what i can do to implement my ideas. <br>
<br>
what i have been thinking of is a series of roleplaying events between rival guilds (mine of course and another). i would like to derive a storyline to set up a bit of a struggle between two opposing guilds. once the storyline is developed i would like to have public displays of struggle between the rival guilds in the form of guild wars. not just all out brawls that end up long and drawn out and end up getting boring. no, im talking about a war with a set objective for one or both guilds to try to achieve. once the objective is met, the war is ended and the players go off and do their own thing while the guild leaders begin work on the next confrontation to take place. the wars and skirmishes that go on can even be pre-planned as far as what the final outcome will be to set the stage for events to follow. not talking about letting one side win but more having a pre-determined sequence of events that will follow given one outcome or another. <br>
<br>
that being said i am looking for a few things here. one, i am looking for more players that would like to join my guild to help enhance the size and quality of these events i am working on hosting (dark race rpers only). second, i am looking for a guild to play opposite us in these scenarios. would prefer to have an all light race guild play against us so the sides are clearly defined (light vs dark), of course with a little imagination an all dark guild could play opposite us too but would really prefer to go against light (light roleplayers that is). lastly i am looking for other guilds (all dark and all light) to eventually ally and join in and expand on the impact of this rping on the server. im not sure how the rules work as far as guild war with allies on each side but would be pretty awesome to have 2 or more guilds apiece going at it in various zones in norrath. i would like for the guild that participates in this to be close to the level range and size of my guild at the moment so that all is fair in the beginning and can remain fair throughout because that is one of the biggest factors in making this whole thing fun for all. not too fun if ya know there is know way in hell youre gonna do anything but get slaughtered ya know. <br>
<br>
before the replies begin flying in and tells start bombarding me i must inform any and all that read this that i am only interested in doin gthis with a group of mature level headed people. if you just want to war so you can break out your 50+ chars to come stomping down on a bunch of mid 20 chars i am truly not interested in conversing with you. i also have no interest in &quot;evil characters&quot; that end up talking to me and end up trying to do this with when they have no intention of sticking to rules and guidelines that we end up setting for this (these) events blaming it on the characters &quot;evil ways of trickery&quot; and the sort. <br>
<br>
luckily the only people that bother to even enter this forum are rpers and most rpers are generally pretty decent people and can appreciate rules and guidelines that will make the entire event enjoyable for all and abide by them. <br>
<br>
ok enough for now. i have many ideas for scenarios and ways of controlling the chaos so if you are interested in:<br>
a) joining the souls to participate on our side<br>
b) entering your guild into these scenarios and working out some server wide rp events<br>
or<br>
c) entering your guild as a future ally to one side or the other<br>
please let me know here and i will seek you out in game or give me a tell when ya can.<br>
<br>
hope to hear from many of you.<br>

As a senior agent of the Leatherfoot Raiders, Marshal Anrey keeps me very busy protecting the interests of the Vale.  We have numerous agents positioned across Norrath to keep an eye on unfolding events - our natural propensity toward stealth contributing no small advantage to this end.  We pay particularly close attention to the movements of the Teir'Dal, having quite a strong presence in Nektulos, and even within Neriak city limits.  While I am not a member of any guild, I should be glad to represent in person the Leatherfoot Raiders in any event working as an ally of the forces of light should such circumstances as unfold require our attention.  I could perhaps best serve in the area of espionage and intelligence, being capable of disguising myself as a Teir'Dal - a skill which you would of course not be aware of in character....<br>
<br>
If you find a guild to play against and could use an added element of my sort I would be glad to join in.<br>

<br>
The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Harpers of Luclin</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are a Guild of primarily fair skinned races. <br>
We have been actually doing this very role-play struggle you describe within our Guild itself-sort of a struggle for &quot;Guildmaster&quot; as it were.<br>
<br>
We have had kidnappings, heists and planned assasination attempts, and of course all the resulting actions following them. <br>
We are mature players, and completely against powergaming principles.<br>
<br>
It certainly keeps the game interesting and provides an outlet that simply discovering new strategies to more efficiently kill MOBs does not replace.<br>
<br>
Contact me with more detail of what you have in mind and let us see if we cannot become your adversaries-in RP that is! <br>
<br>
Our current average level is 30 at this time by the way, but we can always make adjustments as needed...<br>
<br>
email me at: mikhail_avatar@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
P.S: Mumsley, we would gladly welcome your services and those of the leatherfoot. Perhaps an alliance can be formed?<br>

But I'm a member of the Nation of Eridine and I will probably try and post a link to your post here to see if that's something the guild would be interested in. I also say we should maybe bring something to the attention of the GM's and maybe they could raise the stakes some. <br>

As stated previously by two of my guildmates the Nation of Eridine has been looking for something just like this.  Our guild is getting its feet back on the ground after a mess within our ranks and several guild member run events for the guild are in the process of being formed.  So we are definetly an RPing guild and have been looking for some other great RPers.  I look forward to future plans on this.<br>

ahh is good to get some positive feedback on this idea. i was sure i wasn't the only one running around norrath looking for something to break up the monotany and give meaning and purpose to the many hours i spend playing eq and campin different mobs for different equip. <br>
<br>
like many of you, i have been on this server for a long long time. a few weeks after it opened ol' rukkas was born. since i am a mere lvl 44 it is pretty obvious im not into the powergaming at all and can say that the majority of my guilmates are the same in that regard. we all are also looking for more as well. had i known the fun involved in good pvping i would have been born on tallon zek, but have been here far too long and have too many friends here to leave. that being the case i decided to try to alter the environment on luclin by adding some pvp type play to it. i basically felt the server was getting a bit mundane and needs something to get it jump started with excitement. <br>
<br>
i have a great many ideas on things i would like to do and i believe the possibilities for RP fun here are endless. i only know of a few RP guilds on this server and it is good to learn that there are more out there, especially fair skinned roleplayers. at the moment i have contacted Valor's Companions and spoke briefly with the guild leader Lara. we will begin making a few plans here this weekend and work out some details on how we can get this started. any of you truly interested in helping us out with this server wide struggle between light and good on a &quot;blue&quot; server please let me know via e mail at    jlbrooks1@yahoo.com  <br>
<br>
could possibly start this struggle between the Souls and Companion's and each side goes and enlists more help in the conflict from the other guilds that showed interest here and tie them into the battles. <br>
<br>
i am really excited about the idea of server wide RP events between several guilds all going at once. beats waiting around for GM's to cook up an event for us. maybe if we can work this out right we can get some GM's to help with some of the things we end up planning out.<br>
<br>
anyway, i look forward to hearing from all of you with all your great ideas. i guarantee you that i will do what i can to make this work and if you all would do the same we are in for a really good time.<br>
