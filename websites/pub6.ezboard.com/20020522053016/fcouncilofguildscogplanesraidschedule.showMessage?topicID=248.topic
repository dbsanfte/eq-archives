Many creatures in PoF have absurdly long agro ranges (the imp guys, especially, can agro from almost as far away as you can see them).<br><br>I always make a point of stopping at the bottom of the hill and looking around.  Wait there for a good 10-20 seconds and make sure nothing is on or near you.  Then, and only then, proceed to the camp.  This may increase the chances of a wandering mob attacking you, but wouldn't you rather make the &quot;noble sacrifice&quot; than cause the death of many many people?  I know I would...<br><br>And something else to remember: if you see someone near you get attacked, it's very likely that you are on the mobs hate list as well.  So just because something isn't attacking you YET doesn't mean it's safe for you to proceed to the camp.<br><br>And once there, for gods sake, don't sit down until the raid admin has said it's safe.  Sitting down doubles your agro range, possibly more... which added to the already long Fear mob agro range... well, you get the point. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

You can then know everybody who you assign to the break-in groups and can announce MA and SA at the get go to avoid breaking mezzes in the future.<br><br>I will go on any and, hopefully, all raids that you run Destructress.

A good sum to go with is 5 - 7 groups.<br><br>When you buff up to go in, no sow hehe. Unless everyone knows whats goin on and what to do, sow is a killer. So is not having invis on. Fine so there's undead and live creatures in there, put it on anyway and heaven forbid you zone without it.<br><br>When I used to go with CoG we were told, zone in, take one step foreward, turn 90 degrees left and run to the wall....... NONONONONONONONONONONO.<br>There's one little step in here that must be removed. &quot;take one step foreward&quot;. dont move an inch foreward talk about a step. (unless you want to agro another 10 creatures your way to train) Turn automatically left and then go down the hill SLOWLY. There is NO reason to rush since when you get to the bottom you'll just have to wait anyway.<br><br>And as Kommi pointed out, do NOT sit once you're there. Everyone should stand until front is broken. no mana? too bad, stand and med it up. Sitting can potentially agro another 20 creatures onto you.<br><br>I know everyone is eager for loot but I would very strongly reccomend sending in only 3 groups (of all the highest lvl people you have) to break and have everyone else wait outside. Once you break the wall, then have the others zone in 1 at a time (not all at once). As each group gets to the safe spot and are accounted for, call in the next group. This way there are less people to get stuck on top of eachother on the port in point, less people to agro mobs, and like it or not, people are much more exposed and you can tell who trained you. (if that helps any)<br><br>Hint for groups: if you have a CoH mage, always put them with the puller <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I'm sure you knew that.<br><br>And Destrucress, to reduce the stress on you, choose one person from each generic class type (tank, pure caster, priests) and have them deal with tells along with you. Just make sure it's someone who knows and understands the zone lol. preist questions to priest leader, pure's to pure leader, tank's to tank leader. No one person can be expected to understand how everyone's class works best even though some claim they do know. Let the tank class leader sort out who would be best MT, let the monks figure out who would be best puller. They aren't dumb, sure they want the honor but there's a difference between experience and eagerness.

The main reason behind this is I believe it will only lead to friction as people look to me as opposed to the Raid Leader for direction.<br><br>Now then.  One thing I suggest is people go back and read my Planar Raid Recaps.  They are not just lengthy and long winded recaps of who got what loot.  They contain not just lessons, but also advice and suggestions for doing things better in the future.  You can learn from the past or you can learn on your own.  Either way you gain the experience, but one way is a lot less painful than the other.<br><br>And I need to agree with Lagdalen.  The difference between a 50 warrior and a 55 Shadow Knight, or Ranger, or Rogue, or Paladin, or any other melee is extreme.  I often used a 59 SK for an MA in Fear and Hate.  I've used a 60 Ranger as well.<br><br>Group makeup is an art form as opposed to a science.  Especially in KCoG where you may or may not know who is showing up.  You need to take into account not just levels, but equipment, experience, reliability, and spell/weapon layout.  I'd rather have an experienced level 55 ranger be my MA than a level 60 Warrior from X Uber guild who has never been on a KCoG raid before.  <br><br>One thing that often makes things easier is to have a single leader.  Period.  If you have seperate leaders for different tasks then you will get confusion in the raid.  This isnt true for guilds such as Valoran or Watchmen or Grey Hawke that work in and with confusing and rapidly changing situations.  But you are dealing with people who often have no planar or large scale raid experience and knowing they can listen to a single person helps a whole lot.<br><br>When Haemish used to lead KCoG plane raids we learned the problems with one person being in charge and another running the raid itself.  KCoG was never as successful as when a single person did everything.  It simplifies the situation enourmously.<br><br>And finally, attitude among the leaders is everything.  There is a big difference between keeping control of the raid and talking down to your raiders.  I do expect those that raid with me to be quiet and no complain.

And even worse to show it for any reason.  It destroys morale faster than almost anything else.

Low level does cause arggo, sigh but you dont get many 55-60 on a pick up raid they tend to be members of guilds that only enter the planes for epics... and god killing so they wouldnt bother with KCoG.

Then I come to find out he was in ec the next week selling all of his equipment and and leaving the game or changing characters one (not to sure) and last raid you would have to been there to understand......... so dont tell me how to act, I dont lead I assist Destructress. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uentwain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Entwain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(4/12/02 9:53:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=248.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear recap </span><hr size=1> That was a freakin blast.. and i luved coming in to give a hand although i kick myself in the teeth for not showing up on the initial break in (tsw raid i had no clue about), destructress you did AWESOME god it was fun doin that with you guys and draco goes down next time i see that dwaggon...<br><br>Entwain Demoshine<br><br>If I was an Autobot, I'd be:&lt;br&gt;<br><a href="http://android5.com/misc/tests"><img border=0    src="http://android5.com/misc/tests/autobot/ironhide.gif"  alt="Click to see what Autobot you could be!"></a>&lt;br&gt;<br>Take the <a href="http://android5.com/misc/tests">Transformers personality test</a> at android5.com!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>MAGELO<br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=165036">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=165036</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KCoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(4/15/02 4:04:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=248.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.godwinclients.com/sd/haemish_new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear recap </span><hr size=1> I'll have to chime in with Kellory and Lagdalen here. Break-in, especially in Fear (or portal breaks in Hate) can be done with 3-4 groups of 50+ players. They actually take less time, have fewer casualties and are more fun than 6 group pileups. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>The best way to do break in on Fear is really with 3-4 groups of experienced raiders with an average level of 52-55. Not saying that someone under 50 can't be helpful, but if for nothing else than the fact that at post-50 levels, HP's, AC, mana levels, disciplines, etc. are VASTLY different. Someone more efficient than me can point to research that shows that melee characters are on a completely different damage/to-hit table than under 50 characters. Not to mention the fact that most of the creatures will con white/yellow to a 52+ as opposed to red to lower levels, and you see the benefits. <br><br>However, it can be done with 4-5 groups of 46-49th level folks. You're just going to have more deaths, probably need to evac a few times and take a bit longer. It can actually be more fun. Personally, I always LOVED being in the break-in groups, because aside from mini-boss fights, once the plane is broken, it's all just fairly simple loot-collection from there. Pull mob to camp, kill it while mezzing any adds, rinse repeat. Now doing AE multi-mob kills is a blast as well.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>Founder<Br>Karana Council of Guilds<br>"I don't play role-playing games to be a politician."</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showPrevMessage?topicID=248.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showNextMessage?topicID=248.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=248.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.emailToFriend?topicID=248.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.threadControl?topicID=248.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=248.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=248.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule>CoG Planes Raid Schedule</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
