<br>
We began a bit late, say around 7:50 pm CST taking attendance, and took me about an hour to get the groupings down, so we moved in about 9 pm CST. We cleared to the Nox room, and 1 group had trouble with getting repeatedly trained at the zone. We had a few deaths getting to the stone spider room, mostly from folks either getting trained or getting lost and separated. After a few quick corpse recoveries and resses, we moved through the stone spider room (which was camped) and began taking on the fire giants. Here is where we shined. After the first fight with fire giants (where we lost 2), we lost no more casualties to fire giants. This is a vast improvement over our last attempt, where we had a few fights with multiple casualties. We moved through fairly quickly, with only 1 bad pull (my fault, right before the draw bridge). We took down King Tranix easily, and Baptismo won the polished mitrhil torque. After that Skarlon fell with ease and yielded his Mithril Vambraces to Aalya. We soon found ourselves outside Nagafen's chambers and ready to pull the last 2 Fire giants and Magus Roykl. <br>
<br>
Sylssyth, Iksar monk, and Syan, Shadowknight, were our only two FD pullers on the raid, so we sent them to split the giants and the Magus from Nagafen, luring the giants and the Magus into the antechamber with bowfire. This was done quite well, with the only problem being that Sylssyth was killed, but not before feigning at just the right spot. We pulled the Magus and the giants and killed them with ease. <br>
<br>
Here's where I made my only loot screwup of the night. We rolled for the Polished Mithril Mask that drops off the Magus before we pulled him. At the time, I checked with my loot guy for stats, and saw it was a AC5, wis+7 int +7 mask for all/all. I could have sworn that I had restricted this to just casters in the past. However, I did not have my loot list written down, and couldn't pull it up in a Web browser either at the time. It was pointed out to me by Eryndhel that it was supposed to include hybrids on this roll. I didn't think so (my faulty memory), so I only let casters and priests roll for it. For anyone who looked at the loot policy, this was wrong, and I apologize to all hybrids for not giving you the chance at it. Next time I will. This mask did drop and was won by Meline. <br>
<br>
We began buffing, which took a bit longer than normal due to some LD issues. Finally we were ready to go. Upon zoning back in, we had 2 LD's that never came back from the chat room. Anyone that is stuck in there may want to log into an alternate tonight and see if the FG's have been cleared.<br>
<br>
We charged into the lair upon my call and ran past the beast, at which point, I was feared. This lasted about 10-15 seconds, but I was not feared again after that. I was not hit with melee at all. Having turned Server side filters on, I had almost no lag on a 56K connection and got a bunch of screenshots. The plan went off like clockwork, the tanks engaged, and with the exception of one time fighting Nagafen on the bridge (my fault again), we pulled him back in the lair and he never left it. The casters came in and nuked on time. I only had to run to the healing line once, at which point they were OOM. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was heading back into the lair from the triage line when Nagafen went down. <br>
<br>
We did spectacular last night, with no discipline problems and only a few minor setbacks. Server side filters are a must to use on these things. We only lost 5 (yes that's 5) people out of about 50. Skrimegeour came in looking for Ragefire (who wasn't up) and ressed all of our deaths. All had a fabulous time, and learned a great deal about dragon raids. <br>
<br>
The loot was:<br>
Half of the Book of Scale (Baptismo)<br>
2 Hierophant's Crooks (Dognaily and Colandria)<br>
Cloak of Flames (Thaur)<br>
Gauntlets of Fiery Might (Zetta with a 500 roll on 1 to 500)<br>
<br>
I only want to mention one problem we had last night. After we killed Nagafen, some disparaging OOC comments were made about Grey Hawke which were in poor taste. Please refrain from insulting guilds in OOC in the future. If you want to diss them in private, it's your call, but keep it out of zone wide shouts and such. It's unbecoming and does no one any good. <br>
<br>
Other than that (and my own lack of printing out my loot rules), this was an excellent raid! Congratulations to all who attended (I'll have a complete list later)!<br>

More than happy to support future ones as well (support/CR/clearing the way), really enjoy these raids with you all and love to see the beasts slain! I was even prepared to go in unbuffed and groupless but you threw me in a group and threw me in buff line and i want to thank you for it. As you said i cant roll on items i didnt care one bit and was glad you let me go in and pound on him for a few <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The raid went very well, indeed.  I don't remember anyone whining that things were taking too long and everyone seemed well behaved.<br>
<br>
Things went smooth, and I got to go to bed about midnight which isn't too bad on work night.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Ronfar (might be spelling that wrong) for your generosity on the torque.  I didn't even know what was going on as I was dropping off the trinket loot with Lothax at the time.<br>
<br>
It was also the first time I had lived through the entire dragon fight.  In fact our entire group did.  I didn't know that Nagafen was really such a chicken when he knows its over.  He tried to run like an orc pawn.<br>
<br>
Anyway, had fun yet again and hope to see you all at the next event.<br>

If anyone is stuck in there give one of Fellowship a shout - I believe we were gonna try to kill FG's tonight if they're uncamped.<br>
<br>
Now maybe I'm a stickler for it and you can grouse all you want but I am SICK of going on raids where members cannot control their mouths! Do you not understand that some people have young children that like watching mommy or daddy go after a dragon and might be reading the screen?!? There is NO reason to swear like I heard in one persons battle call (I believe EVERYONE knows who I'm talking about) and to have to sit and listen to people making sexual inuendoes about themselves and eachother at the lava ring is unacceptable. If I wanted to hear opinions on Aronos's manhood I would ask him myself, not have it said out loud. (personally I think Aronos is a great guy and wether it was a joke or not he deserves an apology for it). My point ladies and gents is - THINK before saying. Just because you have no other way of expressing yourself does not mean everyone else wants to hear it.<br>
