Even if that guild has choosen NOT to enter the plane that day and skip.  You must have the approval of preferably the guild leader or the KGC liason from that guild/alliance.  Not just any member or officer.  It must be someone who actually can make a decision for that guild or alliance.  If you do not know who that person is, check with one of your officers and they can check on the KGC board.<br><br>Even if there isnt a guild in the zone, you need to check with whoever is up for that plane for that day.  If the guild has already left the plane I would highly suggest you get in touch with not only the guild that was up for the plane that day, but also the guild next up.<br><br>Also, the book isnt by the portal.  Its over by the Maestro room.  In order to get there safely even a rogue with Sneak/Hide will need to have made sure that area is cleared.  Also, as most large guilds do portal breaks in Hate by the time they have cleared to the Maestro the portal sentry's would have respawned.  The wanderers have a very short respawn timer as they do not drop loot.<br><br>It is frankly suicide to attempt to get this item without the consent of whoever is up for the plane that day.  Nor would I suggest trying to sneak it.  Should a large guild see you trying to do so, especially if they have told you no, you risk sanctions against not only yourself, but your guild and whomever else brought you up there.  <br><br>Oh, and if I were you I would not attempt to do a port for someone to Hate or Air if you do not have positive confirmation from the guild that has the plane that day as you risk sanction against yourself and KCoG should you be caught.  And most guilds will go out of their way to find out who ported said rogue on up.  Most dont care much really about the rogue as they will probably die anyway, but they do care if there is a rogue wizard out there.<br><br>Kellory Silverstar<br>KCoG Plane Raid Liason (retired)<br>The Watchmen<br>Master of Shadows<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udestructressfyrestarter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Destructress Fyrestarter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/28/02 5:56:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ok..</span><hr size=1> 'nuf said... counts me out... sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>thanks for being patient with me Kellory, you know im new at this kinda stuff..<br><br>Destructress <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <br>p.s. btw, im Norraths' only Tanking-Wizard .. not a Rogue-Wizard</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udestructressfyrestarter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Destructress Fyrestarter</A> at: 2/28/02 6:03:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujahla2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jahla2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(3/2/02 8:13:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok..</span><hr size=1> 1)  I AM getting permission, Kellory.

I will be on spring break and I have a very good opportunity to play for a long time instead of going to school.  Perhaps we are getting closer to a solution to this problem of mine.  thank you all.  =o) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufallonn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fallonn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/lastout111/skullspin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(3/5/02 5:30:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/lastout111/skulani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok..</span><hr size=1> I'm not suggesting your guild go for a slot in Hate, what I am suggesting is for your GL to make contact with the leader of one of the guilds who are scheduled for the Plane and see if he can work something out with them to allow you inside to get the book. Most guilds don't have a problem allowing someone in after they have cleared the zone, which would be the best shot for you. But KGC requires that you get permission from the guild who has the Plane that day. I have spoke to Litl about this and am waiting for his reply. Hopefully you can get that book soon! <p><table border="0" style="filter:glow(color=black," strength="#1)" align=center><tr><td><b><strong><font face=verdana size=-1 color=#0066FF>Fallonn Vargyle - 54TH      Heretic</font><font face=verdana size=-1 color=white></strong</font></font></strong></b></tr></table><p><center><b><font face="verdana" size="-1" color="#0066FF">Guildleader of the</font></b><br><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/lastout111/Shadows/Homepage.htm"><img border="0" src="http://webpages.charter.net/lastout111/ssblue.gif" width="450" height="55"></a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujahla2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jahla2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(3/5/02 5:48:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok..</span><hr size=1> oh.  hehe.  i try that a lot too. )  most guilds say they have a rogue with them that needs it. )  it works...in theory. ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urbecka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rbecka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(3/14/02 3:42:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok..</span><hr size=1> Jahla2: <br><br>Next time Sacred Band goes up to PoH, holler..  would be glad to assist you in getting that book.
