Every game this guy has enjoyed I've played for over 2 years long min.  Anyway every game he's given me a review on I've loved to death.  here is his Review of DOAC<br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot (5 day review)<br>
<br>
I only played 4 days but I doubt there is anything more that I could see<br>
by playing further. I had<br>
a level 12 Bard (3 bubbles short of 12). I wasn't failing at the game, I<br>
was toward the top of the players. I was on track to rule the game. Maybe<br>
people who play more could have better things to say, but I really can't<br>
invest the time getting to a point where this game does not suck when I<br>
don't know for sure if it ever gets better.<br>
<br>
Simple Review<br>
It's a pure ripoff clone of Everquest. They copied the basics, the chat<br>
commands, the spell lists,<br>
classes, the game mechanics. In many places the game is worse than<br>
Everquest, in a few places they have improved upon it. But when it comes<br>
down to it, if you have played Everquest, you might as well stick to it,<br>
or not waste your time with this game.<br>
<br>
Pros<br>
There is a lot less downtime compared to Everquest. But from what I've<br>
seen, even though you're fighting more, you seem to level SLOWER than<br>
Everquest. Everquest is already too slow. It takes<br>
hours early on to get to the next level. If you expect to succeed you<br>
need a group.<br>
<br>
They have a nice grouping system that helps you find groups. People are<br>
very friendly and it's<br>
not difficult to find a group.<br>
<br>
They are supposed to have a very nice PVP system where you can war<br>
against large groups of<br>
other people on the server. I've never seen it so I wouldn't know. But<br>
PvP in MMORPGs are always very horrible and imbalanced. If you want PVP<br>
why not just play<br>
Counterstrike.<br>
<br>
The people running it are probably not jerks like Everquest. I didn't get<br>
harasses by any GMs.<br>
<br>
They are pretty forgiving on names, I saw NutsacGargler, Bob Marly,<br>
MeleeProject, BigBard, and all sorts of other common, and famous names.<br>
<br>
Some of your buffs last hours so you don't have to keep recasting them<br>
unless you die.<br>
<br>
The game splits loot and money automatically with your party. Very nice!<br>
No arguing about loot.<br>
Not that the loot is worth arguing about.<br>
<br>
They have a nice Buddy List.<br>
<br>
The people in the game are very nice. I didn't run into one jerk the<br>
whole time playing. In Everquest that happened every few mins.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of monster spawns usually so I had no incidents of kill<br>
stealing. There still reaches points where there are not enough monsters<br>
but you can leave and find somewhere else.<br>
<br>
They allow up to 8 people in a group.<br>
<br>
The NPCS have what they do under their name. So say BOB (Weapon<br>
Merchant). So you don't have to talk to every NPC to get what you want.<br>
But there are about 4 varities of NPCs so you have to still kinda look<br>
around.<br>
<br>
They give you a nice map and command card. And the manual isn't that bad.<br>
You still don't know what any of your spells do or how to play your<br>
character.<br>
<br>
They seem to have plenty of classes. Too bad most of them are stolen<br>
directly spell for spell from Everquest.<br>
<br>
The Bunny Hop. You can Jump everywhere you go and they don't penalize you<br>
for it. So everyone Bunny Hops everywhere. It's fun!<br>
<br>
Cons<br>
#1 Problem: When you Zone, your party is broken up, and your buffs are<br>
stipped. That means whenever there is a train in a dungeon, you have to<br>
reform your party when you zone and cast all your buffs again. That one<br>
problem, combined with the lack of content and boring and long gameplay<br>
caused me to quit.<br>
<br>
Graphics<br>
The Graphics are god aweful. From the start of creating your character<br>
you see what is called<br>
&quot;programmer art&quot; which is temporary art programmers make until artists<br>
can put the real thing in. Only they didn't seem to ever get any artists.<br>
The game's graphics just make you gag.<br>
The Characters all look retarded. You get to the character screen and you<br>
go, I don't want to play any of these guys. I don't want to look like any<br>
of these people. People say Everquest had bad graphics (I thought they<br>
were ok I wasn't bothered) and this game has worse graphics big time than<br>
Everquest. There also isn't much selection on what you are going to look<br>
like.<br>
<br>
Interface<br>
The interface is the worst part of the game. It's just horrible. At<br>
higher resolutions it's so small you can't even click on anything. Their<br>
whole camera is really bad too. It's very hard to see around in buildings<br>
and in dungeons.  You'd think the Everquest interface was the worst that<br>
could be designed, apparently not.<br>
<br>
World<br>
The World is hella boring. There's only one thing you see, grass and<br>
trees. It's so boring. At least<br>
in Everquest they had different zones with different seasons and looks.<br>
I'm told the world looks different if you start other characters on the<br>
other Realms but why should I have to either create another character or<br>
fight my way there to see something new.<br>
<br>
They divided the world into three parts. You only see 1/3rd of the world.<br>
To see the rest of the<br>
world (which is equally as boring), you must create another character<br>
over there or<br>
FIGHT your way PVP style into the enemy Realms (parts) to see the rest of<br>
the world.  The<br>
1/3rd of the world you do get to see is very small and boring and all<br>
looks the same.<br>
<br>
The world is very linear. There is one main path and everything is along<br>
the path. That makes it easy to get around but makes for a very lame<br>
world.<br>
<br>
Item Drops<br>
The item drops are hella lame. They don't start dropping crap you can use<br>
until level 15 or so. Most of the stuff you get is monster parts (bug<br>
legs) that you sell to the vendors. You should<br>
get useful things at level 1.<br>
<br>
Items<br>
The items for wearing and such are the most boring I've ever seen in any<br>
game. Maybe they get better when you play more but why should new players<br>
not get to see cool things.<br>
<br>
Lack of Content<br>
There is nothing to see. In your first few days of playing you see just<br>
about the best of everything that is to see. Your Realm only comes with 1<br>
city, and there are only 3 total cities in the world. And the cities suck<br>
@#%$. They are boring cities with nothing in them but trainers. Their sub<br>
or small towns are all exactly alike and equally as boring.<br>
<br>
Horses<br>
They say they have Horses but this is how it works. You buy a ticket (to<br>
who knows where) and give it to the stable guy. Then it's like the boat<br>
ride in Everquest where you are on a horse going and have no control. The<br>
only thing you can do is jump off. That's a pretty cheap way to claim you<br>
have horses.<br>
<br>
Game Play<br>
The Gameplay is just the level grind. Sit at one spot with a group,<br>
someone pulls a monster, you beat on it. Hours and Hours on end. Very<br>
Repetitive just like Everquest. It gets so boring.<br>
<br>
Monsters<br>
The monsters are totally retarded. It's like why are these monsters here?<br>
Is there anyone<br>
actually planning the monsters? The starting town had Crabs,<br>
Sandman/Mudman, Little<br>
f-ing Trees you attack (TREEES??? WTF?), Skeletons, and some Beetles.<br>
This is supposed<br>
to be Camelot? I didn't see one impressive monster. Everquest had flying<br>
monsters, Everquest<br>
had Sand Giants. Everquest had way the hell better monsters.<br>
<br>
Information<br>
Like Everquest they tell you nothing about anything. You start with 8<br>
things to put your points into<br>
and if you spend them wrong your character is ruined. And you have no<br>
idea what to spend them on. Then you get about 5-6 things to put<br>
specialization points in and you have no idea how to spend those either.<br>
You get new spells and there are no descriptions as to what they do.<br>
&quot;Magic Ability&quot;. Thanks dudes I knew that much. Dumbshits. If you don't<br>
have a second computer with a web browser you're going to have to keep<br>
quitting to print or read the web then come back to the game. Second<br>
Computer or a Printer is a must. They COULD just tell you in game how<br>
things are so you didn't need to.<br>
<br>
Looting<br>
I had lots of problems looting. I had to keep clicking over and over<br>
until it picks stuff up. Other people didn't seem to have that problem.<br>
<br>
Insides of Buildings<br>
When you go inside the camera gets all jacked up and you have to screw<br>
around with it to see. It's nearly impossible to walk up stairs or<br>
ladders. Also you have to open doors to go inside and they are really<br>
wacky. You have to keep clicking on them over and over to get them to open.<br>
<br>
Missing<br>
There don't seem to be any mounts or guild halls or housing. Or Boats, or<br>
Boat combat.<br>
<br>
Map<br>
There is no map. So like Everquest you have to print out maps FANs have<br>
made that are often wrong.  They at least give you a direction command.<br>
<br>
Bugs/Crashes<br>
The game crashed 20 times on me, I was about to quit. I updated my<br>
drivers and it seemed to fix it. Later on several days later the game<br>
crashed on us during a fight and 2 people died. 5 people<br>
crashes and 2 died. I suspect that would happen more often if I played more.<br>
<br>
If you have your group menu open to talk to your group, you don't get<br>
private messages! So you have to leave your main window open and type /g<br>
message to talk to your group. Very annoying.<br>
<br>
The quest system is pretty buggy too. Often it doesn't work. They tell<br>
you to talk to NPC here and you talk to them and they don't respond.<br>
Links in quest system that didn't work.<br>
<br>
The swim sound continues to play even when you stop swimming.<br>
<br>
You cannot swim under water!<br>
<br>
One guy in my party talked to the wrong NPC and his class was set to a<br>
class that he didn't want to be. His character was ruined.<br>
hahahahahahahah.<br>
<br>
The Trade Window is bugged. You accept/they accept, nothing happens. And<br>
it seems you can dupe with it.<br>
<br>
Crappy Quests<br>
This game is supposed to have the most advanced Questing system in any<br>
MMORPG. That's not saying much. All the other games have had virtually no<br>
quest system.<br>
They do have a questing system but the early quests don't seem to give<br>
any rewards. Your reward is a &quot;story&quot; thanks a lot! There are supposed to<br>
be &quot;tasks&quot; that you can do for rewards that must be completed in 2 hours.<br>
The quests were mostly go talk to this NPC and come back. Very boring.<br>
Some of the quests didn't work. And most of the quests I saw were<br>
VERY VERY VERY boring. The NPC blabs on and on and on about @#%$ you<br>
don't care about. Shut the @#%$ up and tell me what I need to do and cut<br>
the bullshit. If I wanted a blathering story I'd read the manual. In one<br>
if my first quests they tell me to walk way out to this guard tower.<br>
I walk way the hell out there and talk to the guy. And he says &quot;you're<br>
not a druid&quot; Thanks dumbfuck I already knew that. What about my quest? So<br>
I had to walk all the way back for nothing.<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
If you're incredibly bored, and not worried about wasting your money, why<br>
not try it. If you didn't like Everquest, you will not like this game. If<br>
you are already playing Everquest, you might as well stick to it. If<br>
you're not a MMORPG fan, this is not the game to start on unless you want<br>
to use it as a comparison to everything wrong in a MMORPG.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind I'm a very negative guy and have a very high standard for<br>
games.<br>

They are both &quot;sword and sorcerer&quot; type online role playing games.  The primary difference -- from a macro perspective -- is that EQ is very *item based* and DAoC doesnt really seem to be.<br>
<br>
In EQ you spend hours and hours camping rare spawns, putting together high level raids, and buying and selling in EC so that you can get ITEMS.  Also in EQ, you argue and fight with people and try and manipulate them over items, whether you are trying to get a camp, or whether you are in a guild and trying to get awarded loot.  In DAoC the emphasis is not really on items (or so it seems in the 14 levels I have played) so if you are the type that plays EQ in order to get the most uber gear then you won't like DAoC at all.  In DAoC you cant even inspect people and see what items they are wearing, so even if you had the most l33t stuff no one would know.  About the most uber you can get item-wise in DAoC is using some expensive dyes to color your armor (everyone has the ability to customize their armor, and some of the colors are really expensive).<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, in DAoC the emphasis seems to be on adventuring and exploring, as well as a tradeskill-based economy.  So far in my playing time there is none of the bad-vibes that I used to see all the time in EQ.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I like DAoC a lot, and this is just my opinion based on 20 or so hours of playing =)<br>

<br>
I have never had the client crash on me at all, not even once thus far. I am very impressed with the stability, it blows away AO or EQ (even now) with stability.<br>

<br>
Can't really review it yet myself as I'm still aways away from level 50.  <br>
<br>
Leveling in the game is very very fast if your in a group.  You get nice group bonus exp for each kill.  Also if you group with people 5 - 6 levels higher then you then you will make about 4 levels in 2 hrs from the purples they kill.  Also the &quot;/whisper task&quot; command which gives you tasks will have you making exp fast.  The game is not a race to be the first to 50 but more of a group effort to get everyone in your realm to 50 before the other realms.  <br>
<br>
People are much friendlier then in EQ.  Also that guy didn't try a roleplaying server as shown by the stupid &quot;non fantasy/mythical&quot; names he mentioned.  Role playing to me at least is part of the fun except when in a group doing the exp grind then it's just important to be with a very skilled group of players.  <br>
<br>
He is way off on graphics.  Except for the trees the rest of the landscape is much more visually intense then EQ and the spell effects (especially the bolt spells) look awesome.  Wish EQ would upgrade there spell effects which are usually turned off anyways during raids.  No idea if DAoC will get laggy during major realm raids.<br>
<br>
Gear/Equipment is important in DAoC but not so much as a status symbol like EQ.  Again don't know about the high lvl game.  I've had /inspect turned off for probably a year in EQ as there is no purpose for it unless you have some pixel envy problem.  Glad they don't have it in DAoC.<br>
<br>
The big test for me at least will be in seeing how RvR works at the high levels.  Think with a crew of skilled players could develop some really cool strategies for taking out enemy forces and can't wait to put a flight broadheaded arrow through some bald pated briton friar one day soon.<br>

Before I go into what I like and don't like about DAoC let me first give you something to think about. What was EQ like in the first few weeks after it was released? Did the weekly updates and the emergency patches run over the past 3 years enhance the game to the point where it is today? <br>
<br>
Also to the point of some of the interfaces being the same or very similar that is marketing. What better way to sell your product then to imitate the competition. What kind of car or truck do you drive? If it is not a Ford you are supporting some company that copied another manufacturer. If something works it is repeated over and over again. That said the Verant should take it as a compliment that they are being imitated as long as it doesn't break trademark or patent laws. (Side note do you think JR Tolkien is rolling in his grave because Verant is using his books as a basis of there game?) <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Some of the things I like and others I have yet to acquire a taste for.<br>
<br>
Graphically this game is Awesome. The ability to change the way your armor looks with dyes is a sweet touch.  The spell effects are better then EQ.<br>
<br>
I also really enjoy the way they have there trade skills set up. The recipes are available on the system. EQ would benefit from adding this to there system.<br>
<br>
When doing quests and task you can ask guards where someone is and they will point the way. This is a great help and makes doing simple quests more. In EQ I hate doing quests because some of them don't make sense.<br>
<br>
The character creation is somewhat difficult as was noted above. But if you wait for 6 months I am sure CastersRealm.com will have a nice break down for you. Trial and error is not a bad thing. The book that came out for EQ doesn't give you a break down on all the spells. It will give you the effect message but it took some time to learn what they did. IE reading websites or making a program to read the files inside your EQ folders. <br>
<br>
Something I would prefer a change on is the chat interface. I am used to EQ's chat options. If you are one that got used to doing the /say or /gu to talk you will not have an issue with DAoC I always just switched chat to make it easier for me but that is a personal option. There are other little things I would enjoy changing but it's because I have logged too many hours on EQ and it's engrained into my brain. If I would have started playing DAoC first I would have thought EQ was messed up.<br>
<br>
Bottom line the game only costs $40. That is not a lot of money if you think about it. Try it and see what you like. If you like DAoC select the option button  after you create your character and change your keyboard options to mimic that of EQ's.<br>
<br>
Those are  my thoughts for all they’re  worth.<br>
<br>
See you on Both games<br>

I was really interested in the game.  the horses the way they are sound pretty cheap like he said and @#%$ up a bit.  A Few of the bigger parts which I wanna hear are not True are as followed.  If they are true for the most part I seriously doubt I wanna play the game since it'd prolly just be EQ all over again and I don't wanna waste anymore money as I'm already poor.<br>
<br>
-The Horses the way they are<br>
-The Quest (I'm a gamer who does get sick of all that fckin reading and getting nothing out of it, even if it's not phat lewt, I just don't feel like reading a book on my gaming machine aka computer.)<br>
-The Boring world.  Would you say it's boring or fun like EQ?  I did like EQ's world like he said also.<br>
-Lack of Content... EQ had a LOT of world to exlpore, most of which I never even saw.  would you say this has a lot of world to see for the 1/3 of it anyway?<br>
-Monsters really that boring as he says?<br>
-Finally the leveling system... kill a lot, less downtime, but slow still?<br>
<br>
I think those are the biggest things that bother me.  I don't want a boring world, and I don't want an EQ spawn.  <br>
<br>
The guy who wrote this, Well I'm prolly not allowed to put his Website up (since you really had to E-mail him to get his review).  I will say he works for a big gaming company though, and has played EQ.  Also I know the last character he played in EQ was Scooby (before he E-bayed him) and the leader of a guild a long time ago.  If you don't know who he is by that information then you have no chance.  Anyway, I've always trusted his gaming mind.  He did solo a lot in EQ, so I'm guessing he soloed a lot in DOAC as well... I'm 'guessing' Doac leveling system is a lot like Diablo II's where if you solo, it'll take you forever to level at the higher levels (40+) but if you group, you can make levels really fast, even if the character in your group are pretty far ahead of you.<br>

<br>
Here is a break down for what I think so far. <br>
<br>
-The Horses the way they are<br>
* The horse are some what like taking a boat, like the above mentioned, but it’s really like hopping on a horse in Queynos and taking a faster ride to Freeport (10x as fast as a sow maybe). I guess they could have used a stagecoach but they would be too lame. Paying 5 sp to take that trip in 2-3 minutes is well worth not having to run if you don’t have a port.<br>
<br>
-The Quest (I'm a gamer who does get sick of all that fckin reading and getting nothing out of it, even if it's not phat lewt, I just don't feel like reading a book on my gaming machine aka computer.)<br>
* I am with you here. This system is easier, there are two types of quests (Tasks and Quests) Tasks are local errands for your trades master. He asks you to make an item using the trade skills you currently have and delivery it to a person in the same town. You can also ask the guards for a task and they will some times ask you to go kill a mob and bring back the proof of the kill for a reward, ears, claws ect...There are also quests that ask you to go town to town for some coinage. I haven’t done much of that so I won’t say more.  I know there are real EQ type quests out there but I haven’t started looking for them at this time.<br>
<br>
-The Boring world. Would you say it's boring or fun like EQ? I did like EQ's world like he said also.<br>
* This one is a little hard for me to comment on. This really depends on your playing style. Some folks want to power level the crap out of there characters and only play the high end game where others are content with hanging out in the midlevels and helping newbie. I have played EQ for almost 2 years and in the past week I have really enjoyed my time on DAoC. One thing that does make it a little more boring is the lack of OOC and other spam chat. I know a lot of folks on EQ and it’s easy to find someone to hunt with without shouting LFG. I don’t like that. I enjoy grouping with people I know.  So I can see how they would think it’s boring on that point.<br>
<br>
-Lack of Content... EQ had a LOT of world to explore, most of which I never even saw. would you say this has a lot of world to see for the 1/3 of it anyway?<br>
* This again comes down to how you like to play. The game comes with a map that gives you a ruff idea of the lay of the land. It however is not good enough to play by. I have only printed out a map of the city to help me with trade skills. The rest of the world I will learn on my own. If you like to know everything about a zone before you go into it then you will hate it. However if you like adventure and learning it your self, it’s a kick. <br>
<br>
-Monsters really that boring as he says?<br>
* There are a lot of common monsters in appearance. A lot like orcs with the pawns, centurions and so on. I would not call it boring it is just something you are not use to. <br>
<br>
-Finally the leveling system... kill a lot, less downtime, but slow still?<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This ultimately comes down to how you like to play. In 2 days I have leveled a character to 8th lvl and spent time running around exploring and spent over 4 hours just working on trade skills to get some better armor for myself. I don’t know if that is fast or slow for you. I can lvl a character on EQ with out twinking from 1st to 2nd in about 6-8 minutes. Please keep in mind I know the systems and have my favor areas to hunt. I have known folks to go from 1st to 40th lvl in a week. I don’t like that kind of play. <br>
<br>
I am pretty tired so I hope this all makes sense.  <br>

<br>
EQ got boring that way. The battles themselves may have been a challenge but if you didn't mess up and followed a given strategy then you won. DAoC is going to be more of a battle of wits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uginwen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ginwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Savage</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#333333>(10/18/01 6:46:04 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hi</span><hr size=1> Horses are like a travell only sow you can buy (so like scale of wolf, I guess) with the added advantaged that you can't get attacked while riding the horse and the disadvantage that you can only go to a few locations at any given stable.
