<br>
She didn't ask what we gain by being part of this community,..and she did not ask what the advantages were...and she did not ask in the right forum.<br>
<br>
What she asked was what did we think should be changed.<br>
We answered that question,...with basically none of your business. If we have change suggestion we will make them through our reps in the proper forum...not in FC.<br>
<br>
However, since she apparently sees no advantages after reading through the board. And subsequently informed us all we are obviously getting something out of this...(ie Loot hogs)<br>
<br>
What have I gotten from this comunity arrangement:<br>
<br>
1. My guild entered a rotation...that is we take turns with other guilds capable of killing a mob. You remember taking turns..that is a kindergarten concept.<br>
<br>
2. We resolved 2 guild problems that could have escalated into ugly arguments with GMs, through RTA intervention and discussion.<br>
<br>
3. What have I personally gained...lots of headaches due to my rep status. That is the only thing I have personally gained from this community. <br>
<br>
I get no uber loots for supporting Nycah 90% of the time. <br>
Rogg has yet to pay me all the plat he owes me for complimenting his writing style.<br>
As of yet, I have received nothing but headaches.<br>
<br>
What my guild has received,...not one thing they did not earn. But they did not have to have arguments in OOC with some other guild trying to do the same thing.<br>
<br>
When they got ready to try that uber rot mob, 2 count them 2 uber guilds who could have walked over us and took the mob, waited for us to get assembled, cheered us on, and rezzed the ones who died.<br>
<br>
We have received moral support when we failed and suggestions and cheers when we succeeded.<br>
<br>
You are absolutely correct we as a community are better off with the RTA.<br>
<br>
If the guilds who are involved in doing the zones feel a change is needed they make those changes. If you want to have a say in that....then get your guild mvoing towards posting status, convince them to make you rep...and come tell us how we should do things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alcyona>Alcyona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1341.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: d</span><hr size=1> Excuse me...but I also asked what you would like to stay the same.

<br>
You obviously have problems with the rotation system and the way it is set up.  I feel that this is from lack of experience.<br>
<br>
The Rathe, in general (yes, specifics can prove this wrong, I can name couple of examples) is a very civil server.  Guilds go out of their way not to step on each other.  In fact, they encourage others to get on rotations, as it's alot easier to be happy when everyone around you is happy.  Quite often, when a guild wants to break into a rotation, they don't log on and try and race the guild.  Instead, the guild rep and/or leaders talk to the guild rep and/or leaders of the next guild that is up for the mob, and ask for a chance to break into the rotation.  Only a few times, in my experiece, has a guild denied another a shot at getting onto the rotation.<br>
<br>
So please, explain to me (and use little words, cuz I'm afraid I might not understand) how the rotation protects the ubers more than a free for all dash for mobs would.  Please keep in mind how rapidly FK has advanced, and that they were always on rotations.<br>
<br>
I saw firsthand the frustration of what racing can cause with the cockblocking of Tindi by BotSon killing Emp prior to PoP coming out, and I wouldn't wish that kind of problem on any guild on The Rathe.<br>

Learn,...find out how things work,...figure out if they work,...then find out how you can represent to change things.<br>
<br>
There is currently a topic for change under discussion in the rep section on Plane of Hate.<br>
<br>
It will be discussed by the reps...a consensus will be reached...and while Personally do not think anything should change...those rules will probably change..for the excellent reasons presented.<br>
<br>
Not because  a bunch of twits came here and flamed the system.<br>

Ok.  Time to get this flame on topic again.  <br>
<br>
Rotations that are over 2 months long should be set back to FFA mobs.  Waiting 3 months to kill a rotational mob because the encounter is trivial is absolutely ridiculous.  There becomes a point in time when it isn't worth being on the rotation because it's not going to progress you any further.  I don't see these rotations as being a benefit to anyone.  Therefore if they're not 'benefiting' anyone, whats the point of keeping them on rotation?<br>
<br>
I know people are going to say &quot;it benefits the lower end guilds who would be beaten in a race type enviroment&quot;.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, benefits them every 3 months!  Bullshit.  There's no way getting 2 loots every 3 months is going to help a guild.  I could see a month, month and a half...but 3? Come on now.  <br>

Its one thing to show with examples someone being a moron, but thats not what happens here. I have started making an effort to post here now and get involved for the &quot;fun&quot; of it.

Yeah that makes sense dickhead. <br>
<br>
And my comment:<br>
&quot;And who's to say when the rules &quot;need&quot; to be changed? when someone from one of the BIG UBAH guilds speaks up and says I don't want such and such guild killing this mob so let's set up some kind of outragious rule so they will never be able to?&quot; <br>
<br>
Was made in response to Seer's <br>
<br>
&quot;The rules are changed when needed by the guilds involved in those zones who are represented here.&quot;<br>
<br>
And so what...maybe I don't know as much about this game as you do...I mean look at  your posts Seer...seems to me like you spend all your time on game or on this site...But I do know that I play this game with RL friends and that I do have fun playing it...up untill a bunch of power hungry people that can't seem to get shit accomplished in RL takes over every aspect of the game. <br>

<br>
If you are indeed in VoLS, perhaps talking to your Guild Leader about the RTA, Rotations and Calendars should have come first. <br>
<br>
If you aren't in VoLS but are in any other Rotational or Calendar entity, you might talk to your Guild Leader first.<br>
<br>
If you aren't in a Rotational or Calendar entity but truly wish to know about the RTA, perhaps reading posts in the 20 pages of posts in the General Forum, the 20 pages of posts in the Flame Forum, the (not sure of the number) pages in the Guild Rep Forum and all the post in the pages of the other &quot;pertinent to the Rotations and Calendars&quot; forums.<br>
<br>
Then, perhaps you'll have a better understanding of what impact your question would have on this posting community.<br>
<br>
Even if you had read the first few threads in the General Forum, you would see that there are on-going concerns and changes always being discussed and implemented on the RTA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seranis>Seranis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1341.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: d</span><hr size=1> Slim,<br>
<br>
This topic has come up at least once a month since I started reading these forums over 2 years ago.  It gets old, and people get antagonistic because they get tired of seeing it.  I have stated my post in similar form numerous times, and in fact saved it in word so that next time this is brought up I can cut and paste it in and edit it to fit the situtation.<br>
<br>
Alcyona,<br>
<br>
I would indeed suggest speaking with your guild representative if you feel a change needs to be made to a certain rotation.  Talk to them in a calm, well written manner about what you think the problem is, and if they are a good guild rep and agree with you (at least somewhat), then they can post your concerns on the rep forum where the representatives for the community may address the issue.<br>
<br>
The rotation system only works because people support it.  They support it because it benifits them to do so.  No guild is *REQUIRED* to follow the rotation system, but they have to be willing to accept the consequences of not following it.  And those consequences can be pretty harsh.  I saw how people in SoT were treated after the whole Ragefire/Trompen deal, regardless of whether they were present (I, in fact, know some people who logged to avoid being involved).<br>
<br>
If you enjoy soloing and don't want to trade much, you can do pretty much whatever you want as long as you follow the rules SOE has set.  Just don't expect to ever be uber, just look at Saas (sorry Saas).<br>
<br>
Again I will refer you to your seeming quest for unbiased opinions on what needs to be changed, all the while harboring a signifigant bias against the rotation system.  And I quote:<br>
<br>
&quot;And so what...maybe I don't know as much about this game as you do...I mean look at your posts Seer...seems to me like you spend all your time on game or on this site...But I do know that I play this game with RL friends and that I do have fun playing it...up untill a bunch of power hungry people that can't seem to get shit accomplished in RL takes over every aspect of the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
This kind of an antagonistic attitude will not win you any friends or support for your cause, it will simply get others to act antagonistically towards yourself.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to bash you, I just want you to open your eyes and see that there are better ways of going about and attempting to make a change.<br>
<br>
To all:<br>
<br>
I do think that in some cases the rotations do need to be updated.  It is not my call to take a guild from a rotation, however.  They have earned their place on the rotation and have (I feel) the right to be there.  I would ask that other guilds look at what you get out of killing certain mobs, however.  The following is the King Tormax rotation:<br>
<br>
NB - ADC - Terr - KoO - EotF - [TL] - LoM - VoLS - FK* - ED - VoF - SoY - CB - FS - CE - TWC - LoL - BotS* - SotE<br>
<br>
For those who aren't aware, the * indicates autopass (effectively off of the rotation).<br>
<br>
Looking at the power levels of some of the guilds on the rotations, I don't see why a guild like KoO (and I'm not flaming you guys, just stating a fact) should be competing with an elementally flagged guild like Tindi or NB.  However, Tindi and NB may find that KT's Head is still worth enough for them to go and take him out.<br>
<br>
By the same token, though, I feel that you should always look out for your fellow man.  So, I would encourage guilds that are only looking to loot a single item (even if it always drops from the mob) that isn't a key item (such as a warrior hate weapon from XTC) to pass on the rotations.<br>
<br>
This subject too, however, has been brought up numerous times (usually using Sev as an example).  It's ultimately the responsibility of a guild to do what is right, and I don't think we do too badly at that at all on The Rathe.<br>
<br>
Also, someone noted above that some mobs are being used more for farm status than any dire need for the loots, and suggested that any rotation over a time period (I thi nk 3 months was suggested) be changed to FFA.  From examining the KT rotation, I see 12 guilds that I do feel are in the correct power level to be killing him, which meets your 3 month criteria.  I personally would rather see those guilds taking him out, however, than the FFA alternative.  Because I can guarantee I can take out KT with a single group, and would certainly farm him as much as possible.  Just look at what has happened to the Kunark Dragons.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, flame away.  Oh, and Alcyona, I would appreciate some sort of a civil reply (I only say this because I don't want to be involved in your flame war with Seer).<br>

No, I didn't flame you.  <br>
<br>
I directed you to your GL first, just so you could find out what stance he/she had on Rotations.  You said you were looking for input, I just thought looking a little closer to home, first, might answer some of the questions you had.<br>
<br>
I directed you to other posts that have asked the same questions you did, and got similar answers to what you are receiving now.<br>
