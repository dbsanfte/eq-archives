And for those of you who saw me go to karnors for 30 minutes on a small corpse recovery for a guildie, YaY! congradulations! its nice to see im still very populair there. Now, if I might ask, why the heck is everyone talking about it? I &quot;left&quot; karnor 6 months ago or more, damn I left it WAAY back when I was 58, I still go there to do evacs to skyfire <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Larss is a dick.<br>
<br>
So is anyone else who posts up that I made 5 trains every 15 minutes. One, thats a train every 3 minutes. Consider this.. a lone druid actually medding fast enough to PULL every 3 minutes? No I pulled every 10-15 minutes. It always took all my mana each time, so of course I worked my ass off to ensure I never got trained out of the zone. Everytime I would get trained out of the zone thats two 30-second zone loading times plus mana wasted healing myself. That all slows me down, so no.. I definantly avoided trains. You cant get 60 first if you train every 3 minutes, eh ok. Now, you all have your personal experiances with me pulling some massive train and slaying your whole group. Ok, first off Ive NEVER posted about this topic so this is my first unedited post on the issue. I already know that many of you will post negitively about everything I say nomatter how logical, or how well-said it is, but here it is anyway. I didnt pull massive trains. And I definantly RARELY was responsible for deaths. Sure, many of you say youve died to my trains multiple times, thats eather lieing or mislead thinking. Ive still got the names of everyone I trained and killed in karnor, all but one accepted my regrets. All were accedental. And I can count them all on my one hand. So why do so many people say they died multiple times to my massive trains? First of all its hard to blame someone for small things, its hard to say xenth killed a few people when you could say he killed YOU and everybody you know! Thats one reason I think I take so much heat from karnor, people make it up. But theres other reasons, first of all, I got blamed for SO many trains I didnt have anything whatsoever to do with. Many many many times I would be sitting around talking to my buds and people would shout or ooc &quot;thanks for killing us xenth&quot;. Why? Well they automaticly blame it on me. So I would defend myself, which wouldnt acomplish everything, they would lie and say they watched me do it or some shit like that. Some people even admitted that the reason they were blameing me was simply because I was in the same zone. But theres more (imagine that). I did train, Im not saying I never trained, everyone who goes to karnor trains. Im one of the most skilled everquest players (not bragging, this is technical) I can send a druid where no druid has gone before. I could take a train of 30 mobs that I didnt make, and with a little talented manuvers and jumps, trap it and nerf it. Actually saveing people from dieing. Why would I want to save people who accuse me of such evil things? Because like I said I didnt like zoneing out of karnors, it would waste mana and a lot of time. Plus my rule was HIGHLY against going into the zone-out area, people would train that zone-out area so oftin that if I would go into it even for 15 seconds I was likely to get hit by a mob, and take blame for another train. So I steared clear of the zone, if I got 30 mobs on me you would see me running away from the zone out and into karnor with it, im sure some people saw that and wondered what i was doing. I was going to the wall so i could jump off and trap it inside karnors. Save myself from a zone-area risk and save a lot of people from dieing. I dont know how many times someone would train and the number of people in the zone would go down to 1, me. And what am i doing? running around freely pretty much :P I was very skilled in karnors, i knew absolutly every trick in the book. And i used every one of those tricks to keep trains from happining. Anyone who says I train on purpose has NO idea what they are talking about. As for these &quot;massive&quot; trains people say i pulled. No, never happened. Any train that *i* would actually start would be extremely small 2 mobs or 3. thats nothing for karnor. and I never took it to the zone-out cuz of my rule. I would go up the steps and jump the wall into my safe corner and camp every time. the train would never go over second bridge, so people wouldnt die to it. or if people would go die to it, really, you have to say in that case it was their fault :P if my train is standing still somewhere, its just like any other mob in karnor. you get to close and it will attack you, you cant say that it was my fault though. So why would I get blamed for massive trains and huge deaths? Well EARLY on in karnor before i knew all the tricks on how to get a train stoped, I would have to zone it. This was back when i was level 54ish. Even then though any train i would make was 3 mobs or less because i never pulled from any doors back then. just bridge mobs and such. But i WOULD get hit by other peoples trains rubbing off on me, and i would zone because i knew not what else to do. Of course you can say that they would have zoned too, so Its not like i was doing anything worse with it. But what does it look like to everyone else? It looks like xenth is training a lot of mobs on you and you are dieing to it. I cant say I blame people for being upset about those, but I have to say if i didnt pull it then it was someone elses fault. This was only early on though, because later when i was 55+ I never took any of my mobs anywhere near zone out tunnel area. Now, people say I pulled through the moat. This is correct. People say I would train moat in the process, this is also correct, but heres what was happining: because karnor is so buggy if you want to pull to the moat from inside you have to pull over bolth bridges, which brings your mobs close to where other people like to be hangin around. At first when i was not good at it i would lose control of my mob sometimes. Useually my half dead mob would then go die to a moat group somewhere. This always sucked, and very rarely would people even mention it. But this wasnt happening the whole time i was in karnor like people say, what people dont know is i changed what i was doing in karnor every few days to make it work better and train less. most people dont know that or dont want to believe it. At first i pulled the mobs over the bridge and i would take a right turn and hop into the water and wait for it to hop in also. If anyone ran by it had a chance of attacking them and i would have to go beat on it. Some people would blame me for KSing when i would do that (bleh) depended on if it was a rare or not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . And other would blame me for training them. This didnt happen for more than a few days though and then my strategys improved, i started to take a LEFT turn and wait for it on the land until it actually hit me, then i would fall into the water and it would instantly teleport into the middle of the moat. This ensured that noone would take it/get hit by it without me being right there ready to wildfire it off them. and when i changed to that strategy, only about 1 in 200 of my pulls got interrupted by people. by the time i was 57, my strategys were mastered. I never made trains then, even though i was in karnor continously. How is that possible? Skill. first of all a train walking back, 35 mobs in it, noone else in the zone but me, a rare walking back with the train. I could snare the rare and nothing else would come, ever. Why? Because I was level 57. People dont understand this, because I still got blamed for makeing massive trains even at this time. I never made massive trains exspecually after level 56, because i could pull loners with snare. Also after they fixed root to where the druid root wouldnt break itsself, i REALLY didnt make any more 1 mob trains. Because i could root any others that came. Yet even with my high level and ability to pull loners i still would get blamed for trains in multiple spots in the zone at the same time. Who was blameing me for these trains? the same people every time. I wont list their names, but definantly the same few people every time. This does suggest that they were doing it on purpose. Many people remember the guy who yelled for days on end, stop kiteing in a dungeon moron! He made things a heck of a lot worse as far as lots of occing and shouting, its amazing what one person with a lot of shit can say, and just how many people will believe it. And as for kiteing in a dungeon and not leaveing when when asked to. Well hands down I have to admit I didnt leave, and i was asked to. But its not nice to ask someone to stop leveling if they are doing nothing wrong. Whats weird is at first in karnor, everyone ONLY asked that i stop kiteing. noone blamed me for trains, really because i rarely made trains. people would petition the gms by the masses asking for a gm to make me stop kiteing. At that time (level 53 till i got 54) i was kiteing at the zone-out area. I only killed big drolvarg sentrys. They dont hyper agro, so my &quot;kiteing&quot; NEVER trained anyone. Why? Ill repeat, big drolvarg sentrys dont kyper agro. So why all the fuss about me kiteing? here it is and it sounds lame, people were scared of a big dog running around them near the zone. Lol. Thats it, they were scared it would attack them. It never did but they didnt know that it wouldnt so they would ask me to kite somewhere else, and i wouldnt because the zone out area was the zone safe spot for me to do it that early into kunark. After people tryed for a week petitioning, to no avail, a few people started to change the blame, from &quot;kiteing in a dungeon&quot; to &quot;training&quot;. In essence, I was still doing exactly what i was doing, but now a new way to blame me for it. &quot;training&quot; is a heck of a lot worse than kiteing. And one these few people, who i might add never shut up with oocing it for months, started to blame me for training. Well people would watch me to see if it was true. So yeah, I would get hit by someone elses 30 mobs and (take it to zone-out cuz i hadnt learned about the other tricks, yet) and they would see me train it and then all the rumors they had heard, they would beleive. And i didnt even make the train, just looked like i made it. then I have even more people plungeing headfirst into the rumors. Consider this, I was there in karnor for a very very long time. THat gives anyone who goes there a very long time to figure out if xenth trains. Sure they will adventually see me do it. And then beleive all the rumors that people just like themselves made. There are a very few people who dont lie though, they post up their personal memorys of an ACTUAL train that i was involved in, and if its true i sometimes even remember the exact thing they are talking about. What they dont realize though, is that they may be refering to one of the extremely rare cases that i screwed up and my mob actually killed someone, somehow. Sure a snared, near-dead level 41 mob can do some serious damage. Someone posted up here that I trained a moat group, and killed some of them or something, and then came back and blamed them for KSing. I would blame people for ksing, sometimes. Depended on what happened though, you say &quot;Xenth came back&quot; and it sounds like your saying i ran off into the blue and didnt see my mob killing people. I assure you, Im skilled. I can run backwards, sideways, jump hop and swim like a moterboat, on a computer that probably blows most of EQers computers away, and I watch my mobs as I pull them. As I got better (and more determined) I would pull my mob the ENTIRE way, backwards. yes, pull it over bolth bridges all the way into the water. I had done it so many times i could walk backwards perfectly anywhere in karnor. Whats the point? I was watching my mobs, always. A few rare cases (listen people, out of 100,000,000 pulls you make a few mistakes) I would have my mob in the water and swim for a few hundred feet, turn around, It was right behind me a second ago but now its way the hell over there out of the water beating on people. I still am not sure how this would happen but useually it was because of people sitting and the way the game is buggy. This didnt happen oftin because I hated it when it did that. First of all, though, assumeing it was a mistake, what do I do about it when It does happen? If the group was attacking it sometimes i would let them have it, and they would promtly ooc that i should &quot;at least come back and get your shit..&quot; or if i did come back and start nukeing it, it would be &quot;you trained us and then KSed it!, at least let of kill it if you train it!&quot;... bleh. Anyway someone posted that I came back and blamed them for ksing. If I did come back and blame them for that, I assure you it was one of the rare cases that one of the moat persons jumped into the water and actually nuked it off me and ksed it. I blamed a few people for ksing my mobs out of the most water, and it was when they actually did. If the mob was not in the water, I blamed even more people for ksing my mobs as i pulled the over bridge. but i understood the hyper agro rules and i only got upset if it was a RARE and i was clearly attacking it. Sometimes my pulls were very long and difficult to get to a rare, just to have people eyeing it down like crazie and oftin time attempting to take it away when i get it to the bridge. As you can see Im presenting myself as perfectly innocent. No, not really I did make some trains just like everyone else. People see me as some complete asshole. Sometimes I wonder what people think I look like, probably some stuck-up tattooed ciggiritte-up-his-nose drunken moronic loser <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Actually im nice, cool. however you like to put it. Sometimes people would see me rant in ooc in defence of myself in karnor. And take that as the way I am. Im just always defending myself against this or that, so its hard to show my friendly side. There are a lot of cool people in eq who are, cool :P And many of them I am homies me&amp;P&amp;G forever with. Some of you would like nothing more than to think im miserable or at least unhappy. Naah, If i was gonna be unhappy I woulda been unhappy yesterday <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sure you could say I am posting this is some faint hope that a few people would see things differently. Yeah. But for those who want to see me miserable, its you who are miserable. Because you see that im not. Here, after all this time and debateing, your still wishing every day that xenth would be baned :P And yet he isnt, because it was proven by the GMs that he didnt train. Yes, at 4am youd find me sitting around laughing with gm-guildes about what the heck the iksar berzerker club i was swinging was. Every gm and guide knew me personally by the time i left karnor because everything was green. Never did one of them find me guilty of anything people had blamed me for, and yes i know they watched me with invis on even at 4am. That one guide had watched me all night, and finally went uninvis to ask me what my weapon was :P. He also wanted to know what a preserver was, although he assumed i was a druid cuz i was casting druid nukes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I talked with him for an hour and he said that he didnt see what all the fuss was about. <br>
<br>
Anyway this turned out to be a long post. lol.<br>
<br>
quote: &quot;Xenth you get what you deserve&quot;, im sorry larss, although i did nothing serious to the extent im blamed for: I have yet to receave this punishment you faign to think I'm getting. Many people blacklisted me in karnors despite my efforts to reason. Now they are blacklisting me again for going to fear for a couple days. I suppose getting blacklisted by the same people twise is supposed to hurt worse? People say none likes xenth. Ive got many friends who wont think a bit differently of me even if 10 thousand people are -rumored- into thinking I suck. Look, all im saying is the truth on the karnor issue from the eyes of the person who saw it ALL. Many of you will post negitively. Dispite. Youll find SOMETHING bad to say, and if there is nothing bad you can find to say:<br>
<br>
Youll say, &quot;well xenth thinks...&quot; <br>
<br>
How can you know what I think? Ive had many people who think they know what I think. <br>
<br>
Youll say &quot;well I saw xenth do..&quot; <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think people see things. Gms, (yes, they did respond), didnt see what you think you saw. And they see it a whole lot better.<br>
<br>
Youll say &quot;Well I heard..&quot;<br>
<br>
You probably heard something, that someone said, who heard that someone said, who thought that someone thought that somebody thinks they probably said. By the time the infomation got to you, It had probably been exagerated by 10 different people over a month. You cant put any actual facts into that shit.<br>
<br>
Oh, and im not a turd. And I dont go to karnor anymore, except to zone in and evac out at the zone line.<br>
<br>
