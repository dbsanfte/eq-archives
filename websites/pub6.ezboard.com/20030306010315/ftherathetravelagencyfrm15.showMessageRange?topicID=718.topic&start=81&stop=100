I understand that the big 3 are bored with the current content of the game, but lets be real to all the other guilds out there.<br>
<br>
Just because they might make Ragefire spawnable, doenst mean it has to take 40 level 60's to kill it. If it was made as hard as you suggest, then the camping would go on but only the big 3 would be able to do the spawn kill. (well at least they would not be in the line)<br>
<br>
I see, as rumered, 4 items off of rare mobs as a way to break up the time of your camp. I bet it will still take you a month or longer to get all four items. <br>
<br>
You have to consider the competition for those mobs in your rate of getting them. There will be several groups always hunting there for those items. <br>
<br>
Can you say Burn Teams? Ya, I bet the MQ sell price of those items will be pretty high. This solution will prolly make the lower end guilds have to buy the items as the higher guild will be farming them to &quot;epic&quot; all of their clerics and alts. <br>
<br>
There will also be arguments as to what is &quot;engaged&quot; on one of these mobs. DRuids kite in SF all the time and if a druid pulls with a nuke to his group; has he engages? A burn team comes along and kills it. Was that a KS? The GMs will have lots of petitions of highly contested epic mobs. (I bet these mobs are rare and will not always drop what is needed....)<br>
<br>
I hope they figure out a different way of doing this, because we, the RTA, will have to find a way to civillize the cleric epic AGAIN. sigh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukluztzul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KluzTZul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/3/02 12:02:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: changing epics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Miss me?<br>

While this discussion seems to be turning into a Ragefire discussion and I wish not go get away from it, I know this discussion was first started with a number of other questions at the same time.  With that in mind, I have a question or 2 about some things that were brought up in answers to a couple of Broken's questions.<br>
<br>
Broken asked about the 6 person invite rule of other guilds going on a different planar raid than their guilds.  What was answered was that each guild can reserve a plane once per month and that other guilds respect that reservation.  While I agree with this and have been on a number of raids myself, I wonder what happens on those days that no reservation has been made.<br>
<br>
Can a guild who has made a reservation for a planar raid on a specific day in a given month also go into a plane for a raid that noone has reserved for that day?  Is this considered bad form?  Example... Undertakers alliance has Hate reserved for a Saturday in a month, if we wanted to, could the Undertakers alliance also go to Hate say on a Tuesday or Thursday when Hate is not normally reserved?  I'm not saying that we would do this, it's just a question that came to my mind during all this reading I've done on this subject.<br>
<br>
One thing that Broken, or anyone else who may have questions concerning being able to take down Ragefire, General V'Ghera, or any other difficult Epic mob, if you have friends or have accuaintences (sp), chances are if you ask for help taking one of them down, you can always get help doing so on The Rathe.  At least this is how it's been in my experience.  Even if you do not belong to a guild, you may have a guild invite you on one of their raids just for you to get your Epic piece, such as what happened with me joining Legend of Marr against the General or one of my guildmates being helped by Tindi Losi in Chardok.  The possibilities are there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Having the respect from these guilds goes along way to completing a major quest if you need help doing it.<br>

Yes, but its a month that you can still play and raid and enjoy the game when these mobs arent available.<br>

<br>
Maybe, but make them a combinable quest and there can be no MQ...Make the container cleric only. Now a DIFFERENT cleric has to get all 4 items and combine to MQ with the alt cleric's king note.<br>
<br>
Now again I say that there is NOTHINg we can do to change the camp itself. There are MANY ways it COULD be changed to make it better, but until that happens, I think we have a very good system. I have arguments still about certain things, but theyve all been hashed and rehashed a billion times on this board so I wont get into them.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, if you cant find a way to deal with our system, then youre SOL...cause ours is the best of all the servers from what Ive read. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

IF The Rathe had FFA Ragefires, the odds against your getting your epic would be even more slim since the times that you *could* you'd have to deal with people who would kill it within minutes (if not seconds) of when it spawned.  At least on The Rathe, people are civil enough to make sure you get your shot.  You don't have to actually be playing when Ragefire spawns... you can have someone else loot it for you (your brother/sister, for example).  I'm not 100% versed on the camp, but I thought that the spawn is fairly predictable.  In that case, just have someone you trust sit at your computer at home and loot the thing when Ragefire dies.  Hopefully VI will change Ragefire to a triggered spawn and solve the issue for real.<br>
<br>
The Planes question was answered as well.  Everyone elligible is guaranteed 1 day of access to each plane.  However, if there are days that aren't reserved, those days are FCFS.  It is possible that you can go into PoF or PoH many, many times a month based on the availability of unreserved days but everyone who can post is guaranteed 1 day that everyone will respect their reservation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzahrimxealdabooboos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/3/02 2:42:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  if the change epics, they dont need to make them harder.

<br>
Our guild is not likely to qualify anytime soon for RTA planable status, for many reasons, mostly because the core members have a different attitude about the game.<br>
<br>
However, I strongly support the RTA system we have on this server, I keep an eye on what is happening so that I can find raids for our guild members who need assistance on planable items and epic peices.<br>
<br>
My guild is not on rotation nor do we have posting status on the calendar, but it hasn't inhibited our play at all. If you are civil to people and helpful, those same guilds you are criticizing will be happy to take you along and help you out to do things you might not otherwise be able to do.<br>
<br>
And I would like to point out that if Broken doesn't like the social conventions on this server, there are many more servers to try out, they all have their own unique social conventions.<br>

Guy has some friends in BoTS and hates the FFA action going on on their server where all the big guilds wipe out the big kills within an hour of spawning.<br>
<br>
With the RTA even though it may seem a allmighty crushing fist, the smaller guilds have a chance at least of getting the mobs rather than being run over by the larger guilds while you are forming up.<br>
<br>
Heck even Vox &amp; Nagafen don't last an hour if someone finds out they have spawned.  Here, they could be up for 10-12 hours or more waiting for guild on rotation to come get them.<br>
<br>
If I'm wrong on some points its because I only have one planable toon and have not had to deal with the specifics with RTA.<br>
<br>
So, in parting.  At least smaller guilds have a chance.  If you don't have enough people on your own to make rotation, talk to some of the other smaller guilds that are in the same boat and get an alliance going.  It works until you have enough force and you make friends in the process. <p><HTML><BODY><center>

Can't I train your ass back to the stone age? It's part of the content that everyone should be able to experience. <br>
<br>
And was this post even about the RTA? Or was it just some sort of tricky way to get another &quot;New Ragefire Plan&quot; post up.<br>
<br>
Most of your points seemed to be filler questions &quot;how many how much whos what&quot; Then you went into the standard content questions, all refering to ragefire pretty much, then hell why not tie it up with some revolution talk! &quot;Take down the Tyrants of the rathe!&quot; ye buddy congrats on getting no where with your post. <br>

<br>
the *new and improved, triggered Ragefire* requires that a Cleric is at that point in the Quest to finish their Epic.<br>
<br>
IE:  they MUST have the Chardok Note and the Pearl from Sol B.<br>
<br>
The Rathe's &quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; asked the same.<br>
<br>
Hmmm... I think that the Rathe and it's RTA has a profound influence on this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 458<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/9/02 1:52:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> And wasn't Roggie babbling about wishing for a 'turn in mob to spawn Ragefire'?<br>
