Myself, I am neither democrat or republican,  politicians from both sides have so bastardized the way laws are made in this country, it makes a mockery of the constitution. Michael Moore will not say that though, he would rather have handouts to who HE wants them to go to, not do do away with handouts altogether and make people take care of themselves. And i find it amusing he still has an e-mail address with &quot;flint&quot; imbedded in it.

But it is NOT a political issue and is not something to be used as ammunition against capitolism.  George Bush's and many others integrity was tested and reassured when Ken Lay called him and Alan Greenspan for help and was turned down dispite the many campeign contributions.  The democrats were outraged that someone in political office didn't succomb to the same corruption that the head chairman of the democratic party succombed to when Global Crossing colapsed just after Enron.  Ya check that out on the back page.../finger biased liberal media.<br><br>FYI I worked for Enron here in Houston for a year and a half, if it weren't for that I wouldn't have met my close friend (Valasca 50 druid) who introduced me to Everquest.  We both worked for Enron Oil and Gas which was sold about 2 years ago. It was a good place to work for back then, but when they started selling off their oil production subsidiaries I got a bit wary and took a state job, boy am I ever glad I did.<br> <p><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/sigs/sig2.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulordhavemercy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Have Mercy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>He of the Nifty Name</span><br>  Posts: 3028<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 11:37:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqchak.homestead.com/files/def.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> lmao, im sorry but there is too much stereotypical amircan attitude in these replys to ignore.<br><br>my main riff is this, why is that to an average american, the word socialist and communist are some kind of insult that imply you are evil? lol!<br><br>If it wasnt for socialists you would still have 13year old kids getting their arms cut off in machines in sweatshops.<br><br>If it wasnt for socialists there would be no minimum wage,  everyone that did minimum wage jobs would be making slave wages.<br><br>If it wasnt for socialists buisness' would have no responsibility to the worker's health/safety/retirement/ect ect<br><br>Why is it that so many people consider the words Socialist/Communist some kind of insult?<br><br>Have either one of you read anthing about work condidtions prior to socialist influences like Unions? <br>Heh.

Bush did nothing because public officials are NOT allowed to announce inside information that may cause companies to colapse. You never know, Enron could have recovered..if Bush had said something everyone would have sold the stock and would have caused much more damage than was already inevidable.  Yes his informing us would have actually CAUSED Enron's colapse rather than exposing the Enron executives for the crooks they really are either way it was too late..and no matter what people who invested millions were already out.  There's nothing Bush could have or should have done.<br><br>Captitolism is what makes this nation great.  It's what fuels progress.  w/o the promise  of profit and self achievement companies and individuals have no good reason to search for new and better ways of doing things.  Without Capitolism we wouldn't have ball point pens, disposable pens and razors, that machine that cleans up the ice skating rink, x-ray machines, cars, all the latest medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, new and innovative treatment meathods, EverQuest, and OH so much more.  Socialism IS bad because it dilutes motivation, innovation, and the drive to progress the world around you in your own individual way.  Everyone has the option to live the way they want to live, its up to them to put in that old fashioned thing we call work and effort to do it. Individualism = Freedom. <p><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/sigs/sig2.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umuidas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MUIDAS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Legionairre</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:04:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> Dick Cheney refusing to come clean will be the downfall of the Bush administration.  <br><br>And Chakan is correct about a lot of his statements.

Well, heck if she votes or holds that women have the same civil rights as men, then she is a feminist, or if she should get paid the same as a man doing the same job = feminist too. I suppose that is the price for getting an &quot;F&quot; in sex.<br><br>The Enron issue is just as ugly as all the issues thrown at the Clinton administration. <br>Chinese lobbyists = enron lobbyists<br>whitewater = enron<br>hiding documents over health care reform = hiding documents over enron.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> same stuff, different political party this time.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br><br>Thinking that they are different is selective amnesia. And the bias of media in the US is very right wing. Yes, right wing. Live in any other country in the world, and you will recognize how narcissistic and right wing the media and politics in america is. <br><br>And actually the labor unions in america were the ones that got 40 hour weeks, 2 day weekends, sick leave, holiday pay, child labor laws, pension and health care for the common working folks. It was the labor unions that struggled to achieve enough salary for the common worker, so that his wife could stay home and raise children (like the upperclass folks could do. The majority of all wives in america worked while raising children until the early 20th century). It is selective amnesia that causes folks to forget and deny that. Since, most labor unionists were also socialists and communists, it is common to ignore the unions and believe that those social issues and accomplishments were the result of the political affiliations of the unionists.<br><br>PS.

They have helped spur on capitolism, and improved working conditions giving more people the motivation to succeed.<br><br>People have this distorted view of capitolism being viewed as greed.  If you knew how much hard work most of the CEO's of every major corperation went through to get where they are you'd think quite differently.  Capitolism isn't about greed, it's about individual achievement, hard work, and sacrifice.  I didn't get where I am right now by inheriting it from my parents or having it just land in my lap.  I worked HARD.  And if anybody is envious of that then that should spur them on to work just as hard.  Sometimes people fail and fall flat on their face, all I can say is get up and dust yourself off.  If Stephen King hadn't done that I doubt anybody would have a clue as to who he is. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulieah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lieah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=70896971&img=5" BORDER=0> at: 2/8/02 12:42:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucowardlymonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cowardly Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Black Reaver</span><br>  Posts: 1139<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:52:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> Funny, when unions were being formed they were seen as the antithesis of Capitalism and the &quot;American Way of Life&quot;.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushjekai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shjekai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/lurk /lurking leeeezard</span><br>  Posts: 1037<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:57:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.alloftheabove.net/images/CAHR/PicsSprinkledAroundSite/HobbesFace.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> You can work hard, achieve and sacrifice and be communist, socialist or whatever. <br>The fact that money, power and material possesions of any kind are what drives our culture isn't neccessarily a good thing.  <p><bold>Shjekai </bold> 57th Iksar Shaman<BR>Striders of Lore<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85250>Magelo</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaskander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Askander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I can beat up Bruin, np</span><br>  Posts: 1157<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:58:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> I think the problem is today that you can't say Corporation and ethics in the same sentence.  Problem is I don't know why business ethics is an oxymoron.   I suppose it boils down to most that have the drive for power in the corporate environ just don't have much room for ethics or treating their customers with respect. I know these are generalizations and that there are nice companies out there but it's hard not to be jaded about these sorts of things now a days.  I don't think capitalism is bad but in a society driven by our business there should be certain checks and balances to the whole thing.  Maybe corporate america should have been another branch of govt. lol <p><SELECT><OPTION SELECTED>Askander Bladebane (37) -  Cleric of Bruins Maruaders<OPTION>Balamorm SolRendyr (24) - Fuzzy Warrior of Bruins Marauders (Now with new and improved fuzziness)<OPTION>Althain Truetone (20) - Way-too-happy Bard of Sovereign Storm<OPTION>Askander Bladebane(not very creative am I?) - Sneaky Thane of Entwined Faith, Percival<OPTION>Email - - - joshlafaber@tigeraircraft.com</SELECT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucowardlymonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cowardly Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Black Reaver</span><br>  Posts: 1140<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:58:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> BUT, before I am seen as being on a Lieah-Bashing streak, I do think she is correct in one thing.<br><br>Socialist governments of the type envisioned by Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky will always fail.<br><br>The above-average person of exceptional intelligence/ability is not properly rewarded for their job.<br><br>The middle class will never perform as they should because they will constantly have their noses rubbed in the fact that they are considered equal to the lazy, shiftless and stupid.<br><br>And in a society where everyone is considered equal the only motivation will be self-motivation.
