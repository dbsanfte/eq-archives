<br>
The air in the dark room was stifling, with no windows and only a few candles for illumination. The walls had roots sticking out from the trees above growing above, and the occasional eye was poked if one was not too careful. Sweat pored from the massive bodies gathered in this room, as they diligently pored over ripped and tattered tomes. Most pretended to read, as they fidgeted on their chairs (actually, just large stones plopped on the ground). Truth be told, most of them could not read in the first place, and as such would be held back another year in their studies when finals were over. <br>
However, there were the exceptional few that could read, and did not fidget as much as the others. One such student was squinting in the dim light, trying his best to memorize the last spell for his final test. Excitement was racing through his veins, because passing this test meant he would be able to go out beyond Innothule Swamp with the raiding parties. The young pupil was on his last rote, when the instructor called out his name.<br>
&quot;Flek,&quot; started the instructor, &quot;Is you reddy to takes da final test?&quot;<br>
Normally, Flek would shrug his shoulders and mumble a response to his teacher's questions. This teacher was a little shorter than most trolls, which is probably why he was never on any raiding parties, and stuck in a dark, dank classroom instructing young shadowknights in the finer art of casting spells, for the glory of Innourouk. This day, Flek hesitated in his response, and when he regained his composure, excitedly squealed out his affirmation that he was ready. Some of the other students guffawed at the diminutive pitch of his voice, but he did not care. He would show them all. <p>Ninam Skiewalker<br>

<br>
A week had passed since Flek's final exam, but the excitement was still ebbing through his veins.  The young troll had been dispatched with a small group of warriors, fellow shadow knights and a shaman to teach the orcs of Southern Ro Desert a lesson.  What exactly that lesson was, Flek did not know.  He was sure that much pain and death would ensue, and he eagerly looked forward to being such an instrument.<br>
After cleaning some local yard trash in Innothule Swamp, the party made their way to entrance of Southern Ro Desert.  Flek's party was highly cautioned against bothering Andad Filla, an estranged human standing watch just inside the Desert.  Noone knew why he was there, but the elders spoke of influences with bards.  What good is a bard anyway, thought Flek.  <br>
The band of trolls made their not so quietly to a small camp of orcs.  Among the residents of this small, there was one orc that struck Flek as a little odd from the others.  He was not wearing any heavy armor, and the weapon he carried did not appear as fierce as the others.  Then it struck Flek's pea-sized brain like a flash of lightning: this was a cleric. While Flek's people spoke of clerics as weak and pathetic compared to the troll's shaman guild members, Flek read (limited be it) about clerics.  He read a cleric can greatly turn the tide of battle simply by casting a spell of healing on his mates, making a near dead foe appear refreshed and as if never harmed. He also read of their offensive spell casting abilities. which could stun a foe and render that foe useless for a brief time in combat.  Flek's stomach knotted, his brain ached as he lingered on battle with such a foe. <br>
&quot;Me make sure not to get in his way,&quot; muttered Flek.<br>
&quot;Wat joo says, Flek?&quot; whispered the shaman.<br>
&quot;Umm, me says me am redy wen joos guys are,&quot; grinned Flek.<br>
&quot;Oky doky,&quot; started the shaman. &quot;Let's hit dat punee kleric first, and den slotter da rest!&quot;<br>
And with that, the shaman cast a spell of poison on the cleric.  The warriors in Flek's party let out their battle cries, rushed to the cleric and started their beating. This of course was met with retaliation from the three orcs warriors that were with the cleric.  Flek concentrated a disease spell, and bent all his thought on completing the spell on the first warrior to reach the bustle.<br>
FIZZLE.<br>
&quot;Wut da...?&quot; Flek thought, as his first attempt failed. &quot;Hmmm, Master said dis mite happen, me tries again.&quot;<br>
FIZZLE.<br>
FIZZLE.<br>
Flek was beside himself. Had Innoruuk left him, had he failed the god in his faith? No, Flek knew he was faithful. He just needed more practice. No time for that now, as his friends were taking a beating. The shaman was having all he could do to heal the warriors, when one of the orc warriors turned his attention on the shaman.  Now the shaman was in trouble, as the orc warrior ran unnoticed from the fray, and commenced beating on the poor defenseless shaman.<br>
Flek reacted quickly, and immediately jumped on the orc's back, pummeling the creature in the head and neck. Both combatants fell to the ground, and Flek was first on his feet.<br>
&quot;Joo momma gots no teeth!!&quot; taunted Flek, trying to further distract the creature from his fight with the shaman. <br>
This seemed to work, as the orc roared and leaped at Flek. At the last moment, Flek noticed the small dagger in the orc's right hand.  A flash of shield, and the attack was deflected.  That's when the left hook came in, and almost floored Flek.  Fortunately, Flek also took time to keep himself in shape with practicing the melee arts.  After regaining his fighting stance, Flek launched a vicious assault on the orc. The battle seemed to last for hours, and Flek was unaware of the rest of his group during his personal fight.  <br>
Flek was bleeding pretty badly, as was the orc, when Flek felt weariness coming upon him.  He could barely lift his club, let alone deflect the orc's advances. The orc warrior seemed to have no loss of stamina, even through his great loss of blood.  Flek knew he was in trouble, but did not want his party to think him weak and feeble against one pathetic orc.  When the toppling blow came, and Flek found himself sprawled upon the ground, with no energy left to lift himself up, he knew he was done for.<br>
A blood-curdling cry rang out in the air, and all eyes turned to see what caused the disturbance. As Flek's opponent turned to watch the orc cleric finally felled by the troll warriors, the shaman launched a spell of healing on Flek.  This greatly lifted Flek's spirit, as well as his life force.  Flek sprang up, swung down upon the orc's head with his club, and stepped back to watch the orc's brain matter ooze through his ears, as his lifeless corpse hit the ground with a sickeng thud.<br>
