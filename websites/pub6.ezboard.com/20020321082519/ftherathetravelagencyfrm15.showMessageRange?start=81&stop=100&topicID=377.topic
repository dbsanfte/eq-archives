I'm grateful that people are beginning to realize just what kind of a dishonorful liar Alistriwen really is and the reason that he posted this garbage to make a name for himself on our server while hurting someone who has earned his reputation since beta3.<br>
<br>
P.S. edit<br>
   Something important I forgot to mention: The lame first paragraph that I first posted with the whole caste thing was meant strictly for Alistriwen and no one else. Those who know me I'm not an elitist, but exactly the opposite. I have nothing but respect for newer players.<br>
<br>
 It was all in a fit of rage that I had when I saw my reputation being slandered. I apologize because I now realize how offensive it probably seemed to most people. It was meant strictly to hurt Alistriwen as he tried to hurt me. Thanks.<br>

Lukieb's post was sarcastic incase you didn't get the idea. I'd have you know several people on server have sent me tells showing support for ME and distaste for you and all your lame ass remarks.<br>
<br>
Now to the rebuttles.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright @#%$. I am through trying to sort this @#%$ out. You were not god damned trained and you know it. You @#%$ died in an altercation with a guildy of mine. Your log shows your puller saying he had adds, Bogardan is saying give my mobs back. I don't see a train, I see your word against his. It was a badly handled mix up where you died. You bring my guild in this which has nothing to do with the situation, you insult me when I defend my guildy and ask reasonable questions and make some reasonable observations. &quot;<br>
<br>
You're two nonsensical posts were my favorite to read. Again you make the statement &quot;I didn't read the posts nor do I intend on doing so!&quot; Notice Gambitis says adds got trained, not look guys I brought adds.  I never brought your guild into this, they brougt themselves into it by replying to this post. You contradict yourself when you say I didn't die due to training, and then say I did die due to an altrication with your guildie. Make up your mind. You're first post was an insult to my intelligence. You didn't bother reading the posts before you posted your own reply. I appologize for going off the lid, but that made me so angry you could not imagine. I can respect that you are probably not a bad person, and I can be the big person and apologize. I wronged you when I flamed you because you did make your points in a calm if somewhat innacurate manner. Your last post was not as calm but it was retaliation.<br>
<br>
Corso we've already determined Bogardarn is slow, that's probably why it took him so long. He did not go around breaking mezzes one after the other in rapid succession. He broke one, watched the spider aggro, made a lame comment, looked around for another mezzed one, probably had some trouble targeting considering that many of the mobs were on top of eachother. It would not take a long time if they were all lined up and individual, but they were not. He also did not do it rapidly probably because he did not choose to do so. It proves nothing. <br>
<br>
Bogardarn, when I find the remaining members of the group, and have them tell it as it was, you will have nothing left. You could have salvaged any standing opinion I had of you had you just owned up and said my bad. Now  you have been a jerk, and have clearly demonstrated your lack of respect for anyone but yourself. <br>
<br>
As for the guy who said my signatures suck... Tell that to the wife, she has a BIG hammer.<br>
<br>
Edit:Oh yeah, for anyone who thinks he did not train me, consider this: If Bogardarn did me no wrong, and he did not train me, or do any of the things I said, what would be my motive for posting anything here? To hurt Bogardarn? Nope, I just met him that night, and besides for what he did, nothing he said was really bad enough to make me angry enough to do anything. I haven't had a running feud with Bogardarn or any other reason to flame him other than the fact he DID do what I said he did. Thundax if he/she is anywhere can tell you Aabramms complained to him/her about Bogardarn, so is he lying too? To be honest, if I were flaming someone for what they said, I would have flamed Papasula because she was far nastier to my group and myself. So give me a break, the guy did it, now he's denying it when his hands are so red he could paint with them. <br>

Bogardarn I'm going to put this behind me, and for both our sakes I think you should too.  You proved to be a worthy adversary in this flame most of the time. This flame wont take up any more bandwith I hope. =) <br>

Appologies to anyone I insulted along the way.. it was a flame. =)<br>

Happy hunting.<br>

Edit: Any enchanters who say they make good pullers, I'd be glad to take lessons. Not that I'm going to try it any time soon, but it might be interesting to see. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/calalis.jpg"</img> <br>

I dont know either of you.  for all i know its just a miss understanding<br>
however i just needed to reply on a couple of Bogardans remarks <br>
1st  I did not at any point train your group because it is impossible to train someone being a paladin.    <br>
Ive been Trained by more pallies then i can count.<br>
2nd When you hit a messed mob it aggroes on the chanter right away no matter what if it wasn't taunted or rooted. <br>
this is not true  as a pally you should know  when you stun a pally specially with a 49+ stun spell, 90% of the time it will agro on the pally.<br>
<br>
again Im not taking sides.<br>
<br>
But these arguements are not the best defence. <p>Rathermon Briteblade<BR>

<br>
#1.  Breaking a chanters mez. <br>
<br>
You do this to me, I'll load aoe mem blur and bring you a party..<br>
<br>
#2. Chanters make the best pullers, especially in velks. Spiders are whimpy as hell, other then there back stabs. Dont like those! Best exp is when a chanter pulls and keeps all the tanks busy.<br>
<br>
And Uther, you dumb ass, you can train spiders just fine in frenzy/fw, as a pally, or anything else. My guess is, you went around and smacked each spider, brought it to a group who was just standing there with no mobs they were attacking. <br>
<br>
This guy gets no sympathy from me, for the simple fact he broke mez's to kill the chanter, and he has a dumb ass like Uther defending him.<br>
<br>
And no, I don't have any issues with Tindi, but they sure do have a bunch of idiots comeing out of the closet on this one. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52121><br>Slinkity<br>59 Beguiler</a>

<br>
First off sam's loyalty lies with BotS not the triad bog. How long has the triad been dead?<br>
<br>
Second, obviously you pulled thru their group or they wouldnt have had to mez any of your pulled mobs. Thats just bad pulling imo. You can steal mobs from a camp without pulling thru a group. If you did this to one of my groups you'd end up with lots of dead mobs.<br>
<br>
Third, paladins can pull with the best of them, especially if they want to train someone. Just DA and then aggro whatever mobs you see and pull thru the group you want to train.<br>
<br>
And finally for the person who wanted info on how a chanter can pull, talk to neurosiis. He is one of the best pullers ive seen and to date his groups are by far the best exp groups I have been in. <p> [b]Trivilus Nightblade[/b]

This whole not trying to flame people thing sucks I just can't have fun anymore. <br>
<br>
I would disagree that enchanters are the best pullers in exp groups. Then again who cares about exp groups, a 2 fingered monky trained to hit the arrow keys and the &quot;a&quot; button could level to 60. No no no I wasn't trying to flame Haisama either.<br>

Anyways this flame is so cool I just want it to go on and on forever. <br>
