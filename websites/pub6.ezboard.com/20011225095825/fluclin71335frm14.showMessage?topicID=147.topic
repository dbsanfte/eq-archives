Is this true??? Are they still good in RVR? And what did they make weaker about the archers??<br>
<br>
This was the article<br>
<br>
I have a 35 hunter,<br>
<br>
Everyone was complaining about sniper RvR...so they nerfed archer PvE...that makes sence....NOT.<br>
<br>
Before hunters were a solid solo class(not good in group play...not enough damage output).<br>
<br>
<br>
But now soloing is hard. miss rate has gone through the roof..and it is just dang hard to be an archer right now. They really did screw with the class. It was not enough that I could spend 30-50 gold a night on arrows....but now soloing blues are a risky prospect.<br>
<br>
I am kinda disappointed with the way they tuned the archers when it was only PvP from purples on grays that was the problem.....<br>

There was 1 red to me and was hitting me for 300+ and I know they hit some of the other guys lower then I was for 500+ which basically took them out in 1 hit.<br>
<br>
For some reason I have a tough time swallowing, that they are having a hard time soloing blues or at least its &quot;risky&quot;.  I know what kind of damage they do to me.  And I also know what kind of damage they do to others.  Especially in rvr PVE.  I can't tell you how ticked off I get when they decloak shoot me with 2 arrows and I'm dead...  Before I have a chance to see them.<br>
I've also been in a group with a hunter that can shoot yellows dead before the get into the group (not that you would pull yellows, exps in a group would be horrible.)  But we were trying to get a mob to pop that was surrounded by yellow con mobs to me (which was probably a bit higher to him now that I think of it).<br>
<br>
Also, really they say any class should be able to solo blues and maybe yellows.  This game is really based on grouping though...  <br>
<br>
Last night I was gritting my teeth hoping they would adjust them a bit more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Not good.<br>
<br>
Personally I think archers are fine as they were.  A red con caster would probably be doing just as much damage to people and once a tank closes with an archer, it's all over.  Archers cannot melee their way out of a papersack for the most part.  People need to learn to keep Bladeturn type spells up at all times in the Frontiers.  It really sucks for the archer that spends minutes getting into range while hidden to see that critical shot get absorbed by a magical shield. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally I tried a ranger for a while and found it to be slow and boring.  Takes a long time to draw that bow string, and half the time you find out you are out of range and have to start all over.  I much prefer just letting loose with a bellow to pull. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Primary archers were able to hit monsters too easily.  This was mostly a problem one orange+ monsters where other classes began to miss noticeably (especially on purples) and archers were still able to hit relatively well.  This needed to be balanced, and they attempted to do so.<br>
<br>
There is some validity in all of the crybaby response, however.  I will post my own personal observations.<br>
<br>
The balance was intended to affect accuracy on orange+ while solo and red+ while grouped.  I have personally noticed my accuracy on blue-yellow drop significantly, to the point where I will have streaks up to two hours long where my accuracy is around 50%.  If I miss my first two shots on a blue, there is no way I am going to kill it.  With a percentage like that, this is happening about 1/4 of the time (luckily, I rarely solo).<br>
<br>
The bigger problem, in my opinion, as a grouping player, is there seems to be some minor bug with bows in groups.<br>
<br>
First, let me explain how grouping works.  The more players that are in a group, the higher chance you have to hit a mob.  This is so a group full of 8 players can, as they should be able to, take out medium purple mobs.  If none of them could hit, as they wouldn't be able to solo, it wouldn't matter how many of them there were, they would never be able to touch a medium purple mob and would be stuck killing red-low purple mobs (not all that exciting or efficient for 8 well balanced players).<br>
<br>
The bug seems to be that bow attacks are not getting this inherent to-hit grouping bonus.  So, in a group that is killing medium purple, archers are becoming shunned because they simply are unable to hit the mobs that everybody else can hit (while grouped).  I have tested this over and over and see a very strong trend.  If I miss 6+ shots in a row, which happens on every high purple mob, I will whip out my dagger and go in to attack, and suddenly I am hitting 50+% of the time.  Just today I had Meshy look at my screen as I had missed 6 shots in a row with the bow, and had enough time to hit the mob 3 times with my dagger (3 for 3) before it died.  We're not talking coincidence, we're talking very noticeable trend.<br>
<br>
This, no doubt, will be fixed, so the crybabies need to calm down.  The accuracy on blues/yellows is questionable - if I hit my first 2-3 shots on a blue/yellow, it's toast, usually before it gets to me (very strong), if I miss, I'm toast (very weak).  Archers may have to get used to being streaky soloers, because overall I am still able to solo at around the same efficiency as most other classes.  The miss rate on blues is a little too high in my opinion, but the other option to balance us out is to reduce our damage output directly and raise our accuracy back up, and I don't like that one bit.  I certainly don't mind failing my stealthy assassination attempts because I miss once or twice when compared to the feeling of success  on those attempts.  If our damage output was directly lowered, we really wouldn't be able to assassinate-run or assassinate-hide anymore.<br>
<br>
That is all, you may continue your tour. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td align="center"><img src="http://daoc.estoncom.com/images/bishleef1.jpg" border="0" alt="Get yer foul tallard mouse cursor OFF OF ME!"></td><td align="center"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=3814"><font color="#FF2222" size="+2" face="tempus sans itc">Bishoopugget</font></a><br><font color="#44FF44">  Pappanug of the <a href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/bnuggetsofjustice"><font color="#44FF44">Nuggets of Justice</font></a>  </font><br><br><font color="#FF2222" size="+2" face="tempus sans itc">Leef</font><br><font color="#44FF44">  Littlenug of the <a href="http://sacrednut.com"><font color="#44FF44">Keepers of the Sacred Nut</font></a>  </font></td><td align="center"><img src="http://daoc.estoncom.com/images/leefsign1.jpg" border="0" alt="Praise the Nut!"></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uestaryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Estaryn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Evoker of the Teir'dal</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/01 4:12:37 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://estaryn.homestead.com/files/est1.gif HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Archers Nerfed???</span><hr size=1> i'm a lvl 33 hunter i own oranges<br>
