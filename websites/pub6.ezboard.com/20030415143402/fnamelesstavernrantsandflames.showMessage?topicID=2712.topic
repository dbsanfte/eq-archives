Poor people get thieved-</span><hr size=1> Last summer I was scammed and this summer the same person scammed a newbie. I forgot the newbies name but I remember the scammers name. I got some totamic armor got stole from me by this same guy. People just piss me off. The people are mostly Kinomar, Kanoelm, Kanoblaine, Brendara, etc. I dont know this guy but I trusted him on a buy/sell thing. He said he had a mule named Wwobmule (Winter wolves of bane mule), well, he said he'd pay 5k for a suit of totamic and pay on his mule. I gave him the armor, he logged, and never came back as the so called &quot;Wwobmule&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this summer, I was in trade lookin' for SoW potions and some newbie in chat said he was twinked and his items stolen by this Kino fella. Its so sad that innocent twinks and newbies are scammed by this dumbass split-personality jerk. I talked to him myself and he said &quot;The items are mine now! haha!&quot; I reported him and no GM's were on and then server announcement popped up saying they were goin down so I logged.<br>
<br>
I'm upset with this fool and I'm glad he doesnt remember me. Who else here has been scammed by someone or this person? I have only been scammed ONE other time but it was only 200 platinum last summer. What were your reactions to the scammers/individual?<br>
<br>
What is me reaction towards Kinomar and what comments should I have to say to him? I think he needs banned and all his accounts and split-personalities kicked off. MANY people have access to his account and thats another reason he needs banned, insecure account. I mean, I was banned for that but it was cause of someone hacking me, not from giving dozens of people my password for them to play on my account. Everytime I let my neighboor, brother, or sister on my account I change the password when they logout.<br>
<br>
Comments about scammers? Flames to KInomar? Put them here!<br>

<br>
Couple of facts:<br>
1. Kinomer and Kanoelm are RL husband and wife just as a little FYI. I used to be friends with someone that was in his pathetic excuse for a guild.<br>
<br>
2. I have never, will never, see a shittier shaman than Kinomer. Wait, I dont think Ive ever seen a shittier player of any class. Im not just ragging on the guy to rag. He is absolutely fucking horrible. Its laughable. He doesnt know how to heal. He doesnt know how to slow. He acts like hes soloing in group. Yeah thats it Kinomer, DoT that mob instead of slowing it. Total retard.<br>
<br>
3. Hes a greedy loot-whoring bastard. Its not surprising that he scams also. He fucking made someone pay him for the right to loot the sambata warstaff in DP. You know, the no-drop 8/18 no stats 1hb? I know someone is gonna say, he can do whatever he wants, his group killed the mob.... but thats bullshit. Its not like this is phAt LewT ntov drops. Its just fucking insane greed. Of course, I saw him two weeks later in ME, spamming the zone in /shout, begging to loot that wis belt. <br>
<br>
In short, Kinomer sucks Troll ass. He treats people like shit. And so does his wife. Ive never seen her act like an ass directly, but she sure doesnt mind him being a total dick. If I were her I would be embarrased to admit I know that sorry sack of crap.<br>
<br>
So, do TN a favor Kinomer, and go die. At least get banned or something plz~<br>

Anyways I was really upset when I posted this. I'm even more disappointed in this asshole. I seen him in /trade selling a backpack or the items that he stole off the newbie. I gladly bought them off him but did what he did to me, lied about the mule thing, got them back. Yup. The newbie was exactly right. All rygorr, +75 hp EARRINGS, runed frostblade etc., later I bumped into him and gave him the pack. He payed me 150 platinum but I gave it back saying &quot;Its all in a days work man.&quot;. He bowed and waved. He also asked to remain anonymous about this. He said not to post his name, so I'll be nice and I wont. Really was a nice cheery fellow, dont know why he wouldnt want his name posted. Anyways I hope Kinodick learned a lesson. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvengeancebladeofthenameless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vengeanceblade Of The Nameless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(6/12/02 3:50:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2712.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: add</span><hr size=1> Hmm couldnt edit my post but forgot to throw in:<br>

Thats all I'll say for now. Its not a log its just what I recall with some peoples names taken out. Its not fixed but its almost what happened. I didnt throw in the profane language. He spammed everyone and also griefed off some Gnoll Chain armor. I hope he goes to DAoC. He'll be unpopular there and see what hell really is like. I cant believe he lied like he did. The newbie was the one at the hospital, not him. Hes a complete asshole.

Seeings he would have to start over. New name with another chance.<br>
So still fuck the Name Change VI put into effect.  If no one has done anything wrong wtf would they need a name change? All their friends would be clueless on what happened to their bud and then having to tell all who he was, so IMO it's a dumb ass excuse saying &quot;innocent people&quot; 90% of the population that fork over the 50 bucks to get their named change I'll bet anything they are getting rid of their rep. just so they can start over fucking people over.  But thats just my opinion.<br>
