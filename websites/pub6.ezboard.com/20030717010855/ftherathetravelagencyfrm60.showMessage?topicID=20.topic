Since I'm about to start the epic, I figured I would at least post a composite of all the information that I can gather. It would help me keep things in check as well as a good quick look up for me and other necros.<br>

Herbalist in Chardok<br>
The Herbalist that drops the mansi herb has been moved a while ago. Instead of being near the royals, it is in a house that is supposedly much easier to get to. The PH is called the Di'zok Herbalist. The Grand Herbalist Mak'ra is supposed to be the mob that drops the herb needed. I am not too familiar with Chardok because I haven't hunted in there. If anyone knows the whereabouts of this location, please post a reply. Supposedly this mob is on a 3 hour spawn. Although a single group of high 50's can do this area, it is still risky. A second group would be recomended. Behind this house that contains the PH for the herbalist, is an unmezzable sarnak that flurrys. Wizened Herb Collector was the unmezzable one. When looking at the front door, he is off to the left and behind the building in a tunnel, but easily viewable. Heads up for that one. <br>
<br>
On the second of these images he is in the square room in the middle of the map. There is an entrance to the building from the right hand side.<br>
<br>
Here is a post from someone that pulled the area and how he did it:<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
As for pulling, this is how I did it.<br>
Level 57 warrior (me). I used distance aggro for the most part. Walk up til you get aggro then run back to the group. I did bow shoot the Wizened guy though and had 2 from the house dump into my pull, so we had 3 (house was a PH).<br>
<br>
We were one group with 59 enc. I don't recall any bad pulls happening after we pulled the house, but we did have spawns or chain aggro somewhere as we had adds coming to us for a little bit, before they finally stopped.<br>
<br>
As for getting there, I think the easiest way is (take this with a grain of salt mind you).<br>
<br>
- Fight down to the first bridge. DMF up. Drop down there. Fight that stuff (1-2). <br>
- Take a right and fight that path (get the Captain and Bridge Keeper if up, otherwise just walk by them - by walking past, I mean don't turn right into their corridor, just keep on going straight the way you were). <br>
- Once you come to the T, choose the path going down (left). Follow that all the way to the next crossroad.<br>
- Take a right<br>
- After that you should run right into the herbie, but I'm not 100% sure. We usually go left and hit the treasury instead, but I am told that right takes you to the herbalist.<br>
<br>
A FD puller is great, but really, a warrior could do most of it. Up to that point, 1 pull of 4 was possible, but the rest was 1-2 pulls.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I would highly recommend each group that goes down there to have an evaccer just in case something goes wrong. Also, it is recommended to pull the mobs COUNTER-CLOCKWISE due to pathing. This may reduce the amount of adds per pull.<br>
Also, I do believe that the mansi-herb CAN be MQ'ed.<br>
<br>
Info on the Brain of Cazic Thule<br>
This seems to be the bottleneck for the necro epic. It's a rare as hell drop from the golems in Fear. It can drop off of any of the 3 golems, but there have been more reported droppings from Terror. People have gone on dozens of Fear raids and have not seen it drop. Patience is needed for this one. <br>
<br>
<br>
Eye of Inny<br>
Used to drop off of Inny himself, but was changed a while ago, so now it also drops off of the boss mobs. Haven't heard anything too bad about this one. Here is a quote on the subject:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
Each mini-boss will drop three pieces of class specific armor, or 2 pieces and another drop. All of them have a chance to drop that gem that rangers need for their epic (shattered emerald of corruption?)<br>
<br>
They are: <br>
Ashenbone Broodmaster, drops an SK shield and necro focus book.<br>
Coercer T'Vala, enchanter armor.<br>
Avatar of Abhorrence, rogue armor. I got my WS BP and arms off of this guy, and a vexthorne.<br>
Grandmaster R'Tal. He is a monk class mob. He has a monk name. But he drops indicolite and scaled leggionaires. <br>
High Priest M'Kari, he drops cleric armor.<br>
Lord of Ire, some crappy sk sword and a shield.<br>
Lord of Loathing, I have personally never seen this guy drop anything.<br>
Magi P'tasa, AKA the magician bottleneck. Drops magician armor and very rarely the staff of elemental mastery: earth.<br>
Mistress of Scorn drops bard armor, and fire focus staff. <br>
Master of Spite drops a druid scimitar and shaman armor<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any of these mobs has a chance of dropping the Eye. Maestro of Rancor also seems to be a mob that may drop the Eye.<br>
<br>
Plain of Air subquest<br>
<br>
Quest: Cloak of Spiroc Feathers<br>
Item: Silver disc comes from island 2<br>
Item: Spiroc Feathers(the item's name is plural, but just a single spiroc feather is needed) comes from island 3<br>
Item: Black Silk Cape comes from Island 4 off of the Keeper of Souls, the boss of the island.<br>
<br>
After you have all 3, get back to island 1(you can leave a corpse, jump off, and get ported back up if you wish to continue moving in PoA), and buy the Veeshan key (1cp key). This brings you to the quest room. Talk to Drakis the Bloodcaster. Ask him you wish to talk to Jzil(sp?). Drakis will despawn and Jzil will spawn in his stead. Ask Jzil you want to do the test of power (I believe this is the one), just to make sure you have all that you need. Hand him the 3 items and get your cloak of Spiroc Feathers.<br>
<br>
How to get to the 3rd island solo<br>
After you turn in what you need to Drendico Mettlebones (he's located up on the mountains to the right of the docks where the boat to OT comes in Tim Deep), you need to go back to Lake Rathe. Kazen will show you the epic(not really, but in text it says he pulls it out and taunts you with it) and will give it to you if you do one last task. You need take the Tome of Instruction and give it to Gzaalk(sp?) who is on the 3rd island in PoA. Normally, you would need to get a couple groups together and clear the way to 3rd, but I found a way you can get there w/o it. <br>
<br>
1. Aquire a knockback item(chetarri ward staff works really nice). <br>
2. Get a wizard to port you up to Sky. <br>
3. Buy the Key of Swords from the key master. This costs 200 to 250pp depending on charisma. Make sure the wizard also buys a key.<br>
4. Use the key on one of the pods to take you to efreeti island. It's the one with the windmill.<br>
5. If you look out from the ramp of the windmill, you will see the 3rd island(one filled with Gorgalasks(sp?).<br>
6. Set up on the edge of the efreeti island with your back to the 3rd island and facing the windmill.<br>
7. Have the wizzy duel you with the chetari ward staff(or whatever knockback effect you use). Make sure you aren't too close to the edge when you start or you might get meleed off. Although it may not look like you will make it, you will easily.<br>
8. When the knockback procs, you will be sent flying off the efreeti island and easily land on the Gorg island. <br>
9. Go to the temple thing on that island and turn in the tome to Gzalk.<br>
10. Then jump off and proceed back to Lake Rathe from the final turn in to get your epic. Grats!<br>
<br>
