<br>
1.FINE--------This is the word we use at the end of an argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a women looks.This will cause you to have one of those arguments.<br>
<br>
2.FIVE MINUTES------This is half an hour.It is equivalent to the five mins. your football game is going to last before you take out the trash,so we feel it is an even trade.<br>
<br>
3.NOTHING--------If you ask us what's wrong and we say nothing this means something and you better be on your toes.&quot;Nothing&quot; is used to describe the feeling a women has when she wants to turn you inside out,upside down and backwards.&quot;Nothing&quot; usually signifies an argument that will last &quot;Five Minutes&quot; and ends with the word &quot;Fine&quot;.<br>
<br>
4.GO AHEAD(with raised eyebrows)--------This is a dare.<br>
One that will result in the women getting upset over &quot;Nothing&quot; and will end with the word &quot;Fine&quot;<br>
<br>
5.GO AHEAD(normal eyebrows)-------This means &quot;I give up&quot; or &quot;do what you want because I don't care&quot;.You will get a raised eyebrow &quot;go ahead&quot; in a few minutes,followed by &quot;Nothing&quot; followed by &quot;Fine&quot;.She will talk to you in about &quot;Five minutes when she cools off.<br>
<br>
6.LOUD SIGH-------This is not actually a word but is still often a verbal statement &gt;very misunderstood by men.A &quot;Loud sigh&quot; means we think you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why we are wasting our time and arguing over &quot;Nothing&quot;.<br>
<br>
7.SOFT SIGH--------Again not a word,but a verbal statement.&quot;Soft Sighs&quot; are one of the few things that some men actually understand.We are content.Your best bet is not to move or breathe and we will stay content.<br>
<br>
8.THATS OKAY---------This is one of the most dangerous statments that a women can say to a man.<br>
&quot;Thats okay&quot; means that we want to think long and hard before paying you retribution for whatever it is that you have done.&quot;Thats Okay&quot;is often used with the word &quot;Fine&quot; and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow &quot;Go Ahead&quot;.At some point in the near future when we have planned and plotted, you are going to be in some big trouble.<br>
<br>
9.PLEASE DO----------This is not a statement,it is an offer.A women is giving you the chance to come up with what ever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is you have done.You have a fair chance to tell the truth,so be careful and you shouldn't get a &quot;Thats Okay&quot;.<br>
<br>
10.THANKS----------------A woman is thanking you.Do not faint,just say &quot;you are welcome&quot;.<br>
<br>
11.THANKS A LOT------------This is much different than &quot;Thanks.&quot; A women will say &quot;Thanks a lot&quot; when she is really ticked off with you.It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the &quot;Loud Sigh.&quot;Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the &quot;Loud Sigh&quot;,as she will only tell you &quot;Nothing&quot;. <br>

Yeah, they're all number one, on purpose.. Courtesy of Truelly.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up; you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.<br>
<br>
1. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!<br>
<br>
1. Sometimes we are not thinking about you! Live with it.<br>
<br>
1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br>
<br>
1. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.<br>
<br>
1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br>
<br>
1. Crying is blackmail.<br>
<br>
1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! JUST SAY IT!!<br>
<br>
1. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.<br>
<br>
1. Most guys own three pairs of shoes-tops. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?<br>
<br>
1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br>
<br>
1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br>
<br>
1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br>
<br>
1. Check your oil!! Please.<br>
<br>
1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br>
<br>
1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>
<br>
1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to answer.<br>
<br>
1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>
<br>
1. Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it's genetic.<br>
<br>
1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br>
<br>
1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br>
<br>
1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br>
<br>
1. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends.<br>
<br>
1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings . Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br>
<br>
1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br>
<br>
1. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br>
<br>
1. If we ask what is wrong and you say &quot;nothing,&quot; we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.<br>
<br>
1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br>
<br>
1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.<br>
<br>
1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.<br>
<br>
1. You have enough clothes.<br>
<br>
1. You have too many shoes.<br>
<br>
1. Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce Lee or some war flick where it doesn't really matter what the hell they're saying anyway.)<br>
<br>
1. It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz together. No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>
<br>
1. BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br>
<br>
1. I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.<br>
<br>
1. Equal rights is an oxymoron. <br>
<br>
1. Thanks you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that, it's like camping..<br>
