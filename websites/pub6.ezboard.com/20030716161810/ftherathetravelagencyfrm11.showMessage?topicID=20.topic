I'm totally not supprised that someone actually decided invoke that rule.<br>
<br>
I would think that CIW would forfit their round unless they helped KoP.  It seems only fair that if Qwai is holding everyone else up to a strict rules that he too should be held up to the rules:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If your group can not clear a plane, the responsibility falls on the reserving entity to get a hold of the Epic guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  KoP has 40 people to get the password, so therefore if they ask for help, CIW has to help.<br>
<br>
Thanks Qwai, I doubt if we would have known of CIW not wanting to follow the rules without your post.  You do the board a service by reporting your own guild.   <p><TABLE background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></TD><TD><P><font color="white">      "You will never become a Knight at this rate"<BR><BR><BR>"Me 'barsh.

<br>
Here's the exact text of the rule from the calendar page:<br>
<br>
If your group can not clear a plane, the responsibility falls on the reserving entity to get a hold of the Epic guilds.<br>
To qualify as an Epic guild/alliance, your organization has to have cleared island 6 in the plane of sky<br>
<br>
Intent: A list of these Epic guilds will be available, as will the links etc of the posting entities. It is left to the Epic guilds how they want to take turns, but all the resources needed are here. Again, I highly suggest communication, ESPECIALLY If you have a god up. This epic loot is what they want and is what this rule is ALL about. DO NOT LEAVE THAT PLANE WITH A GOD UP. Find out which Epic guild's turn it is etc etc. This is another rule where I feel violations will be highly policed. Communication is the key. <br>
<br>
....<br>
<br>
Everyone has been so fixated on the Gods that they've lost sight of what the Big Brother rule was originally intended for.  Clearing the plane EVERY time to ensure ALL the epic items (not just God Drops) can be looted if they drop.<br>
<br>
So no Qwai, no abuse.  <br>
<br>
If you want to decline to go up and clear the plane, fine.  There's no rule in place yet that says you get bumped to the back for declining to come up and clear the plane just because you won't get phat l3wt.<br>
<br>
This isnt' even an argument about 'spirit of the rules'.  The exact LETTER of the rule talks about epic loot and killing the god as two separate events.<br>

But I don't think CiW necessarily forfeits anything.  How can they?  There are NO RULES IN PLACE to handle how the epics do anything, because nobody has bothered to do that yet.<br>

But calling on the BB I guess is a choice.  It's better then having the plane go to waste.<br>
<br>
Although I feel that if no epic loot is rewarded then there is no reason CIW isn't still up.  Even the dumb clay for the warrior quest shouldn't count against CIW in this case.  Although it could be argued that if an epic got the hand of maestroe(rare) it may count.  Again....this is something we should discuss.<br>

If CiWs High Council members had taken the 30 seconds it required to explain to the Admins the situation I'm confident you would have been given the same go ahead FoR got... but then again... there was nothing to be gained by doing it eh?<br>

ok now thats clear.<br>
<br>
You choose to be a BB guild you are here to help those who cant accomplish it or have problems. <br>
<br>
FoR went up CR'd REsed and assisted a guild. THAT earned my respect. Did they get anything from it? Nope. <br>
<br>
And if Qwai and his dont feel that they are good enough to help fellow members of the community I suggest he remove himself from the BB rotation because the TERM BB is BIG BROTHER wich is a term of endearment , meaning your there to lend a hand . In return you recieve any and all epic pieces droped. And if the God isnt up you get to do it all over again another day. <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

<br>
BB should have ZERO obligation / reprocussions for turning down a plane clearing on a non-god day.  I can speak for bots here.  Generally on Sundays, we schedule a list of things to do for the week.  And we pretty much stick to them.  Only compelling reason to scrap a bots scheduled exploration / raid would be in hopes of obtaining an epic quest for a member.  Granted, on 'free days' some of us (myself included) would be more than happy to tag along and help.  But there shoud be no obligation either way.<br>
<br>
In addition, guilds schedule fear/hate several weeks in advance.  You (the posting guild) should have it in you to have a force shouw up that day.  <br>
<br>
Summary:  Never should a BB guild be called in to BB a non god day; however there should be no restrictions (perhaps the 6 man, perhaps not - discuss please???) on voluntary assistance. At the same time, there should no penalty (loss of BB rotation) if said BB refused to 'BB' a non god day, as chances are, they could be doing something else.  <br>
Ie: i see potential abuse: Non BB guild, schedules fear, logs in its 14-16 non planar armorized guys, and then uses BB to outfit them - clearly NOT then intertions behind BB or the Calendar whatsoever. <p><P align=center>

But let's face it.  Even experienced entities can have bad days where the plane raid goes from bad to worse.  MCoD is a prime example.  They are well able to clear Fear, but needed an assist from FoR (they contacted me first).  As far as the Epic being required?  No, they are not.  But doing so does promote good will amongst our community. <p><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>

<br>
If I were leading a raid in Hate (hah!), there would be no complaints here if our raid went sour and we left maestro up?  Because Epic Rotation is only for the GOD, right?<br>
<br>
So the Epic Rotation should be renamed to the God Rotation, since other epic items drop in the planes.  It's ALWAYS been my understanding that epic guilds get called up to finish clearing the planes so that all the epic loot drops.  That'll teach me to read the rules. 8P<br>
<br>
Because Edwina, you're wrong. Hate to put it that bluntly, but if you read the rules, they are clearly talking about epic loot as WELL AS Gods.  The wording is very clear.  Original Intent was to ensure maximum epic loot drops.  People just seem to fixate on the fact that the Gods drop the rarest epic loot, so that must be ALL the epic loot.<br>
<br>
And per Vincecross's ruling, you don't lose your place in line.<br>
<br>
If you don't want that responsibility as currently defined by the rules of being an epic guild (which you must have read and agreed to, right?), perhaps you should think about withdrawing from the rotation.  Not a 'GTFO', just ... maybe think about what the actual intent was, and whether or not you're willing to make that level of time commitment to clearing OTHER people's planes dates.<br>
<br>
Personally?  I'd hate to be an epic guild.  I dont' think the additional rewards would be worth it.<br>
<br>
But you wanted it, you got it.[1]  So figure it out.<br>

<br>
About 'requiring' BB guild to help clear a plane:  this should not be done because it can be exploited easily.  Here is an example:<br>
<br>
Day X is the day before CT will spawn.  GuildA looks at the BB rotation schedule and sees that BBGuild1 (a guild that GuildA doesn't particularly like) is up next for rotation.  GuildA knows that if they ask for BB help, BBGuild1 *must* supply it, which will use up their 'rotation' for CT.  GuildA asks for help (no matter if they need it or not) from BBGuild1 for the purpose of putting them out of rotation for the next Epic-Quest-Mob.<br>
<br>
As far at 'god' vs 'epic-quest-mob', I think it is clear that the rotation is about 'epic-quest-mob's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/6/01 2:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: KoP asking for help on non-god day wtf?</span><hr size=1> More specefically, gods - as they pop 1/7 days.

I'm pretty sure the epic loot the BB covers is the 7 day spawners; if it's not clear, it should be made clear. <p><P align=center>

Even though Guild_01 is a posting entity doesn not mean that they should have to ely on BB to clear for them. the only way i see calling in BB on a non-epic day is if you have massive CR to do, then i could understand. But calling in CIW because only a handful of your people showed up is wrong. Its isnt BB's responsibility to get you your items.<br>

there is a line between help and give. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urewena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rewena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA WebAdmin</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/7/01 4:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://boh.thixo.net/artwork/board_art/rewena.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: KoP asking for help on non-god day wtf?</span><hr size=1> I will take the blame for this Bias. I posted those words.<br>
<br>
In the begining I offered webspace =)  What exactly happened after that I am not sure. I remember looking as some of the current calendar problems:<br>
<br>
Posts to the calendar couldn't be taken down.<br>
<br>
Initials for the different guilds were very confusing.<br>
<br>
Even though only one raid at a time was supposed to be posted some were doing multiples.<br>
<br>
Alliances got to decide for themselves when they could split and post separately and used the same password.<br>
<br>
I looked at these things and knew that simple logic comands and a data base could solve a lot of them, with next to no maintanence. And I think even Stygar would agree that it has. <br>
<br>
I did that links page, and it was a work in progress for a long time. But again I think being able to see the full name along with the size of the guild and the names of the guildleaders/raid leaders was only a good thing.<br>
<br>
The list of admins was straight forward. The link to the message board seemed natural. The modify mode could have been done any number of ways but that way was the easiest I could come up with.<br>
<br>
That pretty much left the rules to be done... and there was disscussion here, there and everywhere. I waited and waited and waited.  Then something happened the scared me. Bots was disbanned and I knew that if this thing didn't get off the ground and off the ground right then, it would probalby be the end of any calendar system.<br>
<br>
So I finished the code and I put up the rules that had most recently sort of been agreed on, overnight. I didn't realise I was writting a legal document, and I always thought (nievely yes) that any problems people had with the rules would come out right then. I was actually very surprized no one said a thing. I got lots of comments and corrections on the links page.<br>
<br>
Whatever or however I said it this is what was supposed to come through:<br>
<br>
The plane needs to be cleared. If you can't clear the whole plane (ok exception sky but you know what I mean) then you have no business reserving a whole plane. Yes we said 40 but in reality the reason for the 40 was to make absolutely sure you have enough to draw from to clear a plane, take however many you want more or less, invite friends but make no mistake you need to clear it. The exception to this would be when a god is up, in that case... yadda yadda epic guild... yadda yadda god loot etc.<br>
<br>
But make no mistake that rule was supposed to lay the blame of not being able to clear a plane, god or not on the POSTING ENTITY. They came to this board and said &quot;yes we can do it, give us access&quot; and by god they'd better be able to do it. <br>
<br>
If a guild is in trouble it has basically three options, as I see it anyway, they can try to stay within the 6 invites per tag rule and get help then from anyone and everyone, clear as far as they can and let someone know they left mobs up especially Maestro.  This is the best choice IMO. But be honest with yourselves and get help in the future, invite a guild to your alliance whatever.<br>
<br>
They can ask a BB guild and that guild can go over the 6 invites rule to help but it does not effect their place in line. If you can get them in there to help great but this is something they do out of their own generosity.  Plus keep in mind should the same epic go in twice to help it would look like they are piggybacking with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Not a bad choice but I wish you luck.<br>
<br>
Final option they can leave tons of mobs up and hope no one finds out about it. Bad choice.<br>
<br>
If they contact BB then their status will be looked at. In the case of Mcod this was unnessessary as the alliance posted no more raids and asked to be removed. In the case of KoP it's currently being looked into.  They will be asked to back up their 40 and if they can then they will probably be given a warning.  But absolutely no responsiblity lies with the BB guilds, nor does it effect their turn. I am sorry if this didn't come through.<br>
<br>
That last option has only happened once to my knowledge and that was when Soul Slayers didn't do sky on a day they reserved. Since they disbanded I am not sure it was ever finalized but we put a hold on their account for a month and I believe cancelled all current raids. <br>
<br>
Stygar, if you made it this far, as far as cancellations vs no show and DF in sky, thats a very good point but not one that has been brought up yet. Let me get back to you =P  If anyone has a time frame in mind please say something =)<br>
<br>
And I think a lot of rules need to be clarified and some re-written. A few precidents have been set now and so specific consequences can be added for some things.  I'd really very much like it if I wasn't the one re-writing them.<br>
<br>
Look for this in the very near future. Again I am sorry for any problems this caused. <p><i><b>Rewena Bloodstorm</b></i>
