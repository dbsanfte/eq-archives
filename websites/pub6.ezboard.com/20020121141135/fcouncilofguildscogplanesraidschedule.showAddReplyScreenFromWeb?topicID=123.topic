It was great night and we came away with many shiny new bits for those that had good luck.  All in all we took 54 people up and had over 30 of them still up at the end of the night.<br>
<br>
We encountered the Maestro's Hand and then found that an Unpleasant Hand is unpleasant.  <br>
<br>
We travelled up to the second floor and had our first encounter with new MOB's of Hate.  Yay fine steel weapons for loot again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Mistress of Scorn, Corrupter of Life, and the Ashenbone Broodmother are some of the other new spawns we encountered.  The joy of CH MOB's and the rampage attack. I think this rampage might actually be similiar to a melee disclpine.  <br>
<br>
I will be able to post a list of loot and winners in near future.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to those that helped make the raid successful, my management team, group leaders, Zellex and Vaard.  Without your support this would not have been nearly as successful or smooth. <br>
<br>
We had a couple of CR sessions this night and we did a good quick job of it.  I saw that people remained patient during each one and that helped us huge.  Thanks to the people dragging, the clerics with their work and mages, necros and enchanters pitching in as well. Good work on that, especially when we all got killed off that once.  <br>

Thanks to all who came to make it a success. (minus the two wipeouts,lol) It was hella fun taking down the sub-bosses.  I think the new changes to Hate are wonderful!  No DTs by big ugly upstairs, and the new dying quotes of the mobs are hilarious!  A couple notes for the future:<br>
<br>
1. A very unpleasant hand spawned right on top of me after the Hand of the Maestro went down, even though the Hand was killed near the organ.  This was basically right smack in the middle between the organ and the archway into the Maestros Hall.  If this is it's spawn point, then it shouldn't be a problem taking this thing down.  Just pull the hand over to the throne area and fight it there, making sure nobody is in the center of the Hall.  The unpleasant hand really caught us off guard (even though I tried to warn ya, but got killed in mid-sentence HAHAHA), but we could have taken it np if we were a bit more ready, buffed, and medded up.<br>
<br>
2.  The Mistress of Scorn, beleive it or not, is a pretty bad meleeer.  Ok, so I got killed by her, but she missed me, Mr. No Agility, a good third of her attempts.  Maybe I was lucky (it was a good night for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  Anyway, she and the corrupter of life seemed not nearly as tough as the Broodmaster.  Too bad they both aggroed on us at the same time.  That, and that wandering Agent of Innoruuk, just made things too difficult to handle all at once. Ah well, die and learn, right?<br>
<br>
3.  It seemed to me that pets were a big help taking down mobs on the last half of the raid.  I'd like to point out the magicians have a new spell called summon companion that mostly eliminates any worries of aggroing extra mobs.  Malachyte and I were discussing ways to use this spell and we came up with this: Park air pets in a safe place, have the mage acquire the main-assists target, run to that target, summon the pet on top of it, and have the pet attack immediately. Immediately after the battle, the mage orders the pet to back off AND guard here, insuring that the pet won't wander back to its orginal guard point or attack another mob.  Then, when it's all clear, the mage goes back to the original safe spot and summons the pet there.  It sounds like a lot of work, but any good mage would be used to this amount of pet control, and it only costs 50 mana per cast of summon companion. Now I understand that during the first hour of the raid in the SW corner pets aren't a good idea, and I also realize that pets really are not needed for regular mob types (although air pets are great vs. those darn clerics) when we have a great raiding party like last night. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And I have no complaints about not summoning a pet if it means less linkdeath of REAL tanks (can't wait for server-side filtering). I'm just asking that this new additional control we have over our pets be considered for future raids.<br>
4.  This nearly caused me to cry.  The loot policy must be changed to allow faster looting of corpses.  We let a pair of enchanter boots rot.  This is unacceptable.  I propose the following ideas:<br>
a) Before the raid starts, everyone make a button in their socials for /random 1 200. <br>
b) Not immediately rushing to the next mob after the first goes down.  If the second or third mobs are sitting there messed, is it really necessary to jump on the second one right after the first goes down?  Let's regroup, get our bearings, heal injured/poisened members, and acquire a solid lock on the next target. In the meantime, the leader of the group who got the kill should check the corpse for goodies and communicate with the loot coordinator.  The loot coordinator should not be a tank, cleric, or enchanter, for they are people who are easily occupied during battles.  The loot coordinator then shouts, several times, what dropped and who should roll.  Even in the thick of battle, it's not hard to hit the button for a random roll (see A above). <br>
c)  If a member is missing from the lotto due to death or linkdeath, and it seems unlikely that the person can get back in time, why not have someone else who is present roll for them?  (perhaps the leader of the group to which the dead/ld person belongs) If this substitute roller wins the lotto, he obviously won't get the item, as the next highest roller will win it, but the next class-specific no drop item goes to that dead/ld person whom the sub rolled for (assuming this person doesn't have it already). Before rolling, the sub should gain permission (if possible) from the dead member. <br>
d)  Now that god-loot is dropping from mini-bosses, I propose that god-loot be considered the same as a BP/robe drop.  That is, no one person should obtain in a single raid both a god-drop and a bp/robe if there are other members of a raid who do not have these items yet.  A person who has looted a god-drop is not eligible for a future bp/robe drop on the same raid, and vice-versa. Personally, I think it's better to spread the love, share the wealth, and more people go home happy.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading this far into the post.  Tell me what you think. Blink your eyes a few times, stand up and stretch, and I'll see you on the next raid!  Great job everyone!<br>
