<br>
Are you aware that using Main Tank tactics look and work the same with 60 people as it does with 18?  Just because we have more members on a typical raid than you have on your roster is no reason to attempt to belittle our accomplishments.  I would argue, and with extreme backing of many members of several guilds, that running a raid with 60-80 people is MORE difficult (more lag, harder to control more people, etc) than running one with 30-45, thus making the fact that we get as much accomplished as we do even MORE impressive, not less.<br>
<br>
I am all for people who want to excel and be able to take down encounters in new ways with less people and if that is their fun, I say so be it.  What I cannot stand is people of that mentality who feel the need to be condescending to others who don't play with that same mentality.  You know the ones, they post on Safehouse about how they soloed Trakanon with a bard and an unbuffed ranger. . .and he was a gimp.<br>
<br>
NB has done a fair share of taking down mobs in new ways with less numbers, especially since the release of Satan that is DAOC.  Talendor with 26, VS with 12, Vindicator with 36, Velk with 36, Lord DJ with 10 etc etc.  While the numbers themselves may not be up to par with SoT or BOTS or Tindi or whoever, that isn't the point.  The point is, I am sick and @#%$ tired of this bullshit elitist attitude of people like you, Haxx (yes I know you aren't alone in this).  We are quite a capable guild, and just because we don't believe in telling the extra 30 of our guildmates who happen to have logged in that they can't come to Vindi or Doze or a moss snake, so we can compare false dick sizes about who killed what with less people, doesn't mean our accomplishments are any less.<br>
<br>
NB is not a Zerg guild, regardless of the numbers present at any particular raid.  We know how to use tactics, tactics we developed on our own I might add.  You don't see NB members watching how other guilds fight mob X.  Our tactics might not be the most efficient, nor the same as yours, but we have long prided ourselves that we fight mobs on our terms, not just reusing someone else's tactics, pull spots, methods.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, I would kindly ask you and any of the rest of the Norrathian public who feels the need to call us Zergs or Noobie Blade, to STFU.  It's childish, it's immature, and it's incorrect. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

If it is, and one guild needs to use these tactics because that's all they can do, what's wrong with that?<br>
<br>
It's their choice IMHO and if they do what they wanted to in the end then what's the big deal?<br>

the biggest irony is that SoT (haxx said it) then prouds to bots that they use 40ppl for tormax vs bots using 60 ppl (post read something like:  Us zergs? please!).  The point remains, as Karadin said, you can kill stuff with 40, you can zerg it with 96 (I think our record for a raid so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ); it doesnt matter, and I'll quote sot here &quot;the dead mob matters&quot;.   <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19398">Fosters</a><BR>Lvl 60 Armadillo<BR>The Rathe</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unyca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 593<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/01 5:03:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haxx</span><hr size=1> For the Record:  SoT has approximately 70 active players.<br>
<br>
If we only use 40 at Tormax that's because that's ALL the folks we have on-line at that time. <br>
<br>
We go short-handed to many Raids, and hope to hell our strategy is sound.  When we do win with the meager amount of players we can field, we do feel proud of our accomplishment.<br>

Then stop having your guildmates throw it in our face.  I don't give a @#%$ if you kill Tormax with 10 people or 200.  Have your guildmates show the same respect. <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Lohki Dedematshin<br>Warlord of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utzutentsunami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzuten Tsunami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/01 7:20:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haxx</span><hr size=1> Lohki,<br>
<br>
Both sides of the fence need to relax off this.<br>
<br>
I was just walking through Keal (about 5 days after the Tormax thing). I see Falconus, and 2 others. I do as I always do. Politely bow and say howdy. (like I always do to everyone I have grouped with in the past) Falconus begins to berate me and my guild at that time. I get hurt (seriously, I remember the days of helping him killing Lucan) and say that looks like I lost another person I called friend in this game. He was very cold and callis when I mentioned that.<br>
<br>
I spent the next 30 minutes having a very enjoyable converstaion with another member of your guild. And for those 30 minutes we were not Noble blade or Spirit of Tunare. We were Tzuten and XXX (not going to mention name out of respect).<br>
<br>
What I am saying is this, I get along with about 90 % of the Rathe. If anyone ever had something bad to say about me . . . bring it here then. Try to judge people on who they are, FIRST, then the guild they are in.<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to reply to the Lazreth Thread as well. The only point Lazreth I believe was trying to get across was, do not call us &quot;Faction Exploiters&quot; and call yourselves justified for doing the same thing. Every single guild on the Rathe has cross-killed thier &quot;Guilds Main Faction&quot;. (Sont , Kland, Kromzek Captain, ToV quest dragons, Tormax, Vindi, Staute, etc etc etc). If you crossed that line ONCE... or 100 times.<br>
<br>
Basicly it comes down to what my grandmother always said about the pot calling the kettle black.<br>

A Zergling was the least expensive piece in the Zerg army/side (in resources and time to create) and massive numbers of these pieces could be created in a short time.  You then take your massive number of inexpensive pieces and Zerg your opponent, basically hoping that you could overrun them before all your pieces died.<br>
<br>
Zerg = bringing massive numbers of pieces/players to a battle, usually overkill, to assure victory<br>
<br>
Bind-rushing is binding close to where you will fight a mob.  When a player dies, he respawns close by so he doesn't have to be rezed.  He loots a minimal amount of equipment from his corpse and jumps back into the fray.  Usually after a fight each player may have multiple corpses from these deaths, at which time they all get ressurrected for the xp to get back.<br>
<br>
<br>
About numbers on raids:<br>
In BotS, we do not turn anyone away from a raid if they are online.  In fact, all raids are required attendence unless you notify an officer and they OK your absence.  There are raids where this is relaxed, of course.  We only need 6 or 8 people to kill Faydedar, for example, there is no reason to drag 30 people out there for him so we don't.  However, we also do quite a bit of raiding at times when we don't have full attendence.  To us, it makes no real difference anymore.  We know the minimum attendence range we need to tackle most mobs and raid them when we have at least those numbers.  We do get a good rush when we kill some mob with fewer people than we thought we could before but we no longer feel compelled to push the envelope on every mob.  We still do occassionally though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We could even read Noows a lot and do mobs with even fewer numbers, if we wanted. <p><P>
