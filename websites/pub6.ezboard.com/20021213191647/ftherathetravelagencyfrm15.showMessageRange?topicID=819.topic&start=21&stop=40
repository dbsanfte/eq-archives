1. We claimed we were going after Vindicator, that's what we were there to do.. we had planned it for 2 days.<br>
<br>
2. SoY calls they are pulling Vindicator when we were minutes away from doing what we had planned, and claimed that we were doing.<br>
<br>
3. To avoid being walked on ...Again we rushed ourselves and pulled Vindi. Not the smartest thing.. but Dammit if you have ever been walked on you might just do the same thing. We wiped out.<br>
<br>
4. Kenshiiro knows he was in the wrong.. so like i said he apologized profusely,Saying he didn't intend to pull Vindi. I watched the screen as he did so with the GM.<br>
<br>
5. Apology accepted, and he was told no problem we're forming again. <br>
<br>
6. Vindi running across arena area to SoY 5minutes or less before our pull. <br>
<br>
Ya know we were &quot;biggerguilded&quot; as i like to call it, into pulling him to avoid being walked on.. but then we were just plain screwed right after by them. Plain as that.. No more to the story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadohawk@therathetravelagency>Shadohawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadows of Yamabushi</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/5/02 3:53:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yamabushi</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
  It is clear to me that because of a previous experience with another guild that they rushed the pull. NOT because of any experience they may have had with Yamabushi. It is unfortunate. Had we been given an answer as to Vindi being camped we would not have sent our people to the arena in the first place. As it is, CoN failed, and having amassed our troops we decided to clear to him and take him. <br>
<br>
 A lot of people are pulling stuff out of there ass on this. Lets stick to the facts.<br>

 1. No, in fact as I have stated twice, we called him, you objected, we stood down.<br>
<br>
 2. I can say that I did not say this. No, in all honesty, I cannot speak for every member of my guild as to what they may have or have not said. I can say it would surprise me greatly to learn that this is true. Nor am I calling you a liar. I suspect, perhaps, you may have mis-interpretted something that was said. I simply do not know.<br>
 <br>
 3. Continual spam no. An answer to a simple camp check, well, yes. Your point about 35 people in Kael has no value. I've seen that many do simple Arena raids. You were in the Arena remember, something that is, well, unconventional when taking Vindi.<br>
<br>
 Guys, really. What happened last night is simple. Yamabushi went to Kael to take Vindi. Having had no response to a camp check we ammassed our troops. We went to the Arena and found CoN in the Arena. Perhaps it was poor judgement to assume that since they were in the arena and had not responded to inquiries concerning Vindi that he was free to take, but it was the call we made. Certainly anyone who has done Vindi a few times can see where the confusion came about. Depsite all this we yielded to CoN when they itterated they were there for Vindi. They rushed despite our yeilding (I suspect due to a prior experience) and failed. At this point we CR'd them and decided to take Vindi, because we had gone through the effort of getting our people there and clearing arena. <br>
<br>
 If you want to dispute something, dispute our decision to take Vindi after CoN failed. Everything prior to that was done either out of a failure to communicate (on both sides) or understandable misundertandings due to the circumstances.<br>
 <br>
 As to our decision to take Vindi after CoN's failed attempt. Perhaps it wasn't the most gentlemanly thing to do. Perhaps we should have allowed them to attempt a second and a third and a fourth time. Fuck perhaps.<br>

Here I am. <br>
<br>
SoY, no one is claiming you did anything illegal here. You were well within your right to take Vindi after CoN failed. That was your perogative. What Deam, and many of my guildmates are upset about, is the fact that you, as a guild, with the full support of your guild leader acted in a manner ubecoming of a guild on the rathe. Every RTA rule and etc. is what is called a gentleman's agreement. There is no one to truely enforce anything, nor do the rules have any official standing. <br>
<br>
Each guild who wishes to benefit from the server's gentleman's ag reement, must also agree to it's rules. I could invoke the name ragefire, and everyone would remember what went on then. This situation in my eyes, is the direct equivalent. What are the differences? Instead of your guild jumping right on the NPC while CoN was engaged, you scared CoN into engaging early. This meant we had adds, and what not preventing us from doing the fight properly. Then, when we were recovering, under the false pretense of letting us go at it again, (To prevent a hassle for yourselves?) you grabbed Vindi and left. <br>
<br>
So back to the gentleman's agreement, it only works for you if your guild as a collective gentleman. Clearly your guild is not. Your scare tactics notwithstanding, simply waiting for a guild to possibly fail, then snagging the mob would be frowned upon on our server, and probably any other. I believe Cildyan, not sure if he is still a member of your guild or not, or if he even plays, could be a good character witness for your guild. From what he told me of the way you treat your OWN members, this blatant, flippant, disregard for other guilds, and the people behind the toons in these guilds does not surprise me. <br>
<br>
Can we do Vindi again? Yes, and trust me, we will. The fact that you ran over us, with a total lack of respect for the people who spent several hours clearing the way for you affronts me. That you acted so pitifully is the epitomy of nearly everything I hate.  Could you have waited another 8 hours to let a guild who has not yet had a chance at Vindi have a chance? Could you not also have moved your force to grab some other mob? Sure you could have. Your black-hearted desire, and machiavellian attitude won over and you did what most other guilds would consider conniving, sneaky, scheming, and underhanded. <br>
<br>
Allegating that a guild so upstanding as my own, would not only have done what you say it did during the fact, and then come her to... what, vent anger over not getting vindi, is proposterous. Perhaps your guild will one day reach the upper echelons of heartless actions that some other guilds with similar acronyms once did, who knows? What I'd suggest, is that you stop trying so hard... it makes it obvious! <p>&lt;img align=top src=&quot;http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif&quot;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br>

So assuming SoY had been sneaky and slinked their way in behind CoN, they were avioding an entire 20 minutes worth of work clearing the see invs giants, not too terribly much work they &quot;waited until was done&quot;.<br>
<br>
Oh, forgetting the 3 Zeks, 2 Static giants and 2 wanderers on each side of the back of Arena,  if those had been cleared, than they are skipping maybe another 30 minutes of killing, still not that much &quot;skipped&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
This server operates on conventions in every bit as much as it operates on rules set in stone. Don't believe me? Ask Frayed Knot. They have been learning it lately, and not liking it, but like the good and agreeable members of the server that we know them to be, they are adjusting to it. However, one thing they are not, is willfully blind to the established conventions so that they can pressure a guild into making a mistake on a mob. They sit back and give people a chance, that everyone deserves. That, is a good method of making friends and influencing people. <br>
<br>
When you have two or more situations that have nearly identically applicable rules, it doesn't make any sense, unless you are looking for raw advantage to one side of the issue, to use completely differant ideas procedures. Drawing the analogy between two similar events creates a procedure for both. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Pulling, would be considered engaging IMO with Vindi.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do you consider pulling to be engaged for Trak? Do you consider pulling to be engaged for Tormax? Do you consider pulling to be engaged for a named mob in village, pulled by fake wall, over the village group? Do you consider pulling to be engaged for Venril Sathir? No, there are specific conventions that govern each similar example. <br>
<br>
Trakanon is 'claimed' by the group in the Cubby: an area from which to clear and stage an attack on Trak. Sounds a lot like a guild clearing the arena to stage a vindi pull. <br>
<br>
Tormax's pull is long, involves quite a bit of clearing as is my understanding. Should a guild run up on the backs of another guild who has cleared to Tormax and then be able to pull him without any negative reprocussions? <br>
<br>
If another player engages a mob from what is traditionally 'your camp', isn't that &quot;claiming&quot; the mob? Or are we now to assume that no one remembers the frantic cries of &quot;leave frenzy mobs alone&quot;. Not a good enough example? Next time you are in seb, pull a guardian with a lammy to your necro jail group, and watch guard roll over and laugh about you 'engaging the mob' first. <br>
<br>
Finally, a race mob that sees much use, in a zone that is often widely populated, Venril Sathir. Do you think that pulling is engaged here? No, it's not. <br>
<br>
I would hope the answer is no, for all examples. Trak is not unique in that when you have a force moved to a certain spot, everyone else stands down, so you have a chance to engage the mob in your own time, using your own strategy. Pass or Fail, you are given every bit as much respect as you deserve for getting force to the mob first. <br>
<br>
Venril Sathir requires a force in a prep area that is all of a 20 second run from the zone in. But you still can't claim from zone in, you still must have the group IN the prep area. <br>

If SoY had not intimated that they were going to pull Vindi at any moment, CoN would have had ample time to split guards and clear any remaining mobs in the way.

You are endorsing raids pressuring other raids into being sloppy so that they can engage the mobs after the first raid whipes?

I won't care if you're moving in, or buffing at the waterfall at the end of 10 minutes, you lose.

<br>
I have a long, long memory, and you saying the words &quot;arena left&quot; bring back all the details I need. A time in Kael that we were heading to left arena, until cries from the yammas that &quot;left arena was taken, claimed for 2 hours in occ&quot;. Sure, whatever, we've been there for half an hour, it's possible your're telling the truth. Then my guildmate who was AFK in the zone for THREE hours checks his log, and finds not a single peep for the whole time out of any of your guild for left arena. I find out later that *you* told a guildmate that you had been calling left arena for 2 hours. When I spoke to you on the same day, you were saccharine and dripping with &quot;oh I'm so sorry, that's not what we wanted,&quot;.

That is an interesting supposition.

Actually, the point about 35 people is very strongly valued. <br>
<br>
Do you Yama's raid with such disipline, that when a camp check is called, not a single member of your raid speaks in ooc or shout, save for the guildleader? I ask, because if I, as a guild and raid leader, saw a guild zoning into the same zone, in large numbers, on the night of our first attempt at a mob, you can be DAMN sure of two things. One, any camp check call would be met with MULTIPLE replies from the raiding party. Don't dare make the argument that the entire raid party was spammed too badly to read ooc or shout. We have multiple windows, we have multiple colors, hell, were there any casters on the raid? Battle spam only works as an excuse if you *are attacking rapidly*. So to your &quot;camp check&quot; it is your contention then, that not a single CoN member said &quot;vindi&quot;? Is that right? <br>
<br>
Because I believe, if that is your contention, that I will pose a scenario of my own: If a camp check was done, CoN was ignored when they called vindi, for whatever reason you felt it necessairy. <br>

Logically, this is bullshit. There is NO WAY that you can Camp Check on a guild that is on a raid in a zone with multiple desireable mobs and *not* get a reply from at LEAST someone. Hell, we've been standing on top of the undead bard and heard a camp check, and replied. <br>
<br>
Your repeated assersions that you made a camp check call are moot; they do not stand to reason on their face, that you ask people to believe that a reply was not made. <br>
<br>
Everyone on a first time vindi attempt is going to be nervous as hell, paying as much attention to everything as they can. <br>
<br>
Not only that, but let me ask you this: When you zone in to an area that you wish to raid, what is the FIRST thing you do?<br>
<br>
<br>
Give up...?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You do a /who to see if there are any other guilds massed in the zone. If I see 30 League of Levity in Cazic Thule, I'm betting it's not a sewer group. Ring of Slime? Gee golly whillikers, that was hard to reason out. <br>

<br>
Ok, so, now, here's where we are so far: <br>
<br>
1. Your camp checks have gone totally unanswered repeatedly. Wow. Ok, sure. Now, you get to the arena and find a group of about 30 people. Alright, I farm border line armor with a craptastic drop rate with 30 people ALL the time. Especially when I can be in the HoT to get armor, but whatever, whatever, lets give you as much credit as we possibly can. They are there, you think, for armor. <br>
<br>
So then, they tell you &quot;oh, we want vindi&quot; and as you've said before, it was only the herculean effort of getting up to the arena that made you feel vindi was something you couldn't just *leave* behind, but if you'd only known at the zone... what a shame, he'll have to die though, you spent 10 minutes getting there. <br>
<br>
I have a suggestion: Maybe it was the fact that he drops... LOOT! that made you reconsider if you *really* wanted him this time or not. You know, you were kind of indifferant, wasn't a big deal, until someone said &quot;hey waitaminute guys?!?! have you seen this &quot;Chestplate of Vindication&quot;?!?!? Holy shit guys, it has some pretty good stats! I had no idea this mob dropped THAT! Wow. We gotta kill it now. <br>

It matters not that Ken came in later and asked again. His member (Raitlin) had already been informed long before any other SoY even showed up.<br>
<br>
As for Ken's asking for a camp check.. You can tell that we engaged a mob 1/10 of a second after he called it out and it was amazing that Sekhar even seen it to respond with what he did.<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter though because Raitlin had already been informed that CoN were going to kill Vindi before any other SoY ever showed up.  They intended on ganking us as you can tell from the logs. CoN was the only force in Kael and then after Raitlin was informed of our going after Vindi you can see that SoY massed anyways.<br>

I'm realizing why it pissed me off so much. Mainly the &quot;we didn't know you wanted Vindi&quot; quotes. Like I stated before we've had Him planned for Monday night for a while, and we did state our intentions in Ooc. If people chose to ignore it and continue on, what more can be said. <br>
<br>
Another thing Kenshiiro when you said /ooc pulling Vindi, we voiced our intent loudly.. and got NO communication saying, you would back off. Again to avoid being walked on and send 30+ of our members who had been working for hours toward this goal packing empty handed.. Misunderstanding? Yeah, I could never understand or fathom people doing underhanded shit like this to ANYONE, Does it happen?, yep here's proof. Do i have to sit and eat it?  *deep breath* No I do not. See I'm civil.<br>

<br>
Seems CoN did claim vindi.<br>
What a detestable thing to do...don't try and justify running over them.  This would have been (AFAIK) their first vindi kill, and by trying to make them deliberately fail and do all the work for you - as this very much seems - you've really managed to lose what little respect I had.<br>
<br>
Kenshiiro, I thought you were better then this. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/sigs/bogsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deamian>Deamian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/5/02 5:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just so I'm clear on this.... </span><hr size=1> OOohh Logs...
