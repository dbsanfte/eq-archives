For me, this shows that no matter what calendar system is agreed upon, there will be people to continue to abuse the system.  In fact, this leads me to wonder why we are putting this effort into (yet again - remember the first one was agreed upon too) designing another calendar system if it will simply be abused as well.<br>
<br>
1.  Violation of the 2/3 rule.  I most definitely DO consider this a violation of the spirit of the rule.  If this was not meant to exclude other posting entities, then why was it a rule at all?<br>
<br>
2.  Guild switching.  I have heard that there are a significant number of people who switch guild tags to become a member of the posting guild for a night so as not to &quot;violate&quot; the 2/3 rule.  Even in the proposed changes to the calendar system, there would be no way to check up on this.<br>
<br>
3.  Repop farming.  I have heard many reports of a group(s) of people entering the planes and farming repops during the early hours when another group has posted intent.<br>
<br>
These are but a few, but the larger issues, that have been happening lately.  No matter what calendar system is put into place, these type of actions, I feel, will continue to occur.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>25</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/7/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>6:56:32 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Abuses of late</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">1.  Well it might have been a violation of the spirit of the rule that you made, but if you do not spell things out hen how are people supposed to know this?  I recently got bakc from a 4 month break from EQ, to learn there was a 2/3 rule at all.  So I looked the current rules up, and no where on them does it state the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rule.<br>
<br>
While I agree the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rules was good, you can not expect people to follow unwritten rules.<br>
<br>
Anyway getting rid of what seems to be a confusing 2/3 rule and replacing it with the new specific rules should help clear this up.<br>
<br>
2.  Well, this seems to have gotten lost but the idea was to have each guild post thier 40+ toons.  So I guess if people felt the need to do checks of the people in the zone against those lists they could do so.<br>
<br>
3.  Hmm, not alot we can really do about this.  As everyone kept saying calendar systems are not supported by Verant, but in-game retaliations are somewhat possible.  But should we all give up on a system that we agree to just because 6 people on the server don't?</font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

Yes there are more then 6 people mad out there. I have found that MANY people are mad out there. I was hunting outside of Karnors, and I saw a member of CIW looking for a group. He nearly got run out of the zone because of his guild tag. People are very pissed with CIW, KEG, and Bots. They are mad because all they have heard about is Aeg's post. Calling them useless losers that will never be able to do what they can. Now this may not be the exact words used, but his lack of people skills has been blown into these words. Give it time for them to calm. If this new system is plainly fair to all, then the rumors will be quelched off of that alone. This new calander system has some very good rules to it, but it needs to be finished soon. The biggest problems people have been having are with the 40 peeps, and the 2 days for Epic guilds. Drop the 2 days for each of them. Keep the training days, but put them at one day for the first month just to see what type of participation you get. Drop the posting requirements to 30. If you do that, then you still lower the amount of posting entities, but you please more people. The only thing that is working for you right now, is the majority of people want some of these rules. Capitolize on it by pleasing the majority of those wanting them. You have to think like a politician here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
If there are people working repops when you enter, try to get them involved in your raid. If they dont want to, do the best to work out a system with them. Bottom line is you cant stop them. But if you try to please them, there will be less of them. The calander WILL WORK! You just have to flatten out the rough edges. And best to have other representatives then the epic guilds. Need reps from smaller guilds too. That would show again that the calander is working for all. That is the intent of the calander. To make things safer, funner, and more organized for all....is it not?<br>

I think that's absolutely correct.  A lot of people are VERY upset.  Unfortunately, they're upset and behaving irrationally based on something that is Not. True.<br>
<br>
What needs to happen at this point (imnsho) is that a single someone from keg/ciw/bots steps forward to act as a representative of ALL THREE of your guilds, so that there is one voice talking on whineplay.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen lately, there is a basic system with the exception of a few details (do keg/bots/ciw get an extra day in fear/hate, the cutoff for calendar posting requirements, etc, etc).  <br>
<br>
My opinion:  Settle on the lowest number for the cutoff you can agree to, don't give the extra day(s) to anyone yet (it will only cause further flaming from people who are already pissed off), and post that to whineplay.  get it on castersrealm, eqvault, everlore and every other damn news site.<br>
<br>
The best thing that keg/bots/ciw could do is find someone who is NOT in any of those guilds to present the proposal.  Someone who is not in any guild that is planes-capable on its own, and have them present the solution.  That immediately kills all the guild-tag animosity that is going on right now.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has really thought about the issue, or has been planes/dragon capable for more than a month knows that to do anything serious at this level requires organization on a scale that is mostly not possible with collections of small guilds.  Without a calendar in place, it becomes even more difficult.<br>
<br>
The calendar is a very useful tool for me.  I use it to find out who is going on raids when, and if I'm familiar with the guild, I ask them if I can join the raid.<br>
<br>
Without the calendar, I'm going to be stuck asking for a spot in a keg/ciw/bots plane raid, because I won't know who else might be capable of going up.  <br>
<br>
And before you ask, no i won't go up and farm repops.  I'll give up on the planes as a matter of principle before i'll help turn them into a zone like lguk.  If I'm going to camp a spawn for some rare armor, I'll go camp karnors or sebilis for cobalt.<br>

A guild can be able to do a plane on its own and still invite friends from another posting entity, there is nothing wrong with that if you consider that they would do the plane with or witout them. What is wrong is if you see that happening at every raid, then eventually people have a right to expect an alliance. That is why that rule was put there, if they didnt want to make invite from other posting guilds they would of writen something like &quot; you can't invite people from other posting entity&quot; simple no? They didn't because it wasn't the issue that it is now. Man I don't even know why this is put back in question all the sudden, almost every posting entity out there have invited people from other ones at one point or another and that includes CIW, BotS, KEG etc.   *Sigh*<br>

I am merely saying that, yes people are dwelling on that post a bit too much. But that is what started the heat. Unfortunately they will not let it go easily. They have only heard of that one post, and rumors have grown from there. Give them something better to talk about. Throw something out there that will wipe out that old post. Regardless of how you look at this. EQ has a society. This society is going to spread news fast, and we all know what happens when news gets spread by word of mouth. It gets twisted, and distorted. I dont know if you realize the true extent of how mad people are about all this. They are VERY missinformed and are just steaming on the bad news that they heard. Example: This weekend I was at a Vox raid. Aeg and others from CIW showed up near the end of it. They did absolutely nothing to warrant any negative response. But every one of the people in my group wanted to see Aeg's head on a stick. Now I am not bashing Aeg here. I am saying that the news has spread like wild fire, and is getting worse. You can quelch this fire. You just need to throw a bit of good news out there. People think that KEG, CIW, and Bots are trying to take over the server and rule it. Now I do not see that as the case, but you need the masses to see that is not the case. Do that, and there will be less resistance from others. <br>
I personally want to see this calander system work. I think it is very noble of those to put so much time and effort into doing it. But remember that not all will see it that way. They only see CIW, Bots, and KEG making rules for them. Get more representation and they will not have that argument anymore. I truly hope that you do not give up on this system due to the negative responses so far. There needs to be a clear system that is impartial, and completely fair to as many players as possible. You have been working on making this system to be that way, it just needs to be smoothed out and finished. <br>

But sometimes you have to take the extra step to please the masses in order for your hard work to pay off. It sucks, and I agree that if they read the new proposals that they would see that you are working to help as many people as possible. <br>
As far as ideas to help sooth the masses well there is no certain formula. 1) Get more representation. If you have already done that, then ask the guild leaders to start spreading that fact in game. Let that news spread. That will help alot. 2) Ask guild leaders to spread the info on the Training days. Ask them to spread the facts. That Bots, CIW, KEG, and any other volunteering guilds offer 1 or 2 days a month where they go into the plains with indys, and smaller guilds to teach them about the strategies, and help them get the planes goodies. All they ask in return is if an epic mob spawns, they get to go for it. They take the epic loot and let the others have the rest. This idea is one of the best ones I have heard as of yet. It is a very noble gesture on the part of the &quot;Big Brother&quot; guilds. Some will still look at it as an attempt to get more planes time for the epic guilds, but once it goes into swing the truth will be known. Most people, especially the ones you are helping will more then appreciate it. This will also help quelch things.<br>
If you can get the guild leaders to bring this info to their guilds, and let the members spread it from there, it might help to calm things. <br>
Guild Leaders: If you want to keep the planes from going FFA, then lend a hand to the ones trying to put this plan together. Bring this info to your guilds with an unbiased opinion. You are the ones that can help to calm things.<br>
No matter how you do this, there will ALWAYS be those that stand against you, but that number can be reduced conciderably with just a few adjustments. I personally will not shun any member of the epic guilds because of the words of any of it's members. There is no reason why John Doe should be shunned because he belongs to Jane Doe's guild. But I am only one person, we need others to push this too.<br>
Obviously you will come up with your own ways to deal with this or not. These are just a few ideas of mine. Take them or leave them. But do something. Dont let all this that you have all done go to waste.<br>

There's a reason that people won't let Aeg's post go.  The &quot;kayans&quot; are not as dumb as the &quot;epic&quot; guild boards seem to assume.  KEG has made an honest attempt to correct the &quot;misperception&quot; of what KEG agreed to, and you deserve kudos for that.  Problem is, everything that BoTS and CIW has posted since Aeg's snafu points to the fact that Aeg's post represented their positions and general opinions pretty darn well.  Both BoTS and CIW are saying the calendar is doomed every chance they get, and this is easy to see as poorly veiled attempts to bring down the calendar without having to accept the blame for doing so.<br>
<br>
There are also members of KEG who are hurting your cause on your own board.  Methinks all the &quot;epic&quot; guilds need to rein in their gnome and halfling muckraker &quot;STFU&quot; teams before your guild reps get even worse than they are already. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  </font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A> at: 11/7/00 12:52:33 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urewena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rewena</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede Master</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>14</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/7/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:44:40 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Come on guys</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Lets try to go forward.<br>
<br>
Please.<br>
<br>
We are so close.<br>
<br>
If the DBN/VOF is a violation, or as long as there is some disagreement then lets finish getting the admin into place and lets get to voting.<br>
<br>
If they are determined to be guilty by a majority vote, then lets get into place what will happen to them. And what will happen to guilds in the future.<br>
<br>
Lets try to word the new rules so there is NO room for interpretation. Can we learn from the past instead of arguing about it.<br>
<br>
The calendar is far from dead and if we give up now we will be saying that those 6 jerks up there are right and that they win. Is this what we want to do?<br>
<br>
Lets start with the proposals that we all agree on and go from there.<br>
<br>
There are so many more important things to be looked at...<br>
<br>
... like what to do with the new planes? Do we want resos right away? Do we want ffa for a month or so? What????<br>
<br>
... what about people who violate? they lose their next day? posting rights for a week? a month? How about epic guilds?<br>
<br>
Please lets not argue about what is or isn't working RIGHT NOW, lets get the new system into place and see what works on that.<br>
<br>
Mistabone??? I have no idea what to do about those 6 up there or others who have done that. However I hardly think they have anything to do with whether or not a calendar works =( <br>
<br>
There must be something we can do. Instead of fighting among ourselves lets try to think of what can be done =)<br>

<br>
Seriously.<br>
<br>
At this point, the calendar needs to stop being discussed in terms of &quot;let's implement it right NOW.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second you do that, you create an adversarial atmosphere that says &quot;We are dictating the rules to the rest of the server.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is the exact problem that is giving people ammunition to push FFA on the server.<br>
<br>
This has GOT to be presented in a way that says &quot;In order to keep the planes available to all people equally, the following calendar system should be used at all times by those guilds/alliances who are capable of making planes runs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, it's the same statement.  but the perception by people who do not know you or your guild will be massively different.<br>
<br>
And I think (honestly) the best thing to do at this point is (as i said) pick 1 person who is as neutral as possible to present this proposal to the news sites and whineplay, and make as big a news deal out of it as possible.<br>
<br>
People are mad as hell for reasons both good adn bad, based on fact and misunderstanding.  But the fact remains that they are mad, and it is going to take some real work to make them not-mad.<br>
<br>
Ignore all the allegations of people abusing the system for now.  it is NOT IMPORTANT.  I don't care if 3-letter-acronym is abusing the calendar by having 1/8th as many weasels in their 10-slot UberBackPacks as is allowed by the rules right now.<br>
<br>
If we don't focus on what's important right now, then it won't matter what Guild TLA does to 'violate the rules of the calendar' because there won't be one to violate.<br>
<br>
Throw it all away, everyone.  The important thing right now is to salvage what we've got and make it work better.  Once we have that, we can all start building up exciting new grudges and complaints.<br>
