I hate to make an  issue of this, but frankly it pisses me off.  I felt quite screwed yesterday by Veil of Shadows.  <br>
<br>
Raid Calendar read for Hate<br>
<br>
Saturday IB<br>
Sunday Heroes <br>
<br>
I logged on Saturday night to find that Veil of Shadows was in Hate. In fact they were ACTUALLY there on Sunday (I logged at 4am and they were still there).  The day of MY raid.  I had heard that Inny was up and that we were going to have a chance to kill him.  Heroes has yet to kill him so the banter over guildchat was really exciting.  <br>
<br>
To make a long story short.<br>
<br>
Veil of Shadows was raiding Hate on the day I reserved.<br>
<br>
They killed a GOD because he was there with no regard for the calendar.  <br>
<br>
I was infact told by someone in Veil that they were not going to kill Inny which is the only reason I didn't start porting up Heroes that night saying it was our day to raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is the only way to kill a god to sneak into a plane the night before and Kill Steal him from another guild?<br>
<br>
I know that Veil has many good members. I infact know many of them.  Why would you do this to me?<br>

I can actually remember ONE thread that was started about LoS ignoring the calendar, and the majority of the list above either took no side at all, or, like myself, told the poster to calm down and quit with the blanketting flames.<br>

All the other flames have simply been about arguing over the calendar because of all the immense, game ruining, server crashing, world ending abuse that is going to one day maybe happen.<br>

<br>
I understand that if someone specifically does something to ruin your day, you have a right to be pissy at them.<br>
<br>
But at least 95% of the crap LoS takes on the boards has nothing to do with anything that happened in game.<br>
<br>
I'm at least as sick of it as he is.<br>
<br>
And I feel slighted by comments like that because.. blah, I write too much, I just do.  &lt;ninja edit&gt;<br>
<br>
And it makes me want to stop worrying about how people treat his guild, but then I remind myself that I'm not doing it for him, I don't even know him really (in game), but I'm doing it:<br>
1. Because they're treated wrong and I like things to be right (god complex anybody?)<br>
2. For friends like Deris, Basheek, Talaban, who at times have gotten wholey fed up with unfair treatment.<br>
<br>
And I think if everybody just got naked and jumped into a hot tub every once in a while, this world would be a better place.<br>

<br>
I appreciate you responding to my post.  I know that we spoke several times during the evening.  It is my impression that IB had Hate for the day (maybe there plans changed which is fine).    <br>
<br>
Your raid on Hate was fine in general.  The zone had repopped and was ready for our raid.  I hope you got lot of great drops.  <br>
<br>
My problem is that you killed Inny, which I believe you did just 2 days before.  I posted on that post also.  So one God you kill back to back when there are many guilds that would like a chance to kill him.  That to me is greedy and unfair. (Although that is a statement only about the one act.  I KNOW that you are not a greedy person).  My post is NOT to discredit you in anyway but to let you know your actions have hurt someone. <br>
<br>
Members of your guild even told me you were only killing Maestro so I did not distrust them (maybe that is an error on my part)  Maybe they didn't really know and only &quot;thought&quot; that was the plan.  I am not sure. <br>
<br>
I have not had a chance to killing Inny or CT in 4 months on any Heroes raid.  <br>
<br>
I sit back wondering how I am going to get to kill Inny or CT under the current rules or when he dies a few hours before I zone in.<br>

If the god is up every single day for a week, and the same guild took that god down every single day because no one was going to do it, that doesn't mean it was your birthright to get to kill this god.  Just because they killed the god 2 days prior does not have any bearing on this situation.  The were in a plane and the God was up.  That god was THEIRS NOT YOURS bottom line.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have not had a chance to killing Inny or CT in 4 months on any Heroes raid.&quot;  -Alaoan<br>
<br>
What about guilds that are doing planes that have never done a god?  Why does it matter how many chances a person has had at killing a god?  It has always been that if a god is up, and you are in the plane that god is yours.  From my perspective they have done nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
One last though.  You basically are pissed all to hell that you feel you were robbed.  I would like a show of hand from people who raided the planes for the past two months on either Saturday or Sunday how many of those times a God was up?  The only reason a God is up on Saturday or Sunday is because there was a server that went down to emergency maintenance or a problem with the plane.  Maybe you would increase your chances at a god if you planned your raids on days that servers are brought down?  Say some time around either Tuesday or Wednesday? Just a though.<br>

The way reservations and Gods in POH/POF have been treated is:  if the God is up during your reservation, it's yours to kill.  The timer has never stopped at 12 midnight PST, EST, or CST.<br>
<br>
However, it's also been seen as inconsiderate to stay so long in a plane that it's not repopped for a scheduled raid the next day.  Sounds like this did not occur, therefore nothing wrong occurred.<br>
<br>
Now the guild had Inno two times in a row?  Inno was up during their two reservations so again no problem there.<br>
<br>
Now the only thing another guild could have done is ask that they leave Inno up (ask the guildmaster or the raid leader...nobody else).<br>
<br>
VI loves to throw in patches midweek like Tuesday or Wednesday.  If you want a God, schedule your raids midweek because Inno and Cazic seldom last until the weekend.  POH and POF Gods are in high demand due to epic quests, so I would never assume a guild raiding either plane would leave a God up.<br>
