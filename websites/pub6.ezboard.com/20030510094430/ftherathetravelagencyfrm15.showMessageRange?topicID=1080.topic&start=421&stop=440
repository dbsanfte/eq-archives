I also understand that you feel pationate about the rotations, to quote another:<br>
<br>
&quot;the best way to get the most out of an experience is to become involved in creating it&quot; <br>
<br>
I just get the impression that you hate soy, and that theres no getting around that.  That is why I 'accused' you of finding joy in the slander of our name and reputation.  Its fairly obvious that I dont like that since Im a member of soy.  No one should have the right to question my integrity or credibility based on the actions of others.  <br>
<br>
My experience with SoY has been wonderfull.  From my perspective we have respected every rule set out on our server, we dont KS, we negotiate camps and find resolutions, we dont recipricate mean spritited behavior.   That is why I joined this guild and that is why im staying.  <br>
<br>
As far as this matter is concerned, I would have preffered a more cooperative response from my own guild to show that though we are not perfect, we do support the spirit of the rotations agreement and accept whatever sanction was put out (within reason of course).  <br>
<br>
I suppose their might be a thin line between pursuing a passionate cause and a personal vendeta, just want to be clear as to which side your on.<br>

People are bound to screw up, whether it be taking a mob that isn't your Rot turn, or making something up, or accidently training someone, there is going to be more problems of the same nature in the future, what's the point of getting upset? Is it going to solve problems faster? not likely. Will it make you feel better knowing you put someone down? I know it doesn't for me. Do you really want to have to come here and start posting about senseless crap day in and day out?<br>

All this does is get people mad, and thats when the fighting starts and people take sides. As for Sprigg, that is so true bud.. Why &quot;damage&quot; SoY's credibility when it was 1 person who &quot;messed&quot; up. Is it justafiable to say all of SoY is like that? not likely, I was in SoY, they are a great bunch of people, and even though im not guilded anymore i still talk to many of them.<br>
<br>
Im sorry for gettin angry, but there is a lot of bullshit posted in this thread and I did let my emotions take place. Zutan was in the wrong. Jester is a great guy, he believed something to be true, but found out it wasn't . nothing more to say, miscommunication, you can't express emotion on a computer as well as in person or on the phone, miscommunication happens.<br>

I have been tempted to post something along the same lines here but as a rule I 'try' not to respond to biased slander from people that have already made up there mind when in stead they should be gathering facts in a adult professional manner.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh, hey, did you forget you were on a flame board? Maybe you should look to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Guild Representative</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> section where I posed stuff like ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
*HOWEVER*, the fact that no one said &quot;hey, uh guys? Where's our Zlandicar?!?&quot; makes me question if one was taken. If one wasn't taken, then what the fuck are we doing here? <br>
<br>
I personally believe that he was solo'd, by hook or more likely by crook, but the logical part of my brain tells me that there are alternatives to my personal bias. All I want to do, is make sure we explore the alternatives first. Witch hunt bad, careful consideration good. <br>
<br>
The answer to that, resoundingly, is no, no matter how much he's pissed in the pool; being an asshole is not a violation of a rotation or posting rights.<br>
<br>
Let me be blisteringly clear; I don't want favoritism. I just want *fair*. And if the facts don't bear out the idea of a Zland pop between the 2nd and the 7th, then fair is to let those SoY who were idiots on the boards take their lumps on the boards, and suffer the lessening of their reputation, and other consequences of not playing well with others.<br>
<br>
All I ask is that we realize that we have literally weeks to hash this out, and that jumping on SoY with both feet precludes a clean place to stand if we are wrong. <br>
<br>
To me, this feels rushed; I'm not sure we even waited for a Zland pop to see if the dates corrisponded in any way. Why not?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong; personally, as a player who has no love lost, I say &quot;fuck it, no zland for you&quot;. But that is the exactly wrong way to make a decision that could well come back to haunt those who made it. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Before you cast stones, you better know who you're dealing with. I am sure you won't make the leap, but you should; no matter if a zland was taken or not, the pool got pissed in. Talking about my 'bias' is bullshit; first of all, I am a representative of *MY GUILD* when I post in the guild rep forum. I occasionally update rotations or add people to one for more than just my own guild. That, and when I post in the admin only section, I am being an admin of the boards. When, however, I post on the flame boards, I represent *myself*, thank you very much. You will note the difference, or you won't, but that is no longer my problem. The only time on the flame boards that I represent anything other than my own view, is when people agree with me; and I *never* claim to have any support for my flames, other than my own words. <br>
<br>
And for your information, slander is when lies are spoken outloud; libel is the word you are looking for, because I am using print. And, more to the point, when or if anyone proves that by posting in a way to upset the system is *not* pissing in the pool, I'll apologize. Until then, my statements were truthful; that precludes the possibility of libel on the very face of the issue. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

That's nice. <br>
<br>
Are you saying that absolutely no one should care, because in your infinite wisdom, obviously approaching Zen as you are, you don't care? I don't apologize for taking fairly seriously the things that I enjoy doing, and if you think so little of my rights to spend my time in an enjoyable way, then yes, you can eat my ass. With Syrup. Repeatedly.<br>
<br>
That's *if* you're even being truthful of a situation in which someone renders useless the time you invested into a game or activity of some kind. I find your glib 'I don't care' reply hard to believe, funny that it's very self-serving of you to not care. Must be coincidence that someone who doesn't care so much about the goings-on in a game cares enough to post about how much the game doesn't matter and how little they care. I normally hate when people use circular logic, but hell, flame forum, gotta love it. At least I embrace my hypocrisy and self-serving nature. What's your damage?<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well gee, this would relate in some small, almost meaningless way... if anything was &quot;BORROWED&quot;. No one gave permission to anyone to solo the mob that was reported to have been solo'd. To &quot;borrow&quot; something, you need to have &quot;permission&quot; from the &quot;owner&quot;. (Heard those words before? Just checking)<br>
<br>
I think you mean if some kid STOLE my car and smashed it up, would I be an 'ignorant prick'? I don't think the &quot;ignorant prick&quot; category would fit someone who got mad. Perhaps &quot;normal human being&quot; would be a better term. Take your holier than thou attitude somewhere else please, it's showing through your shroud of bullshit. <br>

So you don't believe in any rotations at all? Because, you know, 'this mob will be up again'? I'm sorry, you play on a server that uses a reservation and rotation system.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Uh, yeah... so, anytime anyone on the server does something wrong, or anytime someone brings something disruptive to the boards, it's... everybody's fault? Or at least 'someone else's'? So who is at fault when someone trains the graveyards? The person looting their body? WOW, all this time, stupid me, I thought it was the person who brought the mobs. Thank you for clearing that up...<br>
<br>
If I'm so very wrong, as you suggest, then why are you asking 'me' to be the bigger man about it? Is it too hard for you to do? Or is it because it would be easier to be wrong, if people would just, darn it, stop pointing it out? It is very easy to say &quot;just be big about this guys&quot; when you have nothing else to say. I'll even help you; when stuck in the future, just use CTRL and C and then CTRL and V and repeat &quot;just be big about it&quot; over and over. We'll understand what you mean, honest. So, I'll tell you what, I'll stop reminding you that you're wrong, and you... stop talking. That will work for everyone, I think, especially you. <br>

Right, because I suggested violence. Good leap, maybe next time, aim for some solid ground under your feet? It'll help when you flail wildly about to have something to run into. Do try to incorporate the theory into your daily living if you think it will help. <br>

Well, if your violence-in-the-workplace was anything close to a relevant example, I'd agree with you.

Oh, wait... no, I've been saying that we need people who understand and conform to the rules that are in place to allow everyone to enjoy their experience. That, to me, sounds like *less assholes*. If you have such a problem with people who likes rules and order... what does that make you?<br>
<br>
You know what an asshole is, junior? It is not the person that points out when someone does something wrong. Noooo, it is the person that doesn't care when they are doing something wrong. <br>
<br>
Assholes steal cars, radios, mobs, loot. <br>

Believe me, I can go back and quote it for you, if you've forgotten. So, the minute someone posts something that negates your oh-so-very clever &quot;you have no life&quot; argument, it's trivial? That must be a nice worldview to have, I'm sure it will take you very far. Let me suggest another approach you might take when someone says something you disagree with, but you can't prove wrong; you put both your hands over your ears and say &quot;LA LA LA&quot; really loud. <br>
<br>
They both do as well as your attempts to rationalize why &quot;it's just a game so it doesn't matter&quot;.<br>

<br>
This is wholly untrue. One is representative of the organizations they are a part of. One suffers the reputation of those organizations, good or bad. If I am a ranking member of a charitable foundation for children, and am found to be molesting children, one of 2 things happens. 1) I get kicked out of the organization for not representing their beliefs. 2) The organization loses all credibility in the eyes of its supporters.<br>
<br>
If I were a member of the Nazi party, or the KKK, would you not associate me with the actions of others in those organizations, actions made in the name of said organization? Of course you would. <br>
<br>
So when a member of SoY commits an act (whether that act was a gank, or a joke...and I believe it was a gank 110%), and the guildleader supports it, and the members come and defend it, and no one owns up to it, ALL of those in that organization are going to be looked at as if they support this kind of behavior. Should the general membership have an outcry for action because this was a deplorable thing to do to their personal reputations, and the leadership acted on this, we would all be 350 posts back, and this would all be done.<br>
<br>
The fact is, the members of SoY dont seem to care to make their leadership do the right thing in the face of adversity. Only one officer has had the brains to come here and take ownership of ANYTHING, and even that seemed half assed.<br>
<br>
To all of those who say &quot;chill out its jsut a game...dont get upset, let it go, let it die...&quot; If I killed your mother, and told you I did it, but you couldnt find her body, would you let it go? Extreme example, sure, but your mother doesnt matter to me. Maybe our rotation rules and their integrity dont mean anything to you, but dont tell me to stop fighting for something i believe in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=degenrash>DegenRash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/14/03 10:50:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1080.topic&index=426>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Zland Rotation</span><hr size=1> Wow, good job, now will I retort with stupid comments as well?

Try again, bucky.

Do you belong to a guild that is on any rotations? Because that, right there, means that you have to follow the rules. And part of following the rules, is respecting the rules. <br>

You can't get the benefits without the drawbacks, at least in the 'really real world' that you are so fond of using for examples.

<br>
And yet you say you choose to abide by the rules that you suggest are meaningless and are there only to protect the whining ranks of the children who play on the rathe? If it all means so little to you, and everything about the game is so meaningless, why do you 'choose' to follow the rules that clearly you think are so wasteful?<br>
<br>
Oh, I finally see... you've been forced into the rules that you disagree with because there aren't enough people on the server who want the stress of FFA. I'd be bitter too, if everytime I talked about what I wanted, I looked like an idiot. We understand. But really, try to swallow that bitter little pill; and choke on it if you have to, but those of us who like a civil server, and like civil interactions between guilds... well, we *like* the rules and until the number of people like *you* outnumber the others on this server, it's not going to change. <br>
<br>
And, offhand, if it actually is a choice for you to abide by the rules, why, oh why, do you ridicule them? If you had any choice in the matter, personally, you'd pick what appealed to you most, unless you have a glib reply like &quot;no I wouldn't, I like picking things I don't want to do&quot;. <br>

Sorry I can't word what I say so you can contemplate it appropriatly, obviously you think a little different then I. So as it goes, I won't talk to you anymore, You miss points, turn around concepts and well pretty much misunderstand. Perhaps you should open your eyes, maybe think about the posts a little more. I messed up as well regarding the commas thing. Misunderstood. As for the Rotation rules , I follow them because my guild is on the rotations, would I say tell them to screw off, no, I respect them and what they want. And there are a few guilds on Rathe the dont go by rotations, why i dont join them , i dont have real life friends there. I dont care about what mob drops what. Loot is not a factor in the game. I play to talk to others and level a character. I don't get all upset when someone KS's me, nor do I flame about it, I move on. I'm sorry that you have to take this game so seriously as to you find the need to bicker and have to set up rules on certain mobs. As well there are quite a few servers out there that dont even use a Rotation schedule, you know why? Cause they can SHARE. If you need  a rotation to delegate who gets what mob, isn't that a sense of greed? You need rules to say &quot;hey, its this guilds turn?&quot;? Oh well, if this is too hard of a concept to grasp then ill give up ok? Can't talk sense to a brick wall now can you?<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW <br>
<br>
&quot;That's funny, you're wrong and yet you keep talking. And for the record, you've said it many more times than once.&quot; <br>

<br>
Oh sorry i didnt put many times , thought maybe you might get the point anyways, but i guess not.<br>
<br>
And about my &quot;belly aching&quot; about the whole thread. It was under a completely different context, I was simply stating &quot;lets just drop it, nothings wrong, no mob was taken&quot; But once again, you probably misinterpreted it now didn't ya? Sorry I don't make up lavish mumbo jumbo to explain my actions and reasons to every degree so that even you can't misunderstand. My bad.<br>
<br>
And yes I lose sleep because you post messages.. are you really an idiot? Let me interpret that for you.... I'm sick of whiners such as yourself complaining about nothing, Do I lose sleep over it? no, Do I think you are an idiot, damn right I do. And I post to let you know just how pathetic YOU are. Complaining about the someone &quot;ganking&quot; a mob, that surprise surprise popped anyways.<br>
<br>
Since when did North Americans go by Guilty until proven innocent? Correct me if im wrong, but isn't it Innocent until proven guilty, it took about 3 posts before everyone jumped on SoY's back with NO PROOF, and as you put it &quot;just defending the rules&quot; Well maybe you should take a look at the situation before you even get involved and post udder bullshit, SoY did NOTHING wrong. Zutan made a joke, people took offense, Oh well, life is tough isn't it. Zland still popped and my guild dropped him. <br>
<br>
Then people have the nerve to say &quot;this has damage soy's rep&quot; How so? You can't play a joke on someone these days now without losing credibility? Guess people better stop telling jokes, or playin jokes period right? Don't want them to damage their credibility.<br>

It's funny that you should bring up mounds of &quot;oh, you guys made up your mind within three posts&quot; when I posted earlier snippits of obvious &quot;lets talk about it&quot; posts I made about the situation. Kudos to you on missing the important stuff. And hey, while we're at it, here's some more points you miss blatently. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
If you need a rotation to delegate who gets what mob, isn't that a sense of greed?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What? I can only assume you're defining 'greed' as: wanting as many people as can kill the mob to have equal access to the content. Any other interpretation makes your own statement logically invalid; if the system was based on greed, and not on sharing, you'd have permafarmed high end content. Not only just the blanket of 'high end content' but certain mobs that drop keys to important dungeons; there wouldn't be a Vex Thal rotation; first guild in would permafarm the last key-piece dropper. It's called cockblocking, and it happens rampantly on your other utopian society servers. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Name one. <br>
<br>
No, really; tell me the name of the one or two or three or ten guilds on the server that regularly kill, or even occasionally kill a rotation mob, that doesn't appear on the RTA rotations. Hell, likely the least used old plane, Sky, gets attention if a guild goes in against a reserved date. <br>
<br>
Lets not confuse guilds that go to the reserved planes on FFA days, or on booked days against the reservation system because they don't know about it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you'd be clear, or at least correct, it would be hard to find problems with your posts. My replies have nothing to do with 'thinking differantly', and everything to do with disputing your claims. I'm replying to your own words, and saying that you're wrong. I'm not interpreting what you are saying any differantly than you mean it, that's the problem. <br>

Do you know what posting about a solo zland kill in the rotation requests forum, following it up with many posts that all claim that it was true, or that someone heard that it was true from the person who did it, do you know what that is?<br>
<br>
It's a false alarm. And just like pulling a fire alarm gets everyone scurrying around because it might be real, this got everyone worked up. If it was a joke, it wasn't funny; and as I've said on the guild forum... (have you bothered to read anything on the subject, or do you just feel too much has been said, and are working of that assumption?) as I've said in the guild forum, the punishment for being an asshole on the boards is to take their lumps on the boards. So yeah, what you think is &quot;nothing&quot; had a lot of people pissed off. You obviously don't care, so long as you're not annoyed in the process, but that's you. Other people take things they invest time in seriously. <br>

Is that so? You didn't start your appearance on this thread with complaining about something? <br>

That's funny, because reading that, I see complaints followed by the first of your many 'get a life' arguments. Would you define what bellyaching is then, for those of us who are just assuming you mean complaining about something? Hint: If you say &quot;bellyaching is what I say it is, and that's that&quot; it's not going to go over too well.<br>

Yeah, I guess I've answered my own question about you bothering to read anything of the thread; my complaint with their ganking ended the minute it was clear they didn't take it; you can see that (if you care to actually learn about the situation) in my posts in the guild rep forum. My problem then was with the completely unnecessairy mess that was made over their &quot;joke&quot; because they thought it would be funny. <br>

Let me make a few jokes that people take offense to. Let me make them in a forum where most people won't find them funny. I know, I'll go to a special olympics and tell jokes about what's better than winning. Or I'll go to an NAACP rally and tell them the one about the woman with the watermelon. And when I'm done there, how about I come back to the RTA boards and make up a funny joke about how I'm fucking with a rotation and have my friends come and say that it's true, so we can all get a good laugh. <br>
<br>
Get it through your thick sloped forhead; SoY may have not taken a mob out of turn, but 'they' certainly did something wrong when the came here and 'joked' about it. Since they did something wrong, your whole &quot;OMFG guys, ur so lam0rz, they didn't do anything so just STFU&quot; bullshit grates on my nerves. <br>

Gee, I wonder how I can misunderstand, you're so logically consistant in your thoughts and feelings. <br>
<br>
And how am I turning anything around? I'm telling you what your words mean; if you don't know how to express yourself, that's not my fault. You have two options; understand that you are wrong, or realize that you don't know the meanings of any of the words you are using. It's very simple. <br>
<br>
As for me being an idiot... <br>
<br>
...if you think so, I must be doing something right. <br>

Uh, I don't want to ruin the rant you were off on about 'innocent until proven guilty' but did you read the first 3 posts in the thread? They are all &quot;yeah right, whatever&quot; posts. <br>
<br>
It wasn't until *by reading the posts from SoY members* it appeared that it actually *HAD* happened, that people got worked up about it. <br>
<br>
So yeah, lets use the &quot;signed confession&quot; in the whole &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; stuff, mmkay?<br>
<br>
There was absolutely NO indication that anyone posting from SoY doubted the event took place. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry that you feel rational examining of the post is &quot;twisting it&quot;. I can see where taking what you post, and correcting your factual errors and errors in judgement would be 'twisting' for you, but for everyone else, it's just correcting someone who doesn't know his ass from his elbow. Sorry for the misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
I suspect I can sum up your next post, if you feel the need to add to it, go ahead. <br>
<br>
I think it will look something like this...<br>
<br>
I said drop it, god, don't you listen to me? Drop it, drop it, drop it. <br>
<br>
And then I'll say &quot;no, I don't listen to you, you're too often wrong about stuff&quot;. <br>
<br>
And then you'll say &quot;drop it&quot; again. <br>
<br>
That's about where I'll leave off, because after I've pointed out that your views are wrong, all you'll have left is telling me that I'm not proving anything. By that time, you'll finally be right. <br>
<br>
But yeah, do go on believing whatever you'd like; you're entitled to your wrong opinions. Especially if you're French. <br>

This guy is so obviously an idiot I can hardly breath. He is complaining about us complaining first off. Then he calls us pathetic because we complain about something that offends us, but continues to complain about us complaining.<br>
<br>
Its because of people like this jackass that no member of SoY holds any credence on these boards anymore...at least in my eyes. I support everyone having an opinion, but when you are only defending a losing position to save face, its time to own up. Take your lumps and hope people either forget, or forgive. Neither of which will I do for a LONG time. I suspect many others feel the same way.<br>
<br>
P.S. If ever you argue with Rogg, make DAMN sure you have a mastery of the english language, a ROCK SOLID position, hard facts supporting your case, and really think skin...cause you ain't gonna win.<br>
