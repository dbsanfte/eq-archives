class=title>   There is a name I can't forget...</span><hr size=1> There is a name I can’t forget. If I do, I think I will be the last person to forget her, that no one else in the world may remember her. Her name is Dawn Wynters, though I suspect quite strongly that it is a fake name, given to strangers who want to be helpful, or who want to be hurtful. I didn’t find out until the next day that she was 14, though I suspect that too, is a lie, to get a better fare on the bus. But they aren’t lies. I suspect they are, because I don’t want to believe they aren’t. <br>
<br>
This is the wrong way to begin, isn’t it?<br>
<br>
I was working the Sum 41 concert last night. Busy night on the barricade, but that is a story for later, mostly. <br>
<br>
She was my front row girl: the girl who got there early and who stayed in the front row center all night, in the middle of the pushing and the shoving, she held her ground. She was also the most attractive there that night. Blonde, and gentle eyes, almond face. She had that punk look to her that some guys don’t like, and some guys do. She looked like she was having a good time. She’s got a little metal in her face, nothing too much, but a nose ring, a lip ring, and a few earrings in each ear. She wears a homemade safety pin necklace, but it all looks good on her. <br>
<br>
Flash forward a few hours, and I’m working an upstairs hallway, babysitting our marketing director as she tries to evict the band from the building by herself. That same girl is upstairs, and I’m chatting with her, passing the time, and, in all honesty, trying to pick up. She looks really upset, more than most people were tonight. I ask what’s wrong, because if I can solve a problem, I’m feeling good about myself. <br>
<br>
She says that she has no way home tonight. The gears turn a little in my head, and I offer to drive her home, and ask where she lives. The answer shuts me up a little. She lives in Toronto, a solid sixteen-hour drive away, nonstop. I’d be late for work in 2 days if I drove her home. She’s got a timid voice, like she’s talking to someone who has just hit her, very hard, and wants nothing more than to not be hit again. She tells me that she thought she could get a ride back with the band on their bus, but they were offering her a ride of a kind she didn’t want to take. <br>
<br>
I ask her if she’s got a place to stay for the night, and I know the answer before I ask. I offer to let her stay at my place, on the couch, I add a second later, though with enough weight to let her understand there’s a bit of an opportunity if she wants it. She hesitated long enough that I knew she didn’t want it, so I also suggested a youth hostel downtown, and a bus station tomorrow. She nodded, and before I could discuss it further, the marketing director stopped in front of her, and asked what she was doing still in the building. Dawn stammered a little, which opened her up for the characteristic “Sorry, you have to leave now”. I jumped in, said I was driving her home, she’s with me. When I say ‘with me’ at work, it means ‘leave them the hell alone’. At least Dawn wasn’t getting kicked out. After we were alone again, I asked her name, in case I had to tell anyone who I was driving home. We shook hands, and I told her it was a pleasure to meet her. <br>
<br>
I drove her to the youth hostel after I got off work, to set her up with a room. She filled out a personal form, a whole lot of the information missing. She didn’t fill in an address, or phone number. Just her name, and my name as an emergency contact. My name. I’d known the girl for 3 hours, at the outside, and I was her emergency contact. We chatted before she went up to her room, women only accommodations. I gave her my phone number written on a piece of paper, wrapped around a quarter in case she needed a pay phone. I glanced at the sheet she was filling out, and saw her last name for the first time. <br>
<br>
I went back to work for the after party, and met up with some friends, had a few drinks, caught up with everyone having a good time. Made a date with a friend to go out for drinks sometime, just the two of us. I drove home with a grin and a light buzz on, from the concert and the date. <br>
<br>
The next morning, she called. She needed someone over 19 to sign for her to get on the bus home. I figured she had to be 18 at least, she looked 18 easily, I would have said 20. I shrugged into my clothes, and put on an old jacket, in case it was cold or rainy, I was going to give the jacket to Dawn for the trip home. I got to the bus station, and saw her sitting on a bench, looking worried. I was late, about half an hour. I knew she thought I wasn’t going to show. We went up to the teller together, and filled out some forms, promising that she would not require more care than an adult on the same trip, that I’d pay for the cost of her safe travel if it was more than she’d paid for the ticket. Before I signed, I read that I had to be her parent or legal guardian to sign. I didn’t hesitate, and added my signature, invalidating the contract, or the ability of the bus line to collect from me. The attendant nodded, and processed her ticket. As he did so, he said, looking at her identification card, ‘since you’re 14, you qualify for the student rate, so it’s only 159.00 to Toronto’. As I tried to not look floored, she pulled out the money to pay, two fifties and a hundred. As we walked away, I whispered to her, in amazement ‘I had no idea you were that young Dawn. Are you sure Toronto is where you want to go back to? Do you have a place you could go where you have an address?’ She put her head down, and told me that she hadn’t had a place like that since she was twelve. She was looking for work in Toronto, but couldn’t find any. <br>
<br>
I almost vomited. Here was a fourteen year old girl, standing in front of me, telling me that she’s been looking for work for two years, but she looks reasonably well fed, she’s not thin or sickly looking. She’s attractive, and easily able to pass for twenty. I know that, because I wouldn’t ask her for identification if she came to my door. And she’s got a wallet with fifties and hundreds in it. I didn’t want to think about it. I couldn’t say anything. All I could do was put her on a bus back to a city that I don’t think she should have gone to. I regret trying to help her get back now. So I can’t forget her name, I don’t want to be the last person that forgets her. What else can I do?<br>
<br>
I used to sit with an egg timer, close my eyes and let time pass quietly, not watching the time, just letting it pass as I knew it would. I’d not open my eyes until the timer had passed an hour, sometimes two hours. I’d lose myself in thought, sometimes I’d sleep, other times I’d tell stories or replay events in my mind. <br>
<br>
When I close my eyes tonight, I worry about Dawn. I know that will pass, that my memory won’t paint a picture of her for long, now that she’s gone. I can’t forget her name, but I guess I don’t know much about myself after all. <br>
<br>
Before I left the bus station, she sat down and I started to walk away. She turned her head up at me, and the noon sunlight through the windows made her squint at me. She said, in a stronger voice, ‘maybe I’ll see you around some time?’<br>
<br>
I didn’t know what to say, so I opened my arms a little at my waist, in a gesture of futility, and half bowed, tilted my head toward her, and said ‘I don’t know Dawn, that I will ever see you again. But I wish you well, just the same.’ She nodded, and turned back to watching for her bus. <br>
<br>
I left, and hated every step I took. <br>
<br>
*END*<br>
<br>
The above story is true, told with as much attention to detail as I could muster the next day. <br>
<br>
I wish I'd imagined it all. <br>
<br>
Yers,<br>
