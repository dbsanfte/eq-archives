Jasmanna</span><hr size=1> I realize that I have some issues that follow me around, because obviously, I've done some lame things in EQ. <br>
<br>
There are 2 specific instances where I get hounded on, and although i think they were misunderstood (and at that time I never knew that there even was an RTA board) and never posted MY side of what happened.<br>
<br>
There are two instances in in East Wastes which I was accused of wrong doing - one was taking a Blood Ember from KoO (Keepers of Oak)... Although I feel my reasons were completely justified, and the Ember was given to a guildie. Certain untruthes were made to damage my reputation even further by a few KoO members trying to over defend their guildies. I understand that. It was taken too far and posts like &quot;THAT BITCH SHOULD JUST DIE..&quot; were uncalled for. I mean not to spark any flames with KoO anymore.<br>
<br>
The second instance was when Foundation Rathe was doing 8th ring quest in EW. The oracle, chief and a buncha giants spawn inside orc fort. I disregarded the fact that they OOC'd they were doing quest..  I tried pulling the oracle away - after they were harmonizing everything and pulling the cheif. (THAT was stupid, and that was if anything the damaging part) Well their druid snared the cheif and the cheif took off after me.. Well, I FD'd apologized that it aggroed and Q'd out to lose aggro.<br>
<br>
I completely apologize for the situations I got in which created discomfort like that. I have found it hard to get people to believe that i really am a person here, and now that I like to play more often it's even harder. <br>
<br>
As  for Drache's post - I feel he was COMPLETELY out of line in posting my PERSONAL life information on the net. My appearance, pictures, info is mine regardless of how immature that was.<br>
<br>
Now, I KNOW that I have only brought this on myself, and that I've not been a friendly person to people who feel they already know who I am. Right now I just ask that all people who read this at least know that I apologize for all harm caused, and I hope that me being mature in this fashion could bring a little more respect to my name. I hope that now, when someone sees me I have a chance to talk with them so they know that inside, i am a good person. <br>
<br>
Thanks Guys, and Gals...<br>

Jasmanna</span><hr size=1> Quite frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn! You can try to rationalize and justify your antisocial behavior all day long and it won't change my feelings about you. Why? Your feeble apology is a lie. You are the same low-life person you were in the past.<br>
<br>
I personally observed your kill stealing ways recently in Dawnshroud Peaks. And when several groups called you on it, you were vindictive and killed the ancient rockhopper (whatever his name is) to make sure none of the groups there would get any more rockhoppers. This was after all the different groups shouted out for no one to kill him and saying why not. You did it anyway. You tried to cover your lame a$$ by saying you needed a necro item from a sambata but then you immediately zoned out.  It was clear to all of us what had just occurred. You were paying us back for having the nerve to politely ask you in tells to quit taking our pulls.<br>
<br>
You may not deserve to have your personal life on display on the Internet but you do deserve the disdain that others and I feel for you. Your actions have brought this upon yourself. Don't try to blame Drache or others for YOUR past and continued bad behavior. And please don't think you can just do these things and go &quot;oops, sorry guys, I'm really nice&quot; and we won't notice the rude, selfish, and inconsiderate behavior patterns you continue to exhibit towards The Rathe community. As you can see, your past actions, along with your current actions, will haunt you.<br>
<br>
Drache did you a favor by telling us you are a real female. Why? Guys in the game will feel sorry for you and forgive how you behave. But had he not told us, I would have sworn you were some punk-a$$ little boy that hasn't figured out how to get rid of excess hormones. Most women I have had the pleasure of meeting from online games are very nice towards others and quite caring. Hell, SLR's are nicer than you! In your case, you may have a full six-pack, but you are missing the plastic thingy that holds them together!<br>
<br>
Do yourself and the rest of us a favor and take your apology and shove it where the sun don't shine.  <p><BR>

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubogfatherbellybarsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/31/02 2:57:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=662.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well - I ask for forgiveness ...

No where did i say that I want everyone just forget things, but I know everywhere i go i seem to get into arguements with people. If I don't let them &quot;win&quot; the arguement (such as WHOSE SPAWN IS THIS? WHAT WE WERE HERE FIRST, NO I WAS HERE FIRST..) like that, and say &quot;Oh my bad, I guess you can just have the camp now,' then i guess i'm branded a KSer form that person. Then he can read posts and say &quot;OMG the KSer from SK!!!!&quot; Sorry, I may be stubborn, but i don't KS people.<br>
