                       The Crown<br>
<br>
                       Prologue:<br>
                     The Artifact<br>
<br>
     A small black wolf trotted through the forest of Lesser Faydark, weaving in and out of the thickets of trees and shrubbery.  Wolves like this flourished in these forests.  They found it a warm and inviting land filled plenty, as it should be.  These forests are the safe haven and thriving centers of Tunare’s power.  She, as the Mother of All cares for her children.  But as in all the realms of Norrath, there are dangers here.  The small wolf sensed something.  There was an enemy nearby.  Its acute senses knew it was not one of its mother’s children.  It was something else, something vicious.<br>
<br>
     Over a hill, Jabbey followed behind tracking the wolf.  Jabbey was an orc of the Clan Crushbone.  A weak small orc, Jabbey was often used as a pawn in the forests, forced to leave the safe castle of his clan to forage and hunt for food and supplies.  Oh, Jabbey felt himself to be a lucky orc this evening.  He had managed to find wolf tracks.  OOOH, the legionnaires and centurions of the clan wouldn’t be so mean to him tonight!  NO NO, not to Jabbey!  They would thank him tonight!  Maybe even not beat him so much!  And maybe they might even share some of the meat with him.  No no, that would be wishing too much.  With the light races of Faydwer attacking the castle so much, there was little food and water around.  But still, he would have a good night tonight.  And no one would notice if he took a small slice of meat before he returned home.  Pawns needed to eat too, didn’t they?  Oh no!  The wolf had noticed someone tracking him.  Jabbey had to attack it now or never. <br>
<br>
     The wolf slowly turned his head around, sniffing at the cool soft breeze.  But suddenly, a small blue figure jumped out from behind some trees lining the hillside, its red eyes glowing as it shrieked an orcish battle cry!  The wolf was struck, and knocked to the ground, its hind legs crushed by the hammer that Jabbey was carrying.  Jabbey jumped up from the ground, expecting more of a fight from the wolf, but it was too injured.  It struggled in pain, trying to rise and walk with its hind legs.  But it was useless; they were crushed and bleeding.  Jabbey was overwhelmed with joy!  He had managed to defeat the wolf easily and he would be rewarded for bringing food back to the Clan’s castle tonight!  HA HA!  All that Jabbey had to do now was deal the final blow to the gravely injured wolf.  OH, what is this?  The wolf had managed to crawl away a few feet, a last ditch attempt to escape its attacker. He would not be stopped by this, not the mighty Jabbey!  The Forests of the Faydarks had their devils indeed, but also had its angels…  <br>
<br>
     As Jabbey slowly walked towards the injured wolf, a root jolted up from the ground, grabbing and entangling one of Jabbey’s legs.  What was this?!  As he struggled to break the roots grasp from his leg, another sprang forth, grabbing hold of his other leg.  Jabbey lost his balance, tumbling to the ground face first.  Jabbey, in a panic, reached for his dropped hammer, trying to find a way to break the roots grasp on him.  But as he did, 3 more roots sprang up, entangling each of his arms and his neck.  Jabbey was completely incapacitated now.  He was so panicked he did not notice as the Wood Elf came out from behind a tree.  He was so panicked, Jabbey did not notice as the wood elf moved in closely behind him and raised his mace.  And Jabbey had no clue that these moments of struggling with these roots were his last moments of life as the mace swiftly came down upon his head.  <br>
<br>
       The Wood elf, or Feir’dal, frowned as he wiped the Orc’s blood from his mace.  Lenolan hated violence like this, but he was a druid, a keeper of the forests of Tunare the Mother of all, and protector of all of her children.  It was his duty to protect all of the forest's creatures, including this wolf.  Lenolan turned his head to the injured and whimpering wolf, which stared at him, asking for help.  Lenolan walked over to his injured brother, kneeling down by its side putting both hands on its crushed hind legs.  Lenolan closed his eyes, saying a silent prayer to Tunare, the Mother.  A slight blue light flowed from his hands, enveloping the wolf’s broken body.  As the light receded, the wolf was made whole again, healed by the Mother’s power.  The wolf stood, jumped on his protector and licked Lenolan’s face.  Lenolan laughed and petted the wolf.  <br>
<br>
“Go on brother, find your pack and don’t travel alone so close to the castle.”<br>
<br>
     The wolf nodded in understanding and trotted off into the forest to find his pack.  Lenolan stood and smiled.  He was a young druid, his power weak compared to others, but he had done his duty this day. <br>
<br>
     Lenolan often wandered the grounds of the Greater forest of Faydark near the Castle Crushbone.  It was a dangerous area indeed as the god of war planted one of his creations there, the dreaded Orcs.  They were a fearsome race, born for nothing but conquest and destruction.  And the Orc’s of the Clan Crushbone were amongst the most dangerous of clans.  But, thank the Mother of all, the Feir’dal and Koada’dal (High Elves in the common tongue), had managed to push their conquest back with the help of the other light races of the continent of Faydwer, the Dwarves and the gnomes.  And though the Orcs were all but beaten, left starving and trapped in their own fortress, they were still a constant threat to the safety of the treetop city of Kelethin and the shinning city of beauty, Felwithe.  With this threat, many adventurers and crusaders were called to travel the forests near their lair, keeping the Orc’s in check.  This was Lenolan’s duty as a student of Druidic worship.  It was a dangerous task indeed, one filled with danger and constant fighting, but it was his purpose.  He did manage to find some peaceful moments during his scouting.  In an area of tall great trees, where flowers bloomed fully and animals tread without fear of the Orcs, there stood four tall pillars of marble.  These spires reached high into the sky, all reaching to meet eachother at the top.  This place was almost always empty.  It was peaceful and practically untouched.  Even the shy fairies of the land congregated here without worry.  <br>
<br>
        After much time spent relaxing here, communing with Tunare’s creations, Lenolan had learned that a few did traverse here.  And though they were few, they were powerful indeed.  These spires were a center of power for the great Wizards of Norrath.  These powerful masters of arcane magic used these spires, and others like them across Norrath, to traverse great distances in the blink of an eye.  So while Lenolan found this a peaceful, private place, he tried to remain out of direct sight of the spires as occasionally these wizards appeared there with allies.  Some of these wizards could be friendly, many of them actually being High Elves themselves returning home.  And some could be the strange human’s or enigmatic Erudites.  But on occasion, there might appear a Teir’dal, a Dark Elf.  These twisted cousins of the Feir’dal and Koada’dal lived for pain, suffering and hate.  Lenolan seldom saw these people, if they could be called that, and he was glad of that fact.  The stories of the cruelty and butchery of these elves were famous.  It was often said among the light elves that if you saw the blue skin of a Teir’dal, you were already dead.  They hated the light elves most of all, and a meeting of the two cousins seldom ended without violence.  <br>
     <br>
     They were as intelligent as the High Elves, if not more so, and used their great magics to rain suffering upon their enemies, often organizing the bloodthirsty (and often hungry) Ogres and Trolls to their own ends with the promise of humanoids to eat.  These Elves were the twisted creations of Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.  Innoruuk lived for nothing more then to curse the other god’s creations to take the world of Norrath for himself, and the Teir’dal were perfect for his purposes.  <br>
<br>
     Lenolan, however, pushed such thoughts from his mind.  He was beaming over his victory today and now he just wished the peace of the forest.  Little did he know as the soft leaves fell from these ancient trees, that such chaos would be introduced into his small peaceful life on this day, in this very moment.<br>
<br>
     As Lenolan sat, peacefully meditating to the sounds of the forest, an explosive bright light burst from the center of the spires.  It grew encompassing the entirety of the spires!  Lenolan leapt from his meditation, quickly darting behind some foliage.  He quietly spoke a prayer to the mother as the light grew.  In an instant, his image shimmered as he became camouflaged with the forest, remaining hidden from spying eyes.  He had seen the flash of light as wizards teleported into the spires before, but never a flash this large.  A huge group must have teleported into the forest.  What was such a large group doing here?  Many ideas flashed through Lenolan’s mind, the worst of which being a Teir’dal invasion.  It had been centuries since a direct Teir’dal attack, but they were known for striking when their foe least expected it.  The light faded, revealing a large amassed force the likes of which Lenolan had never seen.  He had seen the Armies of the joined forces of Faydwer gather for the assault on the Crushbone Orcs, but never one of this power.  The light revealed members of all the sentient races of Norrath.  Trolls stood next to gnomes, humans next to erudites, and Koada’dal next to Teir’dal.  Lenolan could sense from this group much power as their robes, armor, and weapons glimmered with that of magical power.  This could only be one thing, a raid to face one of the gods in battle on their planes.  <br>
<br>
     These raids were things of legend with all of the travelers of Norrath.  Only those of immense power could travel to these planes, heroes and villains of epic proportion were always there.  These raids were often used as examples and points of inspiration in peace talks in times of war.  With these raids, the most powerful of all of the races worked together, friend or foe, to defeat the image of a god.  <br>
<br>
     Lenolan stared in astonishment as he recognized great Light Elven heroes and then quacked in fear as he recognized those vile Teir’dal, Ogres and Trolls who were the subject of many children’s nightmares during his sleepy childhood nights in Kelethin.  But this gathering made Lenolan uneasy.  The air of this group was not one of cooperation.  It was one of conflict.  Feir’dal, Koada’dal and other light races gathered on one side of the spires as the Teir’dal Ogres and Trolls along with their dark allies gathered on the other.  Something had gone wrong.  Something was so important it broke the sacred oath of cooperation that these planes walkers pledged.  Lenolan knew he should have run.  He should have retreated to the safe treetops of Kelethin, but he did not.<br>
<br>
     Lenolan watched, mouth agape, as a Teir’dal in shimmering Black armor stepped in front of the crowd of dark races.  A Feir’dal druid stepped out ahead of his light allies, moving slowly and purposely towards the enemy to speak.  <br>
<br>
<br>
“We have cooperated up to this point, Teir’dal.  Let us not break the oath of the planes walkers.”<br>
<br>
     The Dark Elf chuckled, “You have something we want, pale one.  Give it to me and we can leave peacefully.  If you refuse, we shall drag you to the great halls of Neriak to be slowly ripped apart by the Queen’s Tentacle terrors, only to be healed and made whole, so that we may begin the torture all over again.  The choice is yours.  We live long lives, Feir’dal, I am sure a millennium of torture shall make you see your folly should you refuse me.  Give me the Crown.” <br>
<br>
     The group of light ones rustled at this threat.  Was the worst a Teir’dal could bestow, and they never bluffed.  But the Feir’dal was unfazed.  <br>
<br>
     “You know we can not do that, Dark one.  The Crown belongs with us.”<br>
<br>
<br>
     Crown?  “What Crown?”, Lenolan wondered.  The planes of the gods held many magical treasures of immense power.  But never had Lenolan heard of an artifact that would bring a raiding party to violence.  Lenolan’s wondering ended as the two parties began to take an offensive stance.  Few of the raiders left on their own accord, not wanting to interfere in the affairs of elves, but most stayed unwilling to stand down from a fight.  <br>
<br>
     The Teir’dal drew his sword as the Feir’dal drew his.  At this signal, both sides charged eachother.  Power like this Lenolan had never seen!  Mighty Magicians summoned forth humungous elementals from the earth!  Enchanters animated floating swords to do their fighting while creating illusions to frighten and confuse their enemies.  Clerics called forth the wrath of their gods on their enemies and blessings upon their allies.  Warriors, Shadow Knights, Paladins, and Rangers drew their weapons of immense power, cutting into eachother, Trying to get this crown.  What mighty crown could call forth such a battle?  <br>
<br>
     Giants balls of flame struck fighters down to the ground.  Blades cut down enemies in their wake.  And the ground shook as powerful spells were called forth, destroying all in their paths.    This small peaceful place Lenolan had found was turned into Norrath’s bastion of destruction in a few moments.  Lenolan watched as a powerful Teir’dal wizard called down a comet of ice from the sky.  It exploded in the center of the Wizard spires, throwing many people to the ground.  The lead Feir’dal was blown from the battle, gravely injured, near Lenolan.  Lenolan knew not what to do.  He could try and heal this Feir’dal, but he would become visible and perhaps a target of this mass destruction.  Being so young, he was afraid.  Lenolan swallowed his fear and moved to the Feir’dal.  He removed shards of ice from the Feir’dals chest and stomach as blood began to flow outwardly.  He had never healed so grave an injury, but he would try.  Lenolan placed his hands on the chest of the Feir’dal as the ground shook again.  The light blue glow flowed from his hands again, as the fallen elf gasped for the breath that was returned to him.  But as the Feir’dal regained his breath, Lenolan knew he hadn’t done enough.  The Feir’dal was still dying, he gave him but a few moments, and his power was worn out.  In his dying moment, the lead Feir’dal looked up to Lenolan, whos face was twisted with fear and regret.<br>
<br>
     “Worry not, young one…  you did what you could… you must do something for me, please, give me your oath, druid!”<br>
<br>
     Lenolan saw the desperation in the Feir’dal’s eyes.  <br>
     <br>
     “I give it brother, anything.”<br>
<br>
     “Take this, please.. keep it safe.  NO ONE MUST KNOW OF IT.  The consequences would be too great, please…  do this…  you are its keeper now…”<br>
<br>
      With those words, the Feir’dal’s life slipped away and from his hands, a small finely crafted shimmering crown dropped to the ground.  Lenolan gasped at its astounding beauty.  The violence happening around him disappeared for a moment.  Lenolan just stared at it until a spell shook the ground once more, bringing him to his senses.  He said a quick prayer of mourning for the fallen Feir’dal, grabbed the crown stuffed it in his backpack and ran.  <br>
<br>
     Lenolan had no idea how long he ran or where he was going.  He just wanted to be away from the battle as he now held the reason for it.  The only things flowing through his mind were fear and a desperate all important question.  “What is this crown?”<br>
<br>
more coming soon...                 <br>
