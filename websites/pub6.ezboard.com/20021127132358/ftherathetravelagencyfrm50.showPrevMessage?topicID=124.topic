They have not always been FFA.  They were implicitly left up to kill when the guild who was killing Dozekar was up for rotation, from what I recall.  For some time now, there has been an issue of 'poachers' taking out the named and leaving up Dozekar... basically when some guild was after Dozekar I'd hear questions about 'where are all the named'. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/15/02 10:37:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Named drakes in doze wing.....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showMessage?topicID=121.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/ftherath...=121.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 817<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/15/02 10:42:08 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Named drakes in doze wing.....</span><hr size=1> Since Tindi and NB started the rotation the named have ALWAYS been part of it. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadynstormsurge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadynstormsurge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/15/02 11:25:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   quest mobs</span><hr size=1> Why dont we put all quest mobs on a rotation then? or are you just concerned about your quest mobs?<br>

Including a set of mobs on a rotation does not exactly fit with the spirt of the rotation system. To get on the rotation, you must kill said mob. Lots of people can kill the named drakes. Shouldn't that mean they are able to get on the named drake rotation?<br>
<br>
Adding them to the Doz rotation is saying, &quot;ya we know you can kill them but don't. We want our quest stuff.&quot; Kinda selfish; others will be able to kill Doz eventually and they want the quest stuff as well. How many of you gathered stuff for a quest that you knew you couldnt do yet?<br>
<br>
If you are going to add quest mobs to the Rotation list, be prepaired for many mobs to hit that list. (Cause I want my quest stuff too)<br>

<br>
Ok ill prolly never see Doze myself as im to busy being a casual gamer myself and unguilded. BUT saying that.. after this issue was raised it looks to me as if Doze encounter was NOT clarified and you had to rewrite or reclarify the policy on him to be SPECIFIC where the named are concerned as of this date. So what ever the rule may be untill now no one should be held in blame for killing them if its not thier turn ... <br>
so then UNLESS said Rotation guild pops up somehow and tells folks  ... SAY  we just needed Doze... the named are up for grabs?. how do you deal with that sort of situation ?<br>
<br>
All this for mobs that are NOT considered to be part of qualifying for said MOB in the rotation? if as someone said they are easy kills?<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Look at it another way:<br>
<br>
I know Clan Bashemded is able to kill the named drakes (we havn't yet, and won't until we are on the Doz rotation) but if we were so inclined, we could kill them. <br>
<br>
A guild of our size, could time those named drakes right down to their spawning minute, be in HoT and pull them, leaving doz for whoever was due for him. <br>
<br>
Now, multiply the number of people doing this by the number of guilds of our size in HoT on a weekly basis, and you see a *whole bunch* of guilds able to kill the named drakes, but not Doz. <br>
<br>
Imagine you had, for example, the faction to do the first half of a quest, but were unable to finish that quest until you got your faction up. However, in so doing the first part of the quest, you caused all the turn in mobs to despawn for a week. <br>
<br>
Then imagine you did the first half of the quest every chance you got, and that there were many many people who could do the first half, but not the second half of the quest. <br>
<br>
That is exactly what people/organizations are doing if they kill mobs that are only valuable for those quest pieces, without the ability to get *all* the pieces. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into the &quot;they are rotations&quot; or &quot;they are FFA mobs&quot; because quite frankly, it doesn't matter: Common courtesy would suggest that if you can't finish the quest, and starting prevents others from finishing, don't start until you can finish the quest. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Let me retort with a rotation that I know nothing about. ToVN. It is my understanding that to get onto the ToVN rotation, you must kill the *hardest* mob of them all in ToVN, in which case, you get access to the easier ones for a 24 hour/48 hour period. In that example, including a set of mobs on a rotation is exactly in keeping with the rotation examples, and I suspect lots of people who could, if they bypassed the toughest ToVN dragons, could kill the weaker ones. <br>
<br>
Wasn't there an age old flame about a guild using CoH to get past the hard dragons to the easy ones, and being flamed for it? Yes, I believe there was. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This example is flawed for a few reasons. First, it is not selfish, it is pragmatic. For the same reason that people (used to at least) ask that clerics camping ragefire be ready for that step of their epic, people would ask that guilds who are unable to secure the final components of the quest do not remove the initial components from the field of play. Why? Because, frankly, some people/organizations will *not* be able to kill Doz eventually. There can be no other description than &quot;waste of quest pieces&quot; if a guild that was happily eating the named drakes for lunch, suddenly or even not-so-suddenly falls apart, leaving pieces to quests unobtainable. <br>
<br>
In a reasonable world, with reasonable people, examining this situation would reveal that the only selfish act is removing the availability of quest peices from those who are actually able to finish the quest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Your question is better asked as &quot;how many of you have gathered stuff for a quest you knew you couldn't do, and in so gathering stuff, removed everyone else's ability to do the quest for a week as well?&quot; I suspect the number is significantly lower when you apply analogous grounds to the question. <br>
<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't believe anyone said that *all* quest mobs are now up for rotation considerations. Some factors must apply: First, and most obvious, the ease of the kill must be definately taken into account. When a pick up, or nearly pick up raid of 30ish people can drop gorenaire, the amount of guilds able to enter into the rotation on said mob reaches a number that is best described as 'stupid large'. For the same reason I argued vehemently against a ragefire rotation, I would have to say that rotations on mobs like Gorenaire, Talendor, or even Venril Sathir, would be prohibitively long, and if not long, then made impossible to get onto without the good graces of those going before. <br>
<br>
Under no conceivable circumstances could a guild, for their first attempt at Gorenaire, race with guilds who had even an inclination to get there first and engage. With druid and wizard ports in the same zone allowing for a super fast mobilization time, there is no doubt that an experienced group of even 6 wizards, to say nothing of an entire organized guild, could conceivably keep anyone they wanted off the rotation, or at least hinder them so dramatically that it would hardly be worth the time. <br>
<br>
Some mobs, due to their nature, should be, and are FFA/FCFS race mobs. <br>
<br>
Would we, then (keeping in mind the differance between a reservation and a rotation) put a rotation on the planes because there are quest mobs available in those zones? Would we like to see a 40 guild rotation on fear, for example, for the enchanter epic? <br>
<br>
Certainly not. Some encounters do not run with an eye to rotation systems, and some do not work with an eye towards reservation systems. Some things are just simply for those who get there first, or sign up first. As such, people must respect the differances between those standards, or at least work within those differances, or the server will lose the reason for the reputation of a civil society: our civility. <br>
<br>
If your contention is that Doz and the named drakes do not fit the criteria for a rotation, that's one thing, and I believe it is wrong on several key elements of fact and argument, which I've already outlined. <br>
<br>
However, if your suggestion, as I read it, is that all quest mobs regardless of circumstance should now be considered for rotations, I have to say that you are very wrong, in a manner that would even prove dangerous to the way the rathe community works, if that proposal were to come to light. Again, for the same reason that people would ignore a ragefire rotation (from the old system) holds true here. A rotation that anyone can get on, is too bulky and slow, and must be turned into a FFA mob. Very simple, and very straightforward. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
IMO, either the mobs are FFA or on a rotation. not a combined rotation. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would argue that there is no such thing as a 'combined rotation' being that we've already established a precedent for the winning over the toughest relevant opponent, and as such, the entity would be considered as either entirely FFA/FCFS or entirely on a rotation. There can be no combination, since we are discussing apples and oranges, one or the other. <br>
<br>
Personally, as a member of a guild that cannot yet do doz, I would much prefer that this is an encompassed rotation: that is, when the time comes that we drop Doz, that we have the ability to start and finish those quests with confidence that other people will respect our wants to get a portion of the quest done, and that we can return that respect in kind.<br>
<br>
I would venture to say, that the only selfish attitude here is the one of those who think that they should 'stock up' on the necessairy quest pieces so that, in the eventuallity that they do kill Doz, they can possibly finish the quest, when they know full and well that 'stocking up' means that other people will not have the opportunity to finish a quest, while they themselves are waiting to start it, for most intents and purposes.<br>
<br>
No one is suggesting we draw and quarter those who have done it already: I think the issue is an agreement to not continue to remove content from people who can finish the quests, in favor of those who cannot yet.<br>
<br>
Seems fairly simple, and courteous to me, speaking of the uncommon common courtesy. <br>

<br>
1- Tindi or NB never killed the named drakes before they could kill Doze? /boggle I find this hard to believe<br>
<br>
2- Tindi/NB/LoM/LoL/FK (all/any other guilds on Doze rot) would not kill the nameds if they saw them up, and doze dead?  I find this hard to believe too<br>
<br>
I for one am glad that the nameds are being put on the rotation, but think it is unfair to the guilds that are 1 or 2 players/spells away from being able to kill doze.<br>
<br>
It's like Tindi/NB saying 'we could kill the mobs before we could kill doze b/c no one was killing doze, but now that someone is you other guilds can't kill them' and that is BS, sorry guys.<br>
<br>
As much as I want to finish my Doze quests and all my guildie's Doze quests, it is unfair.<br>
<br>
And if the rathe is supposed to be so fair-n-shiz then we should re-evaluate this situation, and if new rules are gonna be added to existing rotation mobs then ALL guilds who are part of that rotation should be included in them.  Don't just stick some @#%$ in and say, since we started it this is how its gonna be.<br>
<br>
And to the guy who said FK is stealing mobs, yeah buddy, I get FK to steal as many mobs as we can, we're the unfriendliest, meanest, most ruthless guild on the server, we'll KS any mob we can bro, you better watch your spiders in velks or we'll show up in force and take em all out! /rude<br>

Looks like they were added now in retrospect.<br>
<br>
I can understand the point of TL and NB in regard to the named mobs, however, I have to disagree with some of the posters here who say you are not allowed to kill mobs for a quest if you cannot finish the total quest at the point of time you gather components for it.  If that would be applied to everything in game, people shouldn't be starting their epic quests until they can do every part.  That's not right, either.  Looking at the current Dozekar rotation and the guilds we have on the Rathe right now, I see a couple of guilds probably able to break into this rotation in the near future, and my personal opinion is that they have the right to prepare for quests they have every intention on doing.  Yes, it is a waste if this intention is not there, and yes, it certainly does make this harder for guilds on the rotation, however, I consider this a fairer deal overall.<br>
<br>
Please allow me to let my imagination run wild a little here.  Since these tears/symbols are multiquestable, this could in fact create a situation where both guilds on the rotation and not yet on the rotation are enabled to finish these quests, if Dozekar rotation guilds MQ tears with guilds not on the rotation in exchange for symbols they are missing.  <p><p style="line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif"><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203090"><b>Kelon

<br>
Dozekar and the drakes are all on seperate RANDOM spawn timers.  If you see a named drake up when Doze isn't up, it's because A) Doze hasn't spawned yet and the named has or B) The named hadn't spawned when the rotation mob killed Doze.<br>
<br>
That's WHY those drakes stay up.  We have to wait for a full spawn to clear them.  Now if a guild leaves a full spawn up, then it passes to the next guild in the rotation.  <br>
<br>
This is simple.  This is how it has worked.  For months when it was just NB and Tindi doing Doze, NEITHER guild EVER took a named drake from the other.  It never happened, and we did a lot of armor farming in those days.<br>
<br>
Yes, Noble Blade and Tindi Losi both killed named drakes before we could kill Dozekar, but at that time there wasn't anyone else killing Dozekar.  If BOTS had been killing Doze then, we would have respected the drake spawns.<br>
<br>
Guys, there are levels of competition, and rules do get broken and sometimes guilds get nasty, but for the most part we do manage to fairly distribute the mobs on the server.  THe 'big three' do not exist to put other guilds down, and as time passes and all of the guilds mature, the rotation guidelines  have become less competitive and more open and friendly.<br>
<br>
Just respect it.  If you're a non-doze guild, you don't kill drakes.  If you are a Doze guild, you get one full spawn of drakes for every doze kill.  That's the only fair way to distribute the quests.  <br>

First, Rogg displayed suprising insight into this.  Well done.  /golfclap<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1- Tindi or NB never killed the named drakes before they could kill Doze? /boggle I find this hard to believe<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Tindi/NB killing named at this point didn't detract from anyone's Doze quests, which is the point.  Had killing named detracted from someone elses' experience in the game, we wouldn't have done it.  Period.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2- Tindi/NB/LoM/LoL/FK (all/any other guilds on Doze rot) would not kill the nameds if they saw them up, and doze dead? I find this hard to believe too<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Correct.  Tindi/NB/bots didn't kill named if they were up and it wasn't their turn, ever.  It's a rotation, you don't kill rotation mobs when it's not your turn.  That's the point of a rotation.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As much as I want to finish my Doze quests and all my guildie's Doze quests, it is unfair.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't think you have an accurate idea of what being on the Doze rotation means.  You and all your guildies will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> finish Doze quests.  NB has been killing Doze for about a year and a half now with 2 and a half guilds on the rotation (bots passed it more often than not) and has gotten 39 quests completed.  There are now 3 times as many guilds on the rotation.  With that math, your guild will complete a Doze quest every month and a half.  If you do Doze diligently for the next 2 years, you will finish 18-20 quest items, and having guilds KS the named drakes out of turn will slow you down signifigantly.  Doing a doze quest is basically like doing the Ragefire part of the cleric epic 2 or 3 times. (pre-spawned Rage)  Named are a once a week spawn, usually drop less than useful symbols, and have 6+ guilds waiting in line for them.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And if the rathe is supposed to be so fair-n-shiz then we should re-evaluate this situation, and if new rules are gonna be added to existing rotation mobs then ALL guilds who are part of that rotation should be included in them.

This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> always was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the rule.  It was never &quot;written down&quot; because the guilds in question were courtious enough to each other that it never needed to be written down- breaking the rotation just wasn't done.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I can understand the point of TL and NB in regard to the named mobs, however, I have to disagree with some of the posters here who say you are not allowed to kill mobs for a quest if you cannot finish the total quest at the point of time you gather components for it.

Turn the clock back a month to when Ragefire was the once a week or so spawn that he was.  The agreement/rule was you couldn't do Rage if you didn't have the King note.  So yes, when a spawn is as contested as Rage was and Doze named are, you can't start the quest if you can't finish it.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As NO ONE before this has *Set down the LAW* on these spawns and i see now not many knew of yer before *unwritten laws*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again- it never needed to be written down because it was just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> done.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  With Tindi and NB as the only guilds on the rotation, differences were settled in /tells between guild leaders.  The rules were always there, but there was no need to write them down.  Since people seem to be unclear on the rules, they are now written down for you. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
