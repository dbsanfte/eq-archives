I can only tell you that you could not be more wrong if that is the case.  Many a time we have been angry and not posted grandiose statements about what we plan to do about it.  We would not go to this extreme if we did not plan to carry out whatever actions we promised.  SoT is not a group of people prone to idle threats (cept Gala and that whole killing thing, but as I said, he's been spoken to).<br>
<br>
To Raging Fury.  SoT had admitted partial fault (read: PARTIAL!!!! fault).  What we are looking for out of you is an admission of at least some fault in the matter and some understanding of our position.  We feel that we are being punished twice (once by being forced to destroy Clerise's BP and twice by being forced to give you a Donal's BP) for an incident that was not entirely our fault, this (along with the whole betrayal thing I spoke about a few posts ago) infuriates us to no end.  We are looking for some sort of cooperation on your part, not this holier-than-thou attitude that you all present in pretending to be infalable.  A compromise between our two guilds and GM Vaylin wherein one of the punishments levied against us via your /reports and our lack of /reports /pissandmoaning to GMs is lifted would be preferable.  I do not pretend that either of our guilds should be beyond punishment so I would not presume to ask you to remove your petition (note: I still think you're lower than pond scum for petitioning in the first place, but that is history and cannot be changed...we must deal with the present).  Case in point, were a conference between Eberan, our rep, and Vaylin to result in either a) clerise keeping her BP and you getting a Donals or b) clerise destroying her earned BP and us keeping the Donal's earned in a calm, fair matter then I believe we would be inclined to call this issue ended, as we can in no way go back and change the past.  However, we will not be deterred from our chosen path based on twisted logic, out of context quotes, partial logs, and flaming (please keep Slitz on a leash people, he's making you all look bad).  <br>
<br>
I have gone out of my way not to allow my feelings to come to bare here and cause me to mindlessly flame you, I would expect no less from RF in this case where flames are not warranted by either side if we intend to get through this without causing WW3.<br>

<br>
Lohki, as you know, and as others may not have (because we chose to not make it public) NB and SoT had an altercation about a dragon several weeks ago, i wasn't there don't know the whole story but sounded complex as hell.  How was it handled, sure we had some flames between nb and SoT but in the end it WAS RESOLVED WITHOUT VI's HELP.  And personally i think a dragon is worth a hell of alot more than a treant.<br>
<br>
Thats how this shoulda been handled, the GM's never should have been involved.  The Fact they were brought in is a lack of willingness to discuss it.  If ya notice SoT didn't say crap about this untill our officer and GM got summoned to vaylin.  I was auctually under the impression another officer was working the whole situation out and then this happens. <p><BR><center>

So you are asking people to flame you?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Personally, I think that RF is doing OK by responding as much as they did and moving on.  Depending on the story you believe, RF possibly violated *Rathe Convention*.  By both stories, SoT violated *EverQuest Rules*.  Which do you think GMs care about?<br>
<br>
I think both groups should just move on, making whatever adjustments to their alliance as they see fit.  SoT declaring &quot;war&quot; on RF is their second call of poor judgement in this situation and it has publicly opened the door for GM scrutiny of SoT.  I predict that the first time that SoT ganks an RF spawn because of this declared &quot;war&quot;, they will be disbanded.  Anyone with sense sees this declaration of &quot;war&quot; on RF as having little, if not zero, substance.  Perhaps it is venting some anger and making SoT feel better but it cannot, and will not, have any real effect in the game other than that.<br>
<br>
I do not know what really happened in PoG, nor do I really care.  I'm not making a judgement call one way or another saying who was the &quot;most wrong&quot;.  However the facts that both sides agree upon show that SoT violated the Rules of Conduct of Everquest and I know how that works with the GMs, so that is clear.  Whether or not RF ganked SoT's tree or whether it was legitimately theirs, who can say.  I can't because I was not there and will probably never know the true story.  Ganking spawns is pretty low, in my opinion, but I don't have enough information to know if that is what happened.  Regardless of what percipitated SoT's actions, SoT's actions were the results of poor judgement, perhaps caused by heat of passion.  Regardless, the actions are clear.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that something like this happened but it did.  You can't erase time but you can adjust and deal with the future.  I suggest to both (all) sides to do that and move on from here.<br>

As for what mister big ass Vaylin ordered:<br>
<br>
1) SoT got a warning<br>
2) I have to destroy the Cleric BP<br>
3) We have to give next donals BP to RF<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion of this, SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS BY YOURSELF, Calling GM's only make it worse and they only call wrong things out anyway.<br>

Like Thundaron said we solved the little incident with NB ourselves and nothing big happened.<br>

The GMs would rather the players solve their issues among themselves.  When they get called in, they assume that the issue cannot be solved without GM intervention and are quite heavy-handed.  This makes it even more desirable for players to settle things among themselves rather than /petition.<br>
<br>
However, RF had little to lose, from what I gather.  They had you guys over a barrel and could do anything they wanted with you. <p><P>

If the two guilds talked about sharing the two trees, why did SoT KS Treah when RF were fighting it? Whynot then just kill Fayl and call it even?<br>
<br>
SoT did NOTHING to come to any sort of conclusion as they were the ones in position to do so since RF's intentions were seemingly clear.<br>
<br>
So.... SoT trains RF, KSs their mob, LOOTS the cleric bp, and then gets mad that RF calls Vaylin?? Now you're here whining about how RF could have settled things with SoT peacefully? What is there to settle? the mob is dead, the bp is no drop, SoT is gloating. RF did the right thing by calling Vaylin since they were obviously screwed over.<br>

Personally both sides could have acted better but in the end Vaylin worked with what he had and made the choice. And the best way would appear to destroy a BP that was &quot;Ninja/KS&quot; (by Vaylin and RF word not mine) that is NO drop and give a Dropable BP closest to equivalncy to the guild who in Vaylin's opinion was less wrong(notice not right)<br>

However, Vaylin wasn't an ass about this really.  He did threaten with disbanding, which is way harsh for this situation, and also his end decision was a bit much.  But, I wouldn't call Vaylin an ass or anything like that over something like this.<br>

&quot;Oh and... you REALLY don't want to start going FFA on guilds do you?... Cause if you do, it seems to me you guys are gonna be the ones who'll suffer the most from it  &quot;<br>
<br>
When did we say we wanted to start going FFA on guilds?  Well, for one, we didn't.  Second, we wouldn't lose out on the deal, if it did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Of course I speak for myself and not my guild and whatever, but with the planes changed and stuff now, nobody would lose out on FCFS, imo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But, we never said, and we never would say, that we wanted FFA against other guilds.  Voron you must be pulling that out of the air because it has been clearly stated that is *definately* not the point and would never come of this.  But if planes did go FCFS (patch days at least), we wouldn't lose at in the least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Your so wrong here, this is what you have to write : &quot; So.... RF steals SoTs mob, SoT goes after SoTs mob, SoT kills SoTs mob while RF tries to KS it, SoT gets the kill and Clerise loots her so hard worked BP, RF whines, RF lies, RF calls Vaylin ....&quot;.<br>
<br>
Vaylin didn't know the whole story and ruled wrong.<br>

Btw I will never do a FFA, I just ignore RF. <p><BR><BR><CENTER>

<br>
I agree that the whole situation regarding splitting the mobs between the 2 guilds could have been handled better. I could have sent you a tell but I thought I had made our intetions clear in /ooc and by pulling her the first time. I apologize for this..you obviously didnt get it. Also all it had taken from your side was to give me a tell.<br>
<br>
However running halfway across the zone to KS us while you train us cant really be blamed on miscommunication. You made a mistake and you paid for it. I dont like using GM's as much as anyone else. <br>
But I can asure you I never lied and Im sure Vaylin have checked the logs or something to make sure. <br>
But what exactly did you expect us to do, sit back and shut up ? Im sorry but then your messing with the wrong guild.<br>
<br>
If SoT wishes to disrepect RF further in the future, either by going FFA on our plane dates, Trak dates or whatever. You will leave us no choice but to deal with it and by now I would think I have made it clear that we dont take these things lightly.<br>
<br>
However RF will abide by RTA and Trak rotation rules. If SoT decides to break them Im sure it will be dealt with accordingly.<br>
<br>
One last thing, I would urge SoT to put this behind you. To put it mildly you a making fools of yourselves and we are willing to forgive and forget... are you ?<br>
<br>
This will be the last post from me on this matter.<br>

WHAT exactly ya gonna do to us if we ignore ya  say on trak days? Call us names ? Inspect us all till we lag out? Something  childish like that?  Hmmm? ah Maybe call a GM to help..no but wait isnt RTA NON VI? Good luck gettin help there LOL.<br>

As has been stated  ,SoT will not train or KS but we will ignore RF  camps etc.<br>

I didnt want to get involved in this, but seeing a &quot;war&quot;<br>
on the horizon really doesnt appeal to me either. <br>
<br>
So here is my personal (I dont represent RF, yada, yada)<br>
try at maybe getting us back or at least closer to the good<br>
old relationship betweem SoT and RF.<br>
<br>
I think we all need to take a deep breath here and look<br>
at the situation without the emotional baggage.<br>
<br>
RF and SoT had a good relationship based on respect and<br>
honesty. This kind of relationship between guilds doesnt<br>
just appear from nowhere but rather from a lot of grouping <br>
and help between members of both our families. Personally I<br>
have friends in SoT that I respect and I know to be honest <br>
people and this situation will not make me change my mind on <br>
that. I am sure a lot of SoT and RF members are in the same<br>
situation and wont start thinking their friends just became evil.<br>
<br>
RF members werent snatched by the an evil dragon during the night to be replaced by evil changelings either.<br>
<br>
Can SoT people think about this just a few minutes?<br>
Its all I ask.<br>
<br>
SoT feels betrayed because of the friendship involves between our two guilds before what happened in PoG because they think RF stole their mob on purpose.<br>
As was said before, that wasnt the case. It was never done on purpose like some people have been accusing RF of doing.<br>
<br>
Let me try to put myself in SoT mindset when the PoG event happened (I may be off the track completely, but I am willing to try):<br>
<br>
1) SoT goes to PoG and as per their tactics (each guild has some) clear the protectors<br>
2) When almost finished clearing the protectors, they see us RF pull Treah.<br>
3) Someone from SoT calls FFA on the mob in the heat of the moment due to assuming we were stealing their mob.<br>
4) SoT people run to our camp with a few mobs and KS Treah that we were fighting.<br>
<br>
Can I understanb their frustration at having a mob they had worked toward stolen? Yes.<br>
I can even understand (not condone) their FFA and KSing the mob without thinking of the consequences in the heat of the moment.<br>
<br>
I am willing to understand what SoT was thinking at the time. Again, I ask you SoT guys to give us the same chance and try to understand what we were doing and thinking at the time:<br>
<br>
1) RF goes to PoG and setup camp at waterfall and pulls Treah without killing the  protectors as RF always do (different tactics I guess) but unfortunately some extra<br>
  mobs show up and RF loose the fight.<br>
2) RF goes on a CR.<br>
3) RF goes back to waterfall with the intent of killing Treah again.<br>
4) RF pulls Treah without killing protectors not knowing SoT was thinking it was theirs.<br>
5) SoT calls FFA and run with some mobs to RF camp and KS Treah.<br>
<br>
Can SoT understand the frustration of having our camp trained during a fight and have a mob KSed from us? I certainly hope so. Maybe calling the GMs wasnt the best solution but just as the decision from SoT to KS us this was probably done in the heat of the moment too.<br>
<br>
One thing everybody on this thread seems to agree, this wouldnt have happened with better communication. SoT didnt know we were going for Treah just as RF didnt know<br>
SoT was going for Treah. Since RF doesnt kill protectors before pulling Treah, the fact that SoT was killing protectors (which RF probably didnt even notice) didnt give them a<br>
clue as to SoT intent.<br>
<br>
Only thing I can hope from this book I have written here is to have both our guilds come to better terms again. One thing I know for sure is RF intentions were never to use SoT work killing the protectors as an easy way to kill Treah. This is not RF way and if our SoT friends take the time to understand that, maybe we can put all this behind us.<br>
