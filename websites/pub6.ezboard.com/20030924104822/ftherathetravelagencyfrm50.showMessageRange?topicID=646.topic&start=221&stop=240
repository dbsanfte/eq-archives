WOOOOHOOOOO!  I have done the impossible!!!  BOTS and SoT and now Tindi make me growing NB “impossible”.  Noble House 3 years ago used to raid the Ghoul Lord with both groups.  We then made an alliance with SB.  We then formed one guild Dec 5, 2000.  The entire time we were losing people to BOTS and KEG.  Where are we now?  According to you, we don’t exist anymore I guess, since “Bigger guilds make it impossible for smaller guilds to grow”.<br>

Your math is wrong.<br>
<br>
Big Guild Mob 1 = 2 loots<br>
Big Guild Mob 2 = 2 loots<br>
Small guild A, small guild B = 1 loot each<br>
Small guild A mob 2 = 2 loots<br>
Small guild B mob 2 = 2 loots<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
Big Guild = 4 loots<br>
Small Guild A = 3 loots, one of which they would never have seen alone.<br>
Small Guild B = 3 loots, one of which they would never have seen alone.<br>
Total Small Guild A/B ad hoc convenience alliance = 6 loots<br>

Now do you understand?<br>

It has nothing to do with Ego.  Its a simple fact, higher level characters are more powerful.  Having better gear makes your character more powerful.  Being more powerful allows you to kill things that you could not otherwise.<br>

But wait, your right.  You should to gather up 100 random people and kill anything in the game right?  Because tactics mean nothing, just having more people is all thats needed plain and simple, right?<br>

I'm sorry that your guild seems to be made up of people that are more concerned with thier own progression through the game, than your guilds collective progression.  I can luckily say, my guild is not like that.  Sure, over the years there have been people in NB that were more concerned with themselves, and eventually left.  But NB is where it is today because it has a very solid foundation of people that are more concerned with our collective progression through the game than thier individual game.  People that were willing to help get 100+ epics, and farm for countless hours in ToV because it meant that the guild as a whole got stronger. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

<br>
I feel that many of you (not Gromm nor Karadin) need to stop looking at the small picture so much, and give some of the larger guilds the benefit of a doubt.  Everyone assumes that everything the large guild's do is for their own good, when in reality it usually harms them (gives them less time to accomplish forward tasks by returning to ancient rotations that they have some loot stake in).<br>
<br>
Many times representatives of the larger guilds go about their arguments in the wrong way by implying that they can just perma-kill mobs if they want to.  The implied threat is not constructive, but allow me to illustrate something:  How would *I* know if AD loot was upgrades of people in BotS, if they didn't specifically allow me access to the loot records of all of their members.  BotS could have continued to kill AD for months under the guise of harvesting upgrade loot, and no one would no the difference.  It *could* have been for alts on the raid for all we know.  The fact that they moved on and DID NOT cockblock, shows that they are interested in sharing content.  Like I said above, a little more 'benefit of the doubt' here please.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>There is one thing that people seem to forget after every few pages of this thread.  The thing that everyone is forgetting repeatedly is that AD is not *currently* a rotation mob.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Notice, Gromm, that I did not say that he is not a *candidate* for rotation, something that we have talked about at length in private.<br>
<br>
It is important to note though, that since none of the guilds who have killed AD have *asked* for him to be put on rotation, teaming is perfectly acceptable up to the point at which they do.<br>
<br>
I am also supportive of the idea that no guild should have him put on rotation for the express purpose of cockblocking other guilds.  BotS, Tindi, and NB were kind enough to NOT cockblock the content from the rest of us, and I believe that guilds who kill AD in the future should remember this as a courtesy to those who came before them.<br>
<br>
However, if a guild, say ED were to begin to kill AD as a single entity, I feel that they (as well as many other guilds) would be interested in AD's loot as upgrades (unless of course the risk vs reward thing came up), and thus would be right in asking for him to be put on a rotation.  When this is done by a guild in that position, it will not be out of greed or any other rediculous notion.  It will be because this guild wants the chance to obtain loot from a mob as many times as possible without encroaching on the needs of other guilds at the same time.  Something that is seen in every rotation that is currently established.<br>

Ummm that was a loooong time ago when what consisted of a rotation?  Times were a lot different then than they are now, in terms of rotations etc..  I have been in the same guild long ago with some of your members, and they left that small guild to join you for bigger things.  I joined Far Seekers so i could see more things.  Noble Blade got the luck of the draw on surviving.  Look how many guilds no longer exist now that were when NB was founded.  When SOT broke up, where did most of the members go? NB, Bots, TL, and what is now Sote. Ask the smaller guilds where the people go when they leave thier guild.  So to compare Dec 2000 to now is not apples and apples.<br>
<br>
And to compare saying that: hey our guild consisting of 150 people was able to kill &lt;MobA&gt; so now if you want to kill &lt;mob A&gt; you have to only use your guilds members consisting of &lt;50&gt; people, is a little misplaced, don't you think?<br>

So now your going to insult my guild?  Another classy fellow.  For your information, we do farm TOV for better equipment for the progression of our guild.  Take a look at Far Seekers accomplishments in the last few months, so don't sit there and start slamming someone because you have a differing opinion.  I'd like you to go and solo AD since it's all just tactics and nothing to do with numbers.  Are you going to tell Rog that his guild has no tactics because they needed more numbers? Look at their accomplishments the last few months.  I think we are well aware of tactics thank you, but sorry you can't use the same amount of people on AD as you do with Vindi.<br>
<br>
And please you have a problem with me, don't insult my guild, these are my opinions I stress, and may or may not be that of my guild.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=286161" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dembire Deadbones</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Put AD/Grummus/Behemoth on rotation     <br>
<br>
Guilds may quickly lose interest in doing these mobs for many reasons.  It could be that they have exausted the loot table from these mobs, or that the effort to kill is not commensurate with the reward.  We have seen now that the larger guilds capable of killing AD are not that interested in this mob, most likely because they are VT capable and this presents a better avenue to equiping their guild (time vs reward).  As more guilds start being interested in these mobs, especially those guilds who are not in VT/Ssha, we may one day see this mob as being contested and hence the rotation system will be neccessary to ensure order and fairness on the rathe.  <br>
<br>
As I understand it, AD was up for three days before CB/VoLS killed him.  That is a far cry from a mob being in any way contested, but as I explained above, this lack of interest in the mob may not last.  <br>
<br>
Seeing as this mob does present an obstacle to progress through the content in PoP, I propose that there should be an option to gather up sufficient force to take down these mobs without incuring any penalty from other rotations.  <br>
<br>
My suggestion:<br>
<br>
When a guild passes on their turn to kill these flag mobs, there should be a grace period to allow others not on the rotation to attempt the mob.  If the attempt is from a single guild then a success would qualify them a spot on the rotation.  If another avenue was taken to overcome AD/Grummus/Behemoth, then a new rotation entry is not created and members of the raid only leave with the flags and the loot they earned.  <br>
<br>
Note: Grace period suggestion:<br>
              this can be as simple as informing guild up for rotation that you have an interest in attempting the mob should the guild choose to pass.  When that is the case, the guild defers the kill to the person who requested instead of the guild next on the rotation.<br>
<br>
In this scheme, the rotation on mobs that are weakly contested (as shown by the pass) are relaxed allowing different avenues of progression through PoP (teaming/pick up raid).   Also note that a guild wishing to get on the rotation should not need to wait for a pass, but instead follow the normal procedure.<br>
<br>
Of course this is just a suggestion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'll bet you it wasn't the minimum number you could take using outstanding ubah strategy.  I didn't create this game, and I didn't design each encounter, but I'm not so closed minded to believe that your 72 people were successful only because you used some kind of special anti-zerg tactic ...while 72 people from two different guilds were successful only because they got lucky.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) &quot;Rotations are SOE enforcable rules.&quot;<br>
2) &quot;Server convention must be apporved by SOE before thay can be consider a server convention.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Who said this?  Where are you sources?  ...maybe you misread the part about 'official statements', which doesn't mean pull something out of your ass, throw some quotes around it and call it good.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, but the loot potention of the ALLIANCE does. The entity that gets one share of loot on one mobs, gets double the share on other mobs. This is grossly unfair.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It's only 'grossly unfair' if you completely ignore common logic and start 'extrapolating' that an alliance on one mob ...one and only mob ...automatically causes them to be recognized as an alliance on the entire server rotation system, instead of just that one mob.  This makes absolutely zero sense to me.  The only time you can make this argument, as I stated before, is if 1) the alliance is taking up two rotations on that one mob, 2) exactly double the loot from any mob drops if an alliance kills it, or 3) -and I haven't said this before- you have one guild entered on more than one alliance in the same rotation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now, lets ignore the nightmare of administrating such as system, and just look at the inverse but complimentary arguement:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And that nightmare would be...?  You still only have one rotation cycle per mob ...and you still only have one entry per rotation being taken by an alliance.  How is that different than what we have now?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because, I can easily kill a mob with my guild, for example Trakanon, in fact I can easily kill such a mob with 1-2 groups from my guild, I believe my guild should get multiple rotation spots for this guild. Your whole arguement seems to be that guilds does not matter, and the combining of seperate guilds does not matter. So, why should the division of such guilds matter? So, I would like say.. 20 rotation slots for Noble Blade on the Trakanon rotation please.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->If this is what you see my argument as, you clearly do not have an understanding of what my argument is ...this isn't even inversely what my argument is.  This takes a whole path all its own.<br>
<br>
Try to focus ...concentrate.  The lowest common denominator for rotations is a GUILD, regardless of the number of people who make it up.  That is OUR artificial restriction, not Sony's restriction.  Do we currently have half of a guild on any rotation?  Do we currently have an entry on any rotation saying &quot;3 groups of Guild A&quot;?  Your analogy is absurd from the standpoint of talking about our rotations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The rotational system is a COMPROMISE. Smaller guilds agree to not team up on mobs that are above thier indiviual abilities, and large guilds agree to only take one rotational turn the same as the smaller guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ah, so smaller guilds will stay within their lowly station and large guilds will agree to follow the rules ...rules they created in the first place?  ...and if guilds decide that they don't want to stay in their lowly station anymore? ...if they decide they want to team up with other lowly guilds to try to progress their station to the next level? ...the bigger guilds are going to do what?  Stop following the rules?<br>
<br>
Kinda funny actually.  If 'smaller guilds agreed to not team up on mobs that are above their individual abilities' ...why then do we have a rule in place that exactly legalizes it ...and at the same time penalizes them severely for doing it?  Doesn't sound to me at all like they 'agreed' to anything.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Small guilds, they are smaller in theory everyone knows everyone else pretty well. Each member of the guild has a better chance at loot (1 in 40 vs 1 in 80 in a larger guild). But the disadvantage is because you are a smaller guild, you can not do everything a large guild does.<br>
<br>
Larger guilds, the are generally more powerful, able to kill much &quot;higher level&quot; mobs, bringing in &quot;higher level&quot; loots. But because the guild is larger each member has a smaller chance to get each loot that comes in.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Truly, if we are going to continue comparisons, I'm hoping that you will eventually throw out something that remotely resembles a valid topic.  So your argument, this time, is that because we are smaller ...we actually get a better chance at loot than you larger guilds do?  I'm sorry ...we've skipped right on out of the bizarre to the laughable, boys and girls.  In one breath you are are saying that you can do the same mob with only 2 groups that a smaller guild can do with their entire guild in force ...then you turn around and say that because you are bigger, you get less opportunity for loot?  Oh please, for the love of God, someone shoot me now.  Wait a sec ...let me guess ...you are doing us a favor, right?  Pity you for being so big?  Omg. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because you are either part of an alliance or you are not. Otherwise, if you have 3 guilds, you can get the following permutations, by your reasoning, all would be able to get rotational slots.<br>
<br>
GuildA<br>
GuildB<br>
GuildC<br>
GuildA + GuildB<br>
GuildA + GuildC<br>
GuildB + GuildC<br>
<br>
(assuming combinations, not permutations) So now you have each guild in effect sharing three spots on the rotation. Heck, why doesn't just everybody form all permutations of alliances and that way you can attend 1/2 of all the raids on any mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Aha!  Finally!  A clue to what you people are thinking!<br>
<br>
How many rotations do we have now that we allow a guild to populate two rotation spots ON THE SAME ROTATION MOB in any form or fashion?  Do we, at this time, have any rotation in existence that has GuildA on the rotation as a single entity ...and then has GuildA on the same rotation as an alliance entity?<br>
<br>
Zero you say?  Did I hear Zero?  Maybe you can explain to me how in the world allowing teamable rotations (something we legally allow now by the way from that complete waste of good internet bandwidth you call an Alliance Rule) would cause the situation you described above?<br>
<br>
Or, were you talking about creating the following?:<br>
<br>
Mob #1 - GuildA, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #2 - GuildB, GuildA + GuildC<br>
Mob #3 - GuildC, GuildB + GuildA<br>
<br>
I see no problem with this situation.  GuildA = 2 rots (1 rot + 2 x .5 rot).  GuildB = 2.5 rots (2 x 1 rot + .5 rot).  GuildC = 2.5 rots (2 x 1 rot + .5 rot).  GuildA is getting penalized for sharing two rots, GuildB and GuildC are only sharing one each.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm convinced. Maybe we should do away with all rotations since they &quot;tell someone what they can and cannot do&quot;.

<br>
What we have now is some kind of evil, red-headed, hunch-backed step-child kind of rotation that ...while good in principal, lacks more than a bit of being fair to all people on The Rathe.  It clearly favors larger guilds in progression through game content and is controlled by high end players who somehow believe that their game experience should be followed identically by all other guild entities on this server ...and they aren't afraid to use the RTA (a representative democratic organization?  ...stay tuned, we don't really know yet) to force the will of the powerful onto the will of the less than powerful.<br>

Yes, it is fair.  It may or may not be the right thing to do (depending on circumstance), but it's fair.  To say it's not fair you would have to show that guild A can train guild B, but guild B can not train guild A.<br>
<br>
The problem with this example is that you're using something that most people consider as wrong which in turn makes people bias.  Lets say guild A trained guild B.  Would it be unfair if guild B trained guild A?<br>

I don't think you're examples disproved my argument.  Let's use your claim:<br>
<br>
Teaming up is unfair.<br>
Make a contradictory statement: Teaming up is fair.<br>
There are no rules against teaming up on non rotation mobs.<br>
All guilds have the ability to team up on non rotation mobs without breaking any rules.<br>
Definition of Unfairness: Not just or evenhanded; biased.<br>
Negation of Unfairness (fairness): just or evenhanded; unbiased.<br>
Since all guilds have the same opertunity to team up, it is unbiased.<br>
Since teaming up is unbiased, by definition, it is fair.<br>
Since teaming up is fair, it can not be the case that teaming up is unfair.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You make a good and valid arguement here. But simply said, 1 epic, even if it is a cleric epic, is a very small step in progression compared to flagging 72 people.<br>
<br>
It could be argued quite effectivly that pretty much anything you do in EQ advances your character, and therefore advances your guild. Exp groups get people levels and AA, which make them more powerful, which makes thier guild more powerful. So to follow your agruement, that if you frown upon one way to advance you must frown upon them all: grouping outside of your guild should be frowned upon. However, this has never been the case, and is just silly really.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Don't you see the contridiction here?  How can it be fair on a small scale, but unfair on a large scale?  It's like saying 2,4, and 6 are even numbers but 4 million is odd.<br>

BotS why did you ever agree to rotations why all they do is slow down your aquistion of loot, which advances you further into the game?

<br>
Of course rotations are fair.  Does that mean all non rotation encounters are unfair?  No, it does not.  The purpose of rotations was to set up an organized way to take turns on mobs so that a guild does not have to sit there in the zone waiting for the guilds before it to finish their turn.  Guilds wanted to go off and do other things instead of waiting weeks at a time to kill a mob.  Guilds wanted to quit the bickering on who was up for the mob.   There was a need for the rotation rules.<br>
<br>
Is there a need to create a set of rules that does nothing but slow down every guild's progression?  No, there is not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Where?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If something was done that negatively effects a rotation in an unfair way, then that would be cause for concern which may be used to produce a new rule.  Since teaming up should not be the concern of anyone, then it does not effect rotations. So rotations can't be the reason to make a new rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigorre>Rigorre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 5:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=229>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Guilds who wanted to be able to kill those zones / gods combined forces so we could. <br>

<br>
You are right ...I am going to say &quot;things have changed&quot;.  Back in the day, when you had to consider making an alliance, you did so based on the idea that you would lose ...what? ...2 or 3 rotations at most?  And, at that time, those rotations were probably not packed with 15-25 guilds on each one either.  So, yes, things have changed ...now, if a guild wants to consider doing a formal alliance going into PoP, we aren't looking at losing 2 or 3 rotations.  We are looking at losing 15 or 20 rotations ...or, more importantly, we are looking at losing the TIME it takes to get back on those rotations as an alliance.  <br>
<br>
There is actually a legal term for what our current &quot;alliance policy&quot; falls under, I just can't think of what it is right now, but it has to do with making a law that is perfectly legal yet it is so excessively costly to follow (or exceedingly difficult to understand) that you can't be expected to follow it.  Catch 22.  I contend that this is exactly the affect that this rule is meant to produce.  It's a law that cannot be expected to apply to any guild coming into PoP ...because it is too costly to do so.<br>

Guilds B/C are on 14 rotations individually and Aerin Dar jointly. They get 1 loot each from Aerin Dar, that they would never be able to obtain separately, but still get 28 loots EACH (total 57 loots vs Tindi’s 30).

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, you gotta let go of your theory that having one’s cake allows one to eat it too, it’s one or the other, not both. Alliance rules are there to be fair to everyone, so that guilds that want access to the higher end rotations and need another guild’s help to get there, don’t get to cheese the system and grab two helpings of loot from “easier” mobs. Otherwise the big guilds could just do like the old FR megaguild with its three subguilds, only instead of being a single entity on each rotation, they get to take three or more spots on each rotation. This makes for a much longer wait as we make sure that per capita loot is fairly distributed with BOTS getting 15 Statue rotation shares, Tindi getting 25, NB getting 20, etc etc. All because each of those guilds can kill Statue with 6 people, or call it 12 and halve my prior numbers. Now you have a rotation system that is proportionally fair – every person in a guild gets the same loot per capita as everyone else. Instead, the way our system actually works is more representative – you belong to whatever guild you want, but that guild only gets ONE shot per rotation, regardless of population. If you form an alliance, you are ONE entity for all rotations, or you are not an alliance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I covered exactly why this wouldn't work in my previous post.

I'm not the one that stated that &quot;Bigger guilds make it impossible for smaller guilds to grow&quot;, you are.  Big guilds don't just start out big, they grew from somewhere.  Tindi didn't just form one day as a guild in the elemental planes, they worked thier way there.  FK is an example of a guild that has grow (in achievement) quite a bit lately, breaking into VT a week ago.  <br>

I never stated numbers had nothing to do with it.  Of course, some encounters do require more people that other encounters.  However, you stated &quot;You were able to see more content because you had a lot more people. Plain and simple. &quot;, which I say is untrue.  <br>
<br>
There are 3 things that make you able to successfully able to kill a mob in EQ.  <br>
1.)  The tactics to kill the mob.  Some mobs are very simple, while others require more complicate tactics.<br>
2.)  Enough people to perform those tactics.  If you are using a CH rotation, you need enough clerics in the rotation to heal the MT fast enough to offset the damage dealy to them.<br>
3.)  Powerful enough characters (in terms of both levels and gear) to perform thier duty in an adequate fashion to enable you to kill the mob.  Your clerics need enough mana, your tanks need enough hit points, your wizards need thier spells, etc etc<br>
<br>
Just because I disagree with you that all it takes to beat an encounter is more people, does not mean I don't realise that some enounter do require more people.<br>

The nightmare has many problems, hence why I didn't bother getting into it originally.  However, they include having to setup new accounts for each alliance that kills a mob together, who in those alliances get the passwords, how to handle the alliances postion within the rotation when they break up, who get thier turn if anyone.

Ah, so as long as its you who are getting more loot everything is fine?  But if the larger guilds want to split then its absurd.<br>

No, we don't currently have any sub-divisions of a guild on a rotation, just like we currently do not allow one guild to belong to multiple alliances.

<br>
Well, I can only assume you joined the Rathe recently then.  Because yes this is the agreement that was reached between all guilds of the RTA at the time it was discussed.<br>

If a smaller guilds wants to join a rotation for a mob that requires more than can field, they can make an alliance with other guilds but to do so they must be an alliance for all thier rotational mobs.<br>

Simple mathematics.... I know not your strong suit but please try to follow along.<br>
<br>
Guild A has 40 members.  They Kill mob X that drops 4 loots.  Each member of Guild A has 4/40 = 10% chance to get a loot.<br>
<br>
Guild B has 80 members.  They kill mob X that drops 4 loots.  Each member of Guild B has 4/80 = 5% chance to get loot.<br>
<br>
10% chance to get a loot is greater than 5% chance to get a loot.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(not saying big guilds are bad, just showing a normal action from people)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This was a general comment about how it is difficult for small guilds to grow.  I was not necessarily talking about my guild, just small guilds in general.  And when I said impossible for guilds to grow, i meant at the rate that some other guilds have.  This was not a slam on you or any big guilds, just a fact.  We get people that come to our guild from smaller guilds than ours as well, just people want to see more content so they go where the content is and thats to bigger guilds.  You don't think Bots, NB, TL, don't get more people from guilds like mine and smaller?  look at Sote, they grew over night, and their numbers came from all of our guilds, so while your numbers grow, ours just slowly go up and other guilds just die.<br>
I hate that I have to explain every little thing or somone takes it as an attack, i think people (including myself) are just getting to sensitive.  This merry go round hopefully will stop, i'm getting dizzy.<br>

<br>
Here is where you are going astray...  Rotations do penalize guilds who are mobile and strong.  If there were no rotations, some guild would be able to get a good lion's share of some mob, say Trakanon.  Say they can get 1/2 of all the spawn.  However, with 12 guilds on Trakanon rotation, the stronger guild can only get 1/12 of the spawns.  That is a penalty compared to what they are capable of.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How many rotations do we have now that we allow a guild to populate two rotation spots ON THE SAME ROTATION MOB in any form or fashion? Do we, at this time, have any rotation in existence that has GuildA on the rotation as a single entity ...and then has GuildA on the same rotation as an alliance entity?<br>
<br>
Zero you say? Did I hear Zero? Maybe you can explain to me how in the world allowing teamable rotations (something we legally allow now by the way from that complete waste of good internet bandwidth you call an Alliance Rule) would cause the situation you described above<br>
<br>
Or, were you talking about creating the following?:<br>
<br>
Mob #1 - GuildA, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #2 - GuildB, GuildA + GuildC<br>
Mob #3 - GuildC, GuildB + GuildA<br>
<br>
I see no problem with this situation. GuildA = 2 rots (1 rot + 2 x .5 rot). GuildB = 2.5 rots (2 x 1 rot + .5 rot). GuildC = 2.5 rots (2 x 1 rot + .5 rot). GuildA is getting penalized for sharing two rots, GuildB and GuildC are only sharing one each. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
So, let's look at this closely.  The situation you describe *could* exist, but it is contrived.  A more realistic example would be:<br>
<br>
Mob #1 - GuildA, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #2 - GuildA, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #3 - GuildA, GuildB + GuildC<br>
<br>
I haven't ever seen any example that would be similar to what you have described, although you can imagine it happening... maybe.<br>
<br>
So, you have<br>
GuildA - 1/3 Mob #1, 1/3 Mob #2, 1/2 Mob #3<br>
GuildB - 1/3 Mob #1, 1/3 Mob #2, 1/4 Mob #3<br>
GuildC - 1/3 Mob #1, 1/3 Mob #2, 1/4 Mob #3<br>
<br>
A couple of things here.  Allowing this (I think this is exactly an example of what has been discussed) first enables GuildB and GuildC together to get 2/3 of Mob #1, 2/3 of Mob #2, and 1/2 of Mob #3 spawns.  The Mob #3 spawns are achievable *only* because of the alliance.  Otherwise it would be<br>
<br>
GuildA - 1/1 Mob #3<br>
GuildB - 0/1 Mob #3<br>
GuildC - 0/1 Mob #3<br>
<br>
If this were allowed, it is a very clear message that any guild who is capable of killing Mob #3 alone.  The message is this: In order to maximize the loot you get for your guild, you should divide your guild into N smaller guilds, each one capable of killing Mob #1 and Mob #2 individually, but team up on Mob #3.  Suppose GuildA splits into three &quot;subguilds&quot; - GuildA1, GuildA2, GuildA3 - for the sole purpose of maximizing loot intake.  The picture becomes:<br>
<br>
Mob #1 - GuildA1, GuildA2, GuildA3, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #2 - GuildA1, GuildA2, GuildA3, GuildB, GuildC<br>
Mob #3 - GuildA(1+2+3), GuildB + GuildC<br>
<br>
That gives<br>
GuildA - 3/5 Mob #1, 3/5 Mob #2, 1/2 Mob #3<br>
GuildB - 1/5 Mob #1, 1/5 Mob #2, 1/4 Mob #3<br>
GuildC - 1/5 Mob #1, 1/5 Mob #2, 1/4 Mob #3<br>
<br>
So, in order to maximize loot intake for my guild, we should split up and each enter the rotations we want and team for the stuff we really want.  The alliance rules exist exactly to prevent this from happening.  If you want an alliance, it is because you want to ally to do achieve something you could not without the alliance, not because you want to maximize loot for your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once again, no matter how you slice it. One rotation entry = 2 loots.

<br>
No, you assume that each guild can get the loot alone - if that was the case, they would do it alone to maximize loot intake.  Compare Mob #1 and Mob #3 above.  There is no logical reason to team up on a mob that you can kill alone.  You can't each kill it alone.  Going at it alone you get no loots each.  You team upso you can kill the mob as a team.  If you team up, you get the 1 loot each.  You can't do it alone so you team up to do it... Zero... vs. Two...  Alone you can't kill the mob = 0 loots... vs. teaming up you can kill the mob = 2 loots...  Alone, the mob kills you = 0 loots.... vs teaming up you kill the mob = 2 loots...

It does have something to do with numbers and something to do with tactics.  BotS has killed everything in PoP at or below Xegony level with 56 or fewer people lately, including a 46 person clearing of everything in PoFire except Fennin Ro and a 50 person killing of Rallos Zek The Warlord.

<br>
Plllleeeeeaasssseee, get a grip people.<br>
<br>
Can't say I've read every single post.  If I had, I would currently be undergoing therapy of some description to stop the voices in my head... but I've certainly read enough to  think I can summarise this fairly simply.<br>
<br>
1.  An incident occured involving teaming on a non-rot mob. Although not against the rules, it brought to light some concerns from certain guilds.<br>
<br>
2.  Questions are now being asked regarding the non-rot status of the mob and whether or not it should be looked at for the future.<br>
<br>
           a/ Suggestion has been made that the mob be put on the rot cycle to avoid future teaming efforts.<br>
           b/ countering the suggestion listed as a/ is the fact that there is a quest that results in the same flagging as the kill, thereby negating the need for rotational status<br>
<br>
That's it, in a nutshell, once you wade through all the accusations and name calling and stuff better suited to the flame section. And once you get past the &quot;some rots are outdated&quot; etc etc (which I personally feel is valid but should not cloud this discussion).<br>
<br>
Might I respectfully ask that the powers that be comment on the above points (and not lapse into he said, she said banter)...<br>
<br>

<br>
I am going to try to make a little point here. SoE as you like to point out with rules and such thought our rotation system was so great they actually implemented it on Stormhammer when they opened that server. Now you might ask why i bring this up. The answer would be that we as the &quot;bigger&quot; guilds know what the fuck we are talking about when it comes to setting standards so that the server doenst fall to shit.<br>
<br>
All i am getting out of all your posts is that &quot;Your&quot; guild is being treated unfairly and all us &quot;uber&quot; guilds should cater to your every whim cause, hell you fucking play this game also. Get a clue. <br>
<br>
If you think we are so unfair with how we are setting the rules and rotations, then i'll start acting like qwai used to. Of course i doubt you have any understanding of exactly what i mean using his name as you are a newbie to rathe politics. <br>
<br>
By acting like qwai i mean i'll start pushing for stopping all rotations and going with how other servers do things. This will mean that all mobs are FFA and basically all you smaller guilds will basically be SoL cause we can kill a mob with 2 groups that takes others a full guild to do so. This of course wont be frowned upon by SoE cause we now went FFA instead of keeping our regular rotation system, of which you think you should have so large a say in even though you dont kill any of those mobs with your guild alone. <br>
<br>
If you really want to get down to formalities, we have a very considerate rotation system so all guilds can progress much unlike any other server in EQ. But if you would like to see us become like those other servers because you cant understand where all these arguments come from then so be it. Right now the smaller guilds on our server have more chance of seeing the high end content than on any other server because we are so civil. Do you really want to see that change?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bahaazar>Bahaazar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/13/03 3:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=239>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.diamond-webdesigns.com/webmastercentral/images/Calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: YAWN</span><hr size=1>   Of course we can still team up and be a pain too, why threaten us?..you dont have the time nor the guts to perma kill shit anymore. No one and I repeat no one will ever dictate content on any server. Stormhammer? Yes they rotate mobs ands thats it. Not Flag mobs. Triv of bots? really you make as much sense as a 6 yearold in a sandbox at a public play ground. Karadin still cant make a single point in a 10000 word thesis...do you have one yet?  Want to threaten not to rez us again??? Grow up. How is SOE on your side again? Interesting. Rotations are good. Teaming  is good *not* on rotation mobs. Unless that spawn is being permafarmed for loot it is not acceptable to place it on rotation (which it was intended). Miss a point there? <br>
        Just from another standpoint, one from a BoTS standpoint wouldnt I be more against rotation on these flagging mobs? Wouldnt they take up time to kill all the time? I mean its only a rotation if someone is there to actually kill it and not just autopass.<br>
      There is more then one way to achieve an objective..not all as obvious as others. Teaming is hated because other guilds feel that those 2 guilds will outrun them in PoP content...They feel it unfair and try to quote rotation rules, that they run...a bias you see. I see a patten !!! Wait the higher guilds then tell you ...we will permakill stuff...ya cool, a 2 way street ? So they use threats and stuff, why? I think you all know the answer to that...In the age of given accounts nothing is sacred in guilds anymore...<br>
       The Qwai comment, didnt he get BoTS disbanded by SOE over trying to do that? KSIng in Hate was it? Thought I would let you know if it was a little before your noob time. And going FFA would accelerate *teaming*....this isnt your sandbox,remember?  So do deal with this in a mature way and not one from a *sandbox* mentality...let flagged mobs be FFA and teamable and let us *sol* guilds see the content we want to see...without the whinning. *frowns*<br>

So far you say our arguments are invalid, yet you have not brought one valid argument up yourself other than we are bullies and blah blah blah, cry me a fucking river. <br>
<br>
Oh and if you are going to try and remember something from the past please use the correct context. First off Qwai did not get BotS disbanded in hate. It was a fear raid and Qwai had nothing to do with it. It was a vindictive gm that disbanded the guild for a mistake made by a recruit in fear. So quit trying to act like a know it all and use less words or else you just look like a jackass. <br>
<br>
Now as to the comment of us not having the numbers to perma kill all the mobs you are correct possibly. Now i didnt exactly state we would do that either. I am saying you all want shit to be FFA to do what ya want and refuse to see that those of us that have set the precedents for rotations now are trying to defuse something with flag mobs before it becomes an issue. Why because we actually know wtf we are talking about and see the potential for disaster if its not dealt with now. <br>
<br>
Hehe and yeah about your comment on the smaller guilds taking our content in PoP. Damn you hit it right on the head. BotS is all against teaming cause we just know that you and another small guild are going to gank the planes from us in the near future and we wont be the bad boys on the server anymore. Great intellect and insight you have there. <br>
<br>
Now take your noob ass back to the kiddie yard and drive thru. And like i said, if you are going to quote rathe history please do a little bit of research before making yourself look more like a jackass and less like a moron.
