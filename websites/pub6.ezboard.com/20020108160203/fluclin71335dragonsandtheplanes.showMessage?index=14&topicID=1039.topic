<br>
VL, along with around 30 other guilds, agreed to the calendar restrictions that can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=603.topic">here.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Having never seen the rules that are now posted on the calendar page, I have no idea where they came from, but I do know that VL never agreed to them, and have not seen any information that any other guilds have, either. Until there is another Council of Guilds meeting, and new rules are voted on, Veterans Legion will abide by the rules they agreed to over a year ago, which you can read in the thread linked above. <br>
<br>
Now, having looked over the rules, and our scheduled raids, we have found that we were indeed in violation by having 2 PoH raids on back-to-back Sundays. The rule of having only one weekend date found on the other set of rules is not found anywhere in the agreed-to rules, and in fact, it is stipulated that all 3 of your raids can be weekend dates, just that they can not be to the same plane on the same weekend day two weeks in a row. <br>
<br>
I apologize for our mistake, and it has been corrected. I have cancelled the Jan 6 raid. The reason I chose that one was simply to foster amity between guilds on the server. I would point out that we did in fact post that raid first, and I could just have easily cancelled the Jan 13 raid instead. In the future, please do NOT try to schedule raids over the top of Veterans Legion raids. If you check around on the server, you will find that we have a good reputation, and do not do things like that. We expect the same treatment in return. If there is another incident involving someone posting over the top of our raids, we will not honor it, and will not give up our raid. If anyone finds a discrepancy in Veterans Legion raid scheduling that is against the CoG rules, then please post on our board, or email me at cuchulaine_eq@hotmail.com. If there is indeed a violation then we will correct it with expediency. However, simply scheduling on top of us will not solve the problem and will not be honored. I think you will find that if you work with us, you will get a lot better results than trying to go around us.<br>
<br>
Veterans Legion believes that the calendar is fair to everyone, and will stand behind it, but will not be muscled out of our fair share of raids by technicalities. If the server does indeed go to FCFS, I believe VL is now at a stage where we could still get our fair share of raids under such a system, so from that stand point, whether the calendar stays are not, we can deal with either. We would prefer the calendar, but you should remember that there are some guilds that do not. The calendar will only work so long as the vast majority of guilds work together, including communicating when there is a conflict.<br>
<br>
If you find a violation them inform us, and we will correct it. Do NOT try to correct it for us.  <p><h6><a href="mailto:cuchulaine_eq@hotmail.com">Geneze Angelfyre</a><br>

Triad does not consider itself above the agreed-upon calendar guidelines as agreed to as Cuchulaine so kindly provided the link to, and as such, I have corrected OUR error, in that we had two Sunday raids, by moving our second Sunday raid to a Tuesday.  Triad has increasingly less interest in the Planes and I suspect we will eventually become a non-factor in this dicussion altogether. <br>
<br>
For the record, Triad does adamantly support both calendar and rotations, and will continue to honor it as best as possible.  Any errors in scheduling should be brought to my attention, and will be quickly rectified.  Again, working with us is better than working against us, and is generally a matter of courtesy. <p><font face="arial" size =-1 color="purple"><B>Adetia Drey<BR>

A couple of points:<br>
<br>
1)  I don't believe Stony and Kelestra tried to &quot;fix&quot; the Vets reservation.  It was an honest mistake on their part.<br>
<br>
2)  Thanks for the generous tones from the guild who said they welcome &quot;violations&quot; being brought to their attention.  I no longer do that after a couple of times of doing similar things (not necessarily with these guilds), and being trashed on guild boards (one case was even after their own officers warned the members not to trash me).<br>
<br>
3)  I did not single out any guilds.  I merely looked at what I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> thought</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were the rules and them pointed out.  While my statement about any guild who wants to can break whatever rules they want seemed to imply these guilds, they were not intended to.  I apologize for that.<br>
<br>
4) A limit of four open raids per month????  Get real !  I'm sorry, but that is not the way things are these days.  The large guilds are uninterested in the planes these days.  I know enchanters, mages, warriors, etc who have to schedule open raids in order to get the drops for their epic pieces since their guild won't schedule planes raids.  If we truly had only 4 open raids per month, the calendar would be empty.<br>
<br>
My only question is to wonder if it is better to allow whatever &quot;violations&quot; occur, since some semi-followed guidelines are better than none.  Or, to rework the rules in light of the current situation.  Of course, this is easy for me to say, since I would not be involved in it.<br>

I have been out of town for the holidays and I'm just back today. <br>
<br>
I was not trying to *fix* anything.  In fact, I never once flamed, accused or approached the Vets to change their hate raid.  I'm sorry if you took it that I was challenging anyone.  As I said in my original post I was willing to reschedule our raid because we had in fact double booked a plane...no biggie.<br>
<br>
It was an honest mistake that the raid was booked for the same day.  Stony booked the raid and obviously didn't notice that hate was already booked.  I personally wasn't aware that there was a problem until someone emailed regarding it.  I only came here looking for the post that listed the raid calendar guidelines so I could be more aware of the restrictions.  I was not a guild leader when the guidelines were created and wasn't fully aware of all the ins and outs.  I fully support the calendar, hence the reason I was looking for the guidelines.  Thank you for the link.<br>
<br>
I was not trying to point fingers, or accusing any guild of abusing the calendar.  Mistakes happen, plain and simple.  If the Vets would like to raid hate on Jan 6th, feel free.  We have made alternate plans for that day on the assumption that we were in the wrong for double booking a plane.  Stony's reservation came second, I was more than happy to bow out.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a very reasonable person and I would hope that if anyone has a problem with myself, my posts, my booking raids, my guild, whatever, that they would approach me to discuss it.    <p><center><img src="http://phrogie.20m.com/nemesys/pics/KeleAni.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukelestra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelestra</A> at: 1/3/02 1:09:20 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=791.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=1049.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=1039.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.threadControl?topicID=1039.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1039.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1039.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes>Dragons and the Planes</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
