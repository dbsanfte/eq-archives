Explain why social services takes children away from their parents for verbal abuse if its not against any rules<br>

This is also against the law and schools have been investigated and sued also teachers have been fired for this<br>

There are many of laws out to protect the consumer if someone intentionally decieves a customer there are again laws they must adhere to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Using the previous is weak for the simple reason All of them have laws against these.    Your argument using these shows that you are just pulling stuff out of no where trying to prove your point.  It is also showing you have no idea what you are talking about.<br>

Show me a law that protects an employee from a verbally abusive boss.<br>
<br>
&quot;Explain why social services takes children away from their parents for verbal abuse if its not against any rules<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
I said emotional abuse, not verbal abuse. Show me a law against emotionally abusing your children.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are many of laws out to protect the consumer if someone intentionally decieves a customer there are again laws they must adhere to.&quot;<br>
<br>
As long as the advertiser does not ascribe specific, non relative, and measurable traits to his product, he can in fact knowingly decieve his customers without them having any legal recourse. <br>
<br>
If I offered a computer for sale, giving no specifics of the computer's internals, and calling it &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and using the new buzzword &quot;broadband ready&quot;, it doesn't matter if I sold you a 386sx as long it has a NIC. I would not be guilty of false advertising. Using relative and subjective superlatives is an old and well established way to make a product look better to a consumer than it actually is. Words like &quot;best&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;,  &quot;great&quot;, etc. cannot be challenged as false advertising, even if the person doing the advertising knows the product is a piece of shite. <br>
<br>
Meaningless terms are often created by the marketing industry. Ever hear of Certs, with &quot;Retsin&quot;? Want to know what retsin is? Sucrose, common table sugar. The company that owns Certs trademarked the NAME of retsin, they have not PATENTED the product: sugar. It sounds cool in commercials, that's it. What do the terms &quot;internet ready&quot; and &quot;broadband ready&quot; mean? What does the Intel term Netburst Architecture stand for and how will it/can it speed up anything to do with your internet experience since it can't magically make your internet connection any faster?<br>
<br>
Marketing and advertising are completely BASED on decieving your potential customers into thinking the products you are offering are better than they are and/or better than the competition's products when they actually aren't. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is also showing you have no idea what you are talking about.&quot;<br>

<br>
yes there are laws to protect from this on   even in the military.  Yes i said military, even in boot camp.   Does this mean that they will adhere to this.  Not enless some one reminds them,  which is slim to none because most people have no back bone.   So yes there are laws  but again most people are either  to ignorant or just have no balls to stick up for themselves.<br>
<br>
as far as Parents being emotionally  abusive to their children im sure there's something you just have to look for it.  <br>

In Canada, it falls under &quot;Creating a hazardous working environment&quot; or some such category. <br>
<br>
I'm sure the labour laws in most/all/some states also would protect the worker from verbal abuse. <br>
<br>
Children:<br>
Your distinction between abuses is weak: what one child may find emotionally disturbing can be what another child may thrive on. <br>
<br>
Me? I do not like praise or encouragement from my parents. I know they are proud, and I know they care. That's enough. <br>
<br>
Some people would climb through barbed wire to get a &quot;you did good, son&quot; from their dad. <br>
<br>
If you wanted to discuss physical or verbal abuse, you'd be dealing with a situation which does not fit your example, so I know why you drew that line, however. <br>

And why? Because love is scarse (as in rare, sorry if it is misspelled)<br>
Some people fight all their life for recognition from a father who is himself too scared to show who he is. Children see this as emotional closed-ness and ask them selves &quot;What am I doing wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> what one child may find emotionally disturbing can be what another child may thrive on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Problem is, the child that &quot;thrives&quot; (No, I don't believe it) won't get a chance to feel it's OWN pride first (It will feel pride because it is praised NOT because it is proud) and will experience that others' oppinion of them is what they should look for much more than their own satisfaction/selflove.<br>
This means the child will grow up judging it self on others judgement and not have a clue to when or how they can make themselves happy - only others...(Darn I wish my english was better - I could explain myself so much easier hehe)<br>
<br>
This is why (among other things) a LOT of people have no clue to who they are and what they want from life. They only know what other people want them to want and be...<br>
And one morning when they are around 30-40 years old they will wake up and ask themselves: Who am I really and is this life really the life I wanted???? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvittorriod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VittorrioD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/7/02 9:35:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Hypothetical only</span><hr size=1> So let's say guild xyz is in Kael, they have pulled every mob out of the arena and have a couple charmed at the ready and are buffed.

<br>
First, if it takes you 30 mins to clear arena you won't get a chance at Vindi.  Respawns we get you.<br>
<br>
However, generally if you are near the Arena with any kinda force it will be respected.  I know of several times where guilds wanting to kill Statue, waited for 3-4 hours for guilds trying Vindi.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Where do you draw the line on whether or not someone has a camp and is ready?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Depends on the camp.  Depends on the people.  There won't be exact rules for everything.  People just need to follow the basic idea to respect each other.  And for the most part on the Rathe they do so.<br>
<br>
Also the server convention, is not &quot;has a camp and is ready&quot;, but has a kill force there.  Which yea is kinda subjective.  The basic idea is does one force have a reasonable chance to success or not.<br>
<br>
In the case of Vindi, NB would generally see 18-24 as sufficient to claim the spawn.  However, if you sat there for an hour or so without making progress towards Vindi, we probably would be talking to you and seeing what the hold up was.<br>
<br>
Regarding the quest mob being discussed, no one monk probably does not have a reasonable chance of success.  However, 1 monk and a cleric (maybe a shaman) would have a chance of success.  <br>
<br>
It all comes down to respect.  From everyone.<br>
<br>
Respect for the smaller guilds and unguilded in giving them a chance to do things.  And respect for the larger guilds, in not holding up a spawn if you won't be able to kill it soon.<br>
<br>
If everyone shows each other some respect than things work well.
