(bad RP exp)</span><hr size=1> I met a 44th lavel mage in West Freeport the other day, and he was overly joyful that I SoWed him outof the blue. He started hitting on me and &quot;wooing&quot; me. Now I play a female wood elven druid (you know the one that is supposedly the HOTTEST female bod) and I am constantly getting hit on and proposed to, so I have come to deal with it. I usually flirt back a little, and then move on and nothing ever comes of it. But this guy for some reason really was interested in me. He started asking personal questions (some of a sexual nature) and yet I just brushed them off with a *blushes* umm thank thee m'lord... but then he got aggressive with me and demanded that I call him IN REAL LIFE! Up until that point, even though he had asked me personal questions, I still took it like we we were just RPing. But then he scared me with his aggressive demand that I call him &quot;or else I would learn my lesson&quot;. I /reported his last comments (which included him demanding me to call him AND his #) and then petitioned. A guide quickly replied and actually came to me and talked with me about the situation for a long time, reassuring me that they would take care of it, and this guy could not touch me IRL. He told me that he would write a report to the server GM and I could tlak about it with him later, and I thought PHEW this is gonna be handled (this guy won't be fooling anyone else)... But somehow my report was not found by the server gm. At least I had screenshots taken of some of this sicko's comments including &quot;I have always had a nut for babes in leather&quot;, and &quot;tell me about your sex life&quot; so perhaps something will happen. But this has to have been my worst EQ experience- I mean I love roleplaying the gracious, ambitious, flirty and wild druidess! I don't want to stop that attitude, but that really made me think hmm maybe Quella just does not have any luck in the guy department; maybe she should turn distrustful towards them. (I most likely won't though, for I am much too kind)<br>
Anyways, I later found out from a former guildmate of mine, that a similar thing had happened to her as well, and I was kind of wondering if anyone else had had a similar experience/ If so, how did you deal with it/ Did it make you change your view on roleplaying at all/<br>
May Tunare bless and keep thee well,<br>

I'm so sorry that this happened to you.  People should get banned for doing something like that.  Sexual harrassment is a serious thing.  Making threats to extort sexual favors sounds like a felony to me.  Getting banned should be the least of his worries.  At least put his name here so everyone knows never to group with or help this person.  He's 44th level so it will effect him to not get in groups anymore since he won't be able to just start up a new character so easily.  That's near my level so I'll make sure he doesn't get into any groups I'm in.  Geez - my blacklist is already up to 4 thieves (played by 2 players) and a sexual offender in the span of a week or two, and I thought I would never have a blacklist.<br>
<br>
What the heck is wrong with some people anyway?<br>

The reason I did not put the character's name in the report was that I do not wish to be associated with him or anything that happens to him because of this. If you send me a private tell because you really would like to know the person's name so you can steer clear of them, perhaps I can tell you that way. But posting it publicly in my mind, is not wise.

<br>
I am saddened to hear of your experience. I too know friends who were subjected to the exact same type of nonsense.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go out on a limb here a little bit, hope it doesn't get me in too much trouble:<br>
<br>
I was a Guide on one of the other servers for a while. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What happened to you is a bannable offense. Period.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there is no &quot;investigation&quot; or enquiry necessary. If you had/have the report, it is black and white, and action is immediate.<br>
<br>
If you gave your report to a guide and they have since lost it, Iggy is exactly right; We have a pathetic excuse for a GM on this server. (Sorry GM) <br>
Petitons and your reports go into a queue, and they can be immediately escalated to senior Guides or GM's. <br>
There is no excuse. <br>
What sounds like happened is that someone closed out the petition, either guide or GM. Names are important here. &quot;Why&quot; becomes a very important question.<br>
<br>
I assure you, Verant takes this kind of thing very seriously. Employing quality people is another matter entirely. If you are curious, I am no longer a Guide-I could not stomach the abuse, I quit the program some time ago.<br>
<br>
If I may suggest, you need to be assertive about this. Petition the GM and demand action, tell him/her/it that you will not tolerate this abuse nor will anyone else either. <br>
<br>
If you still receive no satisfaction, you can go to Sony's boards and file a complaint about the GM there. Let us know-I will personally back you up. I have a 14 year old son who plays as well. It is in my best interests.<br>
<br>
Sexual predators and perverts abound in cyberspace. The anonymonity makes it a haven. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> That doesn't mean we have to tolerate it. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Too many people use this place (EQ, or any other online interactive game) as an arena for their sicko minds to run rampant through our innocent *coughs* worlds.  <br>
<br>
I too have met up with my share of weirdos - and fortunately, I'm not afraid to say, 'Leave me alone now, or I'll petition - you are offending me' or whatever the case may be. Personally, I feel very safe in Norrath - but NO ONE should ever have to feel that their safety has been jeopardized because of another's irresponsibility, OR inability to control their hormones. Period.<br>
<br>
My advice would be this - at first sign of harrassment, note the name - keep record of what was said. Then, just put them on ignore. Immediately.  You'll not hear a thing they say. If for some reason they continue to follow you, then just petition the creep(s).  But do not respond.  Responding just fuels their fire, and usually, they are too stupid to see that you mean what you say - they always think it's a game.  I don't mess around with stuff like this - been there done that, and I'll never do it voluntarily again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well, it didn't happen to me, it happened to my gnome enchanter.  He was in Freeport and there was a high elf female just sitting there.  I decided to be nice and cast what buffs I had on her.  She thanked me and or while flirted with me, I didn't really say much back (I think that you can roleplay having your characters in love in EQ.  BUT it shouldbe roleplayed, not to mention have it stay in game.  Being a gnome, and her a high elf I decided gnome and high elf wouldn't be the best RPing relationship)  So I thought I made it clear to her I was not interested.  Then I left and she followed me like a pet, and I am %99 shure I did not use my charm spell on her.  I killed things for a while and then asked her why she was following me.  She said 'Because I love you&quot;.  Well, I just said plain out, 'We can be friends but I am not in love with you and never will be.'  Thinking I got the message to her that time she just replied, 'It is ok, love can conquer all.'  Now I was starting to get irritated, so I said to her, 'Please just leave me alone, I am not interested.'  That was about as rude as my gnome was going to be because he is generally a 'good' character.  But she said, 'It is ok love, our relationship will be fine.'  Now I was really starting to get upset, and not wanting my gnome to get mad at her I decided bringing logging on Srinn, if anyone could be rude to a high elf it was him.  So I went to the spot with Srinn where I logged and shure enough, she was sitting there.  Coming in duel wielding giant claws i said 'A high elf!!!  I WILL EAT YOU!!!'  But she just said something (I do not know if it would offend anyone to say what she actually said, but it wasbasicly saying something like 'Take me in the back room of the Maiden's Fancy.') err interesting.  So I sat down and logged off and logged on to my lvl 1 mule.  And went up to her and said 'Hello.' and to my surprise she said 'Fu** off.'  Now this confused me so I had my high lvl friend who is a female go up to her.  And she said 'WOW, hello!!!  You look very pretty...  Oh yeah I am really a guy, I am just playing a female so all of the wierd people playing this game wont hit on me.'  Then my friend told her... err... him the whole story that I am telling you now.  Then 'it' logged off.<br>
<br>
My theory!!!  The player was really a guy trying to get stuff from higher lvl players.  Beware, 'it' is still out there.  <br>
