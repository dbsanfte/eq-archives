Oh really? I thought we were all working together here...I thought that was what the Rathe was all about. Are you saying that all Rotation laws are etched in stone and not up for debate?

<br>
No, what they are saying is that just because you killed the mob once, dont expect to see lots of changed to the rotation just to please you.  Most likely you will just be told to wait some time, so you can get a better feel for the rotation, and THEN if you think there is a problem with the rotation discuss it with the other guild leaders.<br>
<br>
And really, we don't care what the vocal people of the Rathe think.  Rotation rules are not us for general public debate, that is the reason most of this stuff has not been posted in the past.  The rotations are not your &quot;I'm bored at work and need something to read hot topic of the day&quot;.  They are systems worked out between the guild leaders of the guilds on the rotation to the benefit of them.<br>
<br>
I can however see the difference with the Doze rot, since the Named are so much easier than Doze himself is.  And yes this informations should have been put here before, but we can't change the past.  Its here now, thats all we can do. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 11:59:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> The rotation agreements are just that.

<br>
Wait til your on the Dozekar rotation, arguably the WORST Designed quests in EQ made even worse by the /random spawn timer.<br>
<br>
NB spent months on this rotation, grinding out Doz kills and drakes for a total of around 35 or so completed quest items. And some of the stuff is even inferior to NToV gear unfortunatly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It should be clear to anyone who uses their brain, to complete a HoT quest it requires items from Dozekar AND the named drakes, those guilds farming armor should have no interest in the drakes, all they are doing is denying guilds that NEED these drakes the pieces they need to complete and GET OFF The rotation quicker. Simple, as soon as a guild has what it wants from a mob it moves on, so while your all busy farming the named drakes for symbols you will probably bank for a good few months, your actually keeping these guilds on the rotation, ever thought about it that way? Probably not i guess.<br>
<br>
If people would just use some common sense, look at the bigger picture, im not asking you to move outta the way for the bigger guilds, im asking for some respect is all, respect for those that have been there before you and have ground out time there to achieve what they have, and like i said, if you leave these mobs to the guilds who are ON the Doz rotation you will find that in a period of time they will be done with it, and it will be alot of a shorter period of time if they actually get to KILL these named drakes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaisamayoshima.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haisama Yoshima</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ellardobluth.homelinux.net/forum/images/avatars/Mis14.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>El'lar Dobluth</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 1:21:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ellardobluth.homelinux.net/forum/images/avatars/Mis14.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> Don't be an nimrod Falc.

<br>
El'lar killed one named drake about 3 months ago but did not know about this &quot;package&quot; deal.  If a named drake is in the way of other mobs and I cannot avoid aggroing him then sorry but he will die.  It is not the goal of the smaller guilds to kill named drakes so I don't know where you got that from.<br>
<br>
All I see is the Doze rotation mobs talking saying, &quot;me, me, me&quot;.  Doze rotation guilds want their named drakes and push out smaller guilds camping HoT entrance.  How much sympathy do you expect from smaller guilds when the Doze rotation guilds can't respect our camp in return?<br>

<br>
Thank you.  Now after reading this I have yet to find anyone saying the named in HOT should be FFA, or FCFS.  In fact I see post after post from smaller guilds ALL AGREEING they should be a package deal.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
So now can we forget the part about whether they should or shouldn't be part of a package?  So we can discuss the real problems at hand on this rotation.<br>
<br>
By posting the information here is should solve <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PART</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the problem of named being sniped.  Those who didn't know better because they didn't have the information needed now do.<br>
<br>
However their are 2 problems here that are being ignored.  Those smaller guilds who are supporting your right to the &quot;Dozekar and Named&quot; package are also saying there are a couple of problems that need to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 1:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Named drakes left up for multiple days, causing problems on pulls, blocking areas of the wing from guilds farming armor.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 2:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The way some guilds either are or feel they are being run over by those guilds on the Dozekor Rotation.  <br>
<br>
These are the problems that need to be addressed.  Not whether they should be a package rotation or not.<br>
<br>
Now to answer a couple of questions that I have seen come up.<br>
<br>
1. Yes some of the named are in little alcoves where they are alone.  I think 1-2 are in an open hallway, don't have my map here atm.<br>
<br>
2. The locations of those alcoves are in very bad spots.  Take the 2 alcoves directly east of Dozekar Lair,  those can be agroed a long distance away.  Making it impossilbe to get by them if your headed toward the exit.  Also there is another alcove on toward the exit that you have to pass that has a named spawn in it.<br>
<br>
Now can we have some sort of dicussion on how to solve these 2 problems?  <p><a href="http://www.yopolis.com/syndicate" target="_blank">

<br>
You can pull 80% or better of the static spawns within HoT without agroing any of the named Drakes.  If you move to the back camp near the exit then yes you do need to clear 3 named.<br>
<br>
Doze guild should not be leaving named up for multiple days, however they shouldnt be expected to run over ever time 1 named spawns either.  This can easily be silved just by talking to each other.  You are in HoT and see a named drake up, send a tell to however is up for Doze.  <br>
<br>
As for Problem 2.  Thats something that would have to be dealt with on a case by case situation.  No guilds should not be walking over each other.  Guilds killing in HoT (including Doze) need to work together.  But really this should be dealt with in the normal standard way, talk things out between guild leaders (amazing how much you can accomplish with a few simple tells), and if that doesnt work, flame them on the RTA like normal =) <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uborick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Borick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 1:55:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> Vorth,<br>
<br>
As far as named being left up for too long goes, I think that part of the blame is the random spawn timer and drakes being 'sniped'.  Rotation guilds don't really need Dozekar.  They need the named drakes.  When a rotation guild gets to HOT and finds only 3 drakes up, that guild 'passes' to the next in line because they don't want to waste their turn for nothing.  Then the next guild passes and so on, and so on...<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, that's not the biggest part of the problem.  The -biggest- part of the problem is that certain guilds place Dozekar on a low priority.  If they can get to him, they will, but as BOTS has said, they usually wait until very late at night to kill Dozekar.<br>
<br>
This needs to stop.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is for Noble Blade to see that drakes are up at 4PM and sit there all day while other guilds are farming armor and killing the drakes, only to have BOTS pass the dragon at midnight to us.  I don't mean to bash you, guys, but please... be responsible about this rotation.  All of the other rotations, though they may seem more important to you, tend to take care of themselves.  Dozekar has a limited window.<br>
<br>
Please.  BOTS, NB, Tindi, and whoever else is on the rotation... Get to TOV and kill the f'ing dragon early.  Be responsible.  Don't place other priorities ahead of it.  Your fellow guilds on the rotation will thank you.<br>
<br>
Can we get some input from the guildleaders about this? Some assurance that we'll try to be more proactive in taking out these mobs in a timely manner? Dozekar should not be passed.<br>

<br>
You currently show a yellow dot where I found a named, directly between 4 &amp; 5 you have a yellow dot there.  I don't remember the name but we found a named up there one day. <br>
-----<br>
<br>
I certainly am not calling for a guild to come running over when just 1 named is up.  But I have been in HOT where I have seen 4-5 or more drakes up at once and it has been 2-3 days since dozekor has been killed.<br>
<br>
1-2 drakes don't cause that much of a problem on pulling,  4-5 do.<br>
<br>
I realize there is a random spawn timer involved on the named drakes, which doesn't help the situation.  The result is however there the &quot;Dozekor &amp; Named&quot; package comes with extra maintance that other rotations doesn't.  YOu have 9 npcs on this rotation, 8 of which are on random spawn timers.  As a guild joining this rotation you need to make it a commitment to plan accordingly to handle those 8.  <br>
<br>
Waiting to kill the named and Dozekor all at once, may have worked 6-8 months ago when there were very few guilds in HOT,  however now there are multiple guilds in HOT,  and leaving the named up for multiple days does cause problems.<br>
<br>
There has to be an answer here somewhere.   <p><a href="http://www.yopolis.com/syndicate" target="_blank">

<br>
Read my long ass post somewhere in the middle of this thread.  Giving tells is fine and I try to accomodate but last week I had to delay my own guild's raid for nearly 4.5 hours and thus ending the raid before it really started.  Smaller guilds can't be expected to let every guild that wants to attempt Doze attempt him while we wait.  Add to that line when the Doze rotation guild comes in and demands to kill Doze despite the smaller guild already allowing other guilds have their attempts.<br>
<br>
Communication is fine but just because the guild on the Doze rotation doesn't get the answer they want, doesn't makes the smaller guild wrong nor does it give them the right to push us out of our camp. If Doze rotaion guilds want to ensure this oh so important quest mob dies, they either need to wake up early or stay up late to kill him.<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of the Doze rotation guilds to not intrude on our camps (assuming we were there first).  Not the other way around.  Don't expect to show up on the 20th hour and expect a guild that has rights to a camp to move especially if they had already conceded their camp to allow another guild to have an attempt.  If they choose to great but don't whine and threaten when you are told no.<br>

Unless they have changed things, no named spawns in the location you indicate.  A normal drake spawns there (random which type), but not a named one.   <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umorlen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morlen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 2:56:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> SOLUTION!!!!<br>
<br>
I'm bound at ToV, and try to stay that way. I am also on CoV faction. If you kill a named drake at the HoT entrance, send anybody in NB a /tell to log on Morlen and loot the symbol!! My immediate family has my l/p so somebody can always access me!<br>
<br>
Well, its a great solution for NB anyway!! I'm always willing to come loot a symbol if a drake gets killed on accident! Seriously, I will.<br>

*edit* Borick, I need tears. Not symbols. Tears. Black and white to be exact. So we don't have all the tears yet! <p><CENTER> <IMG SRC="http://www.noble-blade.net/profiles/Morlen/morlensig.jpg">

Hey, its just an idea.<br>
