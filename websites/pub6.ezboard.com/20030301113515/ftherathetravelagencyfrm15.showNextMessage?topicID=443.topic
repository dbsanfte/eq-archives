<br>
As i posted at the first, the facts remain the same, yes Ragefire was up for awhile, i have not seen the logs yet but have been told 5 hours, and yes an attempt was made to contact the people in the zone who were camping him.<br>
<br>
The logs that Dwallyn posted, yes it shows me saying what i did, after it happened i spoke to many others etc and my viewpoint has been changed.  That night i contacted CoN in an attempt to figure out some way to resolve this issue.  The only way i have figured out to remotely do it is that me and several others have agreed to camp RF for Trompen in the near future, whether that will help things or not remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
As for how i feel on what happened, i personally think what sot did was morally wrong, and have gone on record in guildchat and with the other officers as saying such.  Thats been my position since i heard the full story and will continue to be it.<br>
<br>
I will apologize on behalf of those in SoT that feel that what we did was wrong, some of them have posted already and others have made their feelings known in our guildchat or message boards.  To Trompen and Con, and the community that supports this board, as a Guildleader of SoT and a spokeman for those who feel like i do, I am sorry. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utzutentsunami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzuten Tsunami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tad-pole</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/24/02 12:34:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok here goes...</span><hr size=1> Hello, my name is Tzuten Tsunami, an Officer of the Guild Spirit of Tunare. I have posted here many a times, on various topics. Now I wish to talk about my take on this whole situation.<br>
<br>
There will be no great debates, nor will I attack and defends posts like I have done in the past. I hope that my actions in the past both ingame and my posts here can speak for me.<br>
<br>
I wish to say the following.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry.<br>
<br>
I am sorry I was not there when this happened, but maybe if I was there and saw the /shouts and /ooc maybe I could have done something.<br>
<br>
From /guildchat I saw a side that most people did not see.<br>
I saw asking why was RF at zone.<br>
I saw people say that the clerics were afk.<br>
I saw people and myself as well do a /who all to see how many guildies they had on at the time (about 6ish)<br>
I saw people mention NB entering the zone. (My point of view: NB has openly stated that they will not support a rotation on RF. My initial assuming cause I was not privy to all the facts is that NB was going to go after Ragefire. **before I get flamed for this, think about Myga in Western Wastes. Kiting/pulling/kiting etc etc that has taken place between some guilds. I thought this was going to be something similiar.)<br>
<br>
I am NOT leaving SoT out to dry as some &quot;other&quot; people are and coming here and bashing former guildmates. For those that left already had other &quot;issues&quot; and if they say they are not being entirely truthful. But you all know that a guild is &quot;family&quot; and you will defend your brothers and sisters. Every flame on this board, has the Flamer, the Flamee and 50+ people that were not there defending their friends and guildmates.<br>
<br>
Again, I am sorry. <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">

How many members of Spirit of Tunare can say the same for Shei?<br>
<br>
Here we find public apologies posted by some members of SoT. I applaud those who have the strength to say, &quot;I was wrong and I'm sorry&quot;, but the fact remains: Shei was there. Shei is the guildleader, and Shei feels no need to make amends for what he has done.<br>

After all was said and done, and the logs were revealed - it looks pretty bad for SoT.<br>
<br>
I'm impressed with some of the leaders for coming forth with an apology.  But honestly an apology isn't substansive in comparison with Trompen's (sp?) time invested / wasted.<br>

Small question:  Has the SoT cleric who recieved the epic considered asking Vaylin to transfer it to Tromp?  This would be an action commisurate with the deed done, imo. <p><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Emil">Emil Sinclair</a><br>

For those people I would like to add my personal opinon, please remember this is a flame board so if you have a problem with those people reply within these boards and not in game.<br>
<br>
Those kind of actions will not help your or Spirit of Tunares image or cause in any way.<br>

<br>
Afterall &quot;we were just following orders&quot; has come out of a lot of members of SoT. I'd like to see Shei apologize so it can confirm to em and others that this isn't just another Shei order. <br>
<br>
&quot;make an apology to clear this up, it'll make it go away faster.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't care if he doesn't read these boards, then he can say it in GC he can have it logged and he can have it posted on the front page of the Spirit of Tunare website. All your apologies mean a lot. Shei's is the one that matters the most. <p><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

If it happens again I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> petition and I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> report for harassment.<br>

As for the apology, I'm glad someone has finally enough intestinal fortitude to stand up and say &quot;Oops, we goofed.&quot;<br>

<br>
There are some fine people in SoT, but the actions of some of these leaders you have cause your whole guild to have a bad name. This was not a one time issue, but one of many from those same officers that you have. <br>
<br>
It is sad you are trying to clean up for others actions, but what you should be doing is stopping these actions from ever happening in first place. These people represent the leadership of your guild and set the standards for how member should act. I have made a personal vow to not group with any member of your guild, because of this. <br>
<br>
If instead of trying to clean up from these worthless people actions each time, you might look cleaning up the people instead and if so I might rethink this vow. <br>
