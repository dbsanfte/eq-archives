Yes, Sev and Trak are very large rotations.  Because lots of people want thier loot.  But where do you draw the line?  Can I say that 7 is too many for KT tomarrow?  Or 9 is too many for Statue?  <br>

<br>
I was thinking that the demand for such old content (who really wants anything off Sev except the green scale anymore?) must be very small now, but clearly it is not. And that's great, I asked the question to find the answer, and here and there I have found it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the tact I should have taken is that larger guilds (my own included) should take a look at themselves in their Velious quest or better armour and REALLY ask themselves if they plan to go to VP, cos they sure aren't killing Trakanon for ac 17 Beastlord BPs.  Perhaps it's time to remove yourself from the rotation and give the little guys some more if they really want it.<br>
<br>
 My own guild who keyed the majority of members for VP has barely even played in the place since all that Trak killin.<br>
<br>
 While it's not my decision, I'd be just as happy to be off the Trak rotation, it's an onerous requirement for me to go down to Seb YET AGAIN and drop his pathetic ass.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of us could take a page from Noble Blade's self removal from the Sev rotation, since if they REALLY need a green scale they have easy access to one from Hoshkar. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59628">Jurrasic Epoch</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
I think the reason everyone thinks this server has so much respect is because of the rotations.  It is human nature to want more, right now.  Who's to say how often you can kill a mob and be considered acting under the &quot;gentlemen's agreement?&quot;  If a guild decided Statue is a main focus for them, and kill him a few spawns in a row, does that mean I get to kill KT 3 times in a row?  Isn't it better that those two guilds equally share both mobs?<br>
<br>
Trak is a 3 day spawn, so I don't see much of a problem with its rotation as long as the guilds promptly kill him.  Sev is more often than not a weekly spawn.  Since he's so easy, the rot has become rather long.  VoF has no green scales banked, and we've gotten a total of 5 since the rotation was created.  There is lots of time in between Sev kills, but I'd imagine every newer guild on the rot is very happy to be on it.<br>
<br>
There may seem to be way too many rotations right now, but I think that's a good thing.  As a guild progresses, it can pick and chose which direction they want to go.  If they have too much on their plate, they can always pass without the worry of never seeing the content in the future.  Rotations are most definitely good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even some of the velious rotations are starting to suffer what the Sev rotations is going thru now. Personally I remember when only Lom,LoL were actively killing trak, since the big guilds were auto passing and my guild, Lom, was able to enjoy trak many times during the following weeks as if we were one of the first guilds to break onto the rotation. Of course this changed and many guilds broke onto the rotations slowing our chance to get trak; however, this was not a problem since we had progressed  enough thanks to his bps to go onto higher game in velious. Sadly the smaller guilds that join the trak rotation will never get the chance to almost perma farm a mob and move onto higher prey as quickly as my guild. If i remember correctly even Bots had killed trak like 35 times before moving on. The bigger guilds had the chance to ehave a much smaller rotation for a longer period of time thus ensuring much more loot from X mob, thus allowing them to move on faster to higher content.  <br>
<br>
Now we come to the problem, X uber guild is still on Y rotation even tho they can go to ssra and kill mobs that drop superior loot. Now the smaller guilds eventually break onto the  said rotation, allowing them access to trival loot to the older guilds. Sadly the rotation is jam packed with  the old guilds and the new upcoming guilds, and they can expect to see Y rotation mob once every 2 months. This is  fate of the small guild, since every rotation they will join in the future will be just as bad; The sev of today is the Tormax of tommorow. Anyhow I want the smaller guilds to enjoy what the bigger guilds had at one time, a chance to partake in small rotations on old uber mobs, who loot is outdated for most of the high end guilds.<br>
<br>
I personally think Guilds should have a limit to the number of rotations they can be on. This way the older guilds would have to choose which rotations they would have to be on, favoring aow and other high end mobs that drop godly loot, leaving open older mobs for the new guilds, giving them a more frequent chance of fighting mobs in their guild range. This would allow the lower end guilds to be able have a quicker chance to kill sev, the mid range guilds a quicker chance to kill say statue, and the uber guilds ... well they got shafted in my plan, who knows maybe some mobs that nobody wants to be on a roation to kill like the Ancients, or Tunare could go FFA, allowing a free up of said mobs creating more mobs that X uber guild can kill when ever they feel like when non of their rotations mobs are up. Sorta of how IV, Shei are now, and if enough guilds want the same mob that badly they can create a rotation for said mob.<br>
<br>
This is my poorly thought up idea not the feelings of my guild lom blah blah blah, but seriously sev rotation needs something done to it, cause damn that sucks.<br>

If the mobs droped only trivial loot for a guild, then they would not be killing it anymore.  No guild it going to waste its time killing a mob that thier members no longer want loot off from.  The fact that a guild is still killing a mob means that they want something from it.<br>

Nope, nothign wrong with discussion at all.  I was just warning people to be careful what they ask for.  People tend to ask for things without fully thinking the consequences through.<br>
<br>
If Xedd and other thinks Trak and Sev rotations are too big, and that they have no use for them anymore, they why are they still on the rotation?  I can only assume because they still want something off those mobs, so they continue to kill them.  Just like all the other guilds on the rotation.<br>

I was replying to Xedd and the rest of this thread as a whole.  Some post that you made months ago that I have forgotten about had no bearing on my reply, sorry.<br>
<br>
If you think a rotation is too big, then I would suggest that you discuss with your guild if you feel that you should still be on it.  I know that every couple months NB goes through the mobs that we kill and ranks them to see which its time to move on from, and which we still need alot.  <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 659<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/22/02 11:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=853.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rotations, still necessary?</span><hr size=1> Actually, I posted it yesterday/day before, so I figured it was possibly relavent.  /shrug.

Someone in an earlier post said that guilds have to camp the mobs with full force in order get on the rotation.<br>
<br>
I think this is the way of the old Luclin and pre-Luclin EQ days. With more and more content out there, it is harder and harder for guilds to wax mobs the instant they are up. Especially on patch days.<br>
<br>
What I have been finding is that the old way of trying to keep it quiet that you were going to make an attempt on a rot mob for fear that the big guild would /gu &quot;OMG get to xyz mob now! We don't want the abc guild on the rot!&quot; is dieing. The new way is to send a /tell to abc guild and say &quot;hey we were hoping for a shot at xyz mob and wanted to know if we could give it a go before you killed?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you will find that surprisingly enough, the answer will most likely be &quot;Sure thing pal, go ahead.&quot; Of course there will always be exceptions, with very contested 'newer' mobs and some specific 'oldies but goodies'. But for the most part I think you will find what I have said to be true.<br>
<br>
Anyways, that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.<br>

As we all know there are many many mobs that are for the most part Raid worthy that are not on the rotations.  Easy examples are Gozz/telk/talendor/gore/Vindi/Velk.  The list goes on and we arent even talking about Luclin mobs.<br>
<br>
There is a very good balance here of FFA mobs and Rotation mobs.  I dont see a real problem with the current system so why mess with it?<br>
<br>
In Regards to the trak rotation, its not really that long.  There are 13 guilds on the rotation, there are also 13 guilds on the Zlandicar rotation.  Zland is 5day Trak is 3day respawn, if your thinking about Taking trak off the rot, Zland should actually be dropped first.  But by no means do i wnat this to happen, as i said, im content with the way it is now.<br>

Taking a mob like Sev off rotation would see many guilds never getting the opportunity to get this mob, and many powerful guilds monopolizing the drop. I can see it now in the Bazaar: <br>
&quot; Green Dragon Scales 250k PST &quot;<br>
The only way to fix the Severilious situation with having 21 guilds on the rotation ( and 5 more on the list to be added soon by the way ) is to make him spawn faster/ more often OR make the epic portion of Severilious a triggered version like they did the Undead bard/Trakanon for the bards.<br>
If things go the way they are currently, I personally think i will have more luck going to Veeshan's Peak to get My Green scale off of Hoshkar. All you warriors out there, get working on your Veeshan's Peak key quests and get your whole guild doing it. Think about it: Severilious drops the green scale 1 in 3 times on average. That is anywhere from 21 weeks <br>
( number of guilds on rotation ) to 63 weeks ( 21 x 3 attempts to ensure getting a scale ) to get a damn scale. I surmise that a whole guild of about 30-40 people could all get Veeshan's Peak Keys and get into Veeshans Peak to kill Hoshkar ( who reportedly always drops the green scale ) In the time period it would take to get a single green scale off of Sev.<br>
It boggles my mind that SoE don't see this bottleneck as being a problem.<br>
By the way Warriors, I have read  that SoE is possibly thinking of nerfing weapons with the effect of Taunting Blow or Enraging Blow because these weapons totally imbalance the taunt skill.<br>
personally, I cant taunt worth a damn without the effect I get from my Blade of Carnage. Nerfing the effect SoE? Watch me nerf my payments to you and delete my account.<br>

Im a quitter so my opinion doesnt really matter but...<br>
<br>
with a slight modification to this<br>
&quot;I personally think Guilds should have a limit to the number of rotations they can be on&quot;<br>
<br>
heres an idea... you can only be on 5 rotations with more then 5 guilds on it so rotations like burrower or glyphed/exiled dont count as full rotations til 5 guilds are on it.<br>
<br>
I dont know this seems like a good idea and would force guilds to think about what they see as more important but also 5 is a good number becuase not too many guilds are on more then 5 rotations with more then 5 guilds on it and if they are generally it would be a mob like trak where he is reall trivial but a good hunt for a smaller guild. <p>&lt;br&gt;Dastante Soulsaver &lt;br&gt;60 High Priest<br>

After you remove Trak and Sev from the rotation, where do you stop? Next thing you see that the list for AoW (just an example, I did not look at the rot list) or Sssra list is too long and decide to remove him, where does it end?<br>
<br>
I believe that all raid zone/mobs must remain on the rotation list or everything goes FFA.<br>
<br>
The rotation protects smaller guilds like mine who are generally only on the lower end raid mobs/zones. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=285348" target="top">Jerac</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->56 Vah Shir Animist<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://farseekers.com" target="top">Far Seekers</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->The Rathe</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

Think the loots on Sev are sub-par?  Thats fine, UberguildX gets together 1-2 groups, kills Sev, and then &quot;Hey, thats a free 75K in my pocket for the CoF he just dropped.&quot;<br>

Now Im not dissing Cheze, hell, I dunno where he GETS 1/2 his stuff, it's just an example.<br>

As long as there is money to be made from the loots that it drops then their will always be people who will stick to the rotations of the MOBs, whether or not they have better than the mob in questions loot table.  It's that simple. <p>Trevelain Dor'Seth<br>

<br>
It is therefore ridiculous to ask that guilds be limited to how many rotations they can participate in because that would only be a disadvantage to the big guilds who allow the rotations to take place in the first place. Albeit that most of the big guilds are limiting their number of rotation mobs at the moment due to exploring and killing in PoP, but it is likely that will change soon when PoP mobs start going on rotation as well.<br>
<br>
There are certainly cases where bigger guilds sell tradable loot that they don't need. Guilds certainly cost alot of money to run, and it has to come from somewhere. I think the majority of this money tends to come from selling spells, particularly in SoL, but after a while, the spell market dries up and items need to be sold to fund guild activities.<br>
<br>
Rotations are certainly for the benefit of just about everyone. Our system is certainly superior to FFA where on many servers, there are 2-3 guilds all in NToV at the same time killing dragons as soon as they pop, and several guilds converging on Ssra all racing towards the named mobs. Rotations means that people don't have to waste time spawn camping a mob just for a shot of it, or arguing with another guild to see who got their first. Basically, everyone gets more time to have fun and kill the things they want and less time stressing over whether or not they will get to kill the mob they want, and waiting for it to spawn.<br>

The only rotation I honestly think needs cutting down on is the Severillious rotation - Twenty One Weeks a scale. That's a bloody joke, especially seeing as it doesn't drop every time. Somehow this should be remedied, though i don't see how, other then either making it FFA (which, er, was the reason it was made    ) or cutting it down...I don't know what to do. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How does making Sev FFA make him spawn more?  Thie issue here I think has less to do with him being on rotation, and more to do with him spawning less often than everyone would like.<br>
<br>
The real solution is to have a triggered Sev for the warrior epic.  All pulling him off rotation does, is give those able to mobilize more ability to kill him.  So for those less able to mobilize will go from 21 weeks a scale, to more like 50-100 weeks per scale on that rare occasion when they can manage enough folks to actually kill him before he poofs to a larger guild.<br>
<br>
Write letters to VI for the needed change.  They did it for the cleric, druid, etc... epic, I can't see why with enough pressure they won't do it for other epics as well. <p>Soneya<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
