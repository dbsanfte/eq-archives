For some backgroundinformation, we have an alliance with Legends of Marr who hasan addidtional 20 planable members. We reserved the plane offear tonight, November 16th, 2000. With the servers coming downwe were getting the rest of out team in as soon as the serverscame up, around 5pm CST to be technical.<br><br>Aegeis, a level60 paladin from BOTS, as well as other members of BOTS beganto zone into the plane of fear. I asked him what was going on.He told me that BOTS was clearing Fear. I stated that we havehad the plain on reserve for a month now. He paused, and toldme he would have to talk to Mistabone (the leader of BOTS) aboutit. I was then informed that BOTS was going to clear the Planeof Fear and we would be given all of the loot minus Draco, CTand some various carmine and blighted pieces that they needed.<br><br>I was under the impression that we were supposed tocall in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; guilds if we needed aid inclearing the plane as well as killing the epic mobs. This apparentlyis not the case. I was told that the calendar isn't going tobe in effect much longer......I am in a total loss here.<br><br>I was under the impression that we were to clear the plainand then call in assistance. It is disheartening when we havespent weeks looking forward to a date and then a guild decidesto come in and clear it for you. What fun is that? A lot of peoplefrom both guilds took friday off of work for this. <br><br>The servers are down right now, I am not griping or trying tostart a war or anything, I just want some clear up. BOTS leftsoon after to kill Venril Sathir, I believe (but do not knowfor sure) that they went to kill Venril Sathir due to the facttaht after they gated out from Fear they were all in karnors.And KEG was camped in Seb waiting for Trak to pop after thisunfortunate additional downtime. <br><br>I just want to saythat Aegeis was nice and courteous when I spoke with him. I haveno gripe against any, I just want to get some of this clearedup. What is a guild of my size and alliance to do? Is the calendarbeing thrown out? When it comes down to it, we cannot stop BOTSif they wanted to take the plane from us. I have no argumentagainst them taking the epic mobs that they need, but how aboutthey wait till we clear everything else first? Give us a chanceto play. Is this not a violation of the calendar by doing this.<br><br>DISCLAIMER- BOTS has not returned to the POF, theyare still in Karnors as I mentioned due to the servers beingdown, I have no knowledge if they are going to return to Fearor not. <br><br>Any help or suggestions to this situation wouldbe highly appreciated.<br><br>Rogfear Shadowripper<br>Leaderof the Bloodline of the Bear  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upixal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pixal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/00 7:19:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BOTS and Fear</span><hr size=1> I feel for you Rogfear. Like you, I want the &quot;experience&quot; of participating in planes. Of course I want the gear,but just picking up loot rotting isn't what makes EQ fun. Workingfor my loot gives me a sense of accomplishment. Personally, Ithink you guys should have had the chance to clear fear, thencall BB to have the Epic mobs.<br><br>I also think someoneshould implement a system, any system. Then see if it's followed.No proposal is going to get 100% agrement, so no use in waitingfor that. Implement one, and wait to see if it's followed. Otherwise,go FFA. A system sounds good, but FFA has it's advantages aswell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubiasschmias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bias Schmias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/00 8:59:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BOTS and Fear</span><hr size=1> Well by all accounts i'm hearing (all 3rd hand, and taken witha grain of salt), the calendar system as it currently standsis dead.<br><br>Bots went into fear tonight and allegedly trainedthe guild who was on the calendar in their attempts to get atthe epic mobs.<br><br>So it remains to be seen after tonight:can 1 guild declare FFA and force everyone to come along?<br><br>I'm very sad about this.<br><br>Bias Schmias<br>48thWarrior<br>Glossolalia <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udoomvortexx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>doomvortexx</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/dreamersoflightpictures/dolreals.jpg width=20 height=25 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/00 9:09:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/dreamersoflightpictures/dolsmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BOTS and Fear</span><hr size=1> BoTs and CIW are bolth going FFA in the planes, and so are we.<br><br>By the way BoTs.. this is no rant, but next time youcall US fear farmers, why dont ya look at the reflection in themirror.

Trains occur quite often in PoF, and mobility through the zone can get quite disorienting.  There was ample communication on both side prior to it happening.  I don't think anyone on either side proclaimed it to be intentional or an act of blatant malice.  Rather, it was Alkiron acting on his jaded views of BotS.  Hopefully, Verant Customer Service will mature, and these occurrances will be no more.<br><br>Call it &quot;muscleing&quot; our way it, or whatever.  We did not, nor will we ever, make blatant violations of PnP.  We have stated this many times on multiple boards.

Usage of this as evidence to act against a guild is against CS policy as well. All these boards and other such forums do is paint an image of bias.

Would be interesting to know which BotS spoke to which BotB/LoM person and hammered out this agreement yes? Did the person BotS made this agreement with have the authority to make such an agreement?<br><br>If BotB or LoM folks knew BotS was going to zone in to assist them clear the Plane why did they not camp out? Pathing is notoriously awful in Fear and it is always safer to camp out to allow new folks in... even &quot;planes veterans&quot;.<br><br>Did BotS make the agreement with the Legands of Marr folks and LoM failed to inform BotB?<br><br>If so, why did LoM not speak up and correct BotB when Alkiron showed up?<br><br>Being in an alliance myself I know we are in constant communication during raids... all guilds know whats going on at all times... was it a simple communication breakdown?<br><br>If BotS was going in as a &quot;Big Brother&quot; the rules (such as they are) are clear that the BB can NOT loot anything but the epic quest items that may or may not drop... nothing else... to include no Draco loot, no planar armor and no &quot;regular&quot; items off gods. If BotS was truly there as a BB how did Rogfear get the impression that BotS was going to loot what they wanted and leave the rest for BotB and LoM to loot?<br><br>Or perhaps.... just perhaps... BotS motives were a little less than altruistic? Was BotS trying to force FFA on the Rathe? Or perhaps just snatch a few good loots and maybe an Epic Quest item to boot from guilds who arent &quot;uber&quot;? Did BotS think that the guilds in Fear would be grateful to follow them around like puppies picking up the scraps that were left for them?<br><br>I suppose we shall never really know what happened in Fear... but I DO know that Alkiron has a very low tolerance of any person or guild who think they have more &quot;rights&quot; to something than another person or guild does. He is not the usual GM the Rathe has had in the past... he investigates... thoroughly. Did you know that GMs have the ability to /snoop? Whats /snoop you ask? The ability to &quot;listen in&quot; on a conversation... how far this goes I'm not entirely sure... but I suspect Alkiron has far more information than we give him credit for. He will have to answer to his superiors on why BotS was disbanded and he damned well better have the proof to back it up... and guilds are NOT disbanded over a single incident... so it does make one wonder just how much info Alkiron has accumulated on BotS... or any guild for that matter.

I was not one of the ones negotiating the deal so I'm not sure of names here.  We had discussed it thoroughly over /gu *including* many /gu by officers stating to make sure that we were playing nice including instructions on what that meant.  We were to go in, help with clearing, and in return get quest items.  I personally talked to someone named Xedd in LoM when the supposed intentional training happened.  He informed me that he was the one that requested GM presence and that he understood that the train was not intentional and was in /tells with Alkiron telling him that they did not believe the train to be intentional (which it wasn't).  Meanwhile, I told him that we were getting a crew in to rez everyone involved.<br><br>We *were* following the PnP.  We made *sure* that everyone going into the fear also knew that we were there to cooperate.  Unfortunately on zone in to fear, the groups were jumped by a bunch of mobs and things went very awry.  Both sides were telling Alkiron that the train was not intentional and that we had worked out an agreement on sharing the plane.  Alkiron very specifically stated in our /gu that he chose to not listen to those arguments and was following a path of his own chosing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udariuss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dariuss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/17/00 6:50:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BOTS and Fear</span><hr size=1> I was in tells with friends in LOM before servers went down and after they came up and you trained them.

I know many people in Bloodline of the Bear quite well.  When I logged on last night at like 9:30 pm PST talks were going on in /gu that we might be going to Fear.  From all of the /gu, Bloodline and BoTS had worked out a deal where we come in and help them clear, all loot goes to Bloodline, except epic quest pieces and 2 items off CT &amp; Dracho if they drop (BCG and CRoA if they DID drop).  The rest of all CT &amp; Dracho loot goes to Bloodline, including all loot all all the regular plane mobs.  To me in /gu, it did not sound at all like this was people being &quot;informed&quot; of anything.  The 2 guilds made an agreement which would help both guilds, since I remember discussion over whether or not a BCG would be included if we helped drop CT, although all other loot was.  I was not up in Fear at the time but was listening to /gu incase I was needed by Bloodline and BoTS to start the clearing.  Mind you, at this point it was probably 9:45pm PST and from what I understand, Fear was 90% populated, since the server had just come up.<br><br>Anyway, They were notified we were going to make our runs and supposedly said they were camping at ss. BoTS invised up and headed for west camp but got aggroed. Somehow an invite bard got ported by the scarelings right into ss and the train killed everyone.  Unfortunately it was assumed this was done on purpose, which it wasn't.  It defies logic to make a deal between 2 parties which you're coming to HELP and think something like that was intentional.  Believe me, the /gu was crazy pissed right after that this happened.<br><br>Although I wasn't there and wasn't involved, I can tell you that I positively know it wasn't intentional.  Also, if Rogfear was &quot;informed&quot; as he states above rather than worked out a legitamate deal, then that sucks too and I apologize, but I can tell you from the green /gu, it 100% looked like an agreement between 2 parties to work together.  If none of you can say you have never in your EQ life accidentally trained someone or brought back more mobs than was intended, goody for you.  But to act like THAT was intentional is lame, I guarantee it was not.<br><br>As far as Sunwolf goes, I've never heard or met you, that i can remember, so I doubt you know me, either.  However, it is pretty obvious you are misinformed and making assumptions about heresay.  Lastly, Sunwolf, you say that &quot;I'm sure there are many honest and respectful members of BoTs but the time you spent under that tag taints your own image.&quot;  Anyone that knows me knows my character and knows my reputation.  Anyone that wants to classify me by a tag without knowing me is not someone I would want to associate with anyway based on their beliefs.  To me, its rascism, judging someone entirely by the tag above their head and not by their history and actions.  You can make any comment you want, but your rascist attitude based exclusively on someone's tag makes you someone I would not even want to associate with, must less give any of your comments any weight in my eyes.  Anyone wanting to judge me based solely on the tag above my head is not someone's opinion I care about anyway.<br><br><br><br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Kelton Redmist, 59 Enchanter<BR>Cisken, 43 Gnome Rogue</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usunwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sunwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/17/00 7:39:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BOTS and Fear</span><hr size=1> LMOA, bring it on Lynch.<br><br>I trust the GM's word way more than I trust one coming from a BoTs member so I think I'll just continue feeling somewhat gleeful that you've gotten what your attitude so rightfully deserves.<br><br>There isn't anything that is uninformed in my post that differ's from other peoples posts here.
