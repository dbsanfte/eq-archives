<br>
Somehow in your mind, us killing Telkonar and Gozzrem validates the months of faction abuse SoT and BOTS engaged in and makes the lack of sharing acceptable.  Much like you like to spout how you didn't sign a contract to only kill mobs on X faction, no one in NB, KIC, or Tindi signed a contract that we were willing to have to farm faction to make up for all of our same faction kills.  However, between BOTS and SOT, Tindi and NB are left with two choices - stay in HoT 24/7 or stop taking it in the ass and start playing the faction abuse game.<br>
<br>
The day we killed Telk and Gozz was much like any day, SoT had killed Vindi and Statue, Zlandicar wasn't due for the next day (which SoT also killed), BOTS had killed Tormax, and I think RF had killed Velketor.  That left nothing for NB to do, since it was Tindi's turn for Dozekar.  So much like SoT and BOTS have been doing forever, one thing changed, we killed Telk and Gozz.  The reasoning behind Giant guilds killing Kael mobs, I might go into another post later on the Psychology of a Rathe Guildleader planning a week's raids, but for now will suffice it to say, that Giant guilds grab all the Kael mobs, knowing at the time that CoV guilds won't kill their own faction mobs (since faction for us is a pain in the ass).  However, our reasoning was clear, we weren't and aren't prepared to resign ourselves to the Limbo you and yours wish we would go off to.<br>
<br>
While we are now all playing on a more level playground because we are more willing to play the faction abuse game to prevent being denied high end content, and thus have taken a bite of the proverbial apple - don't forget that there is a biblical reason women got stuck with childbirth: they bit the apple first.  Don't try and paint the picture that NB's first slaying of Telk/Gozz somehow invalidates their complaint of the months and months of all +CoV mobs being farmed before those guilds could get to them, while the +Kromriff mobs were left standing till days 2-3 after a patch.<br>
<br>
If you wanna judge us for slaying off faction, it's you who will be the childbearer, not us.  To put it plainly Laz, you (meaning Giant guilds killing +CoV mobs) are more guilty than we are of abusing factions, and creating the conditions forcing us to decide between playing the game your way, or logging to twinks.<br>

<br>
But -<br>
<br>
Claiming rights to a mob simply because of faction is about as unfair as claiming rights to a mob because of the time zone you are in.  If you can kill it, and you want to kill it, then no one should be able to stop that, by this I mean some instigation of a faction rule or somethign.<br>
<br>
I cant help it that the best bp in the game comes off the statue of rz. Conversely, you cant help it that 4/5 of the ST key granting dragons are -CoV faction hits.<br>
<br>
Its the way the nut balls created it... and if you (or i) want to experience more than we are experiencing, then we will ride factions and ride back...<br>
<br>
If someone (guild) doesnt mind the mindless faction fixes (or in the case now with 90% of my guild - has absolutely no need of any faction) then really there is no moral issue here, concerning faction.<br>
<br>
Dozekar is a different matter, in my eyes at least - due to the fact that its so time intensive (tears and symbols).  The rewards from dozekar &lt; the time and conflicts created, for us anyway.  If no one on rathe way killing him, im sure we would be, but since 2 guilds are - we have decided to not interfeer with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best bet with mobs like king t and dain and statue are rots, imo. <p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#000000">

You have every right to kill any mob in the game you want, and it wasn't a negative comment in any way.  I said it because of the tons of whining and bitching done by NB when we went to kill Dozekar.  Dozekar is NOT your mob, and there is no reason to try to lag us out by chain casting in our camp, or by spamming us, or by training us.  I don't judge you one bit for killing Telk/Gozz, or any other mob on dragon faction.  <br>
<br>
&quot;we weren't and aren't prepared to resign ourselves to the Limbo you and yours wish we would go off to.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's fine..don't kill off your faction if you don't want.  However, don't expect us to do the same as well.  As it is now, we don't really have a certain faction we claim to.  Some are on dragon, some on giant, some on dwarf..for various quest reasons.<br>
<br>
&quot;we are more willing to play the faction abuse game to prevent being denied high end content&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, I didn't assign NB to dragon faction, and it's not my fault you picked it.  If you like dragon faction, great.  But don't act like you deserve for us to stay on only giant faction, because you don't have anything else to kill.  If you don't have anything to kill, perhaps you're on the wrong faction.  If you don't want to switch, which is understandable, fine.  But you can't expect us to stay solely on giant faction because the dragon faction guilds have nothing to kill.<br>

Tindi and NB do not own Dozekar, we all know that.   But the problem *I* had with SoT trying to kill dozekar was this:  In order to complete ONE Dozekar quest, and a 1 tear quest, at that, A person(s) would have to Kill dozekar, who can drop 2-4 tears.  There are 10 tears, Silver being the most common.  The chances of a person getting the one tear for thier quest is low.  But say you got the tear you wanted on 2 kills.  thats 2 weeks right there.   NOW, you get to go deep into the halls of testing and kill named, to get the other 3 symbols.  8named mobs, 10 tears, 1 orb, 1 week spawn time.   Orb is common, and again, the chances of the person getting the 3 symbols needed is low.   <br>
<br>
IF you were extreemly lucky, you could finish 1 dozekar quest <br>
in 2 weeks.   So think if you were in TL or NB.   You are in a guild of 70+ active members, all working on a dozekar quest.  knowing that 1 dozekar kill brings 2-4 people 1 step closer to finishing a great quest.  Then a giant guild comes in, a guild that can kill in ToV-N for items similar/better than dozekar quests.  a guild that can walk right up to vindi's door and kill him, then statue, then walk to tormax and wax him, and walk away, with ease.   It just wasn't fair to us, and lot of us got pissed.   <br>
<br>
Your right, though, we all picked our factions, and that doesn't mean we have to stop killing certian mobs.   But common curtosy would be to leave dozekar as the exception.   Of corse, no giant guilds made any attempts on dozekar after the last one, so it doesn't seem to be a problem anymore, but i wanted to post *MY* thoughts on the subject. <p><CENTER>

We even drew up tables for Quests and people signed up before hand for the items they wanted. We also knew that VI messed around with Doz a few times adjusting the tear drop ratio, before he was killed on The Rathe he could drop upto 8 Tears (LoS was one of few people killing him) then they changed him to dropping just 2 tears, then they adjusted his tears to what we have today, any number between 2 and 4. Before we killed Doz we killed the other HoT named many times (Who incidently only drop quest symbols / Orbs). In that time we gathered enough quest items to make 2 or 3 HoT Quest rewards ONLY if Doz dropped the tears.<br>
<br>
Since killing Doz we have completed what? 12 or so quests maybe?? Not sure on actual numbers but its not alot, we have put in months of work killing Doz and the named (Who are ALL on a 7day spawn btw) and as you can see the rewards are very drawn out. HoT stuff is comparable to NToV i would say, but theres alot of NTOV stuff that beats HoT gear.<br>
<br>
The main problem we have is knowing how hard it is to complete a Doz quest and how much effort it takes, and seeing an NToV capable guild walking over us in yet another zone to get what they want, when there is comparable and better stuff to be had elsewhere. Sure i didnt pick your faction for you, i dont make the rules, but atleast have the decency to ask for a rotation and not simply try to Take by force as thats going to piss off many many people. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Falconus<br>Knight of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16862">Profile</a><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udarkoak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 366<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/16/01 3:19:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lazreth</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

You have no proof that any of these actions took place, do you? You just _think_ they happened because you trained yourselves with +CoV mobs.

Looking at another post Karadin made, it's safe to say we don't give a damn. You killed tormax with 42 people, whoop dee frickin doo. Only 3 people died too? Wowee! I know I give a @#%$.<br>
<br>
The incident may have happened three months ago but this topic was brought up two days ago. So discussing it now seems like a viable idea doesn't it?<br>

<br>
The reason this is still being talked about is because you just proved my point.  You have ZERO clue as to what NB raids are like - you just look at us having 40-70 on a raid and assume we must be zerging.  As I said to Haxx and I will say to you - Main Tank tactics look and WORK identical whether you have 18 or 30 or 70.  And guess what, it means you are using TACTICS, not just zerging.  <br>
<br>
Your bullshit elitist attitude and others like it is what I take exception to.  You guys can kill Tormax with 42 and only 3 deaths - great, be proud of your accomplishment, but don't belittle us.  You don't know what how we do most raids, and the times you do watch us at Vindi and Statue - you ignore the blatant use of Main Tank tactics since it doesn't fit with your convenient picture of NB as Zergs.  It's bullshit, it's childish, and it's incorrect.  Now cut it out.<br>

Yes, plenty of your members do it, enough that I would say it's the majority and as long as they do, your guild will earn the animosity of people who don't deserve the bullshit most of your members spew towards us. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>
