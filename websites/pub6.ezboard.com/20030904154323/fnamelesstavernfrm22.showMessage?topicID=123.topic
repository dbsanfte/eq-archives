Pestilence Fire<br>
By R. G. Faulkner<br>
<br>
The ground shuddered like an old woman warding off the chill of a winter morning, and then all was still.  Not a sound could be heard; not the wind that slowly rustled the leaves of the great stand of Birch trees that lie just yards beyond the great crater that suddenly appeared.  Nor the birds that chirped only moments before from within them.  The trees were smoldering and leafless; stripped and singed by a great blast.  Nothing stirred or moved except for a young man that lay on his stomach inside the immense bowl.  His arms flailed and his hands fought loose, blackened dirt for handholds as he struggled to drag himself to the top.  Suddenly, as he reached the very crest, he stopped moving.   He hung there just on the periphery, motionless.  He appeared dead.  <br>
<br>
“Dureck!”  The scream cut through the silence. “Dureck!”<br>
<br>
Leana ran up and reached down to him, placing a hand on each shoulder.  She began to tug franticly, fighting desperately with his weight to pull him up and out of the pit.  With each tug, the dirt released great wafts of sulfur and pitch that flooded her nostrils with an urgent need to sneeze and turn away.  She resisted the urge and fought desperately to maintain a foothold while struggling with the dead weight that was her closest friend. “Why do you have to be so heavy?”  Finally, she got him up over the crown and rolled him onto his back.  She was met by a broad smile on an ashen, black face.  He did not move and his open eyes seemed to stare far away into the nothingness of the beyond.  <br>
<br>
Her gasp was filled with panic and horror.  “Oh dear Maker.  Oh lord.”  She reached into her pack and quickly found a cloth.  Drenching it with water, she began to delicately wipe away the ash and soot that painted him.  With each wipe she exposed pink, bubbled skin.  Her hand began to shake uncontrollably as each touch sparked fear in her cleansing strokes.  “You stubborn mule.”  She cried, unable to control the emotion of seeing him in this state.  “Blasted fool, look at you.  We told you, didn’t we?  But you had to try, didn’t you?  You couldn’t listen to us.  Now…” she hesitated and closed her eyes.  “Now look at you.”  She slammed her hand into his chest and then pulled him up into her arms and began to sob.<br>
  <br>
“Why must you always be so dramatic?” Leana heard the voice come strolling from beyond the trees towards her.  It was emotionless and carefree, as if it had not heard or seen the giant explosion or the great column of fire that had flung itself to the heavens.  Almost as if it was unable to see now the cavernous depression it approached or smell the suffocating stench of burnt soil that permeated the air.  Leana felt herself flush with anger.<br>
<br>
“Get over here and help me, demon wraith.”  She could not hide her emotions.<br>
<br>
“Is he alive?”  His words were full of unconcern.<br>
<br>
“You’re the healer.  You tell me.  Is this the face of someone alive?”<br>
<br>
She watched Marthis bend down and check him closely.  His pale hand touched the hot, pink skin and pulled back quickly as if pricked by a thorn.  He let his hand get a little closer and then slowly traced the outline of Dureck’s face and worked toward his chest, hovering there as if it was searching for some sign.  She looked up at Marthis’ eyes seeking desperately for confirmation of her greatest fear.  They were closed.<br>
<br>
He sighed.<br>
<br>
She choked.  “Is he alive?”  She stood and turned away needing to hide her emotions from Marthis.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” he said.  “Do you know the jukingail plant?”  <br>
<br>
She turned back around. “The red leaved bush with the pinkish berries?”<br>
<br>
“Yes.  Gather me two handfuls of the berries.  I’ll make a salve.  Look at his hands.”  <br>
<br>
She looked down to see the backsides of his hands were completely filled with the blistering of burnt flesh.  Taking them in her own, she gasped as she turned them over and saw the black flesh that was his palms; charred and cracked exposing whitish-pink flesh underneath what used to be skin.  Her eyes filled with horror.<br>
<br>
“Oh lord, his hands are ruined.  How will he”<br>
<br>
“Go get the jukingail.  Hurry.  We have little time.”<br>
<br>
#<br>
<br>
Dureck opened his eyes.  <br>
<br>
“Where am I,” he said.  Dureck’s eyes were filled with the images of a white cloud.   He closed his eyes and opened them.  Again, it was the same haunting white world of nothing.  A hand grasped his arm and pulled it back just before he could reach up to rub his eyes.  Working his eyes back and forth in the cloud, he could find no images, not even a blurry figure.  He tried to get up.  The hand pushed him back down.<br>
<br>
“Shh, save your strength.”<br>
<br>
Then he remembered and knew what the white cloud was.  “Leana?  Leana!  Dear lords, I can’t see.  Leana where are you?”    He reached out frantically trying to feel her in the white world.<br>
<br>
“I said be quiet.”  Her hand touched him gingerly on his chest keeping him down on the soft bedding.  “You’ve been hurt.  We have been at it for days trying to heal you.  We were afraid you were…” Leana’s words were filled with agony.  “Marthis is resting.  Soon as he wakes I will have him look at you.”  The bed shifted and creaked as she leaned over and kissed him on his forehead.<br>
<br>
“I can’t see.  Lord’s Maker I can’t see.”<br>
<br>
“Your sight will return,” she said.  Her voice was just a whisper.  He could feel her warm breath right next to his ear.  Hints of vanilla filled his nose as her hair brushed up against his face.  Never before did she smell this way, and nothing before smelled purer or sweeter.  He imagined her impish smile as she whispered into his ear.  Somehow it calmed him.<br>
<br>
“Where am I?”  He felt her hand come to his own, and he suddenly realized it was bandaged.  He felt the other, which was also bandaged.  <br>
<br>
“Dlislendoor.”<br>
<br>
“Back in Dlislendoor?  Why!”  He struggled with the realization.  He was back where he started and once again far from Kelnfarl and the Moord.   But why?  Dureck fought with all his might to sit up, but his strength was sapped and the hand pushed a little firmer holding him down.<br>
<br>
“I said save your strength.”  Dureck knew she meant it.  Her snapped orders always cut like a filet knife when she was angry.<br>
<br>
“Why?  Why come all this way back?  We have to stop Vendimack.  It’s almost solstice.”  Dureck felt a tugging from inside him.  Something snatched away his last bit of remaining strength.  Within seconds his white world faded to black and he was fast asleep.<br>

<br>
“There will be time for that later.  Now he must rest.  That’s all that matters if he’s to recover.”  Leana watched Marthis stand and shuffle his clothes.  “How long was I asleep?” he said.<br>
<br>
“Most of the day.  It’s near supper.”<br>
<br>
Marthis frowned.  “Why did you not wake me when I asked?”<br>
<br>
“You’ll do him no good if you’re not rested.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll do him less good if he’s dead.”<br>
<br>
“Dureck is strong.  Already he recovers.  It’s the way of Martwood men.  But he needs your skills Marthis and because of that I let you sleep.  You’ll do him better, rested.”  She watched Marthis fume.  Leana rarely won their arguments and disagreements.  She despised the foul man’s interference: always with an opinion, always meddling, always filling his head with words of adventure and glory, and always putting Dureck in the path of danger.<br>
<br>
“Woman, I know what is best.  From now on” <br>
<br>
In a flash of surprising speed, Leana pulled a knife and quickly brought it up to Marthis’ throat.<br>
<br>
“Demon wraith, I have a little secret that I think it’s time you understood.”  Leana leaned in closer as she moved to his side.  “You do not command me.  And not Vendimack himself can stop me where Dureck is concerned.  Never forget that.  What I do only concerns him.  Your influence over Dureck has led him to this.  For that I hold you personally responsible.”  She walked behind him.  The dagger never faltered as she moved.  It hung there at the edge of this throat.  She knew with one flick of her wrist it would slice through his artery and he would die in minutes unable to do anything to stop the act.  She wished he would try to move.<br>
<br>
“Leana…”<br>
<br>
“I would watch my tongue, wraith.  Dureck is my charge and my only friend.  You will fix what you have done to him, and you will see that soon he is as healthy as the day we walked out of here three weeks ago.  You got him into this.  I am going to get him out.  But first, I regret, I need you.  You’ll fix the mess you’ve made and then you’ll leave.  If anything happens to Dureck that upsets me, you’ll find yourself lying in a puddle of black wraith blood.”  <br>
<br>
Marthis started to say something.  She could see he was tensing up, the anger getting to him.  Before he could speak she leaned in closer so that only he could hear her next words.  Her mouth was just inches from his ear.  “If you ever know one thing, know this demon wraith; Makfadi do not play games.”  She felt Marthis gulp.<br>
<br>
“I must see to him,” was all he said.<br>
<br>
She let the dagger drop away and watched as Marthis rubbed at his throat as he walked over to Dureck’s bedside.  He never took an eye off her.  She could live with that.<br>
<br>
“Could he see?”<br>
<br>
“No,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I was afraid of that.  Well, time will heal the blindness.  The affradin never lasts.”<br>
<br>
“And how would you know about the Affradin?  Seen it before have we?  How many other men have you seen blinded, demon wraith?  How many suffered so that you could discover the magic of that cursed metal?”  She was getting angry again: his tone and mannerism were insulting, as if everything was simple and calculating.  He played to easily with other’s lives.<br>
<br>
“Leana, perhaps you should get some rest.  I’ve a lot to do and you are exhausted.”  She knew he was only trying to get rid of her.  But he was right.  The exhaustion of the past week’s ordeal was catching up with her.  As much as she mistrusted him, she had watched him work for two days nonstop to save him.  He had used his magic and his skill, and Dureck had improved.  Marthis drained himself in those two day, to the point that she had been forced to carry his sleeping shell into the bed after he had collapsed.  For some reason, she knew he wished Dureck no harm.  At least not now.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be in my room.  Wake me if he comes to or if anything changes.”  She started for the door.<br>
<br>
“Leana, there is something else.  Something you should know.  Something that I think would be of interest to your health.”  She turned to see him smiling at her with that look of indifferent arrogance.  She felt her blood go cold as a flash of light went off in the room.  She could not move her arms.  She could not speak.<br>
<br>
Marthis walked over next to her and leaned into her so that only she could hear his words.  “Raise one of your tainted daggers again to my throat and I will see that your arm is ripped from your body before you get it halfway.  Vendimack is my only concern, and Dureck.  Interfere with that, and you’ll find yourself next to all your Makfadi sisters, rotting in hell.”  Leana looked at his eyes.  They were red with hatred.<br>
<br>
She gulped.<br>
<br>

<br>
“How can you tell?” Leana said.<br>
<br>
“Look at the clouds.  They’re bunching up and getting darker.”  Leana watched Dureck as he studied the heavens.  His horse shuffled as he leaned forward in the saddle and stretched his face skyward.  “It’s an odd time of the summer to be getting this much rain.  I bet no one can remember back when it has rained this much.”<br>
<br>
“An omen,” she said.<br>
<br>
Dureck looked straight ahead for a moment.  He appeared lost in contemplation.  Soon, he turned to face her.  His face was pale and drawn.  Just weeks before he had been full of vigor and vitality.  But the color and life appeared now to be draining from him, as if each day sucked a little more marrow from his already hollow bones.  He was frowning.  “What’s an omen?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“The rain.”  She put a boot into the side of her horse and nudged it ahead of Dureck’s gelding.  She watched the ground, studying for any sign or tracks.  A steady rain began to fall.  No lightning or thunder announced its arrival.  It just fell from the sky.<br>
<br>
“Leana, am I supposed to believe you are taken back by superstition?” he said as he rode behind her.<br>
<br>
She suddenly stopped and wheeled her small, black mare towards him.  With a tug on his reigns he stopped his horse.  Surprise was clearly in his eyes.  She knew he saw the fury in hers.  She was tired of his immature nature.  She was tired of his unyielding ways.  She was tired of his steadfast commitment.  All of it, she knew would lead to one thing; his death.  “Dureck, think.  It’s rained every day since we left Dlislendoor.  Every day.  All day.  There is no sign of Marthis.  No tracks to follow.  No clues, fires, embers; not even a gnawed bone.  It’s as if no one has been here in seasons.  The rain washes it all away.  Everything.  You.  Me.  All of it!”  <br>
<br>
The frustration was getting to her, and she was tired.  Tired of sleeping in wet camps without a fire where nothing would burn.  And Leana was tired of eating cold, dry, tasteless food; almost spoiled bread and lumps of old, dry cheese.  The pieces of overly salted and poorly spiced dried meat Dureck had bought just before leaving were now treats of decadence.  As bad as they tasted, at least they had flavor.<br>
<br>
“Blast woman,” was all he could say.  He dug a heel into the side of his horse and it leaped into a gallop.  She saw the guilt in his eyes as he rode past her.  Not quite sure what to think, she watched as he trotted down the path.  Then she heard a cry of pain.  She spun around and went after him.  Up ahead, she came around a bend to find him standing along the side of his horse doubled over.  He coughed and coughed.  Quickly she dropped down and ran to his side.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?”<br>
<br>
“I dunno.  I just all of a sudden got this pain that shot up my spine.  It’s like someone is ripping my insides out through my back.”  Dureck looked up at her.  His face was marred in agony and red as a winter beet.  She reached down and took his bandaged hand.  It was shaking.<br>
<br>
Leana looked at the clearing they were in.  A few large boulders were stacked against a cliff wall that formed the base of the canyon in which they rode.  Several of the odd shaped boulders had fallen in such a manner that they provided a nice shelter against the wind and unending rain.  She looked further along the path in both directions, searching for signs of past floods.  <br>
<br>
“We camp here.  This is higher ground.  We should be fine for a while.  You get some rest,” she said.  Leana took his reigns from his other hand and led both of their loyal beasts over to a small clump of nettle pines that were growing defiantly in the poor, rocky soil.  She laid the reigns over a few of the branches.<br>
<br>
“Len, I just need… a few minutes to… let… this clear.”  His voice was filled with several shallow gasps.  To Leana it was obvious; they would go no further today.  The pain was so excruciating that Dureck fought to breathe between his words.  Marthis and even Vendimack would have to wait.<br>
 <br>
“You need to eat and get some sleep.  And so do I.”  She walked over and put an arm around him and helped him stand.  Supporting most of his weight, she guided him to the recess made by the rocks.  He nodded as she helped him sit on the ground, and then she watched as he continued down until he was lying almost in a fetal position clutching his knees. <br>
<br>
He jerked tense.  “Unnhh.  Lords… what… is this?” he cried.  His face was contorting in peculiar manners.<br>
<br>
“Marthis said that you might have side effects from the magic he used.  Could this pain be that?” She leaned down and rubbed his back.<br>
<br>
“I think… Marthis would… have… told me about this.”  Suddenly, Dureck let out a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
“Pain gone?”<br>
<br>
He nodded.  “It comes and goes.”<br>
<br>
“That demon Marthis, if he was here I’d skin him.”  She practically cursed his name when she said it.  <br>
<br>
Dureck looked up at her and shook his head.  “Why must you always despise him, Len?  He’s done nothing but help.  He’s done the Martwood proud.”<br>
<br>
“Proud?  Proud you say?  He’s done no such thing.  Except…” she paused, fighting back the rage.  “Except, he’s cursed you.  That so-called weapon almost killed you.  He’s told you more than once you will die.  He’s almost gotten us killed more time than I care to count.  And now he has left us alone with vague instructions on where we may find him.  We are stuck in the middle of this forsaken land being chased by water droplets, and we are lost.  This is that demon Marthis’ fault, and one day I’ll make him pay.  For all he has done to you, and for all he has done to me.  But mostly for what he is costing the Martwood.”<br>
<br>
Dureck was standing.  “Costing the Martwood?  Blasted woman, you sure paint a horrid picture.  What’s he done to the Martwood?”<br>
<br>
“He will cost them you,” she poked a finger into his chest.  “You.”  She stared directly into his eyes.  “You’re Martwood.  And you’re the type of stubborn Martwood that will die for a cause.  And what good will that death bring?  What purpose will it serve?  Nothing.  The Martwood has already lost its finest craftsman.  Must it lose that citizen’s life?”  She was in tears but it had to be said.  Dureck needed to hear the words.<br>
<br>
He was looking at his bandaged hands.  They were ruined.  Burned and scarred masses of wrecked flesh lay underneath those oozing bandages.  Yet still, Dureck pressed on and Leana followed him.  Sworn to protect him, she spent every waking hour at his side seeing to his safety and well-being.  Now she was standing in front a shell of the man that once was.<br>
<br>
She watched the fire churn inside Dureck.  Through the raindrops that speckled his face she saw for the first time tears.  He held his hands ups in front of him palms outward as if pushing on an invisible wall standing in front of them.  <br>
<br>
“These hands.  These ruined hands are all that stands between Vendimack and Kaleen.”  The rain started to come down harder.  Streamers of water ran down his face looking like tiny, exposed veins.  <br>
<br>
“You’ve forsaken your blood talent and doomed your soul.”  She moved in closer to him trying to get further into the recess to avoid the downpour.<br>
<br>
“What does it matter if I can meld stone and sand and glass, if my heart is shattered?  What do I care for my soul if it is already lost?  Kaleen is all I have now, and my sister will not be served up as some appetizer for a vanquishing lich.”<br>
<br>
“All you have?  How selfish must you be if you think that is all you have?  You had a gift.  You threw it away.  You’ve got a sister.  But soon you will throw her memory away as well.  You’re wasting all there is of tradition and endangering the Martwood because of stupid selfishness and pride.  You’re throwing it all away.”<br>
<br>
“How dare you call me selfish.  I do this out of love.  Out of love for Kaleen and my people.  I do this for them.  I give all that I am for them.”<br>
<br>
She fell to her knees sobbing.  The rain was a driving wall of water now.  She could barely see him standing just feet in front of her, and she could barely hear her own crying.  Minutes passed as they both sat in the silence of emotions drowned out by the unrelenting waves of water.<br>
 <br>
Dureck broke the silence.  “Len, why are you here with me?”  It was the question she hoped to avoid.  But she knew she could not evade the answer if she wanted to save him.<br>
<br>
Leana turned her eyes up to meet his.  For a brief moment she saw the man she remembered that first day in the Martwood.  Strong and confident; bronzed from endless hours outdoors, even his hair showed the paints of the sun.  He was standing next a the large stone of rock singing to it.  Later he had told her the only way a rock would give up its secrets was if it was sung to.  Apparently, this rock was being stubborn, because she startled him when she walked from the other side.  But something else happened, something wonderous.  He never spoke.  Instead he seemed to reach into another place, another world, and find some drive and determination.  He began to shape the large stone, to remove from it the intricate pattern only it could hide.  It took hours, yet he so entranced her with his motions, and the perfection of his crafting talent that she did not notice the form that was appearing or the time that passed.  Her eyes never left him. She was under some spell; his grace, strength, charm, all of his power poured from within him as he worked.  It was mesmerizing.  Stirring, finally after what seemed a few minutes, she realized he was looking at her with a puzzling boyish grin.  Embarrassed, she looked away to the stone and realized it was a perfect likeness of her.  At that very moment, she felt love, for the first time in her life.<br>
<br>
“I’m your friend and I am sworn to protect you.”  She tried hard to avoid the answer.<br>
<br>
“Yes, but why?”<br>
<br>
Leana closed her eyes.  It was time.  “You already know.”<br>
<br>
“Know what?”<br>
<br>
“The Embakek sent me to protect you.  I am sworn to keep you alive.”<br>
<br>
“Len, but why have you stayed?  Why are you here with me?”  He held his hands up.  “The Embakek has lost the talent they so foolishly coveted.  So why are you here now?  I am most certainly not a concern for the old fools now.”<br>
<br>
“Because, I am sworn,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Sworn to an oath given before 5 old men fat from eating too much bread and living on the dreams of others?  No Len, that is not a reason.  Why woman are you still here?  Your duty surely must be done.”<br>
<br>
Leana turned away from the fiery eyes that stared right through her.  Could she tell him?  “Dureck don’t make me”<br>
<br>
“I compel nothing.  You and Marthis have led me down this path for way too long.  Why are you here now?  What gain could you possibly find?  What payment awaits you if we succeed?”  He was boiling over.  Through the rain, his yelling assured her that he was frustrated; with her, with Marthis, with the world.<br>
<br>
She turned her back to him. “I love you,” she said.<br>
<br>
Dureck grabbed her by the shoulders and spun her around.  “What?” he asked.  Startled, she looked up into his eyes.  They were tired.  “What?”  He was yelling louder than she had ever seen before.  It frightened her.  “Speak up woman.”<br>
<br>
Leana pushed Dureck back against the rocky cliff wall.  “I said, I love you.  Did you hear that?”    I crave all that you are.  I wish to spend my last breath in your arms.”  The words rushed out faster than even she imagined they could be said.  His mouth was wide open with confusion and shock.<br>
<br>
Dureck stood there in front of her, lost in thought.  His expressions changed a hundred times.  First shock, then awe, then a smile, then anger, and then wonder.  It was the gamut of facial expression and Leana wished she could capture them all in stone.  Then suddenly he collapsed to his knees; shaking uncontrollably.  <br>
<br>
“Dureck!?” Leana said.  She fell down next to him and pulled him into her arms.  Rocking back and forth, doing all that was possible to ease the hurting, she felt time and again him shudder as the spasms of agony ripped through him.  “Oh Lord Maker, end this.  Please end this.”<br>
<br>
A tear was in his eyes again.  And sadness.  He looked away and then looked back.  He reached over and took one of her hands into his own.  She felt the heat of dieing flesh through the bandages and the sudden squeeze as another wave raced through him.  “I…” His voice faltered.  “I love… you…  but...”  He passed out.<br>
