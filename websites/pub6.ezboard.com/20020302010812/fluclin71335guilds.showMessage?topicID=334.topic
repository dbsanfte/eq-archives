There's a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of committment involved, and it is (for the most part) a thankless job as well.  <br><br>It's very difficult for a guild leader to balance their fun and:<br>1.  make sure that their guild members all have fun<br>2.  make sure all their guild members behave appropriately (however is appropriate in your particular circumstances), <br>3.  maintain some kind of server relations<br>4.  take care of the constant barrage of questions, comments, complaints, etc. that plague most guild leaders.<br><br>Some guild leaders don't do these things.  In my opinion, that makes for a poor guild (one that is doomed to fail, or has a poor reputation).<br><br>Some guild leaders <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> have</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done these things and are now burned out and no longer having fun.  So things start to slide a little bit, or they finally get fed up and resign/quit/leave.<br><br>As a guild leader of what started as a low level (friends only) type guild, I can tell you that it's been a difficult road these last 2 years on the Luclin server.<br><br>The struggle to keep our members and keep them happy was a difficult one.  We lost a couple high level people earlier this year when they surpassed the rest of us in levels.  Within 3 months, they were back.  The guild they joined was great.  One of my favorite guilds, in fact.  But it's a large guild, and there truly is a difference between a large guild and a small one.<br><br>Nemesys will never be a large guild.  We currently have about 25 members (15 of which are +50).  We rely on strong alliances and friendship to accomplish our goals in the game (several of us will be weilding epics by month's end).  You do not have to be in an Uber guild to enjoy the game or get what you're looking for.<br><br>I think the key is to make sure that your propective new members KNOW what your guild is about.<br><br>1.  Don't try and &quot;sell&quot; the guild in the hopes of recruiting more people.  <br>2.  Don't take just anyone who's interested for the sake of more numbers.<br>3.  Communicate regularly, and do fun stuff.  Whatever it is that your guild finds fun.  Do a lot of it.<br>4.  Relax a little and remember that no matter how complicated it gets, you pay money for this game to have FUN, not stress out.<br>5.  Don't jump to start a new guild.  Look around at what's already out there.  I find it really difficult to believe that people can't find what they're looking for.  If you have to sit in the EC tunnel and offer money or officer positions for people to join your guild, you have no business running one.<br><br>Sorry, I know I rambled here...

MANY people find that moving on to an established powerful guild once they have leveled up to be preferable to helping the small guild become established. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. I can't say I haven't been tempted myself, or that I won't be in the future. Building is hard. Joining something that's already built is easy, and shows immediate returns. However, I think that the long-term satisfaction and the limitless returns from building will ultimately be more than worth it. The hardest part is finding enough other players who will stick it out with you. You never really know who they will be, either.<br><br>Another hard part is dealing with those who do leave. Getting angry or upset about it does nothing for you or your struggling guild. You just have to learn that the majority (probably the vast majority) of players are NOT going to be willing to stick it out while the building is happening. My policy is to just let them go, forget about them, and keep working on building. I believe that once we get there, the sense of accomplishment and pride will be absolutely overwhelming, and that we will have an extremely solid guild, capable of damn near anything. <p>Geneze Angelfyre <BR>Cleric of Tunare of 48 seasons<BR><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine_eq@hotmail.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> (deceased)<BR><IMG SRC="http://cuchulaine.homestead.com/files/VLdragon.jpg"><BR>Luclin<BR><BR>"It's not paranoia if they really ARE out to get me..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umyopia2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myopia2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Will O Wisp</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/19/01 5:27:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Degredation</span><hr size=1> another trick to surviving and being successful, is to surround yourself with capable people, and learn to DELEGATE.<br><br>Sierraa has been smart that way.  knowing that people will quit eq eventually,  she brings up the promising people and keeps moving roles and responsibilities.  this has kept Vets with able officers and leaders for a long time now.<br><br>A guild is a product of everyone that is in it, and participates. <p><b>Anng Fenriss</b><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/veterans_legion/" target="_blank"><img src="http://scionevet.homestead.com/files/annglogo.jpg" border="0"></a><i>~ Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.

You will find with smaller guilds that as people get higher in levels they drift away.  With some it is because their focus in the game changes, others require an 'uber guild' to complete the 'end game', others simply lose interest with the game.<br><br>I think one of the things that has saved Valor's Companions, being a very small guild, is that we have a core of about ten irl friends who play together. We also have others who play not so much because of the game but because of the company.<br><br>For a small guild to succeed it must be a home for the members. Small guilds will not get you your epic or your 60th level. You'll have to find another guild to join or tag along with. However, a small guild can offer you a comfortable home and a group of friends to drink tea with and chat.

Everything has its pros and cons, there are no absolutes. <p><A HREF="http://www.luclin.com/wcod/"><IMGsrc="http://users.csionline.net/~dellski/WAR/lath_sig.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="68" border="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujeanpaulsteeldancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JeanpaulSteeldancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/4/01 7:09:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Degredation</span><hr size=1> From my experience in Titans, to build a guild requires three traits: strong GL,  loads of Patience and goals.<br><br>The first two are self-explanatory, the third is the one that most smaller guilds dont have from what I can tell.  When we had a chance in GL at the beginning of the year, we were small and losing high level members.  We decided that we wanted to the high level game to keep the higher levels we have and to have fun.  Now, we are getting there 11 months later.  We arent an &quot;uber&quot; guild but we are pushing to take the tougher mobs.<br><br>Smaller guilds, with strong alliances, can do the same.  There are certain advantages in being a smaller guild like socail interactions that are a bit more loose because members know each other better.<br><br>my 2cp<br><br>-JP<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvladimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vladimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/21/01 7:51:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Degredation</span><hr size=1> I know this sort of an old post, but I thought I could add some insight...and honestly I spotted an ex-officer of my guild posting here.<br><br>I am an officer in a &quot;growing&quot; guild.<br><br>I joined shortly before a major rift, the guild leader left and appointed a new leader to replace him.  MANY of the planable folks left with Slashin.  I would almost venture to say that all of them that were planable at the time have left except our leader, Kipani and Zuldrue.<br><br>However...we rebuilt.  We have a great core of players that I feel are very committed to the guild.  We have fun together...we help each other.  Some, like Solique, our only post 55...indeed, a 60 Chanter, continue to leave.<br><br>Are we angry that he has left?  Did it shake our guild up?  Yes and no.  To both.  It frustrates me to see us getting a dozen planable folks now, and more before the end of the year.  While the current planables were fighting in SolB and the Dreadlands...he was in Sebilis.  I am sure he is ready to try and slay a dragon now.  Cool.  Have fun.  I think you could have done that and stayed a Misfit...but we'll never know.  Did it shake me up?  Only in the sense that it makes me want to level that much faster so that our core of high level people can staunch the flow we have had.<br><br>Our guild carries on...we are still barshin strong, and we are having fun doing it.  We have a great set of officers, a large base of low to mid levels that we can guide and train...and as such, we are drawing some attention from others.  We are now able to recruit some higher level folks...great players, who know their roles and will help us be one the strongest guilds on Luclin.<br><br>I wish we had been able to provide something that others felt were lacking....but I am confident that a small guild can thrive, and weather hard times.<br><br>To those who have left...have fun in your new guilds...<br><br>To those that remain...HAVE FUN and KEEP BARSHIN!<br><br>Vladimp Paler<br>40 Tier'dal Necromancer<br>Still a Proud Officer of &quot;The Misfits of Carnage&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showPrevMessage?topicID=334.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showNextMessage?topicID=334.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.emailToFriend?topicID=334.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.threadControl?topicID=334.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=334.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=334.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335guilds>Guilds</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
