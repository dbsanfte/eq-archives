During the day, we had a rogue that politely asked if he could loot the book for his epic.  I said yes, and he did..he also let us know there were a LOT of poeple in hate.  We started our raid at 8pm EST, and there were 14 poeple already in the zone.  I do have a full list of names, however since the ones from LoL and Ellar Debluth didn't give us a hassle about ir..I won't bother to name them.  They were very professional and apologized, and left the zone.  However, Quaynast from Circle's end started to give an attitude and state that the new &quot;rule&quot; was that any mobs that spawn under 1/2 hour are not claimed.  1st..I know for a fact that hate is still a reserved plane..2nd that the mob respawn on everything in the entire zone is 1 hour.  However, the biggest problem we had was from Freedom Knights..of whom there were 6 in there.  They were going for the rogue book, had they asked they would have known it was not in there.  However, a certain guildy of their's (Pillo) decided to start berating us in OOC's, and even disbanded himself trying to make it look like he was unguilded (he got his flag back 20 minutes later).  These guilds should know the rules of the RTA, and teach their people if they do not know them.  However, when we are told that we are being petty, and a person tried to lie to us (I have all names/guilds written down as I was the first group to be ported in and did a who in the zone) this does not speak highly of your guild.  An officer was even there with him, who did apologize and said it had been a long time since they dealt with the planes on the RTA..which we can accept.  However, getting berated in OOC's and then the same person trying to make it look like he is unguilded is just wrong. <p>You go ahead of me, we let you die.<br>

The rules for Hate have changed, and you would do well to read those changes.  Second, the respawn rate for normal mobs is 20 minutes, not one hour.  Until your guild is there starting their raid, anyone is allowed to go up and xp in Hate.  Once you show up, the plane is yours until you leave, and you have the choice over who is/is not allowed to remain, if any.  However, no one did anything wrong merely by being in Hate before your raid started. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

:<br>
- AMENDED PLANE OF HATE: Reservation days protect the spawns of maestro, hand of the maestro and Innorruk for the 24 hours of the reservation date. The zone is able to be used by groups prior to the reserving guild entering the zone, at which time the zone *must* be vacated if the reserving guild does not want to allow people in the zone. Those groups in the zone before a reserving guild may *ONLY* kill mobs with a respawn time of 30 minutes or less, and specifically *MAY NOT* kill Maestro, The Hand of Maestro, or Innorruk. After the reserving guild leaves, the zone is again available for use. <br>
:<br>
<br>
<br>
It would appear the contention isn't so much that they were there, but perhaps that they refused to leave (were they asked?) and they were rude and sneaky.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure Dallow is aware of the change, but was hurt at the lack of respect they were shown, as a posting and reserved entity.<br>

That also means that the rogue book can be taken by anyone at anytime..so no need to reserve hate for that anymore either as it is not on a mob, and very easy to walk to alone.

Honestly then first the issue should be taken up with the guild responsible. If that is not to your satisfaction and they are an RTA guild on a rotation or planeable guild then there is a penalty for failure to remove themselves from the zone when asked. <br>
<br>

You really can't. Plane of Hate is yours from the time that your guild is in the zone starting the raid. Beforehand anyone can go on that day and do things as long as your guild isn't in the zone currently raiding. Although technically they aren't supposed to take Inny/Maestro however they can get the named which are 20 mins random respawns.<br>
<br>
Once your guild is in Hate and your raid is starting, the zone is yours. Anyone you don't want to be there, can be asked to leave and should leave. Failure to do so would be in violation of the current agreement. Once you leave they are welcome to come back in and exp and do whatever.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
He seems bothered that people were already in Hate when they got there, which is well within the new rules.  He comments that these people are there, and he knows &quot;for a fact Hate is still a reserved plane&quot;, as though when the rogue who went up for the book during the day went, there shouldn't be anyone in the plane.  He also has failed to read or realize that the only named protected under the new rule are Maestro, Inny, and Hand.  He also states, incorrectly, that every normal mob in the plane has a one hour respawn, which would make the new rule meaningless - since no mob has a less than 30 min respawn rate according to him.  If he is aware of the change, he has failed to read or understand it.  So, I'll reiterate, that Hate's rules have changed, and no one did anything wrong simply by being there when Dallow wasn't in the plane.<br>
<br>
That said, there was no reason for the people there to be rude or refuse to leave once Dallow did show up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dennin>Dennin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dallow Abligo - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/11/03 1:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=523.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reserved planes</span><hr size=1> Agreed, we did not know about the new rules..because honestly that means that hate shouldn't even be a reserved plane for 3 mobs. <p>You go ahead of me, we let you die.<br>
