<br>
Shortly before getting online, I checked the KGC board to find out that Nagafen was now up. So I headed online, and began making groups. We had considerably less people gathered than the previous night (about 45 or so), but it was enough to go ahead and try for Naggie. After a bit of gathering, I began sending folks into the dungeon, moving groups to certain strategic points, from the first bat room, to the nox areas, then to the stone spider room. About 2 hours into the raid, we'd made the stone spider room and were preparing to start taking down the fire giants. <br>
<br>
We began attacking the fire giants in waves, 3 groups at a time. At each fire giant point, we lost at least one person, as many were having trouble getting assist to work correctly. But soon enough, we'd made our way to the stair room outside King Trannix's throne room. We pulled Trannix and his compatriots down into this room and in a huge, confined melee, took down the king and all the rest of his guards with only a few casualties. The Polished Mithril Torque dropped and were quickly lottoed, though I'm afraid I didn't write down who won them. We moved into the throne room, and soon pulled Warlord Skarlon, who brought only one friend. Skarlon found himself without enough firepower to back him up, and quickly died, giving up his Mithril Greaves (I also didn't note who won these). After the throne room, we pulled clear to the drawbridge area, losing both our monk puller, Tyrin, and Belce in the process, but took them down, ressed our losses and scouted ahead. The way was clear past the drawbridge, all the way to the hallway outside the Dragon Mouth Antechamber (the buffing room before Nagafen's lair). We moved everyone to this area, 2  or 3 groups at a time so that we wouldn't have any falling into the lava. We prepared, then pulled the antechamber clear. Here is where we began to prepare, and lost a good bit of time. <br>
<br>
There were 2 fire giant warriors, 1 FG Wizard and the Magus Roykl, all spawned in Nagafen's lair with the dragon. We spent a good bit of time trying to figure out a way to pull the giants and magus without aggroing Nagafen. We had some courageous volunteers in the form of Augie and Yari, who offered to suicide run (with Divine Aura) into the lair to draw Nagafen's attention while our FD pullers pulled the other giants. Finally, we sent Tyrin and Leyrin (SK) into the lair to chain pull the giants, while a host of rangers, warriors and paladins armed with bows readied themselves in the dragon's mouth to rain arrows onto any giants that approached the landing. It worked, sort of, as we dragged the Magus, and 3 fire giants down into the antechamber with us. We quickly killed the Magus (who dropped the Polished Mithril Mask, which we'd lottoed beforehand, and was won by Junun), and another fire giant, while another escaped and the 4th was charmed. The last one had escaped back to Naggie's lair by gating, and Nagafen was pissed! He'd already tried to fear us as we attackd the Magus, and now began summoning members of the raid one at a time. As soon as I realized it, I called for the camp out, and headed to the chat room. We waited for a moment, then returned, after I got a list of those summoned. <br>
<br>
When we returned, we began to regroup and get the list of the dead. We had about 8 down, so I began to send our rogues, Dikek and Chanel in to retrieve corpses. We had 4 corpses that couldn't be gotten by rogue stealth, so I sent a necro to Neriak to gather 3 more coffins (as we only had 1 on hand). While we waited, our rogues informed me that only 1 fire giant remained, right by the door, so we repeated the excercise of chain FD pulling and bowmen firing to pull down the last giant. And down he went with a crash and an AAAAARRRRRGGGHHHH!!! This had however aggroed Nagafen on us again, and our FD pullers were stuck with Nagafen breathing his hot, stinky, sulfurous exhalations right on top of our monk, at the door outside the lair. I had us quickly camp out and come back in to clear the aggro and get him back in the lair. With that the buffing line began. <br>
<br>
Our buffing was much more efficient this time, with 7 buffers total, handled by Cassia and Nawty. Experience does tell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Buffing was done in about 45 minutes to an hour, which is not bad for people who've either only been through a buffing line once or not at all. Finally, in the chat room, Cassia told us we were ready, and in we went. Standing outside the chamber, I counted us down &quot;5...4...3...2...GO GO GO!&quot; and in I ran. The monster was immense, filling my vision and staring straight at me, this curious little blue-tattooed sword wielding berzerker rushing at him screaming incoherently. I ran to the back of the lair, choosing a particularly tasty section of his tail and struck hard. Nagafen laughed, then roared as many more warriors and paladins, shadowknights and rogues and rangers all rushed at him. His roar barely caused my heart to flutter until my body was encased in fire. I ran back to the healers trying to pat myself out, then gave the call for the nukers to move in. Healing was a slow process, as we were dangerously short of druids (5), clerics (3) and shamans (0). Once healed, I ran back in, and found Nagafen at the door. I continued to slash away at the dragon, until I was feared by his immense roar, running back into the hallway with the healers before regaining control of myself. I garnered another heal, then rushed back in again. The lair was almost empty, as many of our tanks were either dead or trying to get a heal. Nagafen's claws tore into me before his attention was grabbed by a caster, Nawty I think, who was quickly dispatched. Seeing no one near, and Nagafen in the doorway, raining fire and fear down on the healers in the hallway outside. Though my health was low, I stayed in the fight until his breath was unleashed again, when I lost conciousness and was returned to my bind point. <br>
<br>
Not long after running into the East Commons, I was told that we had succeeded and the celebration began! Nagafen had left behind in his lair: The Bladestopper, Orb of Tishan, Prayers of Life, Selo's Drum of the March, 2 runes of the astral and 2 halves of the Book of Scale. We began to lotto the loot, with Augie and Aronos each getting a half of the book of scale. Merithment won the Drum of the March, Balludar got the Bladestopper, Zefir the Orb of Tishan and my memory fails me on the Prayers.<br>
<br>
I'd like to discuss some problems we had on this raid. Discipline could use some work in the earlier parts of the raid, and especially when the main mob is dead. After Nagafen died, we quickly ressed the paladins (to lotto the Book of scale) and myself to help coordinate. Then the resses began in earnest. Not until we were all ressed could we begin the lottos. One of the clerics had to leave as soon as Nagafen was dead, leaving us with only Verius and Azuriem for resses. Verius got about 5 resses done before his ISP went to hell. At that point, to speed things up, I sent in Azuriem to res (who had a 39th level res only). This was working fine, until we had an offer from Halaster of the Shadowed Fates and Hammerfell (not sure the guild), both of whom had the cleric epic quest weapon (resses for no mana). They both offered to res the rest of us, as SF wanted to get to Ragefire to get another guildmate an epic weapon, but it was going to take time for them to get to us. People began to refuse to get lower level resses, slowing us up even more. Finally Verius returned, and Halaster and Hammerfell made it to us. Within 5 minutes we got together and did the lottos. <br>
<br>
First problem: When we're trying to get through with the raid, do the lottos and such, resses are the quickest and easiest way to do that. While we try to provide high level exp. resses when we can, we may not always be able to. Sometimes, in the interest of expediency, you may have to take a lower level res. Do not refuse a ressurection on these raids, ever. You're slowing other people up, you're causing discipline to break down, and if this were a weeknight raid, many people would either have to leave or be very draggy in the morning. The biggest complaint I've heard from people about these raids is that they take too long, so in the future, you take what res we have available, in the interest of making the raid less boring for others. <br>
<br>
Second problem: I received no less than 6 tells from 6 different people informing me that there were people on my raid who should not have been there. I'm speaking specifically of those people who are in alliances that already take down dragons or gods. It's really simple: If your guild is in ANY way, attacking either Vox or Nagafen, you are not allowed to go on dragon raids with any guild other than your own. This is not my rule, this is the rule of the Karana Guild Central, which is the body that promotes the scheduling and rotations. The CoG uses the KGC to schedule planes and dragon raids, so we must cooperate with their rules. So whether or not you go on them, if your guild goes on dragon raids in some way, you cannot go on Council of Guilds dragon raids. Any other CoG raid that is run, you are welcome on, and I'd love to have you.  But the dragon raids are out (as are God raids, which we will be going on soon). It does not help me to get these tells in the middle of the raid, while I'm trying to coordinate 45 people.  <br>
<br>
Other than these things, the raid was a great success. I want to thank Verius and Azuriem for doing great jobs of resses, as well as Halaster and Hammerfell. We also owe Darklips a debt of gratitude for using translocation to send many of our melees back to their bind point safely. I'd also like to thank Junun, Cassia, Lothax, Belce, Eressia, Dogedme, Nawty and Barbel for serving as my management body, as well as Larcen, Eressia, Atton, Azuriem, Aronos, Lothax, Barbel, Chanel, and Reyn for doing great jobs as group leaders.

<br>
Ohhhh boy, do I hate that giant. After getting Banished for the ohh what 6th time that night I ran back to the Camp to find Everyone gone. Well not everyone, There was a nice Friendly Fire Giant waiting for me. Seeing that some people where coming back I Grab the giant and soloed it for bit, see this wasn't working I had a cunning plan to run into naggies lair, get the giant way from the people coming back online, get it close to it's spawn point and get banish and live…. Well ahhh I never got banished. Ohhhh sure the only time I do want to get banish I don't. &lt;Grrr&gt; <br>
<br>
I do wish I could have been more help. I didn't think that when the Fire giants from Naggies lair saw me that I would get banished. I guess the Aggro radius want to the Dragon from the Giant. I did Get about 6 corpses pulled out of Naggies lair when you guys where fighting him, just in case the raid turned bad. I'm really happy it didn't. You all did a Great job and should pet yourselves on the back.<br>
