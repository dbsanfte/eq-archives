It is funny when French call Americans rude and obnoxious.  The only time an American was treated with anything other than arrogance and disdain [while in France] was when they were in France helping keep the native tongue French instead of German. <br>
<br>
It is also very humorous that two of their main Air Force (loosely used) aircrafts are the Mirage and Gazelle.  Very appropriate in name considering the Gazelle is at its fastest while fleeing and the Mirage...well hell...it isn't really there now is it?<br>
<br>
Of course the French have a right to their own opinion and to disagree with whoever they want.  They wouldn't had Hitler had his way.  But that's a different story, right?  Lafayette is their counter to that.  Fine.  Yes, the French came and aided us during that time.  Perhaps we should have been as late coming to their aide as they were to ours.<br>
<br>
French don't owe Americans anything.  However, France does owe the U.S. billions.  Want to start paying those war debts off?  Didn't think so.  If you did, you'd have to stop production on your newest military craft.....the WE-2 Retreat.<br>
<br>
Ah hell, just STFU and pay us in pastries you pansy!<br>

Do you not have any facts to base your belief on?  Why were you not against Clinton getting us involved in Bosnia?<br>
It's funny that all the countries voted on the resolution in '91, and yet are not willing to enforce it.  Iraq has had 12 years to disarm and still to this day has not done so.  France will veto anything that has a war as repercussions for Iraq not meeting deadlines.  So why have a deadline if your not going to do anything about it?<br>
I see people saying that Bush is only doing it for oil, well that is the CNN reasoning, why dont you listen to all sides instead of the Clinton News Network.  The oil will still be owned by Iraq which was stated by Bush.  Our oil comes from Many countries, and the amount is based on what OPEC decides to for Barrel exports.  So your oil theory is a little off.<br>
I heard someone actually say that Bush is doing it just to get re-elected.  If you remember correctly Bush senior was NOT re-elected when he attacked Iraq with the support of the international community.<br>
And for those who are blind, yes there are links between Hussein and Bin-Laden and other Terror networks.  They may not like each other supposedly, but links have been found.<br>
So in conclusion how many more years do you think we should wait and hope that he will voluntarily disarm?  You want to wait till the next 9-11 happens? or wait til he gets a long range missile that can reach this country and blows up the west coast?  <br>
If you your response is an uneducated STFU or Bush is a jerk, then don't waste your time typing, it just shows your ignorance and will probably just be ignored. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/14/03 11:33:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> The following is my opinion.  You are entitled to not agree just as I am entitled to express my opinion (at least here in the USA - maybe not in other parts of the world).<br>
<br>
&quot;leaders doesnt reflect the people opinion sir. look at what is happening in england.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are times when this should happen.  Elected officials are elected to deal with things that the populace doesn't have the time/knowledge to deal with.  The are also a buffer concerning certain situations where emotions/passions run too high for a democratic process to result in decisions consistent with the temperament of the constituancy.  An example of this:  a region of the US was historically anti-death penalty.  A crime was committed in that area that was really bad (murder/etc of a child).  The public outcry was to pass a law for a death penalty suddenly because of this crime.  The elected lawmakers thought that this was triggered by emotion and did not side with a death penalty proposition.  This brought them quite a bit of heat at the time, but after emotions calmed down, that area is back into their normal anti-death penalty stance.  Had passion and popular outcry ruled the way that the elected officials conducted their decision making, they would have voted in a measure that would have a) been contrary to what they were elected to represent, and b) then set the area into a mode as some point later trying to deal with repealing those laws.  Sometimes, cooler heads have to prevail.  Sometimes, people *do* know more than you do and need to do something that you may not like.<br>
<br>
Now, as to France.  They have the right to say/think what they want.  They are a sovereign body just like the USA.  They are not without their own motives, though.  I once attended a multi-session seminar given by a French socialogist targeted toward understanding how the French folks think and how to use this information to conduct successful business in France.  Basically, there were a lot of &quot;dos and don'ts&quot;.  One thing that was explained to us was that France was once the center for culture, power, wealth, and political power in the world.  At one time, all political documents between nations were written in French, even if you weren't in France.  Times have changed and France isn't the dominant political figure that they once were.  They have not forgotton their past status and are still bitter that they haven't retained that status (for whatever reasons).  I believe this is why France likes to use its veto power in the UN so liberally.  It puts them into the center of attention and it is some sort of power that they still wield.  This lets them feel important in the World Scene.<br>
<br>
In addition, don't forget that France and Iraq have had ties in the past.  Iraq bought nuclear reactor technology from France and France actually built at least one of the reactors in Iraq.  I would be interested to see how much of France's oil comes from Iraq.  If it is a large portion, then I would definitely see where France doesn't want the regime to chance because they fear some change in their deal and they probably do not want the USA to have any controlling say in their oil procurements.<br>
<br>
Now, as to the world.  At one time, there were nuclear powers who held the nuclear threat at bay by something called &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot;.  With this, the nuclear powers knew that they had to keep these stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction knowing that these weapons would/could never be used.  It was the possibility that kept everyone &quot;sane&quot; and their political arenas relatively calm as far as physical violence was concerned (Cold War).  The world has changed a bit and we aren't as afraid of a hostile country launching attacks as we are for terrorists launching attacks.  Mutually Assured Destruction has no power in this arena - terrorists are spread out, not necessarily nationally aligned, are spread out through a civilian (I do not consider terrorists civilians) population that they blend into.  Militaries have increasingly made weapons that are accurate and precise to avoid civilian casualties.  The problem is that most of the time, the military doesn't know where to point the weapons because the terrorists hide among the civilian populace.<br>
<br>
I think that a country should be responsible for not harboring terrorists within their boarders.  It should be a part of the responsibility of the leaders of the country to make sure that every effort is made to keep them out - arrest them or kill them where applicable.  In my opinion, any country that doesn't actively deter terrorism harbors it.  So, the question becomes, how do we get these other countries to not support/harbor terrorists?  I think it should be forefront on the leaders AND citizens of those country's minds that they are responsible for this.  I personally feel that any country that is known to harbor and/or aid terrorists is responsible for the actions of those terrorists.<br>
<br>
So, how do we get other countries to not harbor terrorists?  I think we treat any act of terrorism as a declaration of war by the countries who harbor/aid these groups.  Since they have declared war on our country AND taken it upon themselves to target our civilians as a primary target, I have no problem reciprocating.  This is where I let my emotions get to me somewhat, but I feel that any attack on my own country by an aggressor nation (yes, those terrorists are allowed to operate from within your boarders and you aren't doing something to stop them) should be met with force manifold times the attack given.  i.e. You attack us and kill 3000+ of our civilians, we will do what we can to destroy your country/regime.  If you don't feel that you can destroy us by attacking us, then you had better not attack us (or let organizations that you harbor/aid attack us).  Basically it becomes the &quot;modern&quot; form of &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot;.  I think this should be our stance and if the UN has anything to say about this policy then they can take up the burden of insuring that terrorists are wiped out.  Unless and until they take up this mantle, then they can basically kiss my hairy ass.<br>
<br>
Now, a little about the UN.  The UN has no real power.  It is a meeting place where countries are promised that they get together to diplomatically pound out agreements.  Unfortunately for the USA, every time an agreement is pounded out that involves some sort of physical presence somewhere in the world, the USA has to brunt the bill for it either in manpower or money or both.  Granted, we have interest in generating goodwill and in the stability of some regions of the world.  However, I think those days should be numbered.  If the USA would lessen the amount of involvement that we have in the UN &quot;projects&quot;, the UN would be faced with some difficult positions.  Most countries are more content to watch to see what goes on elsewhere than to get involved.  This isn't a bad position to take.  I think we should take that stance as well.  Next time some portion of the world is starving, let France and Germany send the troops and the food to feed them if they care to.  If some place wants military action to stablize the area (*cough* Bosnia *cough*) then those with the most interest in the region should deal with it.  Sure, the USA has a lot of interest in making sure Europe and Western Asia are stable but why should we have to foot the vast majority of the burden when there are a number of countries that are in the area who can deal with it.<br>
<br>
The USA should stop being asked to bail other folks out to the point of having to shoulder the majority of the burden every time it happens.  Doing this does generate some goodwill but it also makes other folks mad.  For every group you help, at least one other group doesn't like it and claims that the USA is sticking their noses into places they shouldn't.  Fine.  I'll take that as a hint.

Perhaps you heap me in with the anti war sentiment. Mostly yes I guess I am against war, although I would accept one if it really has come to the point of no return. (I just don't feel that we have reached it yet)<br>
<br>
You ask the reasons I base my opinion. <br>
<br>
The weapon inspectors who are day by day on the ground in Iraq are finally saying things are happening. Yes it has taken us years to get to this stage, yes it has taken a great deal of pressure to reach a stage where Iraq have little option but to disarm or go to war. Do I think its worth keeping pressure on for a little longer ( majority of countries in the UN are proposing 45 days) yes I think its worth waiting 45 days to see if we can end this without having to bomb a country that is already suffering. If there are other options on the table I think they need to be tried first.<br>
<br>
I am doubtful myself about the supposed links between Iraq and the 9-11 events. Yes they were awful and the whole world got behind America as they went and fought their war against terrorism.  You said you saw no hard facts from anti war factions and that these were needed to prove points can you possibly post the information where these links can be found? <br>
<br>
America has had a big wake up to terrorism and its a shock. Britain has been living with terrorism for years as a result of the Nothern Ireland conflict, which in fact has had many of its militant factions often funded by the states. But we have been determined to try and resolve things peacefully and although deadlines come and go as long as progress is being made I still think that its worthwhile persuing. Unfortuantely when you bring emotions and national pride into a situation its not easy to get the results you want.<br>
<br>
As things stand today with weapons inspectors throughout the country I can't see that Iraq is in a position to create a weapon that is going to blow up the west coast. Perhaps NK might but Iraq is pretty crippled in that respect. No one has proposed that we simply back off and leave them to it. But I feel that to jump into a war in a region that is volatile while throwing the whole concept of the UN out the window seems a little foolhardy. Surely preserving the integrity of the UN is worth waiting those 45 days. <br>
<br>
Just my opinion I realise its not shared with most but I think everyone is entitled to express their opinion without fearing that they will be ridiculed for it.<br>
<br>
Der<br>
<br>
PS Not sure why this WW2 thing keeps getting dragged into this argument as its been over for quite some time now. But just to indulge a little Bristish pride, most of Europe and England were in that war for a lot longer than America. France was invaded and yes other nations came to help. But some of the most dangerous fighting was done by those ordinary citizens within France who risked torture daily to provide information to the allies. I don't think that we can call them all cowards for their part. And lets be realistic here we weren't just fighting for France's or even Europe's freedom it was done for the whole world, they were just first on the list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/14/03 12:47:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Gromm, about the veto, please compare the number of times US used it and the number of times France used it. you would be impressed i think.<br>

<br>
1st: yes we have been owned in WW2, but no, u're not coming to save our ass, u're coming because japan attack u, and then germany declare war to u... and france was 1 of the best land to begin against germany...<br>
<br>
Odd then that the US and British military and leaders were already meeting openly prior to Pearl Harbor.  Odd also that America violated neutrality and was actively fighting an undeclared naval war in the Atlantic prior to Pearl Harbor.  Also, explain to me why, if we got into the war because Japan attacked us, that we put priority on Germany?  Maybe because we cared (ok, admittedly we cared about England not France, you got me there).<br>
<br>
As for the notion that france was the best spot to begin against Germany Am. generals actually agreed with you.  Thankfully our British counterparts kept us off the continent until we were better prepared.  France was actually the last, not the first place we fought the war against Germany.<br>
<br>
Also you were owned in the Franco-Prussian War, WWI, the Vietnamese War (hey we lost that too, but at least we didn't get our arses kicked), in Algeria....<br>
<br>
2nd: do we have ever critic u to not support us, after Lafayette com to help u?<br>
<br>
Yes, he did, but that was the aberration.  For the history minded within 10 years of our Revolution, which France indeed aided us in, the the United States and France were fighting an undeclared naval war (ironically enough over the same issues that would lead us into a declared war with Britain shortly thereafter).  Americans abhorred the chaos and lawlessness of the French Revolution.  It made us question your definition of civilized behavoir.   Also, just for the record, we weren't too fond of you trying to establish an Empire in Mexico while we were busy with our Civil War.<br>
<br>
<br>
11th: for the 1st time in ur history, u're about to make a war without any agression against u!! and call that a juste cause...<br>
<br>
???  1st time in our history?  I don't particularly recall Mexico or Spain committing aggressive acts against us yet we cleaned their clocks.  South Korea was explicity stated as being outside our sphere of protection yet when it was invaded we leaped to their aid and North Vietnam certainly did not commit an aggressive act against us.  So we have gone to war when their weren't acts of aggression directed at us.  That doesn't mean the wars weren't justified.  It also doesn't mean they were justified either.<br>
<br>
As for your statements explicity questioning our reasons for going to war you are right you are entitled to question them.  Most of us do because it is our nature and so far I'm satisfied by what I hear.  However, I find France's foreign policy decisions far more politically motivated (both today and post WWII) and inadequately initiated than any other nations.<br>
<br>
You are a nation that always does the opposite of what you should do.  When the situation favors the offense you build defenses, when it favors defense you lauch into suicidal assaults, when the age of empire is waning you send troops into your colonies, and when the world should be unanimously in accord with punishing someone who flaunts the laws and harmony of the globe you choose this time to attempt to establish your own nation as a leader.<br>
<br>
You don't do this because your leaders believe the war is unjust.<br>
<br>
You don't do this because your leaders believe Bush is a warmonger.<br>
<br>
You do this because it is an opportunity.  A rare one to carve out a niche for your nation in the world scene.  To recapture former glory.  This has always been the fleeting dream of France since WW2 and just because you don't see how poorly ill thought out your leader's choices are does not excuse them.<br>
<br>
The sad thing is naive fools will wave flags and shout slogans against war in your country and praise their leadership for keeping them out of it.  Yet, had the nations that imposed these sanctions on Iraq acted together we would not be at this point.  <br>
<br>
Instead now, because of France's selfish desire to carve out a power niche for themselves, a dictator, instead of faced with the world against him will gamble, can gamble.  He can fight.  He can use weapons that otherwise were not available to him and he can make the argument that his nation was unjustly singled out by the US and a few of its most stalwart allies.  Even if Saddam, breaks out poison gas or some other weapons proving how much he has been violating the peace do you believe for a second France's leadership will chastise him, even verbally.  I don't.  Watch and see the spin France will put on the war.<br>
<br>
Say what you will of George Bush.  He has a credibility that the French leadership does not.  <br>

I didn't try to compare the two.  Each country tries to look out for its own interests.  I would expect no less.  This is what I was saying.  The fact that France is using their veto power is a directly related to their interests in the region (which I touched on in the other post and will talk about further down).<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually, the seminar was filled with information, that was just one point.  There were lots of things discussed like what you can or can't talk about and expect to have good responses and such.  Only one part was about France.  The other parts were about Germany and Italy.<br>
<br>
I didn't entirely mean that France was using the veto simply because it can.  France has ties with Iraq - financial and who knows what else - as evidenced by France's selling Iraq nuclear technologies and actually even being hired to build Iraq's nuclear reactors.  France actually has a market of selling nuclear technology and reactors to different countries around the world.  I'm sure that France has received some form of compensation for their aid in gaining nuclear technology and reactors in terms of &quot;deals&quot; on Iraqi oil.  I'm also sure that France sees additional influence of the USA into Iraq as possibly disrupting those concessions that they have with Iraq.  Therefore, it is quite logical for France to not want anything to change in Iraq - even though the world agrees that Saddam is a murderous dictator who has committed unimaginable attrocities.<br>
<br>
In the past, France has also been known to give/sell nuclear weapons technology and other technologies from the &quot;West&quot; during the Cold War to USSR sympathizing countries while also being a part of NATO.  A good example of this was France's sale of mainframes produced by USA companies to Warsaw-Pact countries who then turned around and reverse engineered them and produced clones for the USSR.<br>
<br>
As far as the UN goes, the USA does not have to have the UN's or Frances, or anyone's permission to defend themselves from what we think is a direct attack on our people (civilians).  Would France or Germany see a country like Poland (to pull a country out of my hat) lobbing theatre range ballistic missiles into Paris or Berlin as anything less than a declaration of war?  What if Poland simply said, &quot;Well... that wasn't us, that was some terrorist group, and no, we will not hunt them down.&quot;  What if also you knew that Poland allowed the terrorists to make bases unmolested in their country and possibly even helped fund their actions by giving them money and/or equipment?  I would imagine not and I would fully expect them to seek a hearing in the UN and to receive help in stopping those terrorists or they would have to do it themselves even without the approval of the UN.  The problem is that the USA would most likely step in to help (yet again) without having to be begged to do so.  What is sad is that the rest of the world would expect the USA to step in, to the point of almost requiring it.<br>
<br>
Regional stability is seen as a good thing to the USA.  Stability means that people can go to work and make money.  They can then spend that money in the global marketplace.  Instability means that no money is made and no money is spent.  Commerce = good, chaos = bad.  That is why the USA tends to like to help to stabilize regions in the world.<br>
<br>
Think what you will, to some degree, oil makes the world go around in industrialized societies.  Without oil, our cars don't go and the majority of the world doesn't have electricity.  To say that the USA isn't interested in making sure the oil keeps flowing is the statement of a fool.  To think it is purely for greed and money is as equally foolish.  If oil suddenly became a non-commodity, the way of life in many countries (not just the USA) would just as suddenly drastically change.  Sudden changes in the way of life is a bad thing.  Economies would have to restructure almost completely.  New technologies to produce safe, clean energy that didn't rely on fossil fuels would have to be developed - something that people are working on but results aren't happening fast enough, partially because oil is so cheap that if you can't make something as cheap as oil, it isn't worth developing further.  Would *you* enjoy having scheduled electrical blackouts in your country because there wasn't enough oil to power the generators?  How about walking to work because you can't afford gas for your car?  How about walking to work because there wasn't oil to generate electricity to power your trains? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 509<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/14/03 6:35:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: French Pussies</span><hr size=1> <br>
