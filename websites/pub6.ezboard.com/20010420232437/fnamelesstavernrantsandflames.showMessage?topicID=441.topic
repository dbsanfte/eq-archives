Trak died...  Shadow goes LD...  Shadow comes back...  shadow bends over traks corpse...  shadow goes ld again and does not come back...  bard bp is gone,  and since he was not in a group,  no one knew for sure if he looted it.   Arbaal talks to Valdelmar...  Valdelmar finds BP on Shadow...  Valdelmar brings me the bp in OS.  You can all make your own decision,  but I've made mine.  Shadowspear is a damn asshole and ninja looting cock sucker.  If his account is not banned and he tries to ebay it,  I will personally start another auction titled &quot;don't buy that bard on the everquest nameless server&quot;  and explain about his reputation,  and I will also email every bidder on his account personally.  I have over 1300 feedback rating on ebay (no,  I have never sold an EQ item or account there).  I think people would take me somewhat seriously.  <br>
<br>
I honestly do hope that his account is banned and not just temporarily suspended.  He had a bad reputation as his original character Dolmain,  and couldn't get away from it with shadowspear.<br>
<br>
So what if he was a good bard.  EQ is a social game,  and if you can't learn to fit in socially,  you suck.  Shadow even had a second chance.  He ruined Dolmain's rep,  then started Shadow.  Some people will never change...<br>

Until today. What would compel you to do that? To take a L60 character and slam dunk him like that? You sealed your own fate today. No matter how well you played your class no one would want to group with you. Rumor had it that you used to be Dolmain and you ruined his rep early on in the Nameless's history. I guess a leopard never changes his spots. Thank God it all got straightened out by Valdemar(sp?). It would have been a tragedy to see a nice piece like a SS Bp go to waste on a character that no one would give the time of day to.<br>

Good luck on your next character Shadow. Maybe next time you won't royally fuck it up like the last two.

<br>
I made this post on the LoS boards on October 25th, when I found myself turning away from fun events with my guild , due to the presence of this asshole.  A few members really seemed to like him, and I wanted to warn them of what a two faced motherfucker he was.<br>
<br>
I never went public till now, In general I dont openly flame people, unless on the joke flames that are for fun imho.  This shit is majorly fucked up , and after his actions I would hope he could not even garner the tiniest amount of support.<br>
<br>
<br>
snip:<br>
Well, I just got pissed off enough to finally post a rant about this fool. Most of you find him annoying, others actually really like him. Me I despise him, but to avid problems in guildchat, I will put my rant where it belongs in this forum. If you dont want to hear bad things about this person , then dont read on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Things Shadowspear has done to me:<br>
<br>
He always bugged me, just like he bugs alot of people, no biggy. The thing that set me off with my initial dislike for him was back when I had dropped my first item to lose it completely, my MM drums. It was the best I had , and zoned into KC right after it happened /auctioning to trade or buy a new set.<br>
<br>
Five minutes later, Shadowspear, who was I think high 30's and in OT, sends me a tell. He heard I had dropped my MM battle drums, and had all 5 coins for the nostrolo tambourine. He said all he wanted for them was my lambent boots(I had just recieved my own SS maybe 3 hours before)<br>
<br>
I thought the offer was far too generous, and had recently replaced my (this is sad) runed falchion, and enchanted fine steel rapier with karnor loot(jade mace and sionaches partisan) and offered to give them to him because I DONT SCREW PEOPLE, and wasnt using them. I basically evened out the origional generous offer on his part.<br>
<br>
He asks me if I can meet in FV, I say yes, and on my way.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 hours in FV I ask if he is coming a couple of times, and for three hours he jerks my chain.<br>
<br>
Finally after this wait, he sends me a tell saying that the weapons arent that great , and maybe if possible if I could get him a Ykesha since I am 54. I tell him I have never owned one. He jerks my chain a lil more , with his &quot;Tis ok , i am your buddy, ill still hook you up&quot; song and dance. I wait one more hour. After the hour I ask again, and he sends a tell saying he didnt want my weapons, nor the boots , he wanted singing steel boots, and if i could not get them, he was getting them from someone else, and giving them the coins.<br>
<br>
<br>
The motherfucker made me wait 4 hours in Friona till he finally could get a better deal, then gave me a fuck you, so I say FUCK HIM. I have pretty much disliked his ass a WHOLE LOT since then. Granted now, since I joined LoS , I get tells after tells , like he is my best friend.<br>
<br>
end snip:<br>
<br>
<br>
After what he did to garolick I almost feel guilty about not chewing him a new asshole publicly.<br>
<br>
Well, it all ended well , grats garo on your BP , you have stuck it out with sanct since day one , and are one deserving sunavabitch.<br>
<br>
<br>
iJangos!<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s.  what really sucks is Shadow was like one of the 5 bards I know on this server that I thought had really great skills.  It sucks, and is rare to find one who can play the class well.  I guess thats why I despised him so much, good bards make people realize we arent just mana batteries,  and it all goes to waste if your a two faced piece of shit.<br>

I also can't believe someone could be so stupid as to screw up a perfectly good character like that. i know sometimes when phat lewt drops people lose control of themselves and do dumb things but really, its just a game get a hold of yourself and log out if it makes you that mad don't drag your character through the mud by doing something retarded...<br>

<br>
basically i don't think it's really fair that everyone get down on shadowspear 'cause he didn't even get to keep the item.  if he'd kept it then he'd have his uber track bard tunic or whatever and have a bad reputation.  not a good trade off but he's got something in return.  that's the karmic way the world works.  instead he just gets this item unjustly taken from him by evil gm boy and then he's got nothing.  that's just not right.  it's like if you rob a bank and stash the lewt and then go to jail it's not bad 'cause when you get out if you've hick brother in law didn't hop town to tahiti with your wife then you can live like a king.<br>
<br>
anyway another point is sanctuary sucks.  so it's not like he did anything bad 'cause you guys all suck.<br>
<br>
plus i'm sure he was just settling some score and was totally justified.  i have no doubt that when all the facts are present his innocense will be undisputed... hell maybe he did actually go link dead through some glitch... you guys did notice that everquest is glitchy didn't you?  maybe he just felt he deserved to loot the coin off of track.<br>
<br>
so let's hear what shadowspear has to say...<br>

<br>
/sigh Up until you posting i wasn't even going to bother because i was not even .. Like you said given a chance to say or do anything about it. <br>
<br>
1) I got a tell stating &quot; Sorry Shadowspear&quot; from Jaquim ...<br>
<br>
 heh ok ? Why are you sorry ..<br>
<br>
Way before the Trakanon raid even began Jaquim and myself discussed something pertaining to me being the only bard there.<br>
<br>
 I told him it wouldnt matter anyway regardless that there is no Guilded Bard present i was sure that if the Breastplate was to drop I was not going to be rewarded this based solely on my being the only bard there . Rather it go into the Bank till one of the Deserving *Guildedbards were online*<br>
<br>
 I had not a thought in my mind of walking away with a breastplate due to this.<br>
<br>
 2) after the Trakanon Battle I get the Sorry Message and i go linkdead.<br>
 <br>
 My whole comp was froze up and during this time i had realized that i had to go to work.<br>
<br>
 ( im in the Army ? we all know this at least this is what i have told everyone yes? ) <br>
<br>
 Realizing this i had to let my roomate play for me and i had to go. At this point i never even knew what dropped off of Trak . I told my room mate to find out what the loot was and to have one of the Raid members have me gated to Dreadlands or use a gate potion if he was to late.<br>
<br>
 /sigh This is where i fuct up <br>
<br>
 Letting my roomate play was a big no no<br>
<br>
 Telling him to find out what the loot was and *NOT* to loot the Dragon itself also was my mistake.<br>
<br>
 My roomate took it upon himself to Loot the Dragon - Grabbed the Singing Steel breastplate / Hence i was a Bard and this much he knew. and  I mean serious? If im going to Ninja loot a dragon ? Why take hahaha ? MY Class Breastplate and Not both ? Wouldnt that be just enuff to say welp The SS breastplate is missing Hmmmm..<br>
<br>
 I wonder who took it..<br>
<br>
 I was already out the door at this point and i dont know what else happend.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I get next morning and log in to find all of this Fuck me this and fuck you that. I read it and I took the time to hear all the bad feelings about me heh..It's obvious to me that my roomate as well as him saying so...<br>
<br>
 Looted the Breastplate and did not stay for questions.<br>
<br>
 He fuct me and i have no one else to blame but myself for letting someone else play - If i knew this was going to happen i might as well left myself Linkdead and logged in to die and get a corpse Summon.<br>
<br>
 What benefit would ninja looting a Breastplate do for a level 60 Bard? I might as well have ninja looted all the Imbured Platemail Breastplates i seen drop in hate that were being rewarded to the 46-52 Bards.. Had i ? No.. why ?<br>
 Because i knew it was not worth my time or Reputation to do so..<br>
<br>
 You should all know me to be a better and clear thinker than to take a Breastplate that i did not earn and say YUP! I know im going to get away with it ... <br>
<br>
 I hope this will open your eyes and I even more hope that with this being said I can one day log on again and not get 1000's of tells asking me why or did i Ninja loot a breastplate . Till then i will seek greener Pastures --<br>
<br>
 Have fun in Norrath - some people just can't win..<br>
<br>
<br>
 What it all summs up to is this<br>
<br>
 I left the House and Let My roomate play<br>
<br>
 He misinterpreted to find out what the loot was ... To looting the Dragon itself.<br>
<br>
 He gated like i asked him to. and He camped  and that was that.<br>
<br>
  I don't blame you guys for acting on the missing breastplate -- anyone and everyone should of did that.<br>
<br>
 But basically im being made to look like a thief and there was no room for discussion. Nor was i even present to do so.<br>

I know the powers a GM has... Lol Myself and Hawthorne worked against players that scammed others in the past - They are very capable of Looking into your files -<br>
<br>
 Your *avatar* and finding out what you had the second it was looted - What would I have been smoking if i thought i could get away with Ninja'ng a breastplate that would not benefit me .. Yeah that would have been a really low thing to do... <br>
  <br>
 Peace,think clearly.... and let it die. <br>

Now if was not in your guild why did you bring him if he couldnt get it aint like he was getting any exp from. Thats like having a fine as lady undress in front of you and not give you any. A stright tease.<br>

I have never even considered openly flaming shadowspear, and for reasons of respect.<br>
<br>
Me and shadow talked about this, he knows this.<br>
<br>
My post on the private legacy of steel forums was a warning to my friends, and guildmates, that Shadow wasnt the kind hearted person that trully cared about everyone he was made out to be.  I had witnessed both sides of his persona.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why I came out:   <br>
<br>
This is just a game true, but there are people who are living and breathing entities behind the screens.  If you take a good look at a raid, you see 50 or more people spending 5 hours of there life at a time.   Each raid equals around 250 real life man hours being spent.   <br>
<br>
Then take the number of times Sanctuary has helped or soloed trak, and you have well over 1000 hours of peoples lives being spent  for a shot at awarding an item to someone who has been loyal to sanctuary since day one.<br>
<br>
In all honesty when one person can ruin the thrill for all those people (yes its part of the concept of killing big mobs , I am thrilled when I see someone deserving get something), I reluctantly posted after thinking about it for a few hours.  <br>
<br>
Was just my fair warning to the people out there who might have bought into whatever lame excuse he could come up with.<br>
<br>
Anyways, hell even shadowspear knows Ive felt this way for a long long ass time, but always kept it private, without the juvenile rants you see on this board.  Last night I really felt bad for Sanctuarty, and I felt horrid for my friend Garolick.  <br>
<br>
<br>
He went to far.<br>
<br>
<br>
If your gonna hate me for it and flame me at a personal level  /shrug  .... <br>
<br>
<br>
I just hope he doesnt have a shot at ever doing that to such a large number of people again.<br>
