These guys are stalking the boards awaiting every post. I implore you all to just write them off. They'll quit the game and go sit in a corner and jack off to porn of overweight guys eatin dried cum out of their mom's belly button.<br>

Once upon a time the planes calendar was packed.  If you wanted to go into Fear on tuesday you had to book it a month in advance because every guild on the server with 40+ people wanted in.  The unguilded people screamed that it wasn't fair.  They weren't in a guild and were being treated as second class citizens.  The RTA listened to them and created FFA days for the planes.  Noone guilded could enter them on those days.  The unguilded would have free reign to do as they pleased!  What did they do?  Nothing.  The planes sat empty on those days.  The RTA even had a forum solely for organizing such raids.  It was never used, except in futility.<br>
<br>
You want to add FFA days to the rSev rot?  To the AoW rot?  I'll tell you right now exactly what would happen:<br>
<br>
1) On FFA day Sev would get killed by any random 2 or 3 people that were unguilded.  These would be people in between guilds, probably former members of &quot;uber&quot; guilds who were bored, who would sell the loot, not use it.<br>
<br>
2) On FFA day AoW would sit and twiddle his thumbs all day because noone would bother him.  You would be adding an extra day onto the rot and delaying every guild on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Now, maybe it's time you took into consideration how you go about doing things.  This crusader for the little guy shit is getting old.  Learn how to think for gods sake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=senzii>Senzii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.protoculturex.com/steeltalons/forum/non-cgi/emoticons/yin-yang.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clan X - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 12:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Poodles?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) the RTA's unjustified wide sweeping action of laying this at all of C4 and AiF (which I think they have backed away from some)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you have noticed AiF has not been blacklisted. The members of AiF that have said they are in C4 have been. The leader of AiF from what I understand is determining wether or not they are part of C4. As an alliance/association when one person violates the rules then the whole alliance is punished. If anyone in my guild broke any rules and we as a guild backed them, we as a guild would be punished wether we are involved or not. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) the prefectly unreasonable fact that unless I chose to join a guild I don't ever have an oppertunity at Serv Trak AoW etc why what makes guilded people more worth? my suggestion fair reasonable and would probably prevent this from ever happening again.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
It isn't actually RTA that is made it so you can't kill Sev, Trak and AoW its SoE. Tell them to stop making mobs that require 4 65 characters or a raid force of 30 people because you want a shot to kill them. The game is about organization, working together, with other people and you chose to work against that. No one is stopping you from killing Sev, Trak of AoW and if you want to attempt it, more power to you. Now if you succeed and then want to spit in the faces of everyone else then expected to be punched in the face.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of mobs that have a better loot table than Sev, Trak and AoW and are not on a rotation. You want to get a pickup raid of people guilded or unguilded, more power to you. Pickup raids aren't something new. However you chose to take down Sev for no real purpose except to show off you could. You didn't do a pickup raid, you already have an organization/alliance formed.<br>
<br>
You know you might of had a shot at actually getting on a real rotation providing none of your members of C4 are guilded and instead of acting like childish brats spoke to RTA. You first submitted you wanted to be part of the community, then when they said no for the fact you have members in other guilds you said fine. You then kill Sev and taunt everyone by saying, &quot;Ha ha we ganked him&quot;. The only thing that got ganked are the people involved who I hope they enjoy grouping with just themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rangeraoyama>Ranger Aoyama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 12:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.theorlandobloomfiles.com/pictures/desktop/ez19.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dumb Fuck</span><hr size=1> Karasu you can take your apology and shove it up your dillusional ass <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sexiedeliah>sexiedeliah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/eiregirl101/images/kao_nurse.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 12:24 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4hx4h/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/bonhead1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  no fun</span><hr size=1> no fun...<br>

<br>
I take full blame for me being there. This isn't a post to try and protect or stick up for anyone...even myself. I know now that the Sev kill was not what I thought it was. Here is my story, which I have tried to explain to Vincecross, Lukiebb, and anyone involved....to no avail. I know very little of the RTA. I am not against it, this is actually, unfortunetly the first time I've ever been out to this website, or looked over any of the content or rules here....I wish I had come here before the unfortunate incident occurred. I honestly did not know that Sev was rotation only. I thought that surely if they were going to take him down, that there was no problem with it. I was wrong....I should have just logged off, which I was in the process of doing when I saw the talk of Sev.<br>
<br>
I really have no problem with the RTA, and believe me when I say that I was not present at the Sev kill to &quot;get attention&quot; or anything of the sort...I have....or had a few friends in VoLS, one of which I have known since I started playing....and the fact they won't speak to me now because I was ignorant to the rules hurts so much.<br>
<br>
I am not going to ask for your forgiveness, as I believe that maybe I should have none....even though I was not fully aware of what was going on.<br>
<br>
As far as me being a &quot;member&quot; of C4....I didn't honestly believe that it was anything more than a group of old friends, in a chat channel that liked to just be around each other...that is the reason I was there. I was not in it for plat, or uberness....I honestly just liked the conversation, it gave me someone to chat with and hang around with, as I usually keep to myself, and anyone who knows me from in-game, knows that I like to help people. I have never intentionally tried to hurt anyone in-game, or in RL....but it looks as though I have hurt many people indirectly.<br>
<br>
Again...I personally am sorry.<br>

2) the prefectly unreasonable fact that unless I chose to join a guild I don't ever have an oppertunity at Serv Trak AoW etc why what makes guilded people more worth? my suggestion fair reasonable and would probably prevent this from ever happening again. <br>

<br>
Do you see spots?<br>
<br>
Your suggestion is to add a 'free for all' slot to all rotations that unguilded people might be able to kill. <br>
<br>
And then you suggest that the entity who just killed the mob... not be allowed to kill the mob... until every other group on the rotation... has killed the mob again... FUCKSTICK?! You're talking about JOINING THE ROTATION!<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;make him FFA once a month, but only for those who are not guilded...&quot; bullshit, please, tell me why the unguilded people should have *more* attempts at him than the guilded people, mmkay? If you want *equal* access, post your interest to join the rotation. You don't have to be, as obviously proven, guilded to kill him. <br>
<br>
If you don't want to be in a guild, resign yourself to killing mobs that are single groupable now. Unless they drastically raise the level limit, mobs like the Avatar of war will not be single groupable by any group not geared in Plane of Time gear. No single group will gear up with Plane of Time gear so that they can backtrack to the Avatar of War. If you can gather your band of friends together and bring out enough firepower to drop the AoW using gear from Kunark, and early velious, and droppable luclin/planar gear, more power to you. <br>
<br>
Not being in a guild is a glass ceiling; it looks like you can proceed, but really, you're stuck on the ladder, looking up. <br>
<br>
I'm sure, as you have a problem with that system, that you will shoot the messenger, and that's fine, I really don't mind. <br>
<br>
Tell me, though, when you're dictating to guilds about who deserves their epic, who deserves a scale, and who should or should not be on that rotation, how are you differant from those saying that C4 should not be allowed to kill a mob? <br>
<br>
VolS should not kill Sev!!!!!!<br>
<br>
And you should? By what right? That you 'need' it more? <br>

This is one of the first sensable things I've read in awhile. At least he owned up to it, politely and claimed ignorance of the situation or the politics. He wasn't someone who basically came to RTA to spit in their faces. Maybe there will be hope for you after all.<br>
<br>
I've heard people say they thought C4 was just a chat channel of friends. It might of just been a chat channel of friends and I'm sorry their leaders failed to let you in on their own politics, the same politics they said they are trying to get away from by not being in a guild. If you look in the General Section you'll see they tried to get C4 on a rotation, submitted for admidance to the RTA. They knew what was going on, to them it wasn't just a chat channel and they even stated it. Just goes to show you have to be careful who you trust these days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gelding1017>Gelding1017</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 6:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/gelding1017/avatar.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I just ganked Serv</span><hr size=1> Don't quote things out of context,<br>
