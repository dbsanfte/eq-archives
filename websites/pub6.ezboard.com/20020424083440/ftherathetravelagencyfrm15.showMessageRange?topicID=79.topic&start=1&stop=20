Please read the entire post before you respond.  And I do not care if you &quot;flame&quot; or whatever, I will take everything in strides)<br>I don't know what to feel right now, I really don't...<br><br>I started playing Everquest on August 3rd, 1999, at 9:48pm as a High Elf paladin named Eclet.  I lived a quiet easy life, killing giant wasp drones in GFay and eventully heading over to Freeport were I met up with some folks I knew a bit in RL, my first introduction to the Shadow Reapers.  I remember when I first heard of the planes, fearsome zones being inhabited by giant, deadly dieties.  I was awestruck, I wanted to go there just to see the zones, and the monsters.  I also knew I had a long fight ahead of me, ya see, the road I took as a paladin was not an easy one(at least for me, but I ain't the best player out there).  Skip ahead about a year, I was only level 20(mind you, I took 3-4 months off) and I had gotten to know more and more of the Reapers and had become interested in joining them.  So, after much smoozing, I made it in.  I now had a reason to play and to try harder, I did it for the guild.  I farely quickly took off up the levels, soloing ogres out in TD, camping AoF, soloing the zone in Guk.  Before I knew it, I was 40.  I couldn't believe it, I was only 6 levels from being able to go to the planes.  Last Saturday rolled around and, with a bit of powering to get me a buffer, I finally reached 46.  I was overjoyed.  I proudly walked up to the portal in Feerott and took a deep breath before entering my first plane.<br><br>Sunday, 11am, we all log into PoF.  Mostly Reapers up there, as well as some personal friends of mine from the Valiant Knights which my guild allowed for me to bring along.  I had a ball, first attack being feared and running off almost onto another creature, finally pulling a Fetid Fiend, which I heard dropped my planes armor.  Very first FF kill, our cleric looked over at me,&quot;Valorium Breastplate&quot;.  Heh, I was overwhelmed.  And next kill, legs, next kill, arms.  I was happy to be recieving and my guild was happy to reward me for my hard work to getting to 46.  We were up there for quite a while before we came up to pulling from the Amy(excuse me for not knowing the whole spelling) temple.  Our pullers run in and then run out with a big group of mobs, we engage, and then I go LD.  I was angry, I didn't want to let the guild down.  I went to log back in and it said Rathe was locked.  Well great, I eventully got into a chat room with the guild and we eventully logged back on about 30 minates later.  It took us approx 45-50 minates to finally get logged back on and set-up at the SS.  We then waited....and waited...  Approx and hour and a half later, we are greeted by Vaylin, yelling at us for flooding the petition list asking for zone repops.  We assured him that we only sent one, which, to the best of my knowledge, unless a VK did, we did, because Evilrulz had told us not to petition.  He threatened not to even pop the zone, which angered alot of my guildies as well as myself, but we kept it in because we were scared that he wouldn't pop it at all.  So he finally repops it.  I look over to my right and see a giant moving mass of brown and clicked on it.  Cazic Thule.  I was happy again.  I had seen my first diety, and I knew we were well in the way to killing him.  From there out was a whirlwind.  We flew through the West portion of the zone and we came up to the point of pulling Dracoliche.  I was then sincerly asked in guild-chat to play as Docoslr, a level 52 cleric and a extra account of one of the members becuase we needed the extra healing.  I, wanting to help the guild, of course said yes and logged her on.  Now take in mind, I am not the best cleric player in the world.  Most of my group ended up dying because I got killed myself because I forgot to heal myself.  We did eventully prevail and got resituated.  At this point we had a few people log for RL reasons, but still had 3-4 strong groups.  We then trucked along the South wall and halfway up the West.  We were to the point at around 3am where we were getting DTed by Cazic just for being so close to him.  After one fight with some Gorgons, I went LD.  No biggie, I'll just log back on.  Well,(as alot of the East-Coasters know) we had a storm coming and I lost cable.  No internet, no TV, nothin.  I called up a guild member, Rixen, 59th conjurer, and told him the news.  He said he would take up the helm of the cleric.  I then waited about 30 minates to try to log back on, but to no avail.  So I went to bed.<br><br>I logged on the next day and checked our message board to see if CT went down.  There was no rejoicing, so I assumed he didn't go down to us.  I thought that the BoTS had probably come in and taken him down, which was no biggie, as long as he went down.  I then logged into EQ(not as Eclet mind you, he was still up in PoF) and asked a friend of mine in VK if Cazic went down.  He said that they had gotten him down to halfway through the first &quot;C&quot; in Cazic before they were mobbed by 10 amy knights.  I was bummed, if I hadn't have went LD, I could have played the cleric and Rixen's extra damage(or at least his pets) would have finished off Cazic, theorectically, mind you.  I then contacted a random KoIC member and asked how fear was going because my main was stuck up there.  He said to keep in contact and he'd tell me when the portal and the SW corner were clear.  I eventully logged on as Eclet, and was killed by a pull(not KoIC fault mind you, I wasn't paying attention) but was graciously rezzed and TPed out.  I did notice while I was up there Cazic yelling, signifying he was still up, but I also noticed how many people then had and knew that they could take him down.  They said nothing about him being up nor complained.  I mean, why would they?  Then now had a chance to take down Cazic which they wouldn't had if we or the BB guild had done it.<br><br>I still left happy, I had one of the best weekends...well, probably my best weekend ever in EQ(and in RL for a log time, hehe) and I was looking foward to going up to Hate the next Sunday.<br><br>Now for the Wrath of Eclet to be loosed...no more happy crap...I....AM....PISSED....<br>(DISCLAIMER:  This is Eclet talking, this is not nessessarily the views of the Shadow Reapers or the entities therein the Shadow Reapers guild.)<br><br>You want to know why?!  The pure and unadulterated greed and lust for power on this server disgusts me to no end.  BB guilds?!?  Just WTF is that?!  Just so what if a &quot;smaller weaker guild&quot;, like us apparently, can't kill a diety?  We have done it before and just had bad luck this time.  The BB system is nothing more then a tool for the &quot;epic&quot;(don't get me started on that one) guilds to just waltz in and pick up diety/epic quest loot, seeing as they don't want to bother clearing out the zone every time they need to kill Cazic or Inny and they have no use for planes armor loot besides to equip their secondary/tertiary charecters. If anything, the &quot;epic&quot; guilds should have to ask the current guild up in the plane if they can loot say(I don't really know my epic quests) a_epic_item01 off of Cazic if they lend a hand in killing him.  If the guild up in the plane says no.  Whelp, boys and girls, then the &quot;uber&quot; guild can't go up.  They'll have to wait their turn a hope Cazic is up there next trip up or keep asking guilds that go up.<br><br>I am not dissing the calender system completly, it is a good system, just being used improperly.  I will not say being run improperly, because I do not know anyone who is on the admin board.  But I will say I am surprised that this post has not been locked yet like the other Shadow Reaper posts have been, &quot;Violation of Calendar rules&quot; and &quot;*sigh*&quot;.  You know why I think they were closed?  Because Rewena reliezed she was wrong and reliezed that other guilds agreed with us.  Why didn't you post a last post before closing them, explaining why they were closed?  <br><br>You know why I wrote the first paragraph?  To explain the battle one has to go through to get to 46.  You all remember it, I'm sure.  Now, if I want to get into the planes, I have to battle to get into a guild that has &quot;posting rights&quot;.  What is that?  It is complete foolishness is what that is.<br><br>Now in regards to Vaylin(or whatever his name is, I really do not give a care)  I don't know if you reads these boards or not.  But I would like to know if you know what &quot;abuse of power&quot; is?  You came into a zone that we had petitioned ONCE to have repopped and began to yell at us and threaten us saying that you would not pop it if we kept up &quot;that attitude&quot;.  You also said that it may not have been us who were flooding the petition log because alot of them had come from the guild up in sky, but continued to threaten not to pop zone and even said before you left that we were lucky to have you pop it, because he could have gone to reply to other petitions first.  Now I am not a GM, but to the best of my knowledge, that was quite un-called for.  You should have just came in, informed us of the repop, repopped the zone, and gone out to help another petition.  But no, you had to waste our and your own time threatening us.  I am not asking for any kind of apolegy, I am just saying that this isn't the first problem I have heard happening with you and I'm sure your bosses wouldn't mind hearing about it, seeing as I am one of their loyal paying customers(how's that for threatening?)<br><br>Lastly, this is not a threat and I am not saying this will happen, this is just a scenario I came up with in my head.  Let say a non-posting entity which has no posting rights and only 16 charecters over 46 get together and want to go to the planes.  This guild does not have to adhere to any player/&quot;uber&quot; guild enforced rules, only the play-nice policies put in front of us when we started EQ.  What is keeping a non-posting guild from getting 2-3 groups together, going up to Fear, camping the Fetid Fiend house for Valorium armor(only camp I know of) then taking off.  I don't remember signing any contract when I started a charecter on the Rathe saying that I must adhere to policies set forth on some message board somewhere.  &quot;But it's SoAndSo guild's turn up in Fear!&quot;  And?  I can't go into a zone in Norrath to get equipment because the &quot;powers that be&quot;(non-Verant employees, mind you) on the server does not deem my pitiful guild of only 16 charecters over 46(not the Shadow Reapers, mind you) access to the planes.  That is unjust for many guilds out there.  First line in the rules section, &quot;This calendar represents a player agreement of the lvl 46+ players on the Rathe. No player or guild is excluded.&quot;  Is that so?  Why were the Valiant Knights excluded?  Why were any other guilds that cannot post deemed unworthy and not being represented?  <br><br>The system is corrupt.  I am not saying I have all(or any) of the answers.  I just hope that whatever &quot;uber&quot; guilds that are staying behind(which, it seems, &quot;uber&quot; guilds seem to have the only say in the rules) is able to figure it out.<br><br>Please reply however you deem worthy.  At this point in time, I do not care what anyone says.  If you want to black-list our guild for this post, I'll disband before that can happen.  I would just like to know if you are happy for destroying our guild(which I'm sure you're laughing at right now, now that I just said that) seeing that this horrible display of politics has caused almost half our guild to either &quot;take a long vacation&quot; from EQ or to leave to the new server. <p>Eclet [insert last name here]<BR>{Shadow Reapers}<BR>-Guild Mascot<br><b>ai...yiyiyiyiyiyi....erp!!</b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueclet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eclet</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 3/8/01 4:44:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujerricaevilbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jerrica EvilBringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/8/01 2:41:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why did I play my charecter this long...</span><hr size=1> All I can say is I'm sorry that this Calendar ever came to the place where a group of players think they can decide to ban a group from being in a plane.  I always said I would never agree to any Calendar rule that allows for a player or group of players to administer a punishment banning people from a plane.  There are enough rules upon rules upon rules that exclude some people from access to the Calendar.  If it is at that point now, this Calendar has failed horribly. <br><br>I have no idea what kind of recourse there is for these smaller guilds.  I can tell you that KEG would never be a part of a Calender that had one or two players think they had the power to keep a group of people out of a plane just by their judgement.  I stated that clearly.<br><br>One thing I will not miss on this server, while I'll miss my friends dearly, is what this Calendar, that was started with the best intentions, has dissolved into right now. <p>"Half of the harm that is done in the world is due to people who want to feel important" - T.S.

They used to be left up, for days on end, cause no one could take them down.  Now a lot of Guilds can and do take them down whenever they're up.  <br><br>Do away with this idea of &quot;not leaving the Gods up, call in a BB guild&quot;, and the Calendar will take care of itself.<br><br>Most of the Guilds that started the &quot;BB/Epic&quot; idea are leaving the Rathe, maybe we should send that idea with them.<br><br>Go back to just having the Calendar as it was, a schedule of reserved Planes dates, so the reserving Guild know that any deaths are from their own play, and not someone coming in.<br><br>Yes, we need the rule in place of 40 for Posting Rights.<br><br>Yes, we need the rule of no more than 6 from a different guild.<br><br>Yes, we need the rule in place of vacating the Plane by 2 am PST.<br><br>But no, we don't need the BB/Epic rule any more.  With the way the server is going up and down, multiple times a week, we are having multiple Gods.<br><br>But no, we don't need the BB/Epic rule any more, cause the Epic items are being moved off the God and the God is getting beefed up to SoV standards.<br><br>Epic items will now be available daily, for those that can kill the mobs that carry them.<br><br>If we, as a community, say that there should be punishments for those that violate the agreement that we as a community have put into place, then so be it.  <br><br>From what I've seen, the majority has agreed.  It's only now that the Rathe is finally being split, that folks who are leaving are saying the Calendar should be done away with.  Well, they are leaving, so should have no say in what they are leaving behind.<br><br>Keep the Calendar.  It's a nice thing for me to know that tomorrow is my Guilds Day in Hate.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm planning my day around it.  I know I'll be with my friends, and no one is going to ruin my fun.

I'm telling you this so that you understand that I can probably step back better then most when it come to look at this system. <br><br> The reality is that EQ motivates players threw different tools and two of the major tools are the advancement of your characters level wise and the obtention of better gear for them. In a FFA world what that basically mean is that the stronger go after what they want leaving little room for the weaker. The calender was never meant to be perfect, its a compromise that force the stronger to show restraint in their desire to obtain what they want and offer the less experimented guilds opportunities that they would normally never got by them self (killing of a God in a FFA context) . The price for the smaller/less experimented guild is to step on their pride and ask for help if they can't do it. This is where the system often fail when the stronger are either not warned or warned too late to effectively accomplish what they want. Unfortunately I think that the major mistake is that we are asking people that might not have the experience or objectivety to make that call in time, a better way of doing things would probably be for the BB guild to send an observer with enough experience and tact to discuss the issue with the raid leader every time a God is up. <br><br> Jerrica spoke of a group of people having the power to ban other from a plane as something wrong. This is not about the people administrating the rules though but about where the rules came from. Those rules were put there because of the pressure coming from the major guilds that wanted to make sure they wouldn't be dependent only on the good faith of some players. They screamed abuse by the smaller, you screamed abuse by the bigger. Thats where we are with the calendar acting as a bridge between the two. Each party have to give something they don't want to in order for this to work, the bigger are giving missed opportunity to get the Gods, the weaker are giving learning time/fun time with friends when they see they might not be able to get the God.<br><br> You could talk about how wrong it is to for the bigger to act like bully only because they want something and I would even agree with you. However its part of the game and you wont change it so you have to work with it somehow. The calendar is alot of trouble to administer but it did give alot of good time to several group of friends that wouldn't of got the same quality time in a FFA context. In the end everyone has to decide if that quality time is worth the price or not. Personally I think it is, I don't dare thinking about the confrontations we could of had in the planes in a FFA context threw out our history.<br><br>As for the closed threads I didn't see all of them but I would agree with you that a post explaining why it was closed should be in everyone of them. I'm afraid that they have become useto close threads a bit much around here since this forum is also the flame magnet of the Rathe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .<br><br>What is to stop people to farm? to not care about the calendar ? Nothing... However one of two things will happen if its the case, either those people will meet alot of resentments by hundreds of players to a point where they will find their quality time aproaching 0 or the biggest guilds will lose faith in the calender and just go after what they want.<br><br> There is no perfect system here, there is only the choice of what price you prefer paying. Soon there will be change to the planes as well as guilds going so I'm guessing that alot of talk will be needed to adjust things again. Hopefully things will be better but we will have to wait and see. <br><br>Congratulations on your Val BP, arms and legs btw.

The second we made a rule that prevented the one guild per plane per day system we had to figure out a way to enforce it.  The admins came in to do that, and were elected and then another set were elected.<br><br>Verant is at fault for their epic designs.  Verant is fixing it with the planes overhaul.<br><br>When the plane changes go live, I plan on making a post recommending the removal of the entire epic guild clause.  That means admins return from a policing orginzation to a mediation between disagreeing guilds.  At that time, the  only rule that could be voilated is the 6 per group invite, which is easy to verify, and respected by everyone nowdays.   <p><table border=0 background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><TABLE border=0 background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><center><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></center></TD><TD><P><font color="white">"Barsh Barsh, pull another pally."<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp"Err, I could use a group.."</font></P></TD><TD><center><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elaundarhead.jpg" border=0></center></TD></TR><TR><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Elawndar<BR>Warrior 53</font></P></TD><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Frayed Knot<BR>The Rathe</font></P></TD><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Elaundar Nobillium<BR>Paladin 53</font></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umanaspineblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manas Pineblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://psicopro.tripod.com/isw1h55.gif height = 13 width = 15 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/8/01 9:39:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://psicopro.tripod.com/manas.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why did I play my charecter this long...</span><hr size=1> i CANT WAIT for the changes personally, makes ALOT of hard problems just go away so i can just go in game. <p><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Woodlands Stalker<br> <p><img border="0" src="http://www.cofguild.org/eq/logo3a.jpg" width="300" height="58"></p><br><font color = green size = 3>Officer of the Council of Friends, Protector of Lore</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/8/01 9:45:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/xeddrc/froooaakkk.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why did I play my charecter this long...</span><hr size=1> Everquest is fun. <p><html><head><title></title></head><body><ht alighn=right>Xedd Zero<br>Lv 54 He Hate Me Legends of Marr<br>Looks at his coach and says: "Yeah, he hate me."<br> He looks at his opponents and says: "They hate me, and they are going to hate me more when I run all over them today."<br></body></html><img src="http://www.legendsofmarr.com/xeddrc/hehateme.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/8/01 9:56:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why did I play my charecter this long...</span><hr size=1> Agreed.

The loot there is too easy to come across, for little effort.<br><br>Putting epic items in these zones just goes to show how much attention the designers paid to the usage and demand of these zones.<br><br>Its a shame that the way these zones reward, forces in a way players who would rather not see these zones again, to have to go back over and over again, creating a stupidly high level of demand.<br><br>Im sure alot of people would be happy if they took the current loot drops out of the planes, dumped them on the FG in Guk, and buffed the planes up with mobs of levels 60+ with new loot tables <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=79.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=79.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=79.topic&start=61&stop=79>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=79.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=79.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=79.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=79.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm10">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm22">The Town Newspaper<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm42">Ragefire<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencytactics">The Town Tavern<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Adiminstration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Posting Status<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm28">Post for Changes<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm27">Trakanon<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm29">Cazic Thule<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm30">Sev <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm31">Zland<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm33">Tormax <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm34">Statue <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm36">Klandicar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm37">Sleeper's Tomb<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm38">Dain<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm39">Yelinak <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm40">Thought Horror OverFiend<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm43">Dozekar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Guild access requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#FFFF00> -
