<br>
Is your refusal to port my guildmates your attempt to 'win' some of this exchange? Y'know, because you aren't. <br>
<br>
Just checking, because I've noticed a sad lack of your witty conversation on the boards about this topic, and frankly, I'm saddened. I'd think that you would at least respond, as you did with the original poster. <br>
<br>
What's wrong? Afraid someone might, you know, drag your words out into the middle of the street and kick the shit out of them? <br>
<br>
It is, you know, very petty to be mad at one person, and take it out on their friends. But then, petty little jabs are what you're all about isn't it?<br>
<br>
Yers,<br>

Wow I feel special =).  I would have never expected this post to be this large.  I have cought no heat ingame from anyone about it.  Only people sending me tells saying that they have read what was on the RTA and they don't believe one word of it.<br>
<br>
I don't know the majority of you, so that only tell me that you don't know me and you’re posting on what you have read.  I understand that.  From how I acted previously I would think I was a monster too.<br>
<br>
Any who, I see I have a lot to reply to.  So I'll do it in order of the posts.  Scaleslayers being post number 1.  If any of you have half a brain I'm sure you can figure how I've set this up.<br>
(Not meaning that as insult to being the &quot;School Bully as someone stated&quot;)<br>
<br>
2. OMG you’re an ass!  However I can understand you being pissed off and speaking that way to him for accusing you of ninja looting.  /hug Fablaar<br>
<br>
4.  There was no petition made, because I did not ninja loot the ring.  If it were me, and someone ninja’s my ring, I would have petitioned and got it back instead of coming here and flaming false info.<br>
<br>
5.  As Dracthia stated <br>
&quot;he only looted it cause he tyient to steal the kill and didnt succueed. Then looks like he spammed the bod what an alt logged in to loot it who needed it. Seems to me sone greedy ass lvl 60 got what he wanted to MQ and turn some cash...&quot;<br>
<br>
I actually MQed the ring for my real life friend Locore.  He is a wizard just starting to quad and he needed the ring.  Otherwise I would not of KSed the lvl 55+ monk that doesn't even need jboots because he melee's and can FD any sight of trouble.<br>
<br>
6.  El'lar Dobluth - proud to be<br>
<br>
7.  I agree Lukieb, if he did get the kill, and allegedly had someone hovering over the corpse spamming to loot it.  He should of expected someone to ninja it.  Not saying that I did ninja it, just stating my opinion on how he should of approached the situation if it were the case.<br>
<br>
8. &quot;I am suprised at ya fab never expected something like that from you. You always been on of the cooler ones on the rathe. Well watch out on who ya group with now. As revenge may be aims at you. Good luck soloing&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for not making assumptions before realizing the whole story =) - That just shows what kind of a cleric you are to actually think about doing something like that. (referring to the disband, let me die, and no rez part)<br>
<br>
9.  *sigh* This ass clown is in El'lar Dobluth as stated further up the post.<br>
<br>
10.  I payed nine months of lvling for this character, and the price keeps going up everyday.<br>
<br>
11.  I answered your question in post number 25.  BTW I don't know who you are Senzii never seen/heard of ya to my knowledge.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure how Fablaar is now, the only experience I've had with him was many months ago. But its obvious that he hasn't changed much at all.&quot;  -  What happened did I ignore ya upon request for a port?  /shrug<br>
<br>
12.  Yes that is true.  Thanks for posting some true info.<br>
<br>
13.  Bogfather I don't know you, but from what I have discovered asking others on the rathe.  Your a dumb ass.  I'm not backing that up, I'm just going by what &quot;EVERYONE&quot; that I have asked as told me.  I also don't think its right you flaming me and you’re not even on the same server.  <br>
<br>
And yes I did cause a wipeout during that vindi raid he is talking about.  I was told by my guild leader to come into the arena and root the giants as I come.  It worked, but we had some miscommunication and I finally found the camp.  I did not train the camp, I died just before the camp so they could drag and rez me, but I guess someone aggroed the giants trying to save me or something.  When I was rezzed I apologized and took all blaim for something that was not my fault.<br>
<br>
So from this point on, I will skip all of Bogfathers posts.<br>
<br>
14.  &quot;Nice dude speak Fab, pfft, and gg on the button mashing ninjaloot, well earned I must say.<br>
<br>
Trust me Fab, what goes around comes around, especially when it hits the RTA and you do nothing but further your own image as an assclown.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ture.... who?  Any who, bro I don't know you and it's clear that your speaking on my anger post.  I understand that, I was an assclown.<br>
<br>
15.  Crystessia Vallaen - Don't know ya, but you obviously know me.  So I will respond.<br>
<br>
Wow seems things haven't changed with Fab. He was a ninja-looter, scammer, liar since myself and some friends ran into him in CB all those levels ago, and more than likely before that.<br>
<br>
Not sure how I'm a scammer or liar, but yes long ago when I was in the first 10 lvls of my wizard there was a bag sitting on a log.  I picked it up and started to leave the zone after someone told me that the guards would break my bones.  On my way out I saw someone shouting to the zone to give his bag back.  <br>
<br>
I had just came from Diablo 2.  Anyone who played that game knows that it's full of liars and scammers.  So I kept the bag and left the zone.  Again, that was before I realized how this game worked.  I am sorry for that, and I will gladly repay the owner of that bag x5 for my discretions.  I was wrong.<br>
<br>
Not real sure what happened in CB.  I also played nice after that situation with the bag.  I grouped and shared loot and was nice to everyone once I discovered that Everquest is not like Diablo 2.  That’s one of the reasons why I have stuck with this game.  It always pissed me off when I was scammed on Diablo.<br>
<br>
16.  &quot;Take it to the attention of the GM staff asap.&quot;  That was not done because I did not ninja loot the ring.  <br>
<br>
BloodCelt - I don't know you, infact never seen ya.  So the rest of your comments are based on my (as Turean stated) assclown post.  I understand.<br>
<br>
17.  Klurak - This is my public apology to you.  I'm sorry bro, I misread your post.  You were bashing Bogidiot.  Yes necros do own.  I have a lvl 52 necro myself.  And I wanted to say thanks again for doing those necro research spells for me.  And I always ported you for free.  Even when I saw you shouting to the zone Donating for a port to such and such.  I would send you a tell saying come to me bro I'll port ya for free.  Just wanted to let ya know, that still stands.  Sorry again.<br>
<br>
18.  Roggulbuk - I understand your anger.  I insulted you in front of your old ED members in ToV that you left like they meant nothing to you.  I understand why you’re bashing me so much, but I know that it's coming from me insulting you.  So I'm just going to ignore your comments like I'm ignoring Bogfather.<br>
<br>
19.  Moonglum - Yes, the guild leader and officers all talked to me individually.  They all heard my side of the story.  Haisama (the nazi of the guild =P) even got my phone number for a voice conversation.  These guys are serious about there guild and strive for a good rep.  I have been on several raids when they helped other guilds with CRs, but do they post on here listing all the CRs that they have done for people to embarrass them?  No they do not, because they respect others and know that things happen.  I have never known El’lar Dobluth to turn down a CR for another guild.  As other guilds should do the same.  So please stop bashing El’lar Dobluth, they are in the right.<br>
<br>
20.  Pshh /ignore Cecilsuth I’ve already explained myself to his post in post #25.  He once acted my friend but now I see the truth.<br>
<br>
21.  Bogidiot post - skipped<br>
<br>
22.  Yes crack is bad.<br>
23.  I agree.<br>
<br>
24.  Apology accepted<br>
<br>
25.  My post - skipped<br>
<br>
26.  Nicolai IronCross – *sigh*<br>
<br>
27.  vyxn – yes I do seem an ass.  It’s just I always understood SRO as an FFA.  Which it is and you guys have explained the rules of FFA and I understand now.  I should have posted flames on all the times that I was KSed for the AC.  I KSed Scaleslayer and I am sorry.  It was wrong I know that now that everyone has bitch about it repeatedly.  I was only doing what I thought was in the right.<br>
<br>
28.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
29.  Ture……. Who?<br>
<br>
30.  My post – Yes I’m the hardcore newb for not knowning the rules of FFA.  I’m the type of guy that learns from watching.  And from watching everyone KS everyone for the AC.  That’s what I thought was right, but I have been educated now and I know what is right.<br>
<br>
31.  Ture…… who?<br>
<br>
32.  I stated why I needed the ring further up this post.<br>
<br>
33.  But then again your just the offspring of some Yama.  Are you referring to the guild Yamabushi?  Aka Shadows of Yamabushi?  I happen to like that guild.  I have several friends in that guild and I don’t really appreciate you making fun of them.  LOL another proud member of Roggulbuk’s guild.  – If your not referring to yama than I apologize.<br>
<br>
34.  Thanks for calling me an idiot and you don’t even know me.  You have been added.<br>
<br>
35.  Wow Dracthia do you ever play Everquest?  Because 40% of these posts are from you.<br>
<br>
36.  I don’t know you Harwulf or never seen you – So I’m basing your post upon #2, and I understand why you feel the way you do.<br>
<br>
37.  Senzii – Don’t know ya either, so ya know – I understand.<br>
<br>
38.  Wow finally a piece of truth - /hug Fablaar – Keep flaming him guys!<br>
<br>
39.  Morlen – lol I know how ya feel Morlen.  I don’t have MB yet, but I will.<br>
<br>
40.  Don’t know ya Tzuten and you don’t know me. <br>
“So with &quot;The great Oz's logic&quot; ...<br>
<br>
Ninja Looting is Bad<br>
BUT<br>
Kill Stealing is Good<br>
<br>
ahhh... I can see where we of the Rathe might get confused, our most HUMBLE apologies oh Great and merciful OZ... please please do not take me off your most honored of lists of Porting me about or TLing me... I will just not know what to do with myself.<br>
<br>
FORGIVE US!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
-Tzuten”<br>
<br>
You have been forgiven =P.<br>
<br>
Actually Ninja looting is HORRIBLE – Kill stealing is HORRIBLE – but in SRO there is always KSing implied upon the AC.  I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Someone decided to make a flame about it.  Which I should of done upon the first time I was KSed, or maybe the second time, or maybe the third time, or maybe the fourth, and so on.<br>
<br>
41.  Radyn – “Hey Fablaar, you might remember me, as I was the one who turned you in to Mountain Priests when you pulled your @#%$ in BB.”<br>
<br>
WTF dude?  I don’t know you, never heard of you.  I don’t damn sure don’t remember anything happening in Butcher Block.  Crack is bad mmkay.  Please stop the crack before it burns what is left of your memory.  And I was never booted from MPD, so it must not of been bad.<br>
<br>
“Just for the record, do us all a favor and don't offer to port anyone in Steel Talons of Rathe. Being a respectable guild we don't like to associate with your ilk. Hell, you've been on OUR hate list for almost a year now!  ”<br>
Steel Talons of Rathe guild even exist?  I don’t think I have ever seen any of you.  Personally bro, I think you have the wrong guy.  IMO<br>
<br>
42.  Kathartic Don’t know ya, never heard of ya.  But you being the guild leader of the guild of the person of whom I KSed.  I will leave your post as is.  Because of course you have no choice but to flame me.<br>
<br>
43.  Ture…… Who?<br>
<br>
44.  That is true Dovelyn.  Don’t know ya still though =P<br>
<br>
45.  Pahraith – Don’t know you, never heard of you.  So I am basing your opinion on the knowledge that you have obtained from my previous posts.  I understand your feelings.  I would not like me either.<br>
<br>
46.  Bogidiot post<br>
<br>
47.  Senzii I don’t know you bro.  How could you know/seen my type?  WTF dude, don’t judge me until you know me.  <br>
48.  Sorry for you having to do that Jathan.  I will gladly compensate the loss to the guild bank.<br>
<br>
49.  /ignore Cecilsuth – “P.S- I dont have an ignore list and i always port for free  hehe”<br>
Well I do bro, and you’re the only one on it.<br>
<br>
50.  Bogidiot - skipped<br>
<br>
51.  Jurrasic, your pics are comical until that point.  That is not right posting a picture of a child with a syndrome that he could not prevent.  It wasn’t his fault his parents had a defect reproductive system.  Therefore you shouldn’t make fun of that person.  You really are the lowest of the lowest.  You’re the type that makes fun of others with faults to make yourself feel better.  /ignore Jurrasic well cecil your not the only one.<br>
<br>
And we will now refer to Jurrasic as the devil and skip his posts too.<br>
<br>
52.  Pashun – Yet another one that I thought was my friend.  She doesn’t know the whole story so I wont hold her post against her.  Yes I already admitted I was wrong.<br>
<br>
53.  Yes I was wrong.<br>
<br>
54.  nINAFALCHON – Don’t know ya, never seen ya.  I don’t think it’s right you judging me calling me a prick, but I know you are calling me a prick on what you have read from my previous posts.  Yes I was a prick.  <br>
<br>
55.  Teknonurd – /agree<br>
<br>
56.  Teknonurd - /agree<br>

57.  Jurassic – The devil - skipped<br>

59.  Bogidiot - skipped<br>

60.  Dreger – “fablar is a prick, always has been a prick, and always will be a prick...nuff said”<br>
<br>
Don’t know you, never heard of ya.  Don’t know how you could judge me as being a prick seeing the situation.  It’s obvious that I either A) Ignored you for a port B) You just wanted to get your name listed in the thread.<br>
<br>
61.  mayorcakes – Ekac thanks for saying I was a nice guy.  I am the same guy as fablaar was when he was first created.  And yes I did appear to have a major handicap or a brain tumor the size of Alaska in my previous posts.<br>
<br>
62.  Krake – Hiya Krake, not sure if your meaning this toward me offensively or defensively.<br>
<br>
63.  Mista Miyagi – I “magically come here at the exact same time someone posted a flame about him, so he can reply to it BEFORE any of the normal people that troll these boards could... /boggle.” Because a friend of mine told me about the post.  I asked for the URL.<br>
<br>
I don’t hate the RTA, I think it’s a nice thing you guys have going for setting up rotation mobs.  I just hate the people of RTA that judge people without even knowing them, and post pictures of children with disabilities.<br>
<br>
64.  Dreger – “mayorcakes i had seen fablaar alot through my days of EQ, he was a prick when i was 20, he was a prick whe n iwas 38, he was a prick when i was 47 and he was a prick when i wrote this post, fablaar is truely a prick....im sorry if someone disagree's but this is my true feeling. I think it is great for ellar to offer a MQ ring, but it still doesnt hide the fact that fablaar stole something and then laughed about it. Im not saying my record is as clean as a whistle, but when i did something i did it accidentally, and didnt follow up by mocking whomever it was taken from<br>
Final Note- I still say fablaar is a Grade A Di`ck”<br>
<br>
Yet again another person that I do not know or even heard of, but yet I am a prick to them.  Did I ignore you for a port too?

If I have labeled your post as Irrelevant, it doesn’t mean that I am speaking ill toward it.  It just means that the post has no meaning toward the topic and I feel I don’t have any need to reply to it.<br>
<br>
I realize that my reply will make some angry, sad, and who knows maybe some happy.  I just want to say that I know what I did and I know it was wrong and I’m sorry.  It was a simple mis understanding of the rules.  I have been KSed several times in SRO for the AC with witnesses, no one has said anything about it being wrong or petitioned, so I figured it was ok to KS the AC in SRO.  Sure KSing any other mob is bad.  It’s just the way everyone acted in SRO that made me act in the same matter.  I don’t want to be labeled the bad guy, but if you decide that’s what I am, then that’s your decision.  My EQ experience hasn’t changed since this post, and probably wont.  I’m just trying to clear up all misconception and rumors spread throughout this post.  Another thing, my guild has not requested me to do this.  Any of my replies does not represent ED any at all.  I have made this post upon my own free will.  If you choose to bash it, or make childish remarks in anyway that’s your choice.  It only reflects on your character as a person.  Thanks for taking the time to read my post, sorry for any inconvienience I may have cause you, your guild, or your friends.  That is all.<br>

What a loser. Welcome to my ignore list. I dont even want to PRETEND I know this guy with all that server alienation he just did.<br>
<br>
And Im not sure whats funnier, the fact that he thinks he's got server support in hating Bogfather, the fact that Roggulbuk is &quot;replying out of anger to you him&quot;, he took the time to hit backspace everytime he typed &quot;Bogfather&quot; and wrote &quot;idiot&quot;, or just the fact that he picked apart every single poster here. What a douche bag.<br>
<br>
Replying out of anger? Dude, your a dick. Thats pretty much the basis for ALL of our replys. You're a dick and you're not welcome on our server. In the end, nobodys angry. One of us lost a meaningless AC ring. You lost an entire server. I know you have..umm..&quot;friends&quot;....or whatever...so...have fun with...&quot;them&quot;. <p><a href=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Database/scripts/character-page.php?charid=5>Kluz</a><br><embed src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Flash/kluzsig.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="200" height="150"></embed><br><a href=http://www.fallenshadows.cjb.net>Fallen Shadows</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 509<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/30/02 6:10:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=727.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hello again.</span><hr size=1> My god....<br>

<br>
So, you admit that both KillStealing and Ninja Looting is bad. But you are saying that in South Ro when it pertains to the Ancient Cyclops spawn Kill Stealing, it is correct.<br>
<br>
As for me not knowing you, you are mistaken. You have come here and opened that silly pie hole you call your mouth (and which others would call your ass), and express your feelings in your posts. How else would we get to you know? Take your ass out for drinks and a movie? The words you put here give everyone and insight to the type of player and person you are.<br>
<br>
I just love your little comment about your decree that it is right to KS the monk seeing that your little wizard friend just started quading so he needs it more, you know my brother just got his license to drive and that guy who has 3 cars across the way from me, doesn't need them as much as my brother, hell that guy just takes the train to work everyday.<br>
<br>
From your final words on this subject I can see that you must have been KSed in the past and seeing that it happened to you, you have some warped sense that it is ok to do the same to everyone else.<br>
<br>
Well done you have in one post what the 150+ other posts  failed to do, is to make you without a doubt one of the biggest assholes on this server!<br>

I happen to NOT know how to post pics or links in forums, I haven't asked anyone how but I think it brings fun to this scumhole when Jurrasic slaps some pics into the forum so fuck off ninja-looting, whiney fuck !<br>

P.S. If showing a pic of a retarded kid bothers you, don't call Jurrasic the devil because you are a hypersensitive daisy picking momma's boy. I know it's not your fault that you are a Jerry's kid and they got you EQ for Christmas at the home, but get over this gay ass Christian way of slapping the label &quot;devil&quot; on everything that you don't agree with.

Hey fuckstick, get your facts straight: I've only even been in one guild: Clan Bashemded.<br>

El'lar Dobluth members, for the most part, are my *friends* not former guildmembers. <br>
<br>
And for the record, you have to *say* something to insult me.<br>

As for ignoring my comments, the rest of the RTAs can see it for the pitiful attempt of someone 'losing' the argument because they were wrong to start. <br>

Sad that someone could be so clueless, so self-absorbed.   Sadder still that a guild would support your childish attitude.   I'll use a few quotes from your post and place them in proper context for you.<br>
<br>
&quot;yes long ago when I was in the first 10 lvls of my wizard there was a bag sitting on a log. I picked it up and started to leave the zone after someone told me that the guards would break my bones. On my way out I saw someone shouting to the zone to give his bag back.  I had just came from Diablo 2. Anyone who played that game knows that it's full of liars and scammers. So I kept the bag and left the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the same guy as fablaar was when he was first created.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll use a few more of your own words to try and help you...<br>
<br>
&quot;Alas, the mirror has been pointed at you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It only reflects on your character as a person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;grow up and gain some respect for others. You just made your guild look bad.&quot;<br>

THIS IS JUST A GAME YOU LOSERS!!!
its sad that everyone gets this worked up over this game... you all have issues if you take it this seriously... i find in quite amuzing...[/quote]<br>
<br>
Since most of us are sitting behind computers, I doubt many of us are veins bulging from the neck angry. I can easily type of many comments, views and opinions which I am passionate about without getting worked up. I never get worked up over anything online because it is a game. Sure my posts can seem angry but they are just words, there are no tone of voice or body language to show that I'm actually upset or worked up, its because I'm usually very calm when writing.<br>
<br>
[quote]
YOU WILL ALL DIE ALONE!! [/quote]<br>
<br>
There are two ways to view this. On a hear/soul/spiritual level I won't die alone espcially since I am married with a happy with many friends I find it highly unlikely that will happen. On the other side when I do eventually die I do hope it is alone, as in the physical sense we all die alone. I hope that it doesn't involve mass death around me some accident but is instead just myself passing on. <p><br>

Yup, I was there. I was also very humble about the situation, I said I was sorry to everyone involved, and I helped Trompen camp and kill Ragefire.. And, I did this without being threatened by my guild! What a concept!!<br>
<br>
I really could care less about the AC ring. It's not the ninja-looting that's an issue, anymore. It's Fablaar's bullshit, sophomoric, school-yard bully attitude. If he'd have just apologized, this would be an entirely different thread.<br>
