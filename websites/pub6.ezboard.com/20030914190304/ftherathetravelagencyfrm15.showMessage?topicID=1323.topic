That cleric that CH's a 9k hp warrior at 65 percent health and complains he's always oom. That ranger that just watches an add kill the cleric while he does nothing about it. Casters that don't know how to manage their aggro and ping pong the mobs all over camp. Just a few examples.<br>
<br>
Much of the newer population grew up with virtue/focus/C3 as a perma buff from level 20-60. I'm thrilled that SoE recognized this as a problem and changed the group buffs to be level restricted. But from what I've seen, it's to late.<br>
<br>
With PoP exp comes much faster. People go from 45 to 60+ in a matter of a few days to a few weeks. I was blown away by a 62 cleric that had never stepped foot into Seb. Is the lack of the dungeon crawl experience with chain pulling, add management, and self-reliance gone forever? Perhaps the new expansion will bring this back and not be a total waist of time like LoY.<br>
<br>
I'm also sorry to wave goodbye to the natural guild progression. Going from farming whatever dropped loot that your guild could kill, to hate/fear/sky, to ToV, and Dain, doing ring wars, Jeffersoning up to luclin. Farming UP, heading to Sssra and Seru, and spending the 100's of hours in VT drooling all over yourself. It's already been proven that a guild can make it to the elementals with little to no farming.<br>
<br>
In closing all I'm talking about are people missing 90 percent of this game for that 10 percent of the easy ass Plains of Power. The next time you bitch about players like Jiriki training BoT, did you help put him there by buffing him with C3/Virtue/etc when he was leveling and depriving him the experience that is EQ?<br>

<br>
well that depends what mobs you are fighting.<br>
<br>
As for skipping some farming, it has always been like that since... well since always. Let me explain myself. pre-kunark release, you had the top 3 guilds of any server that was farming vox and naggy. Why? well because they didnt have anything to do. The guilds following didnt have that level to fight vox and naggy. Kunark comes out, the top 3 guilds move up. Following guilds are finally able to kill vox and naggy, but they dont farm them as much as other guilds, for the single reason that there is much interesting stuff to do in kunark, and they can do it. so they move up too, but they spent little time farming vox and naggy.<br>
<br>
Same thing for every expansion. However, the big difference between other expansions releases and PoP release was that the high end of luclin was SO BORING to do, that some guilds said &quot;hey, we CAN skip it, so lets do it, not gonna smash my head on boring camps&quot;<br>
<br>
However, i agree you that player progression is wayu way easier. I logged my first toon few days ago, a lvl 21 wizard i spent 6 months to raise at that level <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  With the uber green newbie guild robe and a fine steel staff. best gear i had was the +6 int rings <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But... I think the need to have the progression made easier was NECESSARY to have our guilds, and EQ in general survive. Without that, big guilds could not renew their roster i think.<br>
<br>
Finally, not an insult, dont take it bad please, but your little rant made me think of old people saying &quot;blah, it was better at my time&quot; vs young people saying &quot;pffft you old dumbass&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=desseray>desseray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/31/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1323.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leveling and player skill.</span><hr size=1> This looks so familiar... but I...

<br>
1.  Give them constructive criticism and teach them the things they need to learn to help the group, learn their class, and generally progress in the game.<br>
<br>
2.  Explain that they are a newb retard and need to go back to KC while showing them the group remove button.<br>
<br>
3.  Say nothing while adding to your level of frustration with the lack of skilled players present these days.  <br>
<br>
If you chose the 3rd one, I have no sympathy.  If you have a clueless newb in your group help them in one way or another.  Try to explain things they need to understand/realize or show them the door.  If they keep getting kicked out of groups because they have no clue what they are doing (and are TOLD that) then they will eventually get the hint.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarien>Xarien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/31/03 3:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1323.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leveling and player skill.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>-That cleric that CH's a 9k hp warrior at 65 percent health and complains he's always oom.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I remember, when I was level 5.  I used to fear befallen.  That music used to give me the shakes, I used to not want to turn every corner, for fear that something even more terrible was around the corner.  I remember when I then returned at level 16, venturing further.  I reached 22, and headed down, and some friends and I took on the place.  It was great.  There was a sense of accomplishment.  I remember travelling from qeynos to freeport.  To think, that these people now have the PoK books, and the buffs, and the easier-to-get-gear (look at how cheap some things are now with the bazaar.), and the paludals and the echos to hardcore-powerlevel themselves on. <br>
<br>
Sebilis? I remember Sebilis.  Now there was a real dungeon.  I'd take it any day over the monotony of PoV, or the trainerific qualities of BoT, if it had the exp to draw me back.   Velks wasn't so good.  I remember that place being as painful to play in as it was white, unless you got the village, castle, or pit camps.  <br>
<br>
Even today, as Kale, I still wonder around the world, just seeing what I can and can't do. Like, when Droga came out, I went down there and my own, admiring the place, and remembering my greenmist camp.  Just exploring a bit.  These people will probably never do it, or do it, and die because they have the smarts of a piece of cheese, or because they don't know the fine art of getting out of a tight space <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WITHOUT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> training a zone - I shit you not, I've met a level 55 cleric who didn't know how what Divine Aura did.  <br>

I think putting in the book portals is handy, and I love em, but it also takes 50% of the game away, learning how to get places, and dealing with the dangers inbetween your bindpoint and your destination. (And sometimes dealing with the dangers inbetween as you went to recollect your gear. =p )<br>

I've had druids evac my group before because we got 3 adds in seb, just because we didn't have an enchanter or bard, but we had a couple of root-capable classes there... including the druid... there's a lack of improvisation capable players out there nowadays. &quot;If you don't have a mezzer, you can't possibly have a good group.&quot; &quot;If you don't have C3 all the time, you may as well not even play.&quot; Blah blah blah.<br>

The game for me was a lot like most things in life. It's all exciting the first few times around, but over time it gets old. Making my first run from Kelethin to Kaladim being lead by a person who had been playing all of 3 weeks before me was a rush. OOO! Look at that basilisk! It just got old. And I never got uber.

I should have just let myself sink while I pulled off a gate spell but I started to panic and couldn't think of anything intelligent.<br>
<br>
Finally, fortune has smiled upon me as I have spotted an island. I swim toward it gleefully thinking &quot;Yay I will get to land and just gate out and try this again&quot;. All of a sudden I am being slashed and bitten by a Raptor ! I shout &quot;What the hell is with these underwater Raptors close to this island?&quot; Some random guy in zone shouts &quot;Oh, once in a while their pathing gets messed up and they sit out in the water and just spin in circles&quot;. <br>
<br>
I am taking tons of damage every few seconds and scared to lose my corpse so I try to time my gate inbetween it's bites but the cast time is a (5) on it and it is biting me too slow and my channeling skill isn't doing shit for me and i'm getting pissed so I say fuck it and let him finish me off since my swim skill was sickly low and I would never make it to that island about 50 feet away. I die.<br>
<br>
I'm now at my bind point so I go get a Chipped Bone Rod and Bat Wings and Fish Scales from my bank and sow up, buff up, levitate up, EB up, invis up, and get back on that raft in Oasis when it finally gets there. I then ride it back to Timorous Deep and that raft correctly enters the zone and I leap off of it click the C.B. Rod and faces me in the direction of my corpse. I am floating and have EB on and sowed and invisible and heading to it. I get kinda near the area where I died and click the C.B. Rod again and re-invis and go under water looking for the corpse. I use my 3rd charge on it then finally see the corpse so I swim to it and begin to loot it (causing invis to drop) and that same guy shouts &quot;Be careful of the Sea Dragon that sees invis&quot; so I almost piss myself thinking its close to me (just my mind playing tricks on me) and panic and loot it up and gate out.<br>
<br>
FUCKING BOATS ! I think this event took off about 3 hours of exp time and made my heartbeat irregular the rest of the day.<br>

<br>
I went in there and got in a beedroom group and wiped more times than I can count that night but I had a blast. I can never remember myself getting a bigger adrenilin rush in any game I have ever played. That hasn't happned in a long time<br>
<br>
Your right this game is more of a chat client nowadays. When I group in pop the only times I have trouble playing my class is when I start drifting asleep or southpark is on. The challenge in the game is gone. <br>
<br>
I enjoy some of the pop raiding mobs but that is diffrent. a few hours of &quot;focus please&quot; and &quot;malo, slow, malo, slow, malo, slow&quot; gets old no matter what mob your fighting. Nowadays I find myself soloing in seb or trying to find mobs that were uber to solo for fun. Like that iksar in DL. I do have to give props on 1 pop camp though. PoTactics pit. <br>

Ah yep, some fun memoris over the past 2 weeks...<br>

Seriously, this is a different game to when I started in June 99.  No way I'd still be playing if the very original game was all we had now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=halfbakedcleric>Halfbaked Cleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/1/03 5:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1323.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   /agree</span><hr size=1> I'll have to agree with you guys on these points, I've played since about 2 months before Kunark came out, and I remember my friend being a 43 ogre war, and him grouping in Lguk like ALWAYS. Now you're lucky to see a group down there, mostly people farming faction for Wood elf illusion helm.<br>
<br>
But I remember the Sebilis groups they were so fun, always getting adds, and always thinking of new ways to get out of sticky situations. They're was almost like a list you went down for adds, mez? no chanters, root? ok rooting isn't working, slow and just take the extra dmg? ok that works well enough, and if all else fails evac? no evac'er, DIE. Most of these camps in all these pop zones are close enough to a zone out that people just train and kill everyone else. In Sebilis you were never close to a zone out, except in a few camps so it wouldn't of mattered, I sincerely hope LDoN is worth it, and has all these dungeon crawl experiences. Those are the most fun.<br>
<br>
And in my past 2 months I've only had fun, and I mean some REAL fun, on the bertox event (you get adds, you've got adds, and 15 more are inc, with a named that hits hard and procs a 5k lifetap, deal with it.... ah I love it) and tonight in VT when an Eom Thall gated bringing about 7 or 8 adds (waked me up out of almost a dead sleep). Yeah, being a cleric on raids is always increasingly boring unless we're fighting a named that does something cool like AE silence or something, I love those raids where 5 MT's die and you've got like 1 dps over the mobs regen dropping him 1% every 5 minutes, but you still win.<br>

I am not disagreeing with anyone here, I myself think that the game has become too Uber for itself.  Too many people have it too easy... go buy anything you want in the Bazaar, if you can afford it.  And most of those items we thought of as Uber in the past (FBSS, RBG, etc) are now a few plat out of pocket and you are set for your level 1 alt.<br>
<br>
What I did recently was take my level 10 Enchanter down to Befallen with a group and we went with our own wits and whatever we had on our backs.  I do not know who had what gear, for myself, I had some gear that gave me added int but still nothing special.  Our tank was even a new player who didn't know much about the game.<br>
<br>
We managed to get down the first ramp and then we wiped.  It would have been interesting to see if we could have gotten the corpses with a Tank who managed to zone out, another member who died just after she got back through the first locked door as backup, a Nekkid Cleric and a Nekkid Chanter.  Lots of yellows at level 10 in Befallen.<br>
<br>
But attempting to do the CR ourselves did not manifest itself.  One of the group members pulled out their 65 Cleric and ressed us, and I pulled out my 61 Thief and went to find the corpses.  Takes some of the fun out of trying to do it yourself but oh well... maybe next time.  It tends to make you not worry so much about dying when you can get your corpse because you have the means to do it with an alt.<br>
<br>
What was surprising, and for me a nice thing to hear, was the 65 Cleric saying that she would have liked to have stayed with us and dungeon crawl Befallen again but was called to a Raid.  Sometimes being Uber isn't as fun as it was when you were lower level.<br>
