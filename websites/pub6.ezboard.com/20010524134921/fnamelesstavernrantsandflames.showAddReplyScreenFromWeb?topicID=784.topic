Clinton certainly had some moral issues.  No question.  Actually very similar to JFK in terms of that with the plethora of women and iffy friends.  But Clinton wasn't martyred like JFK so time will only tell what he is remembered for.  Still, Clinton was an excellent President.  And I know it gauls you to see what he accomplished in office, Mindia.  <br>
<br>
But before you start bashing the list of iffy friends and such of Clinton, you should do some research and get the whole story.  Unfortunately for us, most politicians are, generally speaking, ethically scumbags like lawyers.  They run in bad circles and lie in bed with some questionable people to get money/support/etc. to win an election.  Politicians are generally weasels and it is very common to have someone in your administration or friends to have legal issues while in office.  <br>
<br>
So you have made a lovely list.  And that is great.  And if you take that at face value it looks pretty bad.  But if you *compare* it to all the Presidents of the 20th century, it falls just above average.  In fact Mr. Boy Scout Much Too Nice to Be An Effective President Carter is the only President without a fairly questionable list. <br>
<br>
And if you look at ALL the lists, there are 2 Presidents this last century that have had FAR more indictments/jail convictions among their administration/friends than any other.  And it isn't even close.  <br>
<br>
Reagan -- most indictments, second most jail time.  <br>
Nixon -- second most indictments, most jail time.<br>
<br>
I know you have deified Reagan in other posts, so that must be hard to swallow, Mindia.  So before you start slamming Clinton, you should take a few shots at 2 worst offenders.<br>
<br>
Oh, sorry, I guess we should forgive Reagan.  If I recall, he just couldn't seem to remember or didn't know what his cabinet/associates were doing -- EVER.  <br>
<br>
And W. isn't exactly a saint (hard core partyer, infidelity, and a slew of drunk driving issues [although just one conviction]).  In fact, Gore IS a saint if you ethically compared him to W. so that seems a bit of an odd twist of fate.  Bash on Clinton for his morals and then support W. over Gore.</font><P>Cazan Planewalker<BR>

<br>
GWB graduated from Yale with a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then returned to Texas and joined the Texas Air National Guard, where he learned to fly fighter jets. Yep, he was a Jet Fighter Pilot. <br>
<br>
The early 70's he admittedly 'partied' and so I really wouldn't deem that a failure of his life. Oh, and he entered Harvard Business School, earning his M.B.A. in 1975. Again, not a bad accomplishment and the last time I checked they didnt hand out MBA's in Harvard just for bloodlines, even if it isn't the easiest place in the world to get into. .<br>
<br>
In 1977 He entered the oil business. If you have a clue regarding that decade you can understand what the gas/oil situation became. The reason he got out of this venture is because he was elected to public office in 1978. He ended up merging and SELLING this business for a considerable profit. Please know the facts before you post superflous bullshit<br>
<br>
Yep, he was a partner in the purchase of the Texas Rangers, where he paid 600k and walked away with 15 million. Not too shabby.<br>
<br>
He literally destroyed Ann Richards in the 1994 Election in Texas. In November of 1998, Bush became the first Texas Governor to be elected to consecutive four-year terms. Texas is a melting pot state, so that alone speaks volumes regarding his leadership abilites. It requires true leadership, unlike the Northeastern states where all that is needed is a name and referencing liberal buzzwords.<br>
<br>
His actions while President will determine his legacy, but please don't slant and bullshit his past without at least some semblance of accuracy.</font><P><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=59620> Kyojitsu Tenkanho</a><BR>

That's it for now.  What do you think?  Coincidences?  Or, does it show you what lengths our scumbag former President will go to cover his ass.  In particular, the cleverness comes with the many different ways these people were killed, to prevent any type of pattern.  So, in that regard clinton did have (some) smarts.  You be the judge.<br>

So Tossica, tell me... Are you saying it's ok for slick willie to have done these things, just because you think, (and I use that term lightly) that George Bush has had people killed to cover HIS ass because he was the director of the CIA?   PLEASE say it isn't so...<br>

I think it may be best for you to take all your precious firearms and family values and move in to seclusion somewhere out in the country so all the aids infected, black, homosexual, pot smoking, baby killing, bible burning, hippies can't harm you and your vision of our country. Everyone lives their life the way YOU say they should? What kind of America is that? <br>
<br>
Freedom of choice.<br>
<br>
ALL POLITICIANS are evil, lieing, crooked, deceiving, backstabbing bastards. Yes, even your beloved Bush.<br>
Clinton was a lieing bastard just like every president before him and most likely any in the future.<br>

Point is... it doesn't matter what color you are, but I have made the decision to choose my friends carefully.  I do not hang out with liberals or homosexuals.  I choose to associate myself with Conservative people because we have a lot in common.  I do have 2 friends that are democrats, but they are Conservative democrats.  <br>

To those of you who like to keep throwing Hitler out on the board... Fuck you too.  You fools keep trying to associate Conservative Americans with Nazis and Hitler.

<br>
Well, I do have all kinds of info and quotes and know far too well all of the background of both W. and Gore.  And I never ever pull anything out of my ass -- I always make sure I have the facts before I spout them off.  <br>
<br>
And sorry to Cats, I misread and thought you meant W. got his BA from Harvard.  So you were right.  But if you look at his record, the Harvard degree barely counts so generally you think of him only having the one degree.<br>
<br>
I wish I had more time to quote more and reference more, but will see what I can do during my break.  Why I get into these no-win debates is beyond me.  Reminds me of Mac vs. PC debates, but alas.<br>
<br>
Bush was rejected into every school he applied to after Yale (which he was also originally rejected to).  Derek Bok, President of Harvard during Bush's enrollment there had a very interesting interview with CNN just before he left Harvard in 1991.  He was there talking about his legacy at Harvard and accomplishments and crap and talk turned to W. briefly (His father was in office at the time and was currently in another campaign).  When asked if he remembered W.:<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a long time ago, but I certainly remember.  I can remember he and his family being very proud when he received his honorary degree.&quot;<br>
<br>
When corrected that it wasn't an honorary degree but an actual MBA, he said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I will always consider it an honorary degree and that is about what it is worth.  I don't like to talk about his time here, and let's not worry about all that now.  What is done is done.&quot;<br>
<br>
From then on out he refused to answer any more questions about W. and his time at Harvard.  Go ahead and dig into his Harvard education.  It is pretty worthless from admissions to graduation.  I don't have time to dig into the references now because I have other points to hit.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as his time in the National Guard goes.  That is certainly an odd point to hit considering it is something the Bush camp likes to avoid.  It certainly came at a very &quot;convenient&quot; time for him to get into it, and there is a quote somewhere from his superior there that goes something like &quot;he was quite simply one of the worst pilots we have ever had, but we were under orders to get him flying and keep him certified.  You wouldn't believe what it took to get him to understand basic aerodynamics.&quot;  I wish I had the exact quote because that isn't perfect, but it is close.<br>
<br>
When he beat Ann Richards in 1994 he garnered 53.5 percent of the vote.  Which is a far cry from destroyed.  He certainly did make history by winning back to back terms though.<br>
<br>
I don't have much time left, but you *really* don't want to go into his shady business dealings and his failings.  The way he made money at oil was pretty despicable and he is lucky his father intervened to avoid problems from the SEC.  Even his oil business partners told him that he was a terrible businessman and despite losing millions of dollars due to him, it was &quot;well worth it&quot;.  His baseball ownership was a joke.  Getting made partner even though he only kicked in 600K.  He made a ton of money off the taxpayers (very similar to the dealings of Clinton's Real Estate deals which were also despicable), and then refusing to pay Arlington the $7.5 million they owed after they sold the team.   <br>
<br>
I guess a quick synopsis can be found here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news_wire/bushboys.html">www.motherjones.com/news_...hboys.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
but there are similar ones at WSJ and the National Review.<br>
<br>
I will certainly give Bush his chance, but he is pretty close to the worst qualified President ever (although why I start being politically correct now is beyond me).  I am pretty firmly in the middle ground between Democrat and Republican, and I try to be neutral in these things, but objectively speaking, he is a pretty horrendous.  Dole was a far superior candidate.  But now he is elected so we will sit back and see what he does from here on out (although getting on the bad side of Alan Greenspan is not a good way to start out).</font><P>Cazan Planewalker<BR>
