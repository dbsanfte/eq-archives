I don't play on the Rathe but have followed this debate from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Jamany, the BB guilds would only get the epic loot not any of the normal loot from the zone... so they aren't getting all the good loot if you have to call them in.<br>
<br>
This calendar system thats being put together is one of the best I've seen post in it's fairness to all involved.The Uber Guild on my server could give a rat's ass about the rest of us and jumps calender dates on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
Rewena and everyone else working on this calendar,you deserve a big round of applause and thank you's from the people here.Makes me wish I was on the Rathe rather than Fennin Ro.<br>
<br>
Well that was my little pro calendar speil.I hope everything works out for the Rathe and I'll still lurk here when work is boring <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  </font><P>Kendryck Dragonheart <br>

<br>
Jamany, I do not understand your idea. However I very much appreciate the fact that you chose to think of a solution instead of just complaining about the problems.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me throw this out there.<br>
<br>
If we wish to make a calender system that works for all then why not work it this way.<br>
<br>
Anyone may be a posting entity...however, you may only go to a plane once every two weeks.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
So how does this work? We have a calendar where an unlimited amount of people sign up for indiviual days? <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you have them submit a list of who is going and keep tabs,&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you volunteering to do this?<br>
<br>
&quot;this would limit any ONE person from going too often and would allow any and all to book a date on the calender. It just means someone would have to keep track and with computers it wouldn't be that hard.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't picture what you propose, can you try to explain it some more =)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I think this is a fair way to allow 6-60 people to go to the planes without allowing them to go all the time and without allowing the BB guilds to get all the good loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think the *good loot* part is covered by the following post to yours. In the bb arrangement as it is now, they hardly get all the good loot.<br>
<br>
When I was in Fear this week, due to the long patch Cazic was up and we had to start late. Many, including me had to leave at midnight. CiW was called in. Cazic dropped all kinds of loot, but not one epic quest peice. CiW left with only the Shissar head.  <br>
<br>
Do you understand exactly how these rules work and apply? I'm not trying to degrade you, I want to hear your ideas, but I want to make sure you understand the current plan and how it works <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think it would be possible to code a sign up list, for independants etc, but I'd like to hear more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

1) You are requiring everyone to be honest.  That has already been proven to be impossible.<br>
2) You are requiring someone every day to keep an accurate list of people who go to the plane.  Possible but very tedious.<br>
3) You are requiring for someone on the calendar to post this information.  Possible.<br>

These would be the only people going.  Then, if it is found that someone else had gone, you cut them out for the next rotation entirely.<br>
<br>
Put a limit of how many times in say a month they are allowed to go.  But this way all will be able to go and if someone wants a date but doesn't have enough people to go you can have a code on the calender so others can put their names on it.<br>
<br>
I would be willing to do the paperwork on it.  But if the calender is put up right, any and all could see who was going and who was on the list.<br>
<br>
I am just tired of the fights and the arguments.  I did not intend to start a war with my post but even though I am a member of a posting entity I still do not agree with the system.  Everyone assumes I am just a solo person.  This is not the case.  I play because I enjoy it and restrictions like these are things that ruin the game.  Your 40 people is just too many and for those that do not have guilds or chose to do semi solo missions you are asking them to go against what they chose to do to fit into your calender.  These things just aren't fair.  The above allows ALL to go and ALL to have a chance to post to it without the restrictions.<br>

<br>
What if i sign up for a raid, i am on for 15 minutes, and then I have a real life emergency, and have to leave?<br>
<br>
What if i'm signed up but never log in?<br>
<br>
what if someone signs me up and I don't show up?<br>
<br>
What if someone's name isn't on the list but they show up at the last minute?<br>
<br>
Who is going to monitor the people in the plane every night to make sure nobody is in there who shouldn't be?<br>
<br>
And the biggest problem I have with this is how badly it stiffs people who aren't in the ever-talked-about &quot;uberguilds&quot;.<br>
<br>
If i'm in Uberguild X, and i can only go up once a month, my guild can put together multiple raids during the month, and I can be ported up / zone in / be camped there to log on for teh 2 minutes it would take to loot a piece of armor if it was going to rot.<br>
<br>
It's like someone said:  &quot;People are broken.&quot;  The current system ensures that nobody can effectively cheat the system because of its simplicity.  Any sufficiently complex system will have exploiters, which will destroy any kind of scheduling.<br>
<br>
Right now, as someone who is not part of a posting entity, I have the opportunity to go up as a guest of as many posting guilds as will take me along.  And if that means I don't get first crack at the phat lewt, I can live with that.  I can go up almost every night of the week if I really worked at it, I bet.  But that's because of my sparkling wit and charming personality. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And you keep resorting to this 'it's not fair' argument.  I am asking you, as a person from a posting entity, to quit making statements on behalf of people like myself.<br>
<br>
You can host your own raids with your guild/alliance.  I can't.  And I am telling you that I, the little guy, want this calendar and like it the way it is.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about wanting to help the 'little guy' and the 'small groups', then please recognize that this calendar is run by and supported by people from guilds that are not posting entities, and likely never will be.<br>
<br>
This issue is not, and has never been about 'guilds vs. guildless' or 'ubers vs. small guilds' or even 'powergamer vs. casual gamer'.  This issue is about coming up with a system that works, that is not open to abuse, and that basically everyone can live with.  Please don't muddy the water with further attempts at making this issue out to be a David vs. Goliath issue.  it's not, and you know it isn't.  In many ways, the guildless are even better off, because as far as I can tell, you could invite as many genuinely guild-tag-free people on a raid as you wanted, since they wouldn't be subject to the 'rule of 6' rule.<br>
<br>
Please, jamany, if you won't listen to the logic of why this compromise currently works for the majority, listen to me as one of those people you claim to be championing.  I don't want your help.  I want the calendar to be the way it is.  It works for people like me, and I am personally happy with it.  Just because you are part of a posting alliance/guild and you've decided this system doesn't work for 'the little people' does not give you the right to be their voice.  I am one of the little people, and your system scares me because I know it would hurt my chances.<br>
<br>
But I would like a few things jamany, if you can provide them.  They might even sway me from my position, if they're good enough.<br>
<br>
1 - Evidence, even anecdotal, that people who want to go to the planes right now have been denied going.  Not having posting rights doesn't count.  My guild doesn't have posting rights, and I can go to the planes.  I already have anecdotal evidence (mine) that shows otherwise.  Hell, I even gave an uberguild a blind tell (they don't know me from anyone) and was told if there was room I could go with them.  Doesn't sound very elitist to me.<br>
<br>
2 - Evidence, even anecdotal, that will refute the demonstrated past history of abuse that happens when the calendar is opened up (2-3 month advance bookings of planes,etc) if your idea were ever to be implemented.<br>
<br>
If your argument is that people want to organize a raid exactly the way they want to, with only their friends, and THAT is what is being prevented, well ... tough.  There are tons of other zones in this game where people can do exactly that.  The Dreaded Uber Guilds (tm) would probably like to just go up to the planes every time a god spawns and toast it, even if the groups up in the plane could kill the god.  <br>
<br>
But guess what?  They don't get to, unless they're asked.<br>
<br>
If they don't get to have everything their way, why should someone who is not in a guild / in a small guild be treated special, and be allowed to dictate the terms of the calendar?<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, this argument you present is no different from Anon_Uber_Guilder00 saying &quot;We are going to take what we want, and there is nothing you can do to stop us.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only difference is your angle of attack is the cry of &quot;It's not fair! We don't get to do what we want becuase we're not powerful!&quot;<br>

You said &quot;I can go to the planes just about every day if I want to.&quot;  Is that fair that those with posting entities only can go once every so often but those without guilds may go as often as they wish?  You see the calender is flawed and the problem is that no one here is hearing what i am saying.  They are throwing the &quot;majority&quot; thing in my face at every turn and we all know that the &quot;majority&quot; back when the calender was made and the &quot;majority&quot; now is a great difference in numbers.  Maybe, just maybe, everyone is afraid to do a vote because the calender will leave.<br>
<br>
And if the calender is so wonderful and people &quot;don't break the rule,&quot; why are people who go in and hunt who do not agree with the calender being threatened?  And yes there are threats on these threads towards those people.  I think this whole thing is pathetic and the game should remain as a game.  If I chose to go, I go.  If i chose to take 100 or 1 friend, so be it.  Why should I have to ask permission from an entity other than verant?<br>

It is fair.<br>
<br>
Because members of a posting entity can get invited on raids as well.  It is just less likely for a posting entity to go out of their way to invite those people, since they have raids of their own.<br>
<br>
And even if they didn't, it would still be fair.<br>
<br>
Hint:  There are tradeoffs.  Just like in the game, a wizard does great DD and has ports, but crappy HP.  A warrior has great HP and defense, but can't kill things fast.<br>
<br>
With the calendar: posting groups get to decide when they are going up, plan the raid, decide loot order, etc, etc.  Non-posting entities can try to go up more often, but they are at the whim of the people organizing the raid when it comes to looting rights/timing of the raid.<br>
<br>
Is this really that hard to understand?<br>
<br>
And I don't honestly care if people are threatening you.  you keep bringing that up as if it somehow proves your point.  All it proves is that people are broken (tm LumCorp), and we all knew that already.<br>

Well, I have news for all of you.  I do not always agree with my guild.  I stay because on the majority we agree.  On this we do not.  Some in my guild do not agree with it.  But, as you have seen on this thread, it is easier to go with the powerful then stand in their way.<br>
<br>
When I said &quot;I will go when I chose&quot;, the response on the thread was &quot;you will not like the consequences.  You will be blackballed from all the lists and if that is where your troubles end you will be lucky&quot;.  That was on the thread that was amazingly deleted.<br>
<br>
The point is I don't agree with it plain and simple.  NOONE has the right other than verant to dictate anything.  You have overstepped your bounds and it is catching up with you.  If you think Clept and I are the only ones on the entire Rathe server that don't agree you are blind.  You are having farming and repop problems as we speak because people don't agree.  Rather than threatening them (also in the threads) or complaining about it, why not do something to help them feel more at ease about this calender instead of ridiculing them for stating their opinion?<br>

By farming repops that is what you are doing.  You can throw off the repops by 4-5+ hours and things will be popping on the next party as they clear the plane.  If they don't pop AFTER they are all done and gone.  So you are ruining their gaming experience by your actions.  Do you not realize this?<br>
<br>
You seem to feel you are the only person in this game.  Or you seem to not like to be told what to do and will revolt just to revolt.  What you do affects others.  What others do affects you.  You see you have to work with others and not demand things.<br>
<br>
I would like to clear some things up.  Yer right we can't and ARE NOT dictating anything Jamany.  In fact this is not forced on one single person.  All the players who have agreed to this do not have a gun pointed at their heads.  Are you dictating that you have the &quot;right&quot; over us in the planes?  You say you can go anytime you want.  Are you declaring FFA?  Are you no different then the uber guilds for saying such a statement?  Only difference is that the uber guild have the numbers to actually over power another group.  What you would be doing is like a theif in the night and taking repops while other slept.  But essentially yer doing the same thing.  Do you not realize this?<br>
<br>
Now what people are saying as &quot;threats&quot; are nothing more then we said to the now famous post of Aegeirson's.  Do it and we will band together to make sure it will be living hell for you.  What you are doing is putting your reputation on the line.  What you do in game has in game repercussions.  As far as the repop farmers you mention.  I do believe even they posted they will speak with the next day posting entity to make sure the repops do not screw up the plane raid for the next day.<br>
<br>
Even they saw to it, to be courteous to the next day's posting entity.  That is all this is, we are asking you to be courteous to others.  If you can't do it don't expect any courtesy back.  That is the basis of this calendar. <br>
<br>
Its the golden rule, how do you want to be treated?<br>

<br>
 I'm in a guild that's a posting entity. ( go figure ). i've been repeatedly asked to go on several other small and large alliances both, to help out or kick back in the planes. Go with friends, Go there if something drops i need, or just go and hang out. Previous system that was taken down becuase of abuse, states that i couldnt do this. Said i couldnt go &quot; hang out with friends &quot; becuase of possible alterior motives. Well,  This new system allows me, and anyone else for that matter, to get invited up on another plane raid ( staying within the 6 member from another posting entity rule ). I wont get into the &quot; alterior motives &quot; part becuase this happened before and after epic quest items were in place, which makes it invalid of a response, and i've been in full planer gear before this year even started. So it's not a question of loot per say.<br>
 As to your question above, Yeah, it's fair. cause i can go on a rotation with my guild, and still be an invite on others plane raids if they need X class or if friends of mine want to invite me.<br>
<br>
 If they wanted to invite 30+, or whatever, non guilded or non posting entity members on a raid, they are able to do that as well. so your arguement has no grounds.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
Maybe because we all have to share this world that Verant created for us.  This is not a single player game where you can do anything where and when you want.  This IS like the real world, your actions have consquences on other players.  All of us that post here try to keep that in mind.  That is the reason the calendar was formed in the first place, so people would not be in each others way.<br>
<br>
Heres an example for you:<br>
I was in Karnors last night, and in my groups was a person that had never been there before.  Karnors was (of course) heavily camped.  And there was no place free inside to camp.  So as we were looking for some place to setup, we passed thoguht the first &quot;fort&quot; area (under captain room).  The groupmate that had never been to Karnors asked why we just didn't camp there and we explained to her that people don't camp there for a few reason.  A) All trains pass thought there, see other peoples actions stop us from camping a spot.  B) Everyone pulls though that spot, so we didn't want to stop all the other groups (moat groups, closet group, etc) from being about to pull we didn't camp there.<br>
<br>
I don't know if this is coming out right, I'm tired and may not be making sense, but I hope you can see the point I was trying to make.<br>
<br>
This is a multiplayer game, and as such our actions affect the other players in the game.<br>

<br>
Yup, no one told me I could not camp there it was just &quot;common sense&quot;/respect for others.  Just like no one here is saying thay you can NOT go to the planes.  If fact it has been stated serveral times during these discussion that we have NO way to police where people can go.<br>
<br>
However, if I had set up camp there, it would have made everyone else in Karnors angry.  Which could have lead to me getting blacklisted as a &quot;troublemaker&quot;, etc.  That is all that we can do if you do not respect the calendar.<br>
<br>
Also if we had camped there we WOULD have been trained (all trains go through there, not a question of IF you will be trained, just WHEN).   Just as if you do not respect another groups plane raid it will very likely lead to trains and mass death.<br>

Well if Verant hadn't been such stupid fucks and made the planes a requirement for Epic quests then many people would be &quot;done&quot; with them.  Many people had all thier armor and were basically &quot;done&quot; with the planes, then Verant puts rare drops on the Gods for the Epic Quests and not those people that no longer need the planes have come back so they can do thier Epic Quest.</font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

You keep saying this.  I do not think it means what you think it does.<br>
<br>
People are listening, you just don't like the answers, so you talk louder.<br>
<br>
If you HAD camped there in Karnors, people WOULD have said 'Get out of there or else.'  I can guarantee you if you had camped there, people would have retaliated.  Possibly inadvertantly, but they would have trained the living bejesus out of your group.<br>
<br>
And someone DID say you couldn't camp there.  They just happened to be in the group at the time.  Which apparently makes it OK to say &quot;Don't camp here.&quot;<br>
<br>
And as has been stated, the planes are unique, you do not 'camp' the planes.  14 hour respawn means you go up as a group of varying size and then kill the entire plane, start to finish.<br>
<br>
And people won't move on, jamany.  It's possible the traffic will get a bit thinner, but consider things from my standpoint as a warrior:<br>
<br>
I start out in patchwork.<br>
<br>
To get more armor, I have to buy banded <br>
<br>
From my banded, I ended up doing crafted quests (Thanks Arafain!) in my early 30s.  <br>
<br>
Next step:  I can either sit in Karnors/Sebilis for the next 10 years praying to get in a camp and try for cobalt, or I can spend the next several months going up to the planes to try for indicolite armor.<br>
<br>
And realistically, I am going to need at least SOME indicolite in order to be an effective tank in the zones where cobalt drops.  Or I can also wear kylong armor.  it's a hair better than crafted.  And drops in sebilis.<br>
<br>
The problem with the planes congestion isn't that everyone is greedy or that everyone wants to own them.  The problem is that the planes have some of the best armor in the game for high-levels.  And for some of us (ie, ME) our armor is what makes us viable.<br>
<br>
and then there's that whole 'epic quest mob' thing that will keep everyone signing up.<br>
<br>
So Velious might lessen the pressure of people who want to do the planes for the perceived fun of it, but it's not going to change people from working on going there regularly to get ourselves equipped.<br>
<br>
But, the truth will out in the next week or two.  I hope you're right, though.<br>

<br>
That's it exactly, it's a list. Like TR1, King group, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Verant didn't give us lists, I doubt very much they will enforce a list. The players came up with lists themselves.<br>
<br>
But the planes are different than Cazic or Guk. They take more than one group, you die zoning in, the aggro range is incredable, the spawn time is 12+ hours and one week on the gods. <br>
<br>
In the case of the planes this list takes the form of a calendar. You have some choice on where on this list you get to place your name.<br>
<br>
Jamany I'm sorry that when 6 of you get on-line together you can not go in and just randomly kill stuff in fear at your convenience.  But the reason stuff is up to kill is because of this calendar. You can not &quot;bud&quot; in line cuz it's convenient for you. You can always ask the entity who's turn it is about killing repop. You can not just go in and do it. <br>
<br>
Part of posting a reservation is agreeing to honor the reservations of others. They honored yours. <br>

YOU can't enforce this calender.  I personally don't like the PnP rules either but according to Verant you cannot stop someone from going in the planes and say farming repops.  I know that a lot of threats have been made on these threads to those that were going in and doing so.  And as to Greed, that is exactly what overruns every zone.  Gotta have the highest level, best armor, best twink, etc.  Most people take this &quot;GAME&quot; way too far.  And for those of us that play it to enjoy it, those people are taking away OUR fun.<br>
<br>
I am not saying I am going up to ffa the planes.  I am not saying that I personally am going to do anything or that I know of anyone who is.  What I AM saying is that no toon has the right to &quot;Police&quot; (I believe is the word someone used) any zone.  Exept Verant.  If you believe you have this right then maybe you should think about who gave you this right.<br>
<br>
The other thing that has gotten me so riled is the statement &quot;We all voted&quot; or &quot;Everyone on the Rathe&quot;...obviously not ALL or EVERYONE or you wouldn't have the complaints or the problems with farmers.  I think everyone needs to step back a moment.<br>
<br>
Rewena did put a lot of effort and work into this calender and it is commendable.  But not enforcable.  I think she has done a wonderful job but you are still leaving others out and when the do what verant has permitted you get in a huff.  Please think on this.  I am not saying the calender is horrible.  I am saying it isn't EVER going to work 100%.  And the threats and harassment that those that don't abide by it are starting to get are going to be dealt with by the gm's.<br>
