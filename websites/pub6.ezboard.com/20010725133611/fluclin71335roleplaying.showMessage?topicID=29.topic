Certainly nothing to be banned over, and really what people write outside of the official Sony Board should have no bearing on account status.  Sony/Verant has no right to police other people's message boards and decide what is and is not appropriate.  The author did mention that this is not the story that got him/her banned though.  Do you have a link to the other story?  Maybe the other one was on the Sony boards and perhaps had some more questionable content.<br>

<br>
The mother of a adolescent child saw the post, and associated the rape of a Wood Elf of 14 seasons to be the rape of an adolescent child.<br>
<br>
While I think that Banning the poster was too much, when a corporation receives a complaint of this nature they MUST act to protect their reputation.<br>
<br>
Hopefully VI will stay true to their word, and work out a better course of action for future incidents.<br>

I believe I also stated in my post that I think banning was not the appropriate action, and that I thought another means of solution should have been found. ;&gt;<br>

The post was removed from the message board it was on.  It was about a dark elf girl, 14 years old, who was the captive of an ogre (she was bought by him as an infant).  The ogre rapes her but she kills him with poison during intercourse.  It's pretty graphic.<br>

<br>
Mystere was a guildmate for a short while during my days on Brell.  Always stood by the RPing character and personality they had created, even when it conflicted with a potential group or guild.  I respected that about Mystere.  Never what I would call a deviant personality though.<br>
<br>
While I did not agree with or enjoy the theme and topic of the story, I do appreciate the desire to explore unmapped regions of the &quot;evil&quot; personas present on Everquest.  Face it, Norrath is quite a dark realm, where quests involve lopping off heads for rewards, and mutilated bodies of dwarves are left hanging as future meals in Feerrott.  What makes these concepts acceptable while others are censored?  Are these ideas and sights that minors should be viewing to begin with?  The line here is very hazy.<br>
<br>
EQvault had every right to pull the story if it conflicted with their concept of &quot;acceptable material&quot;.  However, Verant stepped WAY over the line in banning Mystere instantly like they did.  A warning to the author?  Perhaps.  A request for EQvault to remove it?  Yes indeed.  But to immediately eliminate someone due to a complaint or two?  /sigh<br>
<br>
I understand that Verant is paranoid.  These last few years video games and the entertainment industry as a whole have been placed in the public's eye as a cause for violent behaviors in children.  A single nationally-covered incident could bring untold damage to their image as a company.<br>
<br>
Consider this:  It is possible (however likely/unlikely) that a suicide/killing/rape will occur that may be linked back to EverQuest or a similar MMORPG as its root cause.<br>
<br>
When the national spotlight is on Norrath, what will you defend and what will you condemn? <p><img src="http://facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/44/1161944.gif"><img src="http://facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/31/1162031.bmp"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaeuda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeuda</A> at: 10/20/00 9:58:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usrinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Srinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/4/00 10:48:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You have it all wrong!!!</span><hr size=1> I read the story, actually just a few minutes after it was posted the first time.

<br>
First off I have not read the story - when i tried the link it was removed. So any oppinions are based on theory.<br>
<br>
One of the previous posts mentioned the high level of violence portrayed in game by VI. They then asked <br>
were do u draw the line(not exact words but idea). <br>
Violence is not right and i do not condone it in RL. However violence and rape are not the same thing. Rape is the most degenerate and disgusting acts possible to perpetrate on another person. Sometimes death would be preffered by some victims. <br>
I read another thread about a young ladies bad experience roleplaying when a guy hit on her and wouldnt leave it alone. That is the kind of behaviour that people who are capable of rape start with. Therefore stories about the rape of 14 year olds will attract more of these types of people to EQ. <br>
Violence is used in RL all the time not allways in an evil way but sometimes to protect the weak. Whilst violence is not good in itself there is still a place for it and it cannot be escaped (yet) therefore it is ok to portray it in the game. Rape will never have a use and should not be associated with the game.<br>
<br>
I re-iterate I did not read the story, I may have misunderstood how graphic it was or wether it was condoning or attacking rape. But remember that the people who vote and who the politicians who have the power to axe EQ will probably not bother to read the story. They will just see rape and 14 years old and then see red.. <br>
<br>
That is why VI had to ban this person from playing. (If the player realises it they can allways just start a new account.) But Verant had to be seen to do something firm<br>
<br>
Anyway, nice to meet u guys. I've been playin about 2 months now and I have a 5th barb shaman but my favourite character is Stytch an 11th Halfling Rogue.<br>
I like to debate and often play the devils advocate but I will try to be nice and hopefully get to know u guys in due course. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ustytchyapgud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stytch Yapgud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 7:24:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You have it all wrong!!!</span><hr size=1> damn i just read the date of this post!<br>

<br>
   just wanna say that i know this is old, but i wanted to say this back in the day, but i didnt, so heres my chance, since technically i didnt bump it up:-p.  <br>
<br>
    Personally, as a DE roleplayer...  if this had been an actual situation of RPing that happened in game, and i stumbled across it.  i would do two things in character.  number one..kill the woodelf.  then number 2, kill the dark elves involved.  Since dark elves generally hate ALL and look down upon all as they are the true superior beings;-), in no way would torture of this kind be acceptable by the Teir'dal heirarchy.  we are above all... ESSPECIALLY light elves.  So having sexual contact with one of them would be equal too, in RL terms, having sexual relations with a pig, dog, or any kind of animal.  It, IMHO would be considered taboo, disgusting, and any DE who took part in it, &lt;if i were in charge&gt; would be slowly torn apart by the queens pet tentacle terrors and fed to the ogres and trolls as a gift.  SO, while it may have been a well written story, nevertheless controversial, i think if they truly knew DE society and rlly thought about it, they would realize DE's view of their relationship with others is not as of &quot;royalty&gt; peasent&quot; but rather &quot;royalty&gt;animals&quot; and so this controversy wouldnt even have been written.<br>
