There are several ways to join this exclusive club but their chosen method was to take advantage of a clear ToV-N to establish a CotH group near the PoM entrance and &quot;jump&quot; the progression of dragons from the entrance to the back because the first dragons are too hard for them to kill.  Not that it is that huge of a deal but it is generally considered across all the servers among all the guilds (except for this esteemed list, of course) as very bad etiquette and just all around massively lame.  They are now famous across all the servers, just like they wanted, and will be talked about in the circle of &quot;uber&quot; guilds that they so aspired to join.  Of course, if you talk to them, they are quite humble about it, saying that they could care less what the other guilds on this server or any think about them.<br>
<br>
However, we were nice enough to give the SoT members left in the zone tonight a demonstration of how to kill Aaryonyar before all of them left to conflict with Tindi'Losi in PoM.  With luck, they will have remembered to screenshot it, log it, and post it on their boards as an example of how to do it for their next attempts and darnit, maybe they just can figure out how to kill him next time.  In times like this, I always like to remember the story of the &quot;Little Engine That Could&quot;.  It always provides me with an emotional boost when I am tackling something difficult.<br>
<br>
Anyway, give them a hand everyone for their accomplishments.  I can't think of anyone else who deserves it more! <p><P>

<br>
There's a difference between not caring and not being able to change what other people think.  Hell, BoTS was the most hated guild on the server for a long ass time.  Before the split, who was the big evil guild that nobody liked?  Even after the split..and if you EVER talked to a BoTS member about their rep they would have said the same damn thing.  Think back to when BoTS was disbanded for 'training'..I happened to be in Dreadlands and people cheered and laughing.  Why am I bringing this up?  Just because the view of each bigger guild will change, over and over again, by the server.<br>
<br>
As for what happened, shrug..nobody thought of it as a big thing.  We were told that bots wouldn't honor a NToV &quot;rotation&quot; of sorts..as in who kills Aary gets the rest of the dragons over the next couple days.  So, we decided to clear to PoM the other day while nothing was up..since we hadn't seen the zone.  We did, and decided that we would get the back couple dragons first when they spawned.  It wasn't some big thought out plan to get back at BoTS..just something we decided to do.  Yes, we haven't killed Aary yet.  While I know that we can, and will soon, we haven't.  You can say we skipped him today because he was too hard for us, and while I disagree and know he isn't, I can't tell you you're wrong because, of course, we haven't actually killed.  We could have did the normal iki/eashan today, but wanted a change..and decided to kill the back wuss dragons first.  If that is looked at by you/others as &quot;massively lame&quot;..shrug..think what you want.  How exactly do you come up with the: <br>
<br>
&quot;They are now famous across all the servers, just like they wanted, and will be talked about in the circle of &quot;uber&quot; guilds that they so aspired to join.&quot;<br>
<br>
comment?  While of course we want to do everything there is to do in the game, we don't motivate our actions so we can be thought of as a server-wide uber guild.  By killing the 2 pussiest dragons in EQ you think we are trying to become more 'uber'?  Riiiiiiiiight.  <br>
<br>
This post is just gonna get huge and ugly, can see it coming..tension between the 2 guilds has been mounting the last couple weeks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There shall be mass flaming by both sides, and in the end nothing will come of it but even more tension.

<br>
If verant designed EQ as a way for people to maul each other, and constantly be at each other's throats, boy they did a good job!!!<br>
<br>
I can't say as I know much about ToV, I've been there three times, and only for screenshots. <br>
<br>
Personally though I can say that most of the SoTs and BoTSs I've grouped with have been very kind and most respectable. A wizard in SoT just recently gave me the crystal chitin gaunts he won, when I only got second highest roll. I wont mention his name so he doesn't die of profuse blushing, but he wears a fancy robe =p. <br>
<br>
IMHO let people do things the way they want, it IS always possible you did not see their true intent, or you missed something, then again it is always possible they did it with malicious intent /shrug.<br>
<br>
Since I so enjoy cliche's &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot;<br>
<br>
It's a game folks, and when UberGuildX kills dragons that uberguildy wanted, no one is really worse for the wear in real life. Have fun enjoy yourselves and if a game causes this much undue stress, get the hell outta here!  <p>~Alistriwen SkyLotus followed by his many alts~

<br>
SoT, you for a long ass time now have been the servers biggest assholes and biggest joke, as you stumble your way thru mobs spying on BoTs to learn what they do (dont say you dont, everyone knows you do). You the servers biggest joke, Heh, there used to be a time when the name SoT had alot of respect with it, sadly that day was long ago and passed. You never cease to amaze as you pull one lame stunt after another (trying to muscle into Doz anyone?) and when you fail at something you do nothing more than blame someone else for your failure, conveinient that a lvl1 Troll warrior was in the zone and Aggro'd tormax from all your lvl60 Warriors and Casters ROFL Yah right, what ever fits the blame i guess.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, if you dont have the skill to drop Aayronar then you really have no business in NToV, think of Aayronar like Vindi, the gaurdian to the good loots off the easier mobs, sure not all NToV mobs are easier but a few are as you found out tonight, Now killing Vindi as you know allows you to Kill Statue pretty much and get the better loots off him. Kinda like killing the Harder Aayronar would grant you access to the rest of NToV to kill the dragons. But no, that concept is rather to hard for your poor brains to fathom so you take the easier route, yep you got it, wait til the NA guild that clears NToV has cleared it, then go in behind them, kill a few wyverns and stuff and park a CoH mage and inviter there ready for when they respawn, Hey presto you got yourself an instant door into NtoV past the hard dragon that hands you your ass so efficiently time after time. <br>
<br>
I also agree with Sssorn, you guys use your leverage of time difference to perma farm mobs away from everyone else who you know will kill them Np, Zland anyone? Hell my guild hasnt even had a chance to kill Zland.... why? cos SoT perma farm him on spawn to stop anyone else getting him. <br>
<br>
Another thing that gets me is your soo quick to cry FFA, or should that be Qwai FFA, *if you dont like it we wont honor the rotation* Blah blah, you threatend NB with this @#%$ and you threaten others with it, kinda lame also IMO.<br>
<br>
Pretty much you guys think your something special, sorry for the rude awakening.. your not, its a shame cos you actually got some decent members, whats even funnier is those members hating lots of the other members especially your esteemed moron of a leader Shei.<br>
<br>
And to point at BoTs and say *you had the worst rep* well i got news for you, you guys have surpassed any kinda badness that BoTs has ever done, your total lack of comon sense and willingess to work with people in your mad zerg rush trip to become *Uber* has permanently marked your cards far darker than BoTs has ever marked theirs. Keep up the good work making yourselfs look dumb day after day as it makes for interesting reading and screenshots <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also SoT doesnt have the balls it takes to movelog to another server, sure SoT hide behind your excuses but thats all they are and will be is excuses. Rather than Movelog and make a name for yourself on a fresh new server, months ahead of a lot of people with your hoarded ST Key and a 4Th Warder waiting for you to kill (as if Rofl) you wanna stay on the Rathe, cause more BS and bottom feed in NToV. That right there shows you all you will amount to. Shadows to a better larger more accomplished guild than you will ever amount to. You have no excuse or reason to stay on the Rathe other than your greed and expertise at monopolizing a @#%$ up spawn system implemented by Verant, knowing the exact spawn time of a mob isnt hard, killing that mob 3242342 times to stop others from getting it also isnt hard and doesnt make you anything special, infact it just shows your utter lack of respect for the rest of the community on the server and show what sniveling greedy little insignificent worms you are..<br>
<br>
And another thing, BoTs has the decency to approach people before pulling lame @#%$ and making their intent known and offering alternatives.. SoT doesnt..SoT see's and SoT grabs, soon you will leap before looking and a fuckin juggernaut will mow the lot of you down <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   heres to that day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   HAGG SOT Assholes of the Rathe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Falconus<br>Knight of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16862">Profile</a><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufalconusdawnlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconus Dawnlight</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/30/01 11:18:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LOM</span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/30/01 10:51:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.guildsob.com/artwork/eva345.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> Guess its time for me to lay down what LoM thinks! *since yah know basically falconus just spoke for nb regardless of what people think if you say something you are speaking for your guild.* and Lom Says! <br>

Think back to when BoTS was disbanded for 'training'..I happened to be in Dreadlands and people cheered and laughing.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you had asked half those people why they hated BoTS they wouldn't know. Just a bunch of lame asses jumping on a bandwagon out of jealousy. Ask people why they hate SoT and you have to /eglog on and come back an hour later.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I bringing this up? Just because the view of each bigger guild will change, over and over again, by the server.&quot;<br>
<br>
If it acts like @#%$ and smells like @#%$, guess what? It's @#%$, no matter how you dress it up.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;While I know that we can, and will soon, we haven't.&quot;<br>
<br>
With what strategy? Wait for BoTS to nearly kill him, train them and then gank Aary? Or does that only work when Tindi beats you to a spawn? *cough* Zland *cough*<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I had no problem with SoT until one fine day where they decided they would get their 3 CoV ally members Dozekar quest items while two other guilds of 80+ members each, were @#%$. Obviously the loot from Zland, Kland, Telk, Gozz, Dain etc wasn't enough for them.<br>
<br>
Then came Zlandicar...a guild other then SoT got to him first(Tindi)after they had killed him 15 odd times in a row without any other guilds in their way. Tindi was setup with SoT breathing down our necks and we had a force capable of taking the dragon. For those of you familiar with the area Zland is in....a SoT cleric &quot;lagged&quot; from the waterfall all the way to Zland's lair, around the corner and back to the waterfall, wiping out most of Tindi and part of SoT. This was ok though, because he lagged around a corner and back with Zlandicar on him which is common in EQ. Tindi had to regroup and rebuff to pull and 5 mins before we did so, SoT decided to jump us and rush him. <br>
<br>
After this happened I found that the day before SoT had been attempting a NToV mob which BoTS also wanted. BoTS allowed them to attempt the kill for as long as they wanted before moving in despite the fact that SoT was getting raped over and over again.<br>
<br>
Way to show common curtiousy assholes.<br>

Follow the &quot;Calender&quot; link to see what events we have planned and let us know what days are good for you to @#%$ us again. I'm sure you can fit us in between NB and BoTS in your busy schedule.<br>

If Spirit of Tunare isn't incentive enough for Verant to create an /ignoreguild command then I don't know what is.<br>

<br>
Anyway, at first I felt a bit sceptic about the idea of COH'ing into NToV, but we have little choice, if we'd ever get more than our 4-5 hour raid window we can do raids in (yes that's what you people call our timezone advantage devil scheme) we'd be able to waltz through Ika/Eashen/Aary, etc.<br>
But actually it's not like that anymore, we don't get to our 4-5 hours because people have lives and stuff, and we can't all be online at the same time. That doesn't mean we can't kill Aary, heck I'm sure we can kill him and any dragon in ntov, if we have time to explore, try out and refine strats, but frankly, we don't expect bots to let our guild try out a mob for hours so we moved deeper in so we could enjoy more of our short raid time.<br>
Whether you wanna call it bottom feeding or flatout lame, or you just wanna call SoT some names cause you're so damn frustrated (sorry Falc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   p0 boy), in the end you know we can kill Aary, we just CoH'd deeper in to make it a bit more easier on our Euro members who don't have countless hours because they have jobs/families and a social life to look after.<br>
<br>
What I also don't get is why SoT has suddeny become so hated, I can still remember when we did CR in fear like every 2 days to help other guilds out, etc.<br>
<br>
TL hates us cause they couldn't kill Zland, guys, if you can't kill a mob blame yourself not us for waiting for 2 hours to finally get the job done, as said before we need to do things fast or they just don't happen. <br>
NB hates us...not really probably, for no apparent reason, prolly just some of their members like Falconus like to flame us because when he sees his bro's gear he goes green of jealousy?<br>
BotS don't like us anymore because we can kill mobs they could only kill before, sucks having a competitor huh, so they have to go tell around stories (even on the FoH boards /boggle) about us bind zerging tormax, I don't really know but I fought him once and I can't say we would need such strategies, oh well, bind zerging is bad if we do it but any other guild can have 100+ corpses on CT <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Just for the record...<br>
<br>
I don't have an opinion on Tindi as a guild<br>
I most CERTAINLY don't like you.<br>
And I could GIVE A @#%$ LESS how big your pixilated dick is and how fast you can wave it.  I suggest you wave it in the general direction of Zlandicar and see if maybe he'll let you reciprocate what he did to your ass the day we supposedly &quot;stole&quot; him from you.<br>
<br>
Check your mythical logs and screenshots, wipe whatever human body fluid happens to be clogging your eyes TODAY and see if maybe you can check how many times you pulled/failed Zland before we even buffed ourselves up.<br>

<br>
Granted you had to learn pathing.<br>
<br>
However!<br>
<br>
Ik / Eash could be probably at most 1h - 1h 30m raid, depending on how fast you can keel. That leaves almost 5h to play with Aary. In between killing chickens and the actual attempts you could probably get 5 Aary attempts in before people fall asleep each time. <br>
<br>
(Keep in mind I'm a History major, and not a Math, so excuse the flaws in my addition and subtraction and whatnot.)<br>
<br>
The time zone advantage is when you start your raids. We start ours around 6-7`ish est. You start yours several hours earlier. <br>
<br>
In that time you sometimes have: Sleepers cleared, Vindi/Statue dead, Tormax dead, and if you're lucky Zland.<br>
<br>
Oh, btw.<br>
<br>
&quot;...you forgot to mention that you got your asses REAMED 2x...&quot;<br>
<br>
Well Kaerlie I think Brumpy put it best!<br>
<br>
&quot;...That doesn't mean we can't kill (MOB), heck I'm sure we can kill him and any dragon in (ZONE), if we have time to explore, try out and refine strats, but frankly, we don't expect (GUILD) to let our guild try out a mob for hours so we moved deeper in so we could enjoy more of our short raid time.&quot;<br>

<br>
I think I'm one of the few in SoT's even the only one that didnt like what we were doing in NtoV yesterday, I have to agree with every other guild if we cant kill aaryanor we cant be in NToV.<br>
<br>
I have friends in every guild (almost every) and I like to keep it that way, there is noway I'm gonna lose friends over some stupid mob or zone.<br>
<br>
About this euro thingy, it hasnt even crossed my mind to movelog to that server, 1) i have friends on the rathe that i dont wanne lose. 2) now the UK server is a phat server with no lag what so ever, but they allowed a movelog from EVERY server... they gonna end up with 3000+ ppl there?<br>

As per my contract.<br>
<br>
I don't really dislike any guild cept RF and hell they are moving so I am a happy mofo. I wanted to ask a few questions though.<br>
<br>
As of late, I've been on an EQ break of sorts, playing another game while on it. In beginning this game, I realized why I became addicted to EQ in the first place. It was so much fun seeing new places, trying new things, and meeting new friends. After a while, 60 levels I'd say, it became something much less, all the stress of he said she said, and xyz guild did this the guild competition became frustrating and almost sickening. How could something that used to be so much fun remind me so much of work now?<br>
<br>
Anyways, sorry I'm rambling now. On to my question.<br>
<br>
Why does it matter? Who gives a crap how they entered and how they killed? Did they take anything from you? Did they run over your dog or something? I just wanna know how in the hell it is so offensive what they did.<br>
<br>
Believe this all BoTS people have always been nice to me, even when everyone hated them, and all SoT people have always been nice to me. Tindi well you have the one person in your ranks that I hate beyond all repair, but you have some people that are friends too, long time friends even.<br>
<br>
I just don't understand what the big deal is. I could understand it if they actually did somethiing to you, but I see where nothing ill was done towards BoTS, for tindi it seems that you got plenty of time/chances to kill that other thing. <br>
<br>
Why can't you guys just play and have fun? Let them bind wherever they want, it's not bothering you now is it? <p><CENTER><img src="http://www.legendofmarr.com/images/grulsig.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubrumpybronzefinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brumpy Bronzefinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 5:55:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> There's a difference between ethics and actually wanting to see a new part of the game, when we first entered NToV (given it was clear of any dragon) I was in awe, it's the things you've dreamed of as a newbie and I was there, the place is HUGE and it's everything I hoped it to be, but thusfar my own petty feelings <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , what's more important is that yes, we could have spent 5 hours on Aaryonar, but some of us felt like doing something different for a change and it was awesome. <br>
I don't think we'll keep on CoH'ing up there, takes probably as much time to clear to there but we just wanted to put something new on the list, but we got to see a part of the zone.<br>
In a way I hope that bots can come to an agreement with us, like a weekly NToV rotation or something, in that case if we can't do Aary we're fu&gt;&lt;ored, and they can still be killed either pre patch by both guilds (the day before a patch no mobs should remain standing, that's just distasteful) or the next week by bots.<br>
In its current form we could clear Ika/Eashen/Aaryo and perhaps 1-2 more in a single day maximum and with some more experience on the mobs, after which bots can come in (there's your timezone abuse again, @#%$ that issue) and clear the rest, or reversed and we go in the next day before bots gets on and try to learn more and eventually kill those dragons, you can consider both ways gimpy.<br>
I don't know how bots would react if we'd kill Aaryonar before them, they might move in after us as well, who knows, double standards aren't that unseen.<br>
I'm no officer or anything but it'd make life on both of us much easier if we could come to a mutual agreement.<br>

<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
At first we had an agreement that whoever got to kill Aaryonar first got the rest of NToV, but seeing as Sssorn started this whole timezone abuse BS Mistabone seemed to have changed his mind and canceled all agreements regarding NToV, aka it's still considered FFA.<br>
Personally I hope there'll be some talking between the representatives of SoT and BotS so they can come up with a solution that works for the both of us...<br>
<br>
Flaming us because you wanted too much of the pie is going to have an advert effect though,  since BotS called this upon themselves, there was an agreement, they discarded it, if the agreement had stand we'd had attempted Aaryonar last night, we would possibly have won and by the former agreement had privilege to the entire wing, or we would've failed.<br>
