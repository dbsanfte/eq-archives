The time constraints among other things are hellish with these.  But, we've been doing so well on the other raids that I figured why not give it a try.<br><br>So, during this time when CoG is low on the rotation list and probably wont get a normal plane I'll try for a PoA weekend.<br><br>Yes, you heard me right, a weekend.  PoA is not a normal plane.  It'll be a 3 day commitment from everyone.  Once you go up, you must stay for all 3 days.  You cant leave the plane and come back, all the keys will disappear when you zone, and you cant bind or CoH here. <br><br>This is also going to be expensive.  We're talking in the range of 400-600pp a person.  While it's only 50pp per person for the port stone, over 3 days you can pretty much say everyone will spend about 150pp per person on reagents like peri's.  Also we will need at least 1-2 coffins per person at 150pp a shot.  Thats why I say its expensive.<br><br>Limited Seating.  48 people.  Max.  Thats it.  No more.<br><br>Stratagy.  We'll take 24 people up the first day to get keys.  They'll camp out and call it a night sometime on Friday.  Probably about 8pm or so.  Log an alt if you want to play EQ more.  On Saturday, bright and early, we'll take everyone else or 24 people again.  The first island will have repop'd and we'll rekill the mobs for 24 more keys.  Thats why we're limited to 48 people.  On the second island we'll send the 24 people who will get keys here across.  The other 24 will duel and be summoned across and revived there.  We'll kill then move to the 4th island, probably on Sunday.  At the 4th island are the flying horses.  These suckers split after you kill them, they're mean, they're cute, and they are unmezable and will kick your butt if your not careful.  Thats why we need ALL 48 people even on Sunday.  If we're short we'll get slaughtered here.<br><br>Necessary people.  Clerics.  Lots of them.  We'll need to camp 1 cleric before we begin killing on the island.  Its not exactly standard procedure, but with the keys the way they are, if we wipeout without one camped, we are totally screwed.  So we'll need like 4 or 5 clerics to be safe.  Necro's, at least 1 high level one who can use the stackable coffins to summon corpses.  While a lower level one will do, the regular coffins both take up lots of space and are bulky.  Tanks.  Lots.<br><br>Now if your asking yourself if its worth it, go to Allakhazam's and take a look at the PoA quests for your class.  You do the math.  Also many people's epic pieces drop here.  We'll try to get some as well.<br><br>I'm not going to gaurntee anything here folks.  I'll sign us up on the KGC board and we'll see.  If not enough people show up, I wont hesitate to cancel the raid.  We cannot be marginal on this one folks.  Either we have enough to kickass and take names, or we dont go.  Also normal alliance restrictions will probably be lifted in this case since PoA is a different matter from the other planes.  Bumps will be handled differently if necessary.<br><br>You must be ready to go on the first day even if you are not picked for to be among the first 24.  I'll need exact numbers or we cant go.  I wont waste people's time or money on the first island just to find out that no one will show on the second day.<br><br>Quest Items.  Handled a bit differently from most other people.  If you can use it, roll.  You can only win 1 piece till everyone in your class has won something.  This is a bit unfair since all the quests need 3 peices to complete it, but its easier than the paperwork involved in other methods.  That might change if this goes off successfully, but for now thats it I think.  Subject to change on the actual sign-up list of course.<br><br>Once again, this is NOT a sign-up.<br><br>Once again, this is NOT a sign-up.<br><br>I do NOT want to see people saying they want to go on this in this thread.  This thread is only for questions pertaining to strategy or specific PoA questions.  I dont want to clutter it up.

I doubt it tho.  The last time I went was with Forged Alliance and I believe they got to the 4th Island.  Using them as a meterstick, I'd say we'll be lucky to get that far.  However, you never know.  I would like to get to at least the 5th Island personally tho.<br><br>I dont really know where you'd find strategies and all for PoA.  Ummmm, Everlore might have some but it's mostly wanna be's making things up or asking what drops there.  The thing is that not to many people go there so frankly its hard to find guides out there on it.  <br><br>PoA really isnt that bad.  The mobs are as easy and hard as any other out there.  Mostly on the Kunark model at the hardest, there arent really Velious type uncharmable, unmezable, unsnareable/rootable mobs there.  Killing them is much the same as anywhere else.  Set up camp on an island, send monk sacrafice out, monk brings back a pull or two, group slaughters them or gets slaughtered.  The only tricky part is CR, but as long as you have a cleric camped its not too hard.  I apologize if I gave the impression PoA is some massively hard and difficult zone.  It really is no harder or easier than any other 46+ zone out there.  However, some things dont work and I want people to be prepared.  <br><br>The major hard part is the expense (400-600pp a person) and the time commitment.  Once you are there, your there.  There's no quick rez runs in WC, no quick reagent pickups in EC, no I have to go to a family picnic I'll be back in 5 hours.  Either you can be there uninterrupted for the 3 days, or you cant be and dont go.  Thats something thats very hard for a group like CoG to pull off.  Personally I wouldnt even by trying if Zellex hadnt asked for it.  *shrug*  I suppose its worth a try.<br><br>Dunno if this helped any, but if it didnt, keep asking till it does.

IF you have a high level enchanter.  I'm expecting to go up there with probably 2.  Neither higher than 55.  If this holds to a normal CoG raid I'd expect 1 at 52.  It's possible we might get more or some at a higher level.  Due to the nature of CoG raids, however, I'm not going to hold my breath.  I cant run raids based on the best case scenario of people that might show up.  I need to prepare of the worst case and see if we can still do it with that.<br><br>There are any number of possible strategies to use.  And you dont even need 24 people.  Large guilds can even make do with less.  But they have the levels and equipement to do so.  We have to make do with considerably less.  Most of our raiders still consider and FBSS to be top end gear and are running around with only one or two pieces of planar armor if that.<br><br>I'm sorry if this seems like I'm shutting anyone down.  Thats not really my intent.  However, part of the job of a raid leader is to look at worst case scenario's and plan raids predicated upon such terms.  We need to be realistic and work with what we have.  And more importantly we need to think things conservatively.  Its easy for a raider to think adventurously.  Indeed, I do myself when I'm soloing.  However, when the exp and equipment of upto 60 people are riding on the decisions you make, you tend to get a lot more conservative.  Even more so when you dont have any sort of backup like myself.  Heh, if I screw up there's no one to call for help really.  <br><br>Oh well, I have babbled enough here.
