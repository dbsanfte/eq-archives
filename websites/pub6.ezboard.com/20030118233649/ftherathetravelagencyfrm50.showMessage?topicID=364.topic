I'm glad to know you're seniority on the server makes you feel as if you have more of a right to speak on a matter than someone else. I guess since I started playing here in August of '99 rather than in april means my opinion doesn't have as much weight, thanks for the heads up. I'll make sure to send a personal tell in-game to anyone I feel like responding to before posting, so I can ask them for a /played to see if my opinion matters or not.<br>

<br>
You came off completely belligerent on the thread...calling my guild &quot;whiners&quot; and the like, then state how I &quot;need to know that rotations work&quot; etc....so my stating how long I've been here is to reiterate that I in fact *do* know how they work, and to ask that you refrain from talking down to people as if they dont know what they are talking about. So, if anything, you're correct in that perhaps reading comprehension is necessary.<br>
<br>
I pointed out the quote to show what you've only proved once again. Your comment about &quot;reading comprehension helps&quot; just further shows your willingness to be negative towards someone as opposed to trying to have a discussion devoid of personal slights.<br>
<br>
Your replies would carry much weight, provided you managed to do it without the attitude to match.<br>
<br>
I'm done speaking on this issue, since it's evident you dont wish to be constructive about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aesclepiustiberinus>Aesclepius Tiberinus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/5/02 3:39:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.in-ta.net/info/aesculapius/onesnake.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: cant seem to reply to sev thread</span><hr size=1> I know this isnt the flame forum, so i'll say this with as little hostility as possible.

Do not be surprised when/if your views or opinions are passed over or outright ignored as a result of your predilection for this type of conduct. That isn't a threat, I have little power to sway the collective consciousness of the server.

Perhaps if you would step back and stop making assumptions you wouldn't get so defensive.<br>
<br>
I never called your guild whiners, I said that &quot;whining&quot; about multiple guilds entering a rotation and hence forcing you to wait a couple of weeks was being unwilling to share.<br>
<br>
I didn't say you &quot;need to know how rotations work&quot;, I asked you if you understood the foundation for *why* there are rotations, and more importantly, why there still are rotations today and evern more rotations. I didn't snidely talk down to you and try and belittle you, I tried to point out that there are more than one reason for rotations.<br>
<br>
The entire basis of the thread in the first place and the proposal to autopass a guild that fails to prevent a second guild from inserting into the rotation before them was the idea of the rotation being there to protect those on the rotation from have inequal access to the mob. That is only half of the purpose. The other half is to allow guilds the chance to get on the rotations and explore the content fairly. If this wasn't the case half the things on rotation now wouldn't be, only the topmost desired and contested content where guilds would try and monopolize it.<br>
<br>
Characterizing something that someone says and proposes as &quot;bullshit&quot; and then going on to explain why certainly isn't a personal attack. I added my opinion to the thread without referencing anyone in particular, talking in general, and then *YOU* decided to take it personally. How did you respond? Logic? Say, &quot;I don't think you see the issue, so here it is&quot;? Say, &quot;Here's why your viewpoint is flawed&quot;? No. You started right off the bat and said I'm someone unwilling to compromise, because I think that a fundamental change to the rot system that has been in place solidly for a long time wasn't in need of change, and didn't agree with you. Compromise has nothing to do with it. You felt shafted by a rule, you made an issue of it (or your guildies did), and a change was proposed by someone. I disagree (and give a reason to boot) and get labeled as &quot;uncompromising&quot;. Hmm.<br>
<br>
I then respond by saying that the idea I am unwilling to compomise is crap, and then explain even further why I feel that way. Rogg then decides to pick apart every sentence of my statement and counter argue, I do the same where I disagree, and then he just make fucking ridiculous personal attacks on credibility (BTW, where are all these posts I've made? funny, I seem to remember hardly ever posting here and mainly short mini-opinions or &quot;good going!&quot; posts on a thread) because he decides that because I disagree with his *opinion* I am wrong. I respond with 2 sentences.<br>
<br>
Then you feel the need to take that 2 sentence response to rog, upload it to webspace, and start an entirely different thread to respond to me as if the quoted statement was in reference to you. This is the best part of it however:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Class act, Abaz. We were trying to just have  a damned discussion, I state that it's nothing personal against LoM and you're dead set on telling me I'm wrong and whatnot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So what you are saying is, that you are just having a closed discussion by people that want the rotation rules changed, and those of us that disagree (and post the reasons for disagreeing) aren't allowed to disagree, and if we do we are just flaming and being uncompromising. Thanks for the info, I'll keep in mind that such &quot;discussions&quot; in the future are really just delcarations of intended changes and all actual &quot;discussion&quot; isn't welcome.<br>
<br>
Then you have the gall to throw out the old worn out &quot;I've been here longer than you&quot; bullshit. hey, guess what, I don't give a fuck! Let the strength of your argument support itself, trying to give yourself credibility over another by saying you are more entitled to your opinion by arguing from authority is ridiculous in all venues, much less EQ.<br>
<br>
You know what? Maybe you think I'm caustic, maybe you think I'm an asshole, maybe you think I'm stupid even. Too fucking bad. Either address the arguments or don't respond to me at all. I'm not flaming, I'm not going out of my way to be insulting, I'm just posting my opinion on a procedural change being proposed and then being jumped on for perceived slights and then having my argument dismissed. I have a right to be an asshole, if I am acting like one. At least I am addressing the issue at hand rather than just getting insulted and resorting to personal attacks and then taking my ball and going home.<br>
