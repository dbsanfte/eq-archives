<br>
We will be operating on the now (hopefully) familair Triage-Healing tactic.  All classes capable of binding in the pre-lair &quot;ready room&quot; MUST BIND there (we'll make it clear during the raid as to exactly where this is).  If you don't bind, you don't roll on loot.  Pretty simple.<br>
<br>
The Triage area where healers set up will be at the corner of the stairs facing into the lair (slightly closer than it has been previously).  Again, we'll make it very clear where this is when we get there.<br>
<br>
There will one or two waves of tanks (depending on classes and levels present).  Tanks will try and fight Nagefen in the MIDDLE of his room, NOT at the very back - we want to keep him out of range of the triage area without making the run back to get healed too extended.  Keeping pressure on the beast is the best way to ensure it's death.  All tanks that have resistant discipline should use it as soon as Nagefen is engaged.  It lasts for 5 minutes, helps ward off both the AoE Fear and AoE Lava spells.  If we can't kill Naggy in 5 minutes, we've probably lost...<br>
<br>
After the first AoE Fear goes off, all pets will be sent in.  Mages should use fire pets for preference, as they will resist Nagefen's AoE fire spells and hopefully live long enough to do some decent melee damage.<br>
<br>
When Nagefen is at or around 50% life casters will go in and nuke for all they're worth.  The exact timing on when casters will be called in depends on how the tanks are doing... if tanks start dying off sooner than expected, casters will need to go in sooner.<br>
<br>
The basic idea here is that the tanks go in and generate as much taunt as possible to allow the casters time to get in and do as much damage as possible - and of course the healers try to keep the tanks alive as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Minimum un-buffed resistances should be 70 for both Magic and Fire resistance.  Healer classes can go lower than this in order to keep their wisdom up for mana, but should still try to remain above 50.  Healers especially need to make sure they have enough Magic resistance to keep from being feared constantly.<br>
<br>
If you do not meet these resistance requirements - do whatever you can to get your MR and FR as high as possible.  Tanks especially need high resistances in order to live long enough to contribute to a successful raid.  If you have sub-standard resistances, you will suck away more healer mana than other tanks (who are fighting longer than you), and in the process of running back for heals you will be fighting the dragon for less time, doing less damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nagafen and Fire Giant loot rules:<br>
<br>
Almost all items are to be rolled on by any class that can use them.  There are, however, some exceptions - I've tried to list them all here.  If I've forgotten something, we'll deal with it when it comes... but all decisions made by raid admin are final.<br>
<br>
Cloak of Flames:  This item is to be rolled on by MELEE classes only.  Quite frankly a caster or priest has no where near the need for haste that a melee class does, and it will make us all stronger if items are used by those that will use them best.<br>
<br>
Polished Mithril Torque:  This item is to be rolled on by HYBRIDS only (Paladin, Ranger, Shadowknight).  There is better AC to be had for the other melee classes (even Fine Plate has better AC), and the +13 Wisdom and Int will be better used by a hybrid class.<br>
<br>
Rokyl's Channeling Crystal: This item is to be rolled on by PURE CASTERS only (Wizard, Necromancer, Enchanter, Magician).  Bards can use it, but, frankly, probably wouldn't even if they had it.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
Polished Mithril Mask: This item is to be rolled on by PRIEST and CASTER classes only.  They can make better use of the Wis/Int bonus, and Tanks can get the same AC out of store-bought steel or even bronze if they want it.<br>
*EDIT*<br>
<br>
Whenever possible we will try to pre-roll on NO DROP items that may drop in upcoming encounters.  This will allow faster ressurection should the winner die during the conflict, and will avoid wasting time trying to get everyone elligable to roll res'd before rolls begin.<br>
<br>
That's it everyone - I hope to see as many of you as possible in the near future, and would like nothing more than tip back a few ale's in good company while looking at the body of a dead Red Dragon! <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

<br>
Just a couple of ideas tho.  <br>
<br>
1) You didnt mention a reagent fee.  Dunno, does that sound better than entrance fee?  heh.  I would suggest going with the numbers I mentioned last night for the reason discussed.  However, it is up to you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) I'm really not sure if this will make any difference, but I would suggest that any caster that dies during the battle and comes back in, mem not only their damage spell, but also RM if they have it and cast it on themselves before entering combat again.  It shouldnt take more than an extra 10-15 seconds to do this and it might keep the caster from being feared once or twice.  With Vox had half the casters been feared just 1 less time, we probably would have taken her down.  Because you lose all buffs and gear when you die, this would be the only resists you're wearing when going in.<br>
<br>
3) I dont really have a point 3, but I thought this would look silly with just 2 things.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would also like to restress Kommisar's point about tanks making sure you have the proper resistances.  Unlike casters you cannot come on back in if you die.  And if the tanks die, then we will lose.  Period.  There is no way that the casters can take down a dragon without tanks to protect them.  You must live for as long as possible.  Please do not skimp on them thinking you'll be the only one to do so.  Low resistances are one of the things that have run many guilds/alliances and even CoG into trouble before with these large target mobs.  Resists are everything, above and beyond even ac and atk and str.  For tanks on these raids, everything else is pretty much secondary.  Remember, what kills you isnt their physical attacks so much as their AoE spells and Fear.  <br>

I guess I did forget to mention the reagent fee.  I guess I figured it was probably covered in the sign-up thread - but uh... repetition isn't always a bad thing, so here it is:<br>
<br>
Everyone showing up at the raid should have 50pp to cover reagents and consumables used during the raid.<br>
<br>
Some people may ask, &quot;Why 50pp?&quot;.  Well, here's a brief answer:<br>
<br>
The 50pp is used to cover the reagents we use during buffing.  Now, while the reagents we use may not total 50pp per person for some raids, this fee is also used to help fund future raids and other events.  Some times we come up a little short, some times we come up ahead... and things generally seem to balance out across all the raids CoG hosts. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

My thought process was this helps speed up the rolls and the fact having to follow who rolls the highest and watching the numbers speed by.<br>

Mind you it wouldn't be a raid without someone complaining.  Thanks for bringing into my attention, and I certainly will ensure we do it differently next time. <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">
