Some of them just got tired of online RPGs. Some of them found they enjoyed other online games better, like SWG. One of them even left to spend more time playing Magic: The Gathering. <br>
<br>
What I am noticing is when I bring up EQ to them, I sometimes get snide comments like &quot;You still play that? I'm sorry.&quot;  WHAT THE FUCK? Yeah, I think things like Magic is a lame game, but I don't go busting on them for playing. <br>
<br>
What the fuck is up with people who think that just because they don't play EQ, they are suddenly better than those who still do? Like they went into rehab and came out clean and the rest of us are just a bunch of druggies. <br>
<br>
I don't agree with a lot of hobbies people have. I think sports are lame. Magic is fucking retarded. Trading Spaces is a boring show.<br>
<br>
But that's just me! I can't begrudge anyone for liking stuff I don't like. So for those who think EQ players are stupid for still playing, keep that shit to yourself.<br>
<br>
Of course, this flame is really stupid because most people who dont play EQ anymore dont read this board either. anyway, i'm done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

<br>
In fact, I actually might have a t-shirt like that.<br>
<br>
I started playing RPGs paper version and creating my own scenarios, before D&amp;D was in books. I was thrilled when I discovered lil published scenarios, that others had done. I played pretty frequently for about 15 years. And even after I slowed down I played occasionally with some close friends.<br>
<br>
I remember years ago, after the initial D&amp;D rage wore off and Vampire real time RPG became the in thing. A friend said the same thing to me about D&amp;D.<br>
<br>
So 4 years...hell I been roleplaying for about 35 years. The only difference now, I do it online, whenever I want. And 35 years from now, I hope I am sitting in some old folks home still killing dragons in my head, or making friends with them.<br>

<br>
There are very few &quot;casual&quot; players in EQ, in fact , for most people EQ becomes a very big part of their RL ..many boarder on it consuming their &quot;real lives&quot;. <br>
It is addictive and players do what drug addicts do &quot; deny, deny, deny&quot;. How many people do you know who have quit and come back, even several times- or people who say they are quitting and don't- Does that sound like an addiction  to you?<br>
<br>
We played a game Where you &quot;black list&quot; people because they killed monsters and broke rules that a mini-government within the game set- I don't recall ever electing anyone to tell me how I could play my GAME.<br>
<br>
People actually Flame Flames, score flames, Suddenly everyone becomes snobs to the person who doesn't spell check or use proper grammar- excuse me but last time I checked these are message boards for a fucking game- <br>
Only the many who have been away from all this can even see how petty it all is.<br>
<br>
<br>
EQ is a game, that for most people should have been considered over long long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
We that have been threw EQ rehab just wish you could see what we see- not very different from a X-smoker.<br>

Read Shally's post above and you'll see it, and while it is true that Everquest has all of the properties of an addictive behavior, anything that a person spends 20+ hours per week of their life involved in is not 'just a game'.<br>
<br>
Everquest is not just a game.  There's no shame in saying that.  Everquest is a community.  Everquest is a lifestyle, and this sort of behavior is nothing new.<br>
<br>
Have you ever seen science fiction fans (Fen) or SCA 'geeks' or Trekkies?  These sorts of lifestyle obsessions are natural to a certain segment of human society.  People make fun of you for playing everquest for the same reason that I would make fun of Trekkies.  From the outside, it looks stupid.<br>
<br>
Real?  Imaginary?  I don't fucking care.  I do what I want to do, and I'm happy to live in a country that lets me.  In the end we're all dead anyway, whether we measure our success in money, how many chicks you've nailed, how many bodies you have buried in your basement, or how many AA's you've amassed.<br>

They may not dress like vampires, but they do dress like their characters in game, and actually DO go into public area's and do RL quests.

<br>
Anyway, I got started in this game a few years ago.  I lived in a small city called Vicksburg, Mississippi.  If you are a Civil War buff you're probably at least a little familiar with it.  At the time I was working as a craps dealer in one of the four riverboat casinos there in the city.  I would get off work usually between midnight and two AM.  Those of you that have been in a casino and seen how real craps work, you know it's a very fast paced, active game.  After my shift there was no way to just go home and go to bed.  Equally television at 2 AM is less than entertaining.  So, in this town your choices after work were.... 1.)Go to one of the other casinos and blow a substantial segment of your paycheck....2.)Go to a local bar, and get exceedingly drunk, possibly killing yourself on the way home, and still tearing through your paycheck like Kobe Bryant through panties.......3.)Go home and try to find something on television that is almost entertaining and not selling something.<br>
<br>
So, a friend of mine that worked in the casino introduced me to this game.  I figured, I've played RPGs in one form or another since 1981, what's the difference.  And, it's only 9.95 a month.  Hence, and addict was born.  Yes, I'm addicted to everquest, ciggarettes, and sex.  Which is much better than gambling, alcohol, and crack.  I choose to spend what free time I have available, after my kids are fed and heading to bed, involved in this game, having fun with people I've never actually seen.  What do you do with your free time that's so much more enlightened?  At 8 PM when it's too early to go to bed, and too late to do yard work, I'm playing a video game.  The fall lineup on Fox didn't look that impressive to me, it's not taking you to Nirvana bro.  Although it is made up of nothingness.<br>

<br>
I have to disagree with you though.  When my brother quit EQ I heard the same arguments from him.  Then when he went back to it during the summer from having nothing to do, his arguments changed to EQ being ok to play when you have nothing to do.  Then, when he was playing again during school, it was ok to play again!  <br>
<br>
Haha IMO this is hypocritical behavior.  Most people only think its ok to play EQ if they are part of the player-base it seems.  This is a lot more consistant with Borick's post.  I would say those who don't play EQ (who have quit, not people who never played) and those who do equally see the good and bad things of EQ.  However, since those who quit EQ often still want to play for a good while after they quit, they try to convince themselves of the horrors of EQ by focusing on them, and thus making quitting and staying away from it easier.  I mean, sure, if you convince yourself that you are so much more enlightened now, that's a huge motive to stay away from EQ.  Because if you do go back to it how can you justify it to yourself?  It's hard to.  <br>
<br>
In fact, however, this behavior is common everywhere and for pretty much everything.  Ever bought something in a store, then looked at advertisements to confirm that the item you purchased was worth it by looking over its good points?  Same idea.  EQ hasn't gotten any worse since the time people who have quit were playing, and no, you all haven't gained some kind of new insight in this that the rest of us naive folk don't see.  You just need to justify your choice of quitting, and those of us who play need to do the same for our choice so we focus on the good things, not paying attention to the bad as much.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dirgul>Dirgul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/21/03 4:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1429.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: People who hate us</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What I am noticing is when I bring up EQ to them, I sometimes get snide comments like &quot;You still play that?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Haha yes that is funny indeed.Me and about 6 real life friends started playin EQ alooooooong time ago.When we first started we were pretty much power gamers and were all 3 - 4 boxin.They all quit playin over a year ago.I myself got rid of all my accounts except for my first one.Anyway, when i hang out with those fuckers, they do not allow me to bring up EQ Lol.If i do bring up EQ i get the evil eye and some sort of speech about there is more to life then EQ.Actually, whats classic is when you go into a computer store and meet somoene you dont know and they play EQ.They look at you and talk to you like your a part of some freakin psycho cult or sumpin Haha <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=patmcrotch>patmcrotch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.originalicons.com/guesticons/Guest.Icons.72/raiders.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Get it? <br>

Although, you make friends in this game, and one way to keep in touch is to check the message boards you know they follow.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Corso checks the Tindi boards as much, or more so than here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Calling Everquest an addiction for *everyone* is stupid.  I play everquest because I have free time.  Because I have met tons and tons of people I like to talk to, and play with.  With out the people, this game is shit.  I've never once let eq take over my real life.  I've logged in the middle of raids to get RL shit done that has come up, and just coffin CRed myself later.<br>
<br>
Just because some people are addicted to drinking, doesn't mean all drinkers are addicted.  Same rule applys here.  And just because you quit smoking, doesn't mean you are better than smokers.   Get off your high horse.<br>
<br>
P.S smokers are stupid.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kitofvols>Kit of VoLS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/21/03 6:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1429.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.coolarchive.com/gifanimations/animals/kitty.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: People who hate us</span><hr size=1> I quit because I am having a baby.

Spending millions of hours playing Everquest when your only responsible for yourself is a choice though, and doesn't hurt anyone but you, so I say go for it if you can.  EQ is cheap and fun, I spent 3+ years playing, I would still play if I wasn't about to have a baby.<br>

I do miss some of you though.

Say what you will, say what you want but from my own personal experience, EQ is the only game i have ever played out of a lot of games that I played and still play that ever came close to ruining any portion of my normal everyday life.<br>
<br>
It is THE most addictive game I have EVER played or even seen. In the hands of the weak minded person *cough* everyone on the rathe *cough* it can be life threatening.<br>
<br>
So yes, if you still play this after I quit then you are a piece of shit.<br>
