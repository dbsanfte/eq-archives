<br>
Our warrior, just leaving the scene of another successful battle, was walking back through the woods to the nearby city of Kelethin to celebrate with some Ale. The sun had just gone down, and it was getting rather dark. Bruised and tired, he was looking forward to some stories with the drunkard before finding a young wood elf maiden and retiring to the inn for the night. <br>
<br>
The warrior heard a faint snarl from behind him. His keen warrior instincts made him grip his two handed long sword tighter, ready for a stealth opponent... but too late, a very large orc centurion jumped out of the trees and bashed him from above, stunning him. While stunned, the centurion proceeded to pummel and bash the warrior. The orc was much larger than the warrior, and appeared to be much stronger. The warrior's courage was equaled by few, so rather than fleeing, he shook the blows off best he could and began to slash and kick furiously at his attacker. However, his wounds were getting worse and greater in number, and he knew that this centurion was out of his league... fearing for his life, his veins began to pulse with adrenaline, and he went into a berzerker frenzy. Pumped up and fearful for his life, the warrior tried to slash the orc with a fatal blow, but the orc dodged and stunned him again... The warrior knew that this was his end, and prepared to die as a warrior should, battling to the death.<br>
<br>
From somewhere closeby a calm voice said, &quot;Care for a hand, friend?&quot; The warrior replied with an exhausted, &quot;Please, help me... he's too much...&quot;<br>
<br>
A wizard materialized behind the orc, and his eyes were twinkling with a electic aura and the air began to smell faintly of ozone.  The orc sensed a presence behind him, and turned to attack. The orc was too late. The wizard beamed a smile at the orc and calmly reached out his hand and touched the orc on the shoulder, sending a huge shock of lightning into the orc. The orc howled in pain and began to convulse as lightning pulsed through him. The orc broke free and began to run for the dark bushes nearby. The wizard turned to the warrior and said, &quot;He wants to be away from us, then he shall be gone for good.&quot; The wizard closed his eyes and put his hands together, as if to pray. He mumbled a few words in a tongue that the warrior didn't understand, and began to pull his hands apart. A ball of fire began to grow between his hands, and grew to almost the size of a gnome. The wizard opened his eyes and the ball of fire shot forth toward the orc... At that moment the orc turned to see if either of the two were persuing him, only to see a ball of flame strike him dead on. The orc screamed as he burst into flames. He tried to run and get the flames off, but it was no use. The orc fell to his knees and then colpsed to the ground, writhing agony and struggling for his last breath. Finally, the orc was no more, a charred piece of history curled up neatly in the fetal position.<br>
<br>
The wizard turned to the warrior and said , &quot;Good luck friend. Get to safety and find a cleric to heal those wounds. Good luck and fairwell!&quot; The warrior started to say thankyou, but the wizard disappeared in a puff of smoke as quick as he had appeared. The warrior shouted, &quot;Thank you gracious friend! I'll never forget this, I am life debted to you...&quot; The warrior, thankful for his life, turned and started walking back to Kelethin when a voice wispered in his ear, &quot;Any time friend... just be sure to shout for help next time. I'll be around...&quot;  The warrior turned to kneel to the wizard with humility and reverance, but but there was noone there... <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usilentwizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silent Wizard</A> at: 7/17/00 11:52:27 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.showMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.showMessage?topicID=9.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
