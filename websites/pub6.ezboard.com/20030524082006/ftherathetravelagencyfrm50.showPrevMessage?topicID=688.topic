Some of them are quite good.  Thought I'd share here.  If I didn't state the source, then you can assume it's from Peter McWilliams book, Ain't Nobody's business if you do - The absurdity of consensual crimes in America.  Forgive any typos, in some cases, I typed it up a bit quickly.<br>
<br>
Life is a sexually transmitted terminal Disease.<br>
<br>
In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable teh government to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.  - James Madison<br>
<br>
moral indignation is in most cases 2%moral, 48% indignation and 50% envy. - vittorio de sica<br>
<br>
The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens free, neither restraining them nor aiding them in their pursuits. - Thomas Jefferson<br>
<br>
I have every sympathy with the American who was so  horrified by what he had read of the effects of smoking that he gave up reading. - Lord Conesford<br>
<br>
Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you  have forgotten your aim.  George Santayana<br>
<br>
There are more old drunkards than old doctors.  Benjamin Franklin<br>
<br>
&quot;I see that you, too, put up monuments to your great dead.&quot;  A Frenchman on viewing the Statue of Liberty during prohibition<br>
<br>
We learn from history that we do not learn from history.  Hegel<br>
<br>
&quot;...'murder and drug cases.. in 1991, there were fewer than 25,000 arrests for murder and more than 1,000,000 arrests for drug violations.  Of these more than a million arrests, 672, 666 were for simple posession.  Here's an even more  rightnening statistic:  In 1990, the average sentence at U.S.<br>
District Courts for first-degree murder was 12.8 years;  for 'other drug-related statutes,' 20.4 years.  Might I make it even more appalling?  The drug terms are usually mandatory; by law they must be served.  Murderers, on the other hand, can be paroled at any time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our 6% of the world's population pollutes more than the other 94% put together.  AMericans, for the most part, are benignly unaware of this, but the rest of the world is not.  In the world view, the Ugly American of the 1960's has been replaced by the Aroogant American of the 1990's.  Future wars and terrorist attacks are more likely to be protesting our pollution than our politics.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...the ratio of the average CEO's salary to that of a blue collar worker in 1980 was 25 to 1; in 1992, it was 91 to 1.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.  As a nation we began by declarind 'all men are created equal.' When the Know-Nothings get contral, it will read 'all men were created equal, except Negroes and foreigners and catholics.'  When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating<br>
to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty - to Russia for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy hypocrisy.&quot; - Abraham Lincoln<br>
<br>
&quot;... Mark Twain, once told by a blustering tycoon 'Before I die, I mean to make a pilgrimage to the top of Mt. Sinai in theHoly Land and read the Ten Commandments aloud.' 'Why don't you stay right home in Boston,' suggested Twain, ' and keep them?' &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Every effort to confine Americanism to a single pattern, to contrain it to a single formula, is disloyalty to everything that is valid in Americanism.&quot; Henry Steele Commager<br>
<br>
&quot;It gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubborness of an incorrigible  nonconformist warmly acclaimed.&quot;  Albert Einstein<br>
<br>
&quot;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,' said Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, 'It is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was we, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union.&quot; Susan B Anthony<br>
<br>
&quot;The illlegal we do immediately.  The unconstitutional takes a little longer.&quot;  Henry Kissinger<br>
<br>
&quot;[The Bill of Rights] is designed to protect individuals and minorities against the tyranny of the majority, but it's also designed to protect the people against beareaucracy, against the government.&quot;  Judge Lawrence Tribe<br>
<br>
&quot;Can any of you seriously say the Bill of Rights could get through Congress today?  It wouldn't even get out of committee&quot;  F. Lee Bailey<br>
<br>
&quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot; - Tenth Amendment<br>
<br>
&quot;When we lose the right to be different, we lose the privelege to be free.&quot;<br>
Charles Evans Hughes<br>
<br>
&quot;Liberty has never come from the government.  Liberty as always come from the subjects of government.  The history of liberty is the history of resistance.  The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it.&quot; Woodrow Wilson 1912<br>
<br>
&quot;The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.&quot;  George Washington Treaty of Tripoli 1796<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone once wrote Sir Winson Churchill, complaining that he had ended a sentence with a preposition.  He wrote back agreeing that such unforgivable grammatical errors were among the things up with which he would not put.&quot;<br>
<br>
Barbara Kingsolver: &quot;It's a fact of our culture that the loudest mouths get the most airplay, and the loudmouths are saying now that in times of crisis it is treasonous to question our leaders. Nonsense. That kind of thinking let fascism grow out of the international depression of the 1930s. In critical times, our leaders need most to be influenced by the moderating<br>
force of dissent. That is the basis of democracy, in sickness and in health, and especially when national choices are difficult, and bear grave consequences. It occurs to me that my patriotic duty is to recapture my flag from the men now waving it in the name of jingoism and censorship. . . . I would like to stand up for my flag and wave it over a few things I<br>
believe in, including but not limited to the protection of dissenting points of view&quot; (from her essay &quot;And Our Flag Was Still There,&quot; first published in the wake of 9/11 on September 25, 2001).<br>
<br>
Jeff Riggenback USA Today - &quot; As long as no children are involved, these 'crimes' are merely what Harvard philospher Robert Nozick calls 'capitalist acts between consenting adults.' In a free society, capitalist acts between consenting adults are not illegal, regardless of how many bluenoses might<br>
disapprove of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't seem to be able to check crime, so why not legalize it and then<br>
tax it out of business?&quot; Will Rogers<br>
