The other epic item is usually rolled for. But would it not be a more fair system if only 50+ rolled on the epic item. I mean they would be closest to epic and also the less then 50 will have many more chances. I have been on  raids where a 45 pally won the roll on the book and was like "what did I just win?". Right now I am at 52 and I have level slow on purpose and I have die and asked the cleric in group to give me a no exp rez (they have trouble finding that spell since it is so old). So it is hard once your 50+ and missing you epic item, I know first hand. It is also not for a lack of trying either I have been on many raids just bad luck. Plus there are alot of items to be rolled for Bards (instruments) and War/Pal (haste items). So what do you all think? <p>Thanks,<BR>

I think that anyone closest to 55+ around 52ish for them Vox,Naggy raids.  Cause YOu aren't going to finish an epic til 55+.  I almost guarantee that...  Otherwise you are in a guild large enough to support you and then you can do your own dragon raids.<br>

She's still just under 50, but I'd vote to let a 50+ roll and her not should one of her items drop. Just makes logical sense.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Fortunately, Druids are one of the few that apparantly can actually get pretty far with Epics before 50.

A paladin who wins a book and asks what he won..... I was about to say should be shot, but he's innocent actually. It's the raid leader who should be shot. Raven would NEVER let that happen.<br>

If you have enough friends, even people in small guilds can complete their epics at a relatively early age.  While I agree that maybe only letting people 50+ be in rolls might be ok, reserving them for only the people who are level 52 would be going to far.<br>

<br>
I was present when a LEVEL 42 BARD won a roll on the scale, and there were only 3 bards present, the 42 and 2 50+ bards, one of which was Raventod. I did not think that this was fair or right. That bard won fair and square on the roll though within the rules that had been set by the raid leader at the time, and I respect that. But what I don't understand was why a 42 bard was raiding Vox to begin with, and what does a 42 bard need the scale for when they're not going to see their epic for months yet? It was just unsettling to me. I couldn't place blame on the 42 bard, but it just didn't seem right when someone else was almost done with their epic and only needed the scale. Hell, way back with the whole Cazic skin thing, if I was on a Fear raid and the skin dropped and I was 46, you'd better believe that I would let someone who was 50+ take it to complete their epic with. Maybe that's just me though...<br>
<br>
If I ever lead a Vox/naggy raid, I don't think I'd let anyone under 46 come, and I think I'd take into careful consideration who was there and how close they were to completing their epic, and how serious they were about their epic at all. In the end it would end up being a random roll, but there's no way a level 42 would get the scale over a level 50+ who's near epic completion. Just my oppinion though... <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000">

If it's your raid, you set the rules, and anyone who doesn't like them doesn't have to attend. If you think making that rule will hurt your chances of success, then you might not make it. However, there is lots of good dragon loot that under 50s can still win, besides epic drops. <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

<br>
Nobody under 47 should even be at a Naggy or Vox raid.   PLUS, all participants should be required to have decent resists (unbuffed) or they can't join.<br>
<br>
Why?  Players that are 46 or lower or that have inadequate resists will not pull their own weight at these dragon raids.  Granted if you have close friends level 45 or 46, I can understand a raid leader bringing them along.  However, those levels should be the rare exception, not the norm.  <br>
<br>
I've seen levels as low as 42 at these raids and I find that ridiculous.  A raid full of 42 level players would never defeat Vox or Naggy, so players at the level are just riding the coattails of the the higher levels present.<br>
<br>
Now to the point.  Assuming you restrict the raid to level 47 and above and assuming all those players have decent (unbuffed) resists, then all participants should get a shot to roll on items based on their class (as outlined by Bish in other thread). <br>
 <br>
However, the raid leader should have the option of keeping one item of his or her choice.  If the raid leader will do this, he or she should make it very clear to all participants before the raid.<br>
<br>
If you want to restrict rolling of epic items to 50+ players, you might as well restrict the entire raid to 50+.   For example, if I had a level 49 warrior with good resists, I would upset if I didn't get a chance to roll on a red dragon scale if it dropped.  A 49 warrior with good resists can definitely pull his own weight as a Naggy or Vox raid, so he should get a chance to roll like everyone else.<br>

Whether they be level 49 or 52, they dedicated the same amount of time for the raid.<br>
<br>
But then again, it is all up to the raid leader.  If the raid leader is reserving the scale for a 35 bard, it's up to him.  The raid leader reserved the time, gathered the people, and leading the raid.  If you don't like the raid rules, don't go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=irulanicorrino>Irulani Corrino</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/01 6:54:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=821.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What to get your opnion on a great idea by Raventod</span><hr size=1> Hi everybody, I am the Bard that won that scale.<br>

I yield the point that a majority of the people feel that the +50 bards should get first crack at the scale. I undertsand that POV and if in that situation, agree with it. I have no wish to belittle anyone in that situation either.<br>

He was angry at me because I was allowed to role at all. Secondly to that; I was not willing to yield the scale to the higher lvl bards. And that doing so is a sign of disrespect.<br>
<br>
Nowhere in what he said to me is a reason for the anger to be directed at me, and that confuses. I did not rig the roll, I did not have some sort of back-alley deal with the raid runner. There as no cheating. It was seeded, we rolled, I won. This I was literally my first raid of any kind of uber mob. I had no clue on the rules players devised along the way on determining who gets loot. All I knew (and still know) loot is done on how the guy running it wants it. I specifically asked this gentleman whether I would have the right to any loot, and he said yes.<br>
<br>
I understand why people woudl be angry; we all get mad when we don't win an item we _really want in a lotto.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is how that anger is aimed at me.<br>

<br>
I know of both incidents of which you speak, and while I hate to speak for someone else, I can tell you that the gentleman who left your group this morning was not angry at you for winning the roll on the scale.<br>
<br>
The reason he was angry and the thing that you did that made him angry, was that you (and you confirmed this with him when he asked), were told the situation of the scale, and refused to do what many people consider the right thing and give it to someone who can actually use it within the next few months.<br>
<br>
As far as refusing to group with you, well that's his perrogative.  Granted, you may be a wonderful person who he will never get to know.  But again, it's his perrogative to exercise his option to leave a group.  I DO know that he tried to explain his reasoning to you, quite politely in fact, for quite some time.  <br>
<br>
You're correct, it was your right to loot the scale according to the rules of the raid.  There are just some people that would have preffered you to be the &quot;bigger man&quot; and give it to someone who could actually put it to use NOW.<br>
<br>
I don't want to turn this into a flame, because this forum is not for that.  I would suggest if there is any more conversation on this subject that it be kept civil.  If it can't be kept civil, then please just start a new thread in F&amp;R.<br>

<br>
Irulani is the level 42 Bard who beat me by one point to win the white scale. <br>
<br>
Was I angry at Irulani? Nope.<br>
<br>
Was I angry at Sharia and Forsakenn who determined the loot rules? Nope.<br>
<br>
Was I angry? You betcha.<br>
<br>
I have killed Vox more than I care to recount after that scale. I need only it and the red scale to trigger Trak and complete my epic. Losing that roll by 1 was enough to nearly send me over the edge.<br>
<br>
I can't be angry at Irulani. She fought and died there just like I did. Whether or not, at 42, she &quot;belonged&quot; at the raid is moot. She was invited and showed up when she knew she had a shot at the scale. <br>
<br>
I can't be angry at Forsakenn as he ran a VERY good raid. He set up his loot rules ahead of time and did not change them even though what happened made him a bit unpopular.<br>
<br>
I am angry at the system. Parhaps there's no better way to describe it than that. I have to continue to stall my leveling to get the scale from Vox unless I want to kill Gorenaire, something which is not within my grasp right now.<br>
<br>
I will tell you one thing, if I hear that the scale goes up for sale or is used for something other than Irulani's epic quest, I will be angry. It's her scale to do with what she pleases, but as a bard, I hope she uses it to get herself a Singing Short Sword, since she won over two others who wanted it for just that purpose and the raid leader gave only our class shots at it for just that purpose.<br>
<br>
Irulani, I congratulated you on your win and I do so now. Anyone who has bad feelings about her over this really should not. If anything learn from what happened that night and be more cognizant of your loot rules as a result. <p><p align="center">

Irulani didn't break any rules of the raid, and was invited to the raid. Irulani rolled fair and square, and won. Congratz on your VERY rare epic piece Irulani!! You have no idea how lucky you are...<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just thinking in the same mentality that the whole server has gotten into over getting clerics their epics, where we should pump out epics like there's no tomorrow. But maybe I don't think it's fair for someone to get the scale who can't use it for many levels. Like I said before, if I were in Fear and a Cazic skin were to drop, there's no way in hell I'd roll on it, because I won't be anywhere near ready to use it for another 4 months, at the very least.<br>
<br>
<br>
I tell you one thing that would REALLY enrage me... I notice Irulani has only one post anywhere on EZboards. If I found out that Irulani was someone's twink that had tagged along for dragon loot and was only pretending to be a primary, WOW would that tick me off. Especially with the scale thing... Innocent until proven guilty, but I'd be interested to see if Irulani's IP address matched up with anyone else's. But if Irulani truely is a primary and not someone's twink (I don't know this person at all, forgive me) then it wouldn't bother me at all, but I still think it's wrong out of principle- but in that case I couldn't blame Irulani directly. You play the game the way you want, it's your char to be whoever you want to be with...<br>
<br>
I'm going to leave this topic alone for a while... I have too many conflicting oppinions on different aspects going through my head and a suspicion that could be very insulting if I were incorrect on it... I'll shut up for now, because you can't change the past. <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000">

Harmdalet the main tank and has been to fear i don't know how many dozens of times is down to only needing two pieces of umbral to complete her suit. Raventod allowed our guild to bring it's own group and Pestylence, our sk, won a roll on the boots.<br>
<br>
Being the first time raiding fear with the alliance(or any raid with them I think) he defered the boots to her. When she finishes her suit, do you think she is just going to throw PoF away and never head back till they are ready to drop CT(hush chak, they can dream)? Hell no, she is going to be back there each time helping everyone else out that helped her. But are you, Irulani, going to go on and even host dragon raids for the next month or two to help people like Jaz and all the other raiders that are still waiting for pieces?  You can answer that if you like but personally I doubt it, I'm thinking you will power through you 40's trying to get to your mid 50's as fast as possible to try and get to a point where you can finish your quest.<br>
<br>
Then again, as soon as Raventod gets his scales I know he is going to leave 52 and dragons far behind but I also know that if you had asked him for help on your epic later on he would remember your kind act and do everything in his power to help you.<br>
<br>
I'm not mad about anything. I'm not angry with anyone. I'm just disgusted at blind greed.<br>

Have to agree with chakan too though, at 42 is there much besides mana song for the casters a bard can do against Vox? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umaoudeib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maoudeib</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Aviak Rook</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/01 10:49:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=821.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /disagree Amethyst</span><hr size=1> The bard who won the scale did nothing wrong.  He was invited to the raid, participated, and rolled on an item according to his class.<br>
<br>
However, raid leaders should really not be inviting anyone under 47 into Vox or Naggy raids.  Like Chakan said, a level 42 person will make 0 contribution.  At that level dragon fear will keep you running away and ineffective for the entire raid.<br>
<br>
Oh btw, it doesn't matter if it's someone's twink character or not.  What if the person wanted to try a bard now cause they got tired of being a necro (but still have the high level necro around for stuff like corpse summons or higher level raids)?<br>
<br>
Bottom line: if you are invited or permitted to join the raid, you deserve a fair shot at items for your class like anyone else.  If a raid leader decides to invite some low level friends, it's your choice to deal with it, or leave.<br>

I'm not saying that I'm right, I'm just saying that it's my opinion, and I know several others who feel the same way.  You and I could probably talk and explain why each of us feels the way we do, but I doubt that we could sway one another to the other side of an issue that arouses such passionate beliefs in many people.<br>
<br>
I've always had a problem with holding people up to high expectations, and my generally positive nature always assumes that people will do what I think is the &quot;nice&quot; or the &quot;right&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I get disappointed a lot ;&gt;<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not going to post to this thread again, since I see that this could easily degenerate into something FAR from the original subject matter.<br>
