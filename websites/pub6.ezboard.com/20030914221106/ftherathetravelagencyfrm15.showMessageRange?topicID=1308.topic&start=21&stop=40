<br>
My dissatisfaction with the cleric class is purely my own.  Though I've seen similar complaints from other clerics, I can't speak for them.  This rant is -my- rant and it's coming from a very burned out player.<br>
<br>
Clerics are required for raids.  Clerics are the howitzer of healing classes, and without them a guild just won't progress very far.  'Need more clerics' is almost a mantra in Noble Blade, and always has been.  Clerics are valued and pampered.<br>
<br>
You would think that all of this attention would make clerics more desirable a class, but the truth is that all of the power of the cleric is focused into one thing:  The boss fight.  On any given raid with 8 to 10 clerics, you may need 2 clerics to manage all of the content up to whatever your next named mob is.  This was most apparent in Vex Thal, but I've also found it to be true as we struggle through the elemental content.<br>
<br>
A cleric shows up and the raid spends hours clearing, while the clerics huddle in a protected group surrounded by the rest of the raid.  There's no need to learn the zone as a cleric.  There's not really any need to even see the mobs that you're fighting.  Most of your clerics don't even need to be AT the raid until the boss is pulled.  On an 8 hour raid, I may only spend an hour of that time actually doing anything, unless I'm the main tank healer during the trash clearing.<br>
<br>
Outside of that boss mob healing role, clerics are pitifully underpowered.  A good cleric can use his 1100 point nukes to help clear the yard trash, but that contribution is pretty sad when you examine the cast/recast of those spells compared to every other DPS class in the game.  You won't really notice it if your idle clerics don't nuke.<br>
<br>
I got sick of it some time ago and levelled my necromancer to 65.  That's when I really discovered just how miserable the cleric is.  With the necro, I have instant access to XP at any time when we aren't raiding.  Though a necro isn't all that great in groups, Sony has managed to upgrade them to the point where they serve equally as well as most classes in that role.  On raids, necromancers have become superb damage dealers who can offer a vital contribution, especially against those mobs that the melees can't touch for fear of AE rampage or suchlike.<br>
<br>
The necromancer interacts with the environment.  As a cleric, I watch red bars.  My attention is focused on others and not on the environment.  With the necromancer I'm actively doing something useful most of the time, and not just twiddling my thumbs or making work for myself with some worthless magic-based nuke that might hit for 200 points of damage if it's not completely resisted.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if I'd never played a necromancer, I'd still be happy with my cleric, but logging in Borick, for all of the gear I've carefully built up over the years, leaves me feeling like a powerless cripple compared to my necromancer in all of his Kael quest armor.<br>
<br>
I'm sick of being required and obligated to attend with a class that nobody ever has enough of.  I'm sick of never having enough of that class to do the job right, and I'm just sick of grouping, healing and generally playing a support role.   I think that if Sony just gave the healing power of clerics to shamans and druids, the game might survive a little bit longer.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 1209<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/27/03 10:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clerics?</span><hr size=1> Having dropped a cleric main to roll Jurrasic, I know exactly how he feels as well, though it was quite a bit longer ago and well before the high end of EQ as we know it was formed. <br>
<br>
 I'd have never been able to continue EQ as a cleric main in a raiding environment, yet lack of turnout of what class will have a raid called off 95% of the time? You guessed it, Cleric.<br>
<br>
I'd say 'need more clerics' is a mantra of any high end guild, and it's not right.  <br>
<br>
 Word is they're giving druids a Rez next expansion. Screw that, give them an EXACT copy of complete heal please.   They won't be able to fill in for a cleric on ALL raids, but surely on a MT/CH rotation.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 292<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/27/03 10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/520013139003-001/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clerics?</span><hr size=1> Clerics are boring as fuck.  This is nothing new.  I guess it really depends on what each person behind each character enjoys though.  That's what it really comes down to.  And it sounds like you just don't enjoy clerics.<br>
<br>
But, if you give a shaman or a druid the ability to heal on par with a cleric, any cleric with a brain would quit EQ or quit their cleric.  What would clerics get then that would really set them apart?  Buffs?  AE Elixir?  Rezzes?  LoL...<br>
<br>
It's a no win situation.  Druids and shaman do not deserve to heal on par with a cleric, period.  If SoE did that, they'd have to give clerics dots and slows and shit to be fair.  That would be stupidity.  There are different classes for different reasons.<br>
<br>
Does it suck that you need a high number of clerics as opposed to any other class for almost every encounter?  Yes.  <br>
<br>
But really... what do you suggest?  That they have other classes heal on par with clerics during raid situations?  See above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=borick>Borick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>'Sid</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/27/03 10:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   At this point...</span><hr size=1> At this point, Shogon, I really wouldn't care.

The class isn't fun to play.   After a few months (I hung on for two years) as a raid cleric, the obligation and pressure of it just makes you feel like you're working a second job.

Being the most needed class to you seems to be a burdeon, to me it would be a focal point of my pride on raids.  &quot;they cant win w/o me, etc..&quot;<br>
<br>
your 1100 nuke actually can reach 2200 (crits) with nothing but AA, then if you can get a hold of a RM dd focus (not super common, but there are some out there) you are looking at 2500 dd, with SCM3 + elemental gloves (nuker mana preserve) - throwing this dd between healing doesnt even dent your mana bar.  I do it all the time (as to alot of clerics, during clearings).<br>
<br>
Really depends on your playstyle and perceptions.  There is honestly no difference between casting Strike of Solusek on boss mobs, versus casting CH on MT at boss mobs, when you think about it..just pressing a button in each case.<br>
<br>
Imo you can make it a fun or miserable time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rixenbladebane>Rixen Bladebane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/27/03 4:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/520013139003-001/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: At this point...</span><hr size=1> Each person makes their class what they play it.

The fact of the matter is, there are numerous things that clerics can do that don't involve healing.  My main is a mage, but I also have a cleric alt that I play whenever I am needed on raids.  Clerics can either heal, nuke, melee, play crowd control, etc etc.  Hell, we even have one of our clerics on our MT rotation sometimes as a laugh.. and he lasts an extremely long time with that hammer that procs pretty much every swing.<br>

YOU are the one that decides what it is you do.  Try something different, try something new.. you might be surprised at what you can do.<br>

Nothing thrills me more than knowing that my one perfectly timed CH saved the MT from dieing...and theirfor prevented the entire raid from whipeing.

Cleric is what you make of it.  I never had problems entertaining myself as a raid cleric.  I did have to stop playing cleric (Baysar is now played by another guildie) just because my personal playstyle needed to change -- I need to be able to look away from the PC sometimes, or log to go to bed at a decent hour, and with a cleric that is hard to do without worrying about compromising the raid. <br>
<br>
So now I play dps classes. Sure they are important too but for most raids my departure means &lt;= 10 seconds longer on an encounter.  Unless its something like RZtW encounter, that doesn't make much difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lukieb2>Lukieb2</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boggletech.com/zi0/sperm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member User</span><br>  Posts: 766<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/28/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: At this point...</span><hr size=1> Each class is what you make of it.  I agree that clerics play a support role, but their support role is crucial.  Without clerics, there is no progression in this game.  It is this very reason that playing a cleric becomes exciting.  We are the backbone of EVERY raid, back bone of most EXP groups, and essentially the backbone of the game.  <br>
<br>
I agree in what you wrote Borick, but it seems like you are looking for something that a cleric is NOT.  We're NOT high DPS machines, or anything to that liking.  Clearing on raids is very boring, but like everything, it's what you make of it.  I usually take this time to fuck off and talk shit with friends.  Hell, I'd rather have the time to do that then having to focus on meleeing/nuking a mob on every pull.  As you mentioned, the pressure on big boss mobs is enough.. <br>
<br>
Different strokes for different folks.  Obviously, you get your EQ boner from doing DPS and feeding mana.  On the other hand, I get mine on hitting a rotation on time and keeping my guildies alive.  So be it..either play a class because you like it or don't play it again.  No sense in clamming up about the flaws of each class because they each have flaws.  Everyone should play the class the enjoy..else there's no reason to play the game.<br>

<br>
Cleric is a fun class to play. Its mellow when doing the xp grind (can watch movies etc) and upbeat during raid encounters. Sure the grinding through annoying mobs getting to the &quot;raid mob&quot; can be annoying but I don't see how melee'ing through them or dotting through them would be anymore fun. If anything would be the &quot;death of clerics&quot; it should have been Luclin, with the brainless killing of mobs in VT which seem to have the dps of a PoP xp mob. On AHR 2-3 clerics could fall asleep or be mega late in the heal rot and it wouldn't matter much, what fun is that?<br>
<br>
Anyways, I enjoy the fact we're critical. I love the fact that by logging on, I can help increase the effectiveness of the guild/raid. And I enjoy the times when we are on a 1.5 second CH rot and I still occasionally land heals for 7k hps. Imo cleric is one of the most fun classes to play IF you primarily want to raid and don't mind the lack of ability to solo or accomplish much on our own. Obviously some people aren't happy.. go to EQCleric and listen to the dozens of rants and whines about the class. But in general most people I know love the class and would pick it again if given a choice.<br>

Attentiveness.  100% attentiveness is required by a cleric, yet that attention is only actually needed at a very small percentage of the raid.  Clerics are very 'hurry up and wait', hovering over a heal key in the off chance that someone grabs aggro.<br>
<br>
Obligation.  Clerics are obligated more than any other class in the game to help their guild and friends at all times.  This is even worse if your team doesn't require attendance at raids.  Those who show up tend to be burdened with far more responsibility.<br>
<br>
Support.  Some people like this.  I did it for a long time and love the feeling of power that came with people relying on me.  But that has grown stale.  I want to directly effect and control the environment.  I want to do things TO the mobs, not keep someone else alive so that they can do it.  It's a narrow distinction, and the weakest of my arguments, and the one most based upon personal feeling.<br>
<br>
You can make work for yourself, but in any role other than healing, a cleric comes in dead last in DPS and general utility.  Dead last.  <br>
<br>
Couple that with the fact that I hate grouping for my XP, and the cleric has just turned out to be a really bad choice.  I often wish that Sony would allow us to transfer our no-drop gear to other guildmates when we retire. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elanacurvacious>ElanaCurvacious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/29/03 9:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1308.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.icode4food.com/images/bananaMan.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I like my cleric.

fucking any class gets boring at times, thats why i like fighting where, if everyone isnt on the ball, you die. <br>

I played a cleric to 54 before my account was hacked and Ssarvhok became my main. In exp groups my cleric usually:<br>
<br>
1) Pulled; 3 roots + distance agro = win <br>
2) Did crowd control; fast root &gt; crappy ench always<br>
3) Did fear-kite groups; rog+rng+clr = dps+snare+fear<br>
4) Stopped casters from casting; stuns = own<br>
5) Tanked; (3 rogues + cleric in Kunark-era Sol B, rar!) <br>
6) Nuked; Could solo Undead and Drolvarg alike (not fast)<br>
7) Occasionally healed people<br>
<br>
Nowadays I still see clerics doing all of those except #3; plenty of off-tank or tank-happy clerics still out there. Plenty of clerics who actually know how to crowd control, interrupt casters, know when to nuke, enjoy pulling, etc.<br>
<br>
That's Exp-Wise... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raid-Wise</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I can't really argue either way. I've played Perator in CH rotations with Ssar smacking away at King Tormax or AOW before, it's stressful and engaging, and I can definitely understand Baysar's statement about having to be there 100%. I don't correlate that to &quot;boring as fuck&quot; though ... <br>

Assist healing on raids (in PoP) requires constant attention, fast reactions, and knowing your class well enough to understand how your mana efficiency works while still being able to keep people alive and not overagro.  And it's alot of work, meaning I have to think very quickly on my feet, and can't just automatically click a key.<br>
<br>
Rotations are kinda boring, but in PoP most rotations are so fast that you don't get bored, you end up almost chain casting.  Unlike Seru, where you can have a 6 cleric 6 sec rotation for an hour, and fall asleep cuz of the long delay.<br>
<br>
As for the lack of ability to solo, I disagree with that.  You just have to be more patient and be willing to take a lower return on xp than other classes (like wizard) would get.  I don't know of many mages that solo at high end without using charm, due to lack of a valuable spell:  root.  And yet, I don't hear constant whining from them about it.<br>
<br>
Don't forget Clerics are a plate class.  This means that you can tank, when needed.  Quite often on my cleric I will purposefully heal early in order to get agro so that the chanter will have time to mez instead of having to tank.  I do the same thing on charm breaks.<br>
<br>
Can healing get boring?  Sure it can, but so can anything else.  Wizards to be would end up being just as boring, cuz their most frequently used ability is nuking, and that's mostly (but not all) that they do.<br>
<br>
I feel privledged to play one of the backbone classes of the game, and I see rewards for it.  Clerics (especially in the old day) tend to get the better loot first (poor druids..../cry).  Clerics get treated better, both on and off raids.  I get invited to kite groups alot for xp, even though I'm low DPS, because people like me and recognize the value of a well aa'd cleric.  (2.3 cast heal that can crit for over 7k owns).<br>
<br>
It sounds to me, though, that you're just really burned out on playing your cleric.  So I think you're doing the right thing by playing your necro.  The whole point of a game / hobby / recreational activity like EQ is to have fun.  So do what lets you have fun.  In a few months, when you get burned on your necro, and start thinking about complaining how you're not doing anything but dps and feeding mana, you'll be able to swap back to your cleric and have fun with him.<br>
<br>
I know because I've let cleric friends play my enchanter before, and usually within a month or so I would get a thank you, cuz I had shown them a different side of EQ and they were enjoying their clerics more again because of it.<br>
<br>
I wish you the best of luck, and hope you are able to find and stay happy in EQ.  =-)<br>

This would mean that those that play Clerics &quot;want&quot; to play a cleric. It would also eliminate alot of the catering that's required to a lot of clerics (You know you've done it).<br>

Part of the enjoyment of playing a class is the strengths that class has that are not replicated in other classes. Would I play a cleric if a shaman was an equal healer? of course not, what would be the point? Along that line of thinking lets make SK's tank raid mobs just as well as warriors so only people who 'want to be warriors' are warriors. Or make mages nuke equal to wizards nuke, so only those who 'want to be wizards' are wizards. That has no basis in logic and definitely nothing akin to the words &quot;class balance&quot;.<br>

I'm all for giving 96% res to pallies, I don't give a flip about others being able to res. But killing the main &quot;feature&quot; of a class is senseless and has absolutely no benefit other than encouraging a good chunk of the clerics in the game to reroll or quit.
