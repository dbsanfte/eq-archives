Anyways, I always hated KEG. I was so bitter with them at the time, when my former guilde leader and semi-friend (bradan) joined them, I began hating him as well. I still don't like the KEG, but they aren't on this server, all the same. <p>Dracolithe the Devilish <br>

<br>
I was there and talked to the GM about the 'training'.  We had already talked to BotB and let them know we were coming in.  We were doing a WW break in, BotB and LoM were on the North Wall at the time.  We had folks zone in to start the clearing, a bard with us recruiting at the time had never been in PoF.  Scarelings ported him away north, a good way beyond the Fetid fiend house.  He had no idea where he was and ran to where he saw some people.  Those people happened to be BotB and LoM.  He brought mobs with him and everybody died.<br>
<br>
Early on, it was KEG, MFH, and CIW in the &quot;Triad&quot; alliance.  BotS, Council of Darkness, and Knights of the Iron Cross formed &quot;BCK&quot;.  BCK held together longer than Triad but eventually all broke up.<br>
<br>
The hatred between BotS and KEG started in Lower Guk.  Docd zoned in and was XPing in Yukitaro's spot or something so Yukitaro trained Docd repeatedly to get him to leave.  Of course, Docd started returning the favor.  Thus, the conflict began.  Later, when PoF was first released, a naked Yukitaro Zoned in and streaked across PoF to the North Wall with all the mobs in his train and killed a BotS raid.  He later claimed 'a turmoil toad feared him'.  PoF was changed later and made much more difficult.  A BotS member named Saul discovered a spot that had no mobs pathing through it.  It was on the North Wall and was called the SS (Saul Spot).  For several weeks, BotS was the only guild on any server who could break PoF.  Even though lots of BotS didn't like KEG, one night Snaggle said he was thinking about joining us or something and wanted to tag along to PoF.  We said he could as long as he didn't tell anyone how to break PoF to which he agreed.  The next day, Snaggle had drawn up maps including the path to get to SS, posted these maps, then advertised about taking open raids there.<br>
<br>
We posted lots about PoF being broken (along with other servers) because nothing was dropping.  On our 50th or so clearing (no, not exaggerating) of PoF after the original 'fix', our first druid item dropped and it was a hat.  Sholan and I /random 100 on it (neither of us wanted because we figured something good would drop next and getting the hat meant the other druid got the next item).  He rolled 19 and was happy, then I rolled a 12.<br>
<br>
The calendar reservation system started over access to the planes around this time.<br>
<br>
Kunark came out.  KEG killed Venril Sathir because a guy from another server made a deal with KEG.  He would start a level 1 guy and level up and join KEG in exchange for the strat to kill VS.  KEG took this deal and started farming VS early.  BotS started working on Trakanon and killed him eventually.  We started farming him.  Eventually KEG turned toward Trakanon as well and started racing us.  It was really nasty a few times.  Once, we were in the 'cubby' and KEG leapfrogged us.  A GM came and listened to the two sides, then told KEG they had 2 minutes to attempt, then it would be our turn.  KEG tried and got wiped out.  We killed and were happy.  Somewhere in there Majdar did the &quot;Wave One GO!&quot; shout in Sebilis and got KEG killed by Trakanon.<br>
<br>
Around the start of Kunark, Cinexa (who was a guide) got the password of a GM-Admin type character who could do things on The Rathe.  It was during this time that BotS became very introverted and quiet from fear of Cinexa.  If you recall, there was a thread started on this board that touched on Cinexa possibly doing something like this and KEG came out in force to shut it down.  Anyway, Cinexa was rumored to do such things as log on the GM-Admin account and plant 'duped' items on other players toons, then turn them in to get them banned as well as giving herself and her friends GM rezes.<br>
<br>
The whole rotation system was set up to keep KEG and BotS from getting so ugly over Trakanon and especially in the threat of Cinexa.  We worked out a rotation between the two guilds with provisions for other guilds to join.  Later, CIW joined.  As it got bigger, more people got involved until eventually it is what it is today. <br>
<br>
Around in there, BotS got disbanded for the PoF thing, the GM who did it was fired the next week.  During that time, one of BotS members had an alt who was the GL of a small guild called Blades of Destiny.  We reformed that night under that tag so we'd have /gu to discuss wth was going on.  Eventually it ticked us off so we all went and cleared VP for the first time on our server under the Blades of Destiny tag.  After around a month, the GMs let us reform but we couldn't use the same name.  We talked about it in IRC and email and came up with Blood of the Spider (we wanted the same acronym).<br>
<br>
KEG had a small membership and wanted to stay that way.  On any given raid, they /guildinvited at least another 50% to 100% of their ranks per raid.<br>
<br>
SoV came out and by that time, KEG had degenerated quite a bit.  We started Giant Faction right off and went toward Sleepers and such.  After a little while, KEG started recruiting heavily and got their numbers up.  They were still fairly far behind all the way until they left for Zeb.<br>
<br>
The server split came and things got a lot nicer for a while.  Spirit of Tunare rushed in to fill the power vacuum caused when KEG and CIW left the server.  Luckily for BotS, SoT did not have the PR machine that KEG had (KEG's #1 strength was the PR machine).  SoT couldn't get away with stuff like KEG did.  Eventually, SoT was bad enough to become the new 'bad boys' on the server, unseating BotS from that position.  For the most part, we tried to be quiet most of the time and let them do their own selves harm, with some nudging on occassion.<br>
<br>
In SoV, BotS was leading on the server 'do firsts' by a long shot.  Eventually, FoH and another guild, mind block atm, 'exploited' the 4th warder and released Kerafyrm.  The other guild got disbanded for it.  The warders were changed and BotS was working hard to kill the warders, secretly racing FoH (although they didn't know it).  On our 5th try on the 4th Warder we killed it.  We had GMs with us in the zone every attempt so that we knew we'd be doing things legit.  When Kerafyrm was released, the GMs congrat'd us and all of EQ sat back to watch.  (We did this without ever having set foot in ToVN).  Of course, then everyone realised that releasing Kerafyrm was actually a bad thing and that we were hosed.  It wasn't until about 4 months later when people started releasing Kerafyrm out of server politics on other servers.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until ToVN issues that I started dealing with Karadin and Thundaron/Nycah more and discovered that these folks were genuine and really deserved my respect.  Karadin always did what he said and Thundaron and Nycah tried their best against tremendous odds (Shei's ego) to make SoT behave more agreeably to the server - not that they curb Shei that often, but we could all see the effect that they were having on SoT over time.<br>
<br>
Eventually, SoL came out.  BotS missed killing the AoW during the SoV era by one week =/ something that griped us a lot.  We killed AoW like the first or second week after SoL came out.  The race was on in SoL to do all the stuff.  There were various frictions but nothing tremendously huge in SoL.  Eventually, on our 13th attempt (done over 15 days), we killed the Emperor in Ssra and got our first VT keys.  We held off on distributing them until we killed the Emperor a 2nd time so that everyone could get keys at the same time (only get 40 per emperor kill).<br>
<br>
Now PoP has come out and we are dealing with the 43223423 time sinks required before we can see any items that are worth saving from the Destroy button.  The 40% shaman slow in PoP has made almost everything previous trivial (as usual per an expansion), and rogues are now being outdamaged by at least 5 other classes (not including the ones who can dire charm mobs). But... that is another story entirely... to be completed some months from now. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 12/10/02 8:01:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trolojesterkinng>Trolo Jesterkinng</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/8/02 10:37:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some info on Rathe history</span><hr size=1> Wait, the server split was like a year or a year and half ago.

When I came back to the rathe after a year and a bit off, the server had already split, and no one had woken the sleeper yet. <br>
<br>
Also, SoT was formed before Kunark, because my old guild, Guards of Tunare, was formed well before Kunark, when I was level 14. WHen I was 19ish it was so cool to hunt Dark Elf guards in Nek, and I had a conflict with whomever the first guild leader of SoT was at the Nek zone. Something about my guildies and I being pissed they had a similar name to ours, and they said we copied them, we said the same of them. Both accused the other of being upstarts etc. <br>
Anyways, Kunark came out when my druid hit 39 or something, so it was before kunark. <br>
<br>
So yeah, not important, but seems some of the timing was a bit off.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;"> Alistriwen Skylotus </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Humiliating<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;"> evil</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> villains around the world! </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> 54th Enchanter of the Rathe </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">Champions of Norrath</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alistriwen>Alistriwen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/8/02 11:25:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seerfamily>Seer Family</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/9/02 10:26:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some info on Rathe history</span><hr size=1> Vague foggy memory I was thinking we have had 2 server splits...<br>

<br>
It started with 6 guilds:  League of Levity, Knights of Phoenix, Tindi`Losi, Muse and Merriment, Black Talons, and Everlasting Alliance.  <br>
<br>
The alliance did well enough in competing against the other 2 groups, however were still usually a step behind.  The alliance had enough to kill the dragons and clear the planes when most people could not.  <br>
<br>
Eventually Tindi`Losi out grew the alliance and left.<br>
Shortly afterwards, Debranna seemed to get fed up with the alliance and Knights of Phoenix left (with me as the only warrior in the guild.)  I had my problems with the officers pratically kicking the lower members, and my friends, to the curb, so when they quit, I went with them.  Right before the server split, turmoil hit Knights of Phoenix, with about half the guild wanting to split, and the other half wanting to stay, so they were disbanded right after the server split (by a disgruntled x-member of the guild that left for the server split that had no right, and if you read this, i still hate you for that).  After I left KoP, I started hunting with a long time friend Xenitabra, who was in League of Levity at the time.  He was urging me to join the guild, and so one day Redbull threw me the invite, and I accepted.  <br>
<br>
Some where in there FoR cleared up to the 6th isle, beating KEG out!  FoR was on the rise!  With this new zeal of energy, the officers talked, and decided to merge into Foundation Rathe.  The new guild FR was met with reluctancy from the other guilds.  A good deal decided to give FR a try, and the members that remained in the other guilds were of course welcome on the raids.  Needless to say, the serversplit came, and the officers of FR were secretly planning on moving to Zeb the entire time to hook up with the uber guild from E'ci.  So when the time came, FR was in trouble.  Vorth, Mithandriel and Donde(?)  stepped up to be the officers.  Tensions were high, and one VS raid, things blew up, and LoL with drew from the FoR alliance.  Later on, FR withdrew from the FoR alliance, if that makes sense.  FR was now its own guild entity.  FR seemed to be on the rise again, but there was always internal conflict, so members were constantly coming and going, until finally it fell apart.  <br>
<br>
LoL is still around and strong, TL is still around and strong, EA is still around, I am not sure if Black Talons are still around, and I know Muse and Merriment and Knights of Phoenix are gone.  <br>
<br>
Thats about it for FoR<br>

The only proof I need is the fact that I saw it then, and died. Was it the bard mistabone? I forget exactly, but they trained our safe spot. Anyways, I don't care about it. We were pretty steamed back then, but its ancient history now. I think the GM went too far with it though, there was no telling if it was intentional or not. Though why they were in the zone then when I believe we had it reserved was beyond us. <p>Dracolithe the Devilish <br>

<br>
it was a train, but alledgely accidental (i believe him)<br>
<br>
I wanna say the mood (of the server in general) was extreme tension - this was pre-split, 3 guilds jocking for epic parts, this was pre-ct upgrade as i recall.<br>
<br>
There were threats all around of FCFS/FFA etc, from various persons, not just bots.  <br>
<br>
There were many mistakes made that day:<br>
<br>
- bringing an invite to a controversial raid for one, he he he.<br>
- allowing this unexperienced invite (apparently 1st fear trip) to break an already occupied fearplane.  what were we thinking, haha?<br>
- in retrospect, even intruding in the first place<br>
<br>
After the train/wipe, the GM blew his/her top, and went banannas on us.  When the bard tried to take blame, GM would hear nothing of it.<br>
<br>
(my Conspiracy theory is that Cinexa (of keg) was playing that GM's toon when we got disbanded - because the actions of the GM were extremely off, regarding discipline, protocol, etc.. the whole thing was extremely unprofessional (serverwide announcement asking for the 'gm of bots'/force-joining our guild, smug mannerisms (wheres the roleplay, yo!?), which lead to his dismissal, i could be wrong though! but it sure makes a good tale!)<br>
<br>
We got disbanded, and sent on our way.  A few days (hours?) later, a member had an alt who was GM of Blades of Destiny.  (trivia: i too had an alt who had the GM tag of a guild, i was sooo tempted to take it over, but instead decided to take the high road and transferred my GM title on my alt, to the acting leader of the guild -- bonus points if you can name that guild! * bots members don't spoil!)<br>
<br>
So we raided under BoD for ~1 month, the GM was transferred, then later fired ( i think?), and we eventually got a new name Blood, instead of Brotherhood.<br>
<br>
Split happened somewhere around this time, i wanna say we got BotS tag back before split, but its all fuzzy, hehe...<br>
<br>
etc etc etc... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>

<br>
First a quote from a recent post from our original guild leader Segal Soulsaver who left the server to play on a different server a long time back.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>EA was formed in the middle of Steamfont where we were trying to powerlevel some of the lower level players. We were probably the 4th or 5th guild formed on the server, took a month of petitioning to get the tag. Which makes EA one of the oldest ongoing concerns across all servers, formed around April 1999. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I personally didn't join EA until later in the year when a bug hit that wiped guild tags and the GL of the guild I was in (Dragon Knights) never logged back in to get the guild fixed.<br>
<br>
It was about that point (mid '99) that I joined EA.  I was always about 15 or so levels at least behind the higher ups in EA so I never paid as much attention to the alliance as they did.<br>
<br>
I do know that we were allied to quite a few other guilds, of which, Gazkull gives an excellent recap a few posts up.<br>
<br>
I remeber that Foundation Rathe was the original name for the alliance, and as Gazkull mentioned we eventually tried forming into a guild named Foundation Rathe under the thought of having better communication between the alliance members.  It was met with opposition from every guilds, but in the end it went through.<br>
<br>
Then the server split happened.  EA lost most of it's higher level members to either the split of FR.  EA at that point remained with just the mid level toons officially running the guild as most of the higher levels had joined FoR.<br>
<br>
The months following the server split, FoR just went downhill.  Members leaving left &amp; right, what was left of the original EA high level characters, most went into League of Levity, where they seem to be doing rather well now.<br>
<br>
The next stretch of EA history is shakey to me as I left FoR to join FK for about a month before leaving game for 6 months.<br>
<br>
When I came back, EA was up and running again under new leadership, EA had recovered from the hardships and was running well again.<br>
<br>
Now, we still hold true to the original vision Segal had for the guild, we are not the biggest or most uber guild out there, but we have fun with the game and are proud to be amongst the longest active guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
I hope that our members, past and present, have left a lasting mark on the server so that we may be remembered and known even though we are not on the frontline dropping the big guys nightly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=383677"><img border=0 src="http://boggens.homestead.com/Files/sigs/BoggsSig.gif"></a>
