I thought it timely to bump it.  I will probably re-write it shortly based on my additional experience.<br>
<br>
I welcome any GL to post it to their own websites.<br>
<br>
My Experience on Dragon Raids.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Well I have now attended two Dragon Raids, which have both been a success. We have slain Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox in a relatively short period of time. <br>
<br>
Both of these raids were run by Raid Commander Haemish. This man knows what he is doing. Though gruff at times, he has the process down pact, to not only make the raid successful but to minimize deaths the best he can.<br>
<br>
The first thing you should know is that there are minimum levels, which is 40 for all classes, except true casters which is 45. There is a reason for this. The dragons don't like you, they take you down quickly. <br>
<br>
The second is you need resistance gear. Again there is a reason. The more your resistance is, the better chances of your survival. Lady Vox requires a minimum of 70 Cold and 70 magic (unbuffed). Now you can still attend, but be prepared to die. <br>
<br>
Sign-ups begin at the time that is posted. Groups are assigned usually an hour later. The more you straggle in getting there, the more we have all waited around for you. Standing beside the people who are taking in the sign-ins, drinking, doing emotes, casting spells, etc. creates major lag. This delays the process. So step aside and move away a bit, so that they can get their job done. By the way, don't bother buffing yourself, it's a waste of time and mana, until you have been assigned to a group. You need to bring 50pp for these raids, which you will give to your group leader once assigned. Clerics, Necromancers and Enchanters are exempt. This fee is to cover reagent expenses (coffins, peridots, etc), which are required during raids for either buffing or recovery.<br>
<br>
If you have been asked not to talk in /ooc or /shout, then abide by that. They are trying to focus on the deed at hand, which is to get everyone signed in and the groups organized as fast as possible. These dragon raids run from 4-6 hours long from start up time. Know that going in, and don't complain.<br>
<br>
They will announce who are the leaders of the raid. The only people who can talk to them is either your group leader, or the back-up group leader, absolutely no one else. If you have been designated as the looter, then you may only speak with the assigned loot coordinator for the raid. <br>
<br>
Once you have been assigned in a group, your group leader will appoint a looter and a back-up group leader in case of their link death. Write down who is in your group. If they haven't told you what your responsibility is within a reasonable amount of time, then ask. Once in your group, and you have your assignment, put the appropriate spells up that you need. If you don't know which ones, ask. Don't feel you need to put 8 in since there are 8 spots. Only put in those you need. <br>
<br>
Groups are then called in one or two at a time. KNOW YOUR GROUP NUMBER. Follow your leader closely. If it's your first raid, don't be embarrassed to tell your group leader. If you have questions, ask your group leader. If your group leader does not know the answer, they will contact the raid leaders for an answer. DON'T WANDER. You are risking everyone's life if you do so.<br>
<br>

<br>
To reduce lag, turn sky off, particles to low, clip plane to far left, turn numerous chats of (auction, guildsay), and turn off bard song. You should also type in /serverfilter on. (Sorry I haven't a clue what this is for, but it works).<br>
<br>
From this point on, no one but the raid commander, the loot coordinator and the raid leaders, are to use /shout or /ooc or emotes. DO NOT DRINK on raids, until the dragon has been slain. You will have been advised as to who the assists are, make sure you have a hotkey set up as follows &quot;/assist (secondary's name), then on the next line /assist (primary's name).<br>
<br>
Once you have worked your way in and everything has been slain in the path to the dragon, you will be asked to camp out immediately and then return. Do what you are told, this is done so we will not be aggro'd. When you camp back in, find your group leader and get re-invited. (Hence why you wrote it down.)<br>
<br>
Next there becomes a buffing line of about 12 - 14 buffs. Each class will be called one at a time, to get their buffs. This process is slow and tedious but necessary for success. Go thru the line as quickly as possible and log. You will be told what chat room to go to. Don't straggle in getting there. The reason for this, is so everyone holds their buffs, when going in for the fight. The raid commander will show up and start to explain the process as to how the dragon will get taken down. Wait until the commander has fully spoken, before asking questions. Everything will be answered, when given enough time. By the way, a triage line is the healing line. The raid commander will advise who goes into the room first, usually starting with the warriors. Pure casters are not to cast until the dragon has been taken down to 70% or less of their health. You then nuke continually. A healing line is created, usually of clerics, shamans and druids (that are under level 50). Druids over 50 are nukers. <br>
<br>
The fight......Each class runs in and starts pounding and nuking. The raid commander will tell you how it's best done, prior to entering as well as which spells are best. If you hit 50 health run to the healing line. Don't be a hero.<br>
<br>
The healing line....This is usually set up just outside the lair. Run towards the healing line, (at this point you should have a hotkey set up &quot;/shout Mirithal coming in for a heal&quot;. As the healer in the group for Mirithal, start clicking on the heal, once he is in range it will hit him. Don't wait until the person stands in front of you. We want to heal them quick and send them back into battle.<br>
<br>
**I will definitely be re-writing this, as there are corrections that need to be made, but until I get time, this is a good start**<br>

<br>
This is what actually makes turning off all those chat channels work.  This will tell the server (Karana in our case) to not send you all the information that you just turned off.  Such as the auction channel, your misses, others hits, bard songs, damage shields, etc.  If you dont type this, then you havent done anything to reduce your lag.  This is because just turning off these combat channels doesnt mean you dont get the information sent to you, your computer will filter them out AFTER its sent to you.  Hence your lag will still be the same.  You MUST type /serverfilter on in order to gain any latency benefits from turning off the combat spam.  <br>
<br>
Are there downsides to /serverfilter on?  Yes, many people prior to doing raids will tell you not to use this feature.  This is because instead of the server sending your updated information constantly on the status of the mob being attacked and your own group's hps, it will only send it to your computer once every 6 seconds.  This can get ugly in say LGuk or Seb when your group is getting mobbed and your the primary healer.  BUT.  You are not in Seb or LGuk on these raids.  Even in the planes you generally will only have to fight one or two mobs, and EVERYONE else will be on that mob as well.  If you waste some mana nuking a dead mob, it isnt going to be a bad thing.  If a group member dies because you were a second slow on a heal, well thats bad but thats what res is for.  It sounds harsh, but its better for the raid to simply rez someone than to lose several people due to Link Death because they cant keep a stable connection due to all teh spam being sent to their computer.<br>
<br>
So on major raids use /serverfilter on.  Also remember to use /showspelleffects OFF.  This will turn off all particle effects like a epic weapon, and snazzy looking particle effects when casting a spell.  Even with the particle effects turned off in the option menu some spell particle effects will be shown unless your do this.  It will have a measureable effect on your lag.<br>
<br>
Just remember, a LD tank or and LD caster is a useless caster or tank.  And not only can the raid not continue to progress if you constantly go LD, you may actually lose out on rolls because you were not there to roll on an item before it decays.<br>
