WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Revised Vox Strategy and loot rules *please read*</span><hr size=1> The strategy we intend to employ on the next (and following) Vox raids is as follows:<br><br>*EDIT*<br>A word of warning:  The area around Vox' lair is lousy with pit-traps.  I didn't do a very good job of pointing this out last time, and we had some &quot;pit-casualties&quot; even before we starting fighting the Lady.  I'll try to do a better job this coming raid... but if I forget again, someone please kindly remind me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>*EDIT*<br><br>We will be operating on the now (hopefully) familiar Triage-Healing tactic.  All classes capable of binding in the pre-lair buffing area MUST BIND there (we'll make it clear during the raid where this is).  If you don't bind, you don't roll on loot.  Pretty simple.<br><br>The Triage area where healers set up will be just outside the rock door into the lair, pretty much the same place it's been on previous raids.  We'll make this very clear when the time comes.<br><br>There will be one or two waves of tanks depending on classes and levels present.  Tanks will charge in and attempt to fight Vox in the MIDDLE of her lair - there's a slightly raised platform which is exactly where we want to keep here.  This is a little closer than we've normally done, but I want to keep the run to the triage line a little shorter.  If we can keep up good pressure on her, we shouldn't have much problem dropping her.  All tanks that have the resistant discipline should use it as soon as Vox is engaged.  It lasts for 5 minutes, and helps ward off both the AoE Fear and AoE Cold spells.  If we can't kill Vox in 5 minutes, we're most likely going to fail...<br><br>A note for everyone, but tanks especially:  When we charge Vox, set your verticle &quot;look&quot; to straight ahead by hitting the &quot;Home&quot; key (unless you've re-mapped the key that does that).  This will give you longer to become un-feared before you fall unrecoverably into a pit-trap if you are still levitating.<br><br>After the first AoE Fear goes off, all pets will be sent in.  There is some difference of opinion as to which mage pet works best against Vox.  If no one can come up with a conclusive set of evidence supporting one over the others, I'll leave pet choice at the discression of the mages attending.<br><br>When Vox is at 75-80% life, we'll send in the Enchanters to begin draining her mana.  This is earlier than we've done it in the past, but since Mana Seive is virtually unresistable the Enchanters don't need to be in melee range to land the spell... they can stand near the door and cast it as long as they have mana.  Any chanter that runs out of mana will be expected to run up to Vox and sit down underneath her.  This should get you killed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       After coming back, mem up seive and start draining again... if she has mana to get heals off, killing her is a hell of a lot harder.<br><br>When Vox is at around 50% life, casters will go in and nuke for all they're worth.  The exact timing on when casters will be called in depends on how the tanks are doing.  If tanks start dropping faster, we'll need the casters in earlier to make up for the damage loss.<br><br>When Vox gets down to 30% life or so, all tanks should begin bashing and slamming as often as possible.  Paladin's should begin chain-casting stun spells.  Vox cannot actually be stunned, but landing a stun-type spell <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>WILL</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> interrupt her heals, and that's basically the name of the game.  If she can't heal, she's pop-corn.<br><br>The basic idea here is that the tanks go in and generate as much taunt as possible to allow the casters time to get in and do as much damage as possible - and of course the healers try to keep the tanks alive as long as possible.<br><br>Minimum un-buffed resistances should be 70 for both Magic and Cold resistance. Healer classes can go lower than this in order to keep their wisdom up for mana, but should still try to remain above 50. Healers especially need to make sure they have enough Magic resistance to keep from being feared constantly.<br><br>If you do not meet these resistance requirements - do whatever you can to get your MR and CR as high as possible. Tanks especially need high resistances in order to live long enough to contribute to a successful raid. If you have sub-standard resistances, you will suck away more healer mana than other tanks, and in the process of running back for heals you will be fighting the dragon for less time, doing less damage.<br><br><br>Vox loot rules:<br><br>Almost all items are to be rolled on by any class that can use them. There are, however, some exceptions - I've tried to list them all here. If I've forgotten something, we'll deal with it when it comes... but all decisions made by raid admin are final.  If there are multiple drops of the same item, ONE ROLL will be made using the two highest rolls for the winners (or 3, or whatever).<br><br>Rune Bolster Belt:  This will be rolled on by MELEE classes only.  Casters and Priests don't need the haste, and if we give items to the classes that can make the most use of them, we all get stronger on future raids.<br><br>Tobrin's Mystic Eyepatch:  This will be rolled on by PRIEST and CASTER classes only.  Tanks don't need the +15 wis/int it has as much as a caster or healer, and it's lack of AC makes it even less appealing to all us meat shields.<br><br>As the Paladin FA books are NO DROP, we'll make sure to pre-roll for them in case one drops (or more than one if we're lucky).  The winning Paladin(s) will be first priority for res'ing.  If, however, a winning Paladin has managed to fall into one of the pit-traps during the battle and we can't get his or her corpse back in a timely fashion, the book will default to the next in line.  So if you are a Paladin that rolls high for the book... well... just don't fall down below. Better yet, don't die. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br> <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

Basiclly this is for your 50-52 druids and perhaps enchanters.<br><br>Keep Resist Magic mem'd.  As your casters fall and reappear by the triage line, drop an RM on them before they run in.  If your a nuking druid and you die, re-mem RM as well as Starfire (they are on the same page right?) and continue to drop RM on yourself and your casters as you nuke.  <br><br>If you're between 50-52 RM plus your natural magic resistance should generally be enough to keep you from being feared.  You should get in a couple of nukes.  That was our biggest problem the last time.  As the tanks fell the casters kept being feared.  A dead caster can just run back in and try to cast some more.  A fear'd caster just runs around and eventually falls into a trap or spends 2-3 minutes fleeing till Vox kills ya.  The 5 seconds it takes to mem RM and cast it could make the difference for the higher level casters.<br><br>Just a thought btw.<br><br>Kellory Silverstar<br>Druid, 52, Crunchy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuwynofkarana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EuwynofKarana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/4/01 11:39:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Strategy and loot rules *please read*</span><hr size=1> About the pets, Air= Completely resistant to cold, best bet for vox.<br>Fire=Completely resistant to fire, best bet for nagafen<br>Water=Completely resistant to poison, best bet for trak and mobs that use poison<br>Earth=Lazy pet that decides anything should be able to hurt it...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Anyways, air is the pet u'll want to use if u want a pet that can do dmg.

SB uses it every raid. I've never had a problem sticking it on her, and by the time casters are called in, the tank agro is enough that she's never turned on me immediately as other mobs commonly do when debuffed to the degree that Ro's does. I am, however, typically one of the first casters agroed when I lead off with Ro's, maybe 2 or 3 Starfires into the fight.

CoG loot rules normally state that whoever can use it can roll for it.  We make a few exceptions in the case of items that are put to considerably better use on certain classes (haste items, or high int/wis low ac items, for instance).<br><br>So... based on that, the red scale from Naggy is rolled on by basically all plate-wearing melle classes (the one's who can use the BP - which includes bards and warriors who need it for their epic as well).<br><br>The white scale can be used by all/all - and is something of a quandry.  It has +9 int/wis and +75 mana, making it a great caster/priest cloak... yet it also has +25SvC and decent AC as cloaks go...  However, in light of the fact that there are other, much easier cloaks to obtain with similar AC and SvC (though not quite as good)... I tend to lean towards limiting rolls on the white scale to casters, priests, and bards as they are the classes that would benefit most from it.<br><br>I have been asked a number of times why I don't limit scale rolls to those classes who need it for their epic only, and my response is generally this:<br><br>As much as I hate to say it, if you are focused and intent on getting your epic, regardless of what class you are, you will probably never get it by going on CoG raids alone.  That being said, limiting rolls to only epic-classes would be taking away the possible advantage of other classes who could use the item the scale can produce.  It would also serve to give added benefit to those people who are part of larger guilds and alliances that are capable of getting them their epic more better chances on the scales... and quite frankly, the kind of people who would only come on raids for that reason are the kind of people I DON'T want on my raids. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

If Vox ping pongs then the tanks can't do their job (main reason I don't like tirage lines). If the tanks are constantly chasing after Vox rather then dealing damage then this fight is over. I advise the tanks to not run to the tirage line if they are currently agro'd, doing so will pull Vox to the enterance and everything will become chaos.<br><br>&quot;After the first AoE Fear goes off, all pets will be sent in.&quot;<br><br>Here I would recommend that you have the pets set to NO TAUNT. when pets get agro'd they die and vox comes for the master. There you've cost yourself a nuke and whatever damage the meleer's could've been doing while they are now chasing after Vox. Every mage I've talked to say air pets for Vox. They have higher SvC (if they aren't taunting then they should be only taking damage from her AE as is), and also have a chance to stun.<br><br>&quot;since Mana Seive is virtually unresistable the Enchanters don't need to be in melee range to land the spell... they can stand near the door and cast it as long as they have mana.&quot;<br><br>Here I would recommend that you have the enchanters ride on Vox's back, even though they don't need to to land the spell. Granted Mana Sieve is a low resist rate, but it is a high argo. Also if you have spare bards you might want to assign one to Denon's Dissention for the extra mana sieve it provides (and yes it is a sieve over time).<br><br>&quot;The basic idea here is that the tanks go in and generate as much taunt as possible to allow the casters time to get in and do as much damage as possible.&quot;<br><br>For tanks to gain the agro, they need to keep on Vox non-stop.

Most guilds and alliances on KGC have mentioned that they tend to have way too many red scales, and not enough green and white scales.  Go figger.<br><br>As for people not wanting to make the armor with the scale because the scale is worth so much more... you are assuming that all CoG raiders basically sell the loot they win.  This is a false premise.<br><br>Also, CoG is not the only group that allows non-epic classes to roll (and win) scales from Naggy and Vox.<br><br>Now that we have a couple facts straight, let us begin a discussion about CoG vs epics:<br><br>As I've said before, the KCoG is not a good place to get an epic weapon.  If that is your only intent, do yourself a favor and join an uber-guild or larger alliance that is capable of helping you get it.<br><br>One of the main reasons I'm opposed to limiting scale rolls to only those classes who need them for epics is that there are members of those larger guilds and alliances that come on CoG raids... and well, I don't wanna make CoG raids a great place for epic-hunters to tag along just because it'll give them more chances to get what they need.  That is not the kind of person I want to attract to our raids.<br><br>No one, as of yet, has seriously complained about our rolls on red scales (probably because the red scale seems to be so much more common).  So basically this discussion ends up being strictly about white scales from Vox... which are pretty rare.<br><br>I have many a time considered limiting scale rolls to epic classes alone... the main problem I have with rules and policies like that is that they get away from the purpose of the KCoG.  We are not here to get epic weapons for everyone, we are not here to get planes armor for everyone, we are not here to let uber-guilders &quot;double-dip&quot; for rare items, we are, in short, NOT ABOUT THE LOOT.  We are about giving people who would not otherwise have a chance the opportunity to go places and see things they wouldn't normally have.<br><br>Which is why discussions about who should get to roll on what tend to piss me off.  Because they are basically about squabbling over loot.  And that's not why I run these raids.  These kinds of discussions, in fact, are the thing that I hate most about running these raids.  Which is why, in general, I tend to follow the KCoG's overall loot policy:<br><br>If you bleed for it and can use it, you can roll for it.<br><br>So... here's where my thinking is right now:<br><br>Limiting who rolls on the white scales tends to encourage loot-hunters to come to our raids alone, thus giving them the best chances at winning it.  This runs counter to everything that the KCoG is about.<br><br>The cloak, as unlikely as it may be that someone would actually make it, is actually pretty good gear for almost any class.  It's good AC for a back slot item, has nice Int/Wis, and has very nice cold resistance.  So, under CoG's normal loot rules, everyone gets to roll.<br><br>Now think about this: If you are a guild-member of good standing and/or you have lots of friends in the game (like a certain un-guilded, sexless drood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and one of your guild-mates or friends wins something that you need for your epic... chances are pretty good yer gonna get it in the end, right?<br><br>So, here's where I'm going with this:  Opening up the scale rolls to everyone (maybe even the red scale?) would encourage folks that need the scale for their epic to try and bring as many friends and guild-mates as possible to CoG raids - this giving them more chances to &quot;win&quot; the scale in the end... sorta like buying more than one raffle ticket... the more people you bring, the more chances you get.<br><br>That way, rather than encouraging people to come alone, we'd be encouraging people to come with a posse!  THAT is the kind of policy I like!<br><br>So what's everyone think about that?<br><br>Addendum: Paladin books will continue to be Paladin only - they're no drop and I don't wanna encourage multi-questing items on that scale...  besides, if I was going to make any chances in the Paly book policy it would be to &quot;Kommisar gets the next book Nagafen drops.
