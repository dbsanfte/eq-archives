As kellory explained we are just now getting on planes ourselves and dont qualify any longer for CoG raids.<br>
<br>
Without The experience we gained from Kellory and crew this wouldnt have been possible.  This is one of the reasons someone must step up and take control of CoG and there raids.  <br>
<br>
The best thing about CoG is the chance to team and play with new people.  I have met some nice players and had some real fun on these raids.  This is what the game is all about to me.<br>
<br>
Leading raids takes patience and many bottles of tylenol but some people can do it better then others.  Please remember that loot isnt the most important part of the game.<br>
<br>
CoU is willing to help in any way possible to make sure that CoG continues with its raids.  It is that important.<br>

This was before CoG had spot in the rotations. Basically AC requested requested the slot as there own and opened the signup's to the CoG. The host guild had final management staff and attendace. This fits in with all KGC rules as I understand it. I don't know how applicable that would be at this point with the CoG having its own spot in the rotation as it would go unused in this scenario.<br>
<br>
Food for thought from historical case. <p>Xalos <BR>

However, there are reasons why they dont generally like to do this.  In order for a guild to have a slot on the rotations they must prove they are able to break the plane on their own.  For example Fellowship of Faydark cannot request a slot on the Planes rotation because they are unable to break the plane on their own.<br>
<br>
Now then, if a guild can then presumably they can do much if not all of the plane on their own.  That being the case, opening the raid to CoG would only serve to add in a few extra people to the raid.  Most raids only have between 24-48 people on them.  This is to maximize the amount of loot and keep it to those who need it.  CoG is one of the few groups that will take 55+ people on up.  Different philosophies.  I would also point out that 3-4 groups can effectively clear Fear or even Hate.  Especially if they are 55+.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?  It means if another guild like CoU did it, then they would only be allowing a select few CoG raiders on their raids.  Also, they would be intentionally weakening their own guild since CoG raiders would/should be allowed to roll on all loot.  This means that they are using their time and days to help equip people they will probably never see again.<br>
<br>
In any event, only a very small group of CoG raiders, less than 12 in all likelihood would get to go on any given raid in this fashion.  This is one reason Harb and the Sacred Band eventually stopped running Plane Raids.<br>
<br>
It would really work a whole lot better if a small guild that was not planes capable and not in a planes capable alliance were to look at hosting both the Plane raids and dragon raids.  This would allow for the creation of several raid leaders, hopefully keeping them from burning out.  I'm not stopping a Planes capable guild from doing just what was propsed.  I'm just pointing out why in many cases it doesnt work to well.  If a guild wants to try it, by all means go for it.  But considering how open CoG loot rules are and attendence guidelines are, I dont see it working too well myself.<br>
<br>
But thats just my thoughts.  Perhaps someone has some ideas on how it could reasonably work?  If so, post here.<br>

I offered it up as an option as past lessons/methods are sometimes forgotten. <br>
<br>
   With that though it may take time for a guild, or multiple-guilds(really like that Idea) to step forward. The cycle has come round again with your retirement Kell, Also with Komm's in the Dragon raids. New expierences to be had new lessons to learn for those who take the lead. This can can be extremely fun, frightining and be a large hassle all at the same time. All who accept this role and fulfill it are strong people. <br>
<br>
  I've attended raids and events hosted by the CoG off and on for the last year. It is a great opportunity and I want to see it continuing with its success so that others can enjoy it.<br>

There is no reason why we cant take a couple of weeks or a month to relax everyone before finding someone else.  I figure eventually someone will step up for the same reason KCoG was originally formed.  Because someday someone will get bored and step forward.  Rushing things or finding a stopgap is only going to serve as a temporary solution.  No reason why we cant wait till a permanent solution comes to us.<br>
<br>
I would point out, my last raid was only 4 days ago.  We're still at the bottom of the rotation at the KGC in any event.  And will be so for another couple of weeks.  We had a 2-3 week vacation from plane raids coming up anyway.<br>
<br>
These raids are going to continue its because someone is going to step forward and say I'll do it.  Not because someone suggests a way someone else might be able to do it.  It might be tomorrow, it might be next month, it might be next January.  But eventually someone will.  KCoG was formed not to be a parasite organization, but as a means to help small guilds team together to take on large targets without having to form an uber guild or lose players to those uber guilds.  If that premise is still sound, then someone will step forward.  If isnt, then perhaps its time to let KCoG go.<br>
<br>
Neither the planes nor the dragons are going anywhere.  I'd prefer to find a permanent solution rather than a stop gap myself.  But thats just me.  I'm still waiting for someone, anyone, to say I'll do it, lets get together and plan it out.<br>
