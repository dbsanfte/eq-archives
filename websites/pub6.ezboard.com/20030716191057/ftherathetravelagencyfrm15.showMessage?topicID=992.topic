The criminal from 4.5 months ago, but whos counting?<br>
<br>
First thing I want to say to TheRealDrache, bro, your posts (everyone of them) sounds like you just graduated the sixth grade and moved onto Jr. high school and learned the four basic curse words.  Just like all new things, it gets used too much.  If I were vince, I would of already banned your account just from the lvl of intelligence conjured from your posts.<br>
<br>
I remember when you first started posting here, everyone flamed you lol.  They all said you were an idiot, but that obviously didn't stop you.  Kinda like the kid that follows you around and stands with your group pretending to be a friend.  That kid never seems to get the hint.<br>
<br>
I'll admit, 4.5 months ago, I hated just about everyone on this board.  Now?  I only hate you.  Because of you I was asked to remove my guild tag from SOTE simply because of you.  I raided several hours a day.  If I was on and their was a raid I was there.  I never back talked anyone, never made any enemies.  Darkfury himself told me when he asked me to remove my tag.  Sorry bro, too much negative comment from the RTA.  It's a shame to see such a good wizard go.<br>
<br>
I've notied that you hide behind your words.  Big man on paper, but emotionally unstable in reality.  Yes, what I did 4.5 months ago was wrong, I admitted it then, and I still admit it.  Not sure WTF SOTE was saying when they posted that they did not know of it.  I told him, I openly admitted I was flamed on the RTA boards.  To me it seems that SOTE is more concerned about what TheRealDrache says than to have a talented active wizard in their guild.  IMHO, if they're gonna ask me to /gr myself just because of a immature little shit like you, then I'm glad I did.  I'm glad I left the guild before I put anymore hours into it.<br>
<br>
I was hurt when I was asked to remove my tag.  I couldn't think of any possible reason why they would ask me to.  I asked members, none knew, none would give me a reason.  I had grown fond of the guild, but after your post, and their replies, it really revealed their integrity.<br>
<br>
Now I just hope to find a guild that cares more about getting good active members than what TheRealDrache has to say.  The reason I say this, is because throughout this post, he seemed to be the only one with a rejection to me joining this guild.<br>
<br>
61 wiz LFGuild<br>
<br>
Ok, this is a little off context, but I'd like to make a few apologies that I should of made along time ago when I made an ass of myself.<br>
<br>
I'd like say sorry to these people for what all I said to them.  I see now that my only enemy is TheRealDrache regardless of what you guys say.<br>

You'll get me, and my little dog too? Missplaced anger is your problem, you are really paying the consequences from your own actions to the poor guy that you made so unhappy with his EQ gaming experience. When someone calls up America's Most Wanted and reports the whereabouts of a criminal they are seeking, should the criminal blame the caller, or himself for doing the crime?<br>

<br>
oh yea Falabarr one thing youll learn from this is that your actions in life build you as a character if it be in a game like EQ or in real life. I hope your learning from things like this and maybe one day people will forgive you but it takes time. But if  your honestly sorry then its better to give it a rest and try to move on ...try to do some good things like help kayans and things but do it because you want to not because you want to wangle your way into a guild. <br>

I think thats what I was gonna say anyway.<br>

He even says he's sorry, which I don't know if he's really sorry for those he hurt or for the embarrassment he caused himself, either way he's sorry heh.<br>

Even if you didn't know about the incident when he applied, IMO he should start with a clean slate when he applies. Judge him from the moment he applied not from when you didn't even know him.<br>

I dunno, I guess that if I were a GL I wouldn't let people on FC or RTA for that matter influence decisions about who gets into the guild.

If Banisher were to apply to your guild saying that he learned the errors of his ways and that he is sorry for everything...would you open your arms to him and invite him to join your guild? Although it does appear that Fablaar has grown up a little, it still doesnt mean that he wont fuck up again under a new guilds tag. I respect DF's decision the same as I respect insurance companies that jack up prices on males under 21...(booooooooo) Its risk reduction you see. Eliminate the liabilities and you will have a nice secure guild.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=princessabella>PrincessAbella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=992.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.suburbanjungle.com/images/proud_furry_100_dk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: TheRealDrache &amp; SOTE</span><hr size=1> I am all for giving people a second chance.

<br>
But it does not help them to disprove the haters and conspiracy theorists to recruit people widely considered to be screwups/jerks/lowlifes.  The same people who would flame SotE for &quot;harboring an asshole like Fablaar&quot; (I don't even know you dude but apparently the damage was done) flame SotE now for kicking them out. <br>
<br>
It doesn't take a scientist to see that some people like to play the opposite side of the fence all the time.  Do what is right for SotE, I am sure you know what you have to do to meet your goals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liviusmaximus>LiviusMaximus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 9:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=992.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: TheRealDrache &amp; SOTE</span><hr size=1> Fablaar,<br>
<br>
First off is the disclaimer &quot;I am not officially speaking for SotE, etc.&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Second, what DF did wasn't done to hurt you, but to help you.  You were not an official member of SotE as you had not been voted on yet.  It only takes a small number of &quot;NO&quot; votes to not make it into the guild and from what had been said by members of the guild it was apparent that you would not pass the vote.  It would not be fair to you to ask you to keep the tag and keep raiding with us knowing that.<br>

<br>
People CAN change, but they have to realize and admit their mistakes first.  <br>
<br>
 The fact that you are now bagging on SotE for protecting themselves and the RTA flame central  'board trolls' for causing you to be rejected as a recruit speaks volumes as to how you have NOT changed.<br>
<br>
And now, instead of realizing it was your actions that caused the reaction, you are reaching out for external targets (Darkfury, Drache, FC in general) instead of understanding, owning up and moving on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Flame Central  has as one of it's primary purposes exposing shitty people for what they are. It's the judgement of the COMMUNITY that was against you, and you damned yourself with your testimony.<br>
<br>
<br>
Drache may be a piss poor troll in your opinion, but he said the most insightful thing on this thread by far:<br>

<br>
If you read the original post, where Faab brags about his KSing methods, you might note that he states that reputation doesnt matter, He doesnt care if he pisses people off, and that he has enough friends to have a satisfactory EQ career, despite his mischeif.<br>
<br>
And now, a few months later, SOTE decides that the risk of him in the guild is not worth it, they boot him, and he's bitching.<br>
<br>
I for one, personally commend SOTE for further instilling the fact that on The Rathe, stupid is as stupid does, you are who you make yourself out to be, and yes, reputation does matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=992.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=992.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=992.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=992.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=992.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=992.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=992.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=992.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
