You know... others were killing it before you were able to read enough on SafeHouse to figure out how to kill it.  The only difference was that we didn't farm him SoT-style and actually left him up sometimes so that we wouldn't be accused of farming it SoT-style, which let other groups get shots at him.  Typical SoT style... finally learn how to kill something and then farm the hell out of it every spawn to keep others out, even though others were killing it first, until someone gets tired enough of it to bitch about it on RTA.  And yes... I asked SoT the first night they killed Grieg (how many spawns ago?) for a rotation on it... Typical pre-RTA bitch-fest response of &quot;we'll post it and get back to you&quot;.  Yes... it is yet-again a guild asking SoT to stop farming a mob SoT-style and get on a rotation when they were doing a mob first and SoT learns how to kill it, instead of SoT coordinating with the guild(s) already killing a mob to get into and form a rotation and being nice and share - like Tindi Losi did with ToV-N, like all the other guilds did with Statue, like NB has already talked about with ToV-N, like BotS did with Tindi/NB/SoT on THO, like every other guild besides SoT does with every other mob that is on the rotation board.  Everyone does a pretty good job of sharing until SoT decides to locust a mob SoT-style and requires everyone else to have to raise a big stink to get a formal rotation going.  I have no idea why SoT consistently feels the need to try to absolutely control spawns in the game like they do.  The only reason why SoT talked to us (BotS) at all about ToV-N was because they knew they were at a disadvantage if they tried to farm ToV-N SoT-style because it isn't a single spawn and takes time to do.  And yes, everyone does get tired of having to post this crap on RTA to get SoT to share.  It seems a very common thing... guilds are off killing mobs, SoT decides to show up, starts farming the mob SoT-style, causes people to get pissed off, RTA crap bitch flame fest errupts.  Why must we have to do this every single time?<br><br>While you're at it, and not that it's any of my business since we haven't messed with the mob yet, but why not let NB have a shot at TIV sometime instead of farming it SoT-style as well?  That would be in preparation of the other guilds who will want to be doing TIV before long *hint* before it ends up one of these on the boards, too. <p><p><P><center><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#000000"><TR>	<TD>		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">				<center>				<A href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Gromm">Gromm Shatterspine</A><br>				Officer<br>				<A href="http://www.drow.org">Blood of the Spider</A><br>				</center>				</font>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<CENTER>					<A href="http://www.drow.org">					<img src=http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif>					</A>					</CENTER>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>	</TD>	<TD width="70%">		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<center>				<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>				</center>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<center>					<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">					<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/8.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?

(i was personally asked to give you all 48h on your tunare try, pre kill - but if a mob is easy, you all have np in swooping in w/in minutes of it's pop) <br><br>I honestly can't think of an exception.  It's one thing to kill a mob 1st (when we kill mobs 1st (server 1st i mean) you will rarely ever see us keeping it dead on pop).  Or even to kill a mob thats not contested.  <br><br>But you all have a habit, a patern for killing a mob thats already been killed, then using the (oh dear)  time zone to keep that mob in your possession.<br><br>In sol mobs that you killed 2nd (or later) and use eaarly log in's to get mob dead:  THO (hello, check the threads of multiple requests for rotation) akheva guy, greig.<br><br>It's just weird that there are 4 big guilds: bots nb sot tindi.  And im not sure of any major griefs over spawns between any of us, except between you all and all others..<br><br>We all seem to get along ok, we all make sacrifices, and share mobs, and are pretty open about intentions, and pretty respectful of each other.  But it's honestly like pulling teeth to even get you guys to acknowledge the possibility of a rotation on new mobs, then you tend to stall until (i guess) your chosen few get their loot, and you drop the mob (or rotate it).<br><br>It just gets old.<br><br>Greig is really piss in the wind.  So are alot of the mobs you hog.  But you sit there and hog mobs like you do, and then expect us (bots) or the others (nb and tl) to sit back and nod when its your turn for kt,dain,yeli, tov, ct, statue, etc etc etc... when we 3 know that any mob that isnt too hard, or too time intensive you will monopolize until enough @#%$ is stirred here to get your 'good' people to pass a notion to share with the server. I just feel like im giving an inch, while you all take a mile...<br><br> <p><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Emil">Emil Sinclair</a><br><a href="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml">BotS</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubrumpybronzefinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brumpy Bronzefinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/16/02 5:07:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.synmicro.com/prod/itempics/jiveman.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: i could....</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, might I add that we hadn't done a single raid in 3 days because of lack of plausible mobs (and yes, clerics too).<br>If we hadn't killed ANYTHING it would have been our 4th day of consecutive slacking, is that what you ask of us?

It took two months after our first THO kill to get SoT to agree to a rotation, while SoT was farming him sometimes two and three times per week due to the increased patch schedule.<br><br>During all that time no one could get SoT to give any reasn for their behavior, except for the insight of one officer who said, 'Luclin rotations are gay' and went on to spout some unrelated excuse about BoTS and North TOV.  <br><br>I want to hear the REASON SoT stonewalls like this when the rest of the community would like nothing more than a fair shot at the mobs.  The Rathe is not some barbarian server dominated by a single large guild.  We establish rotations early, and we adhere to those rotations with civility and fairness as much as possible.<br><br>Three out of four major guilds are capable of working within these bounds.  SoT isn't.  You guys obviously know what you're doing, and you're fully willing to use the rotation schedule to your advantage when it suits you, so why not back off a bit?  You aren't earning any respect by agreeing to a rotation on something months after you've dominated every spawn.<br><br>It'd be nice to see the Rhags up at 5PM PST sometime... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubogfatherbellybarsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/16/02 4:30:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SOT-Style</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This board has become so retarded its lost its usefulness <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Now, that's the great thing about you Xenth.

The response I got was that it would be posted on their board and discussed and they'd get back to us.   Haven't heard a word.<br><br>It's tiring to deal with folks who have no concept of sharing.  Stelf even posted on another board (not RTA) [paraphrasing here] that there seems to be a core of SoT that thrives on conflict.<br><br>Why is it that when SoT kills a mob that we have been hitting (or NB, or Tindi, or whoever) for a while that the other guild has to contact them for a rotation on it?  Why can't SoT contact the other guilds pre-kill and say they are going to try it and would like a rotation on it?  Why is it that when SoT finally kills a mob they are all over it like locusts trying to hog the spawn completely until people get fed up enough trying to work a rotation out and dealing with their stalling and general crap that they have to go to RTA and start a flame-a-thon about it?<br><br>I'm sure people here are tired of it.  They see it every time SoT kills any mob that anyone else has been killing.  Just go back and look through the archives on this board.<br><br>I am 100% sure SoT knows what will happen when they start doing their childish greedy antics and I cannot fathom why they do it, other than exactly what Stelf said.  There are people in SoT who simply thrive on conflict and feel that their pressing keys and &quot;killing&quot; some pixels empowers them in some way.  Why is it the same with every mob SoT starts killing?  Why has SoT only once tried to even instigate any rotation (ToV-N)?  Why is it that BotS/Tindi/NB instigate every other rotation?  Why is it that other guilds (BotS/Tindi/NB) don't spawn camp mobs and kill them every time they spawn, sometimes leaving them up for days?<br><br>As to Lazreth, as far as racing to spawns, we did that back in the day with KEG and CIW when most of SoT was still hanging out in Crushbone.  People then were wise enough to realize how simply stupid it was to do those sorts of things.  It is tiring.  It is a very negative activity that builds only resentment.  It is something that can ultimately make you stop playing the game, one way or another.  There is nothing positive about it.<br><br>So, some people who were grown-up enough to know how to share decided that sharing was preferable to all the negative bullshit that comes from the crap-filled &quot;racing&quot; to a mob.  The only reason you even mention this here is because you are sitting smug knowing, that no matter how much SoT denies it, there is a sizable portion of SoT that is European who can hold a spawn early.  Yay, you win the race by time-zone.<br><br>How about doing something a little bigger and mature and learn to share so that everyone gets shots at things.  Even though some SoT posted something about BotS and PoG, hasn't SoT had multiple shots at Tunare?  I seem to recall a whole Saturday that SoT threw themselves at Tunare (like 10+ hours worth).  Why didn't SoT try Tunare some those 9 months before BotS ever tried it?<br><br>How about I post this here already, because I know it will happen this way...  BotS again will initiate the rotation discussion on Tunare, because we know that SoT will not, for obvious and proven reasons:<br><br>On the event that SoT kills Tunare, BotS proposes a rotation on Tunare, standard type, kill her in a 24-hour period.  Other guilds can enter the rotation by killing Tunare as well.<br><br>I might as well add all the other reasonable mobs here to...  Change &quot;Tunare&quot; above to HP, AL, Creator, and any other mob that you can think of that BotS already raids that SoT hasn't.  We have no problem sharing mobs with anyone who shows they can raid it. <p><p><P><center><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#000000"><TR>	<TD>		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">				<center>				<A href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Gromm">Gromm Shatterspine</A><br>				Officer<br>				<A href="http://www.drow.org">Blood of the Spider</A><br>				</center>				</font>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<CENTER>					<A href="http://www.drow.org">					<img src=http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif>					</A>					</CENTER>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>	</TD>	<TD width="70%">		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<center>				<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>				</center>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<center>					<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">					<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/8.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
