I was watching some show about abortion and there were all those Christian Fundamentalists on it, just acting stupid.  They act like 'killing your baby' is a direct route to hell, and are so set on making abortion illegal.  What most don't think about is what happens to the baby after it is born.  What if the mother was raped and wasn't financially stable enough for a child yet? or what if the mother knows she has been doing drugs that WILL affect her baby when it is born, ie birth defects and mental retardation.  Another point is I don't see any of the prolife supporters volunteering to adopt these babies once they're born.  Could you imagine middle-age to elder parents, who are usually white, and very religious adopting these babies?  Lol, that'll be the day when I see these yuppies offering to adopt the hispanic or black babies, it'll never happen.  OK, I'm done now. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/66126/0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

However, I'm not always lucky enough to manage it.<br>
<br>
There is a stoplight near work, with a women's clinic nearby.  This is where these insects gather to accost and harass the women as they walk from their cars to the doors of the building.  I'm not a quiet woman, prefering to voice my opinion and attempt interesting and intelligent conversation.  I should've known better than to roll down my window.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I asked a few of the people standing there if they were going to take in the babies after they were born.  Not just the healthy ones, but the crack babies, the  physically deformed ones, even the ones with serious medical needs.  Would they take them in, love them, care for them physically, emotionally, financially?  Would they continue to take them in, regardless of how many there were, because there are many unwanted babies born because abortion was not an option?  Would they then cover the medical expenses of the birth mother, since they were incurred because you refused her access and ability to control her own body?<br>
<br>
Not a single one had an answer for me.<br>
<br>
Several of the women walking into the clinic smiled, though.<br>
<br>
I'm not out to convert anyone to my way of thinking.  I don't believe my way is the only way, nor do I feel anyone else's way is wrong.  It is merely another way, different from my own.  However, if I can make just one person think about things each day, I'm a happy camper.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Especially the born-again Christian perspective (which I was indocrinated into in my younger years). I never understood why god would care so much about abortion, or killing in general for that matter.<br>
<br>
I have heard that this life is just a flash in the pan, and what really matters is the after-life. Convenient for the disadvantaged in this life, eh? If the after-life is so important, what difference does it make if a person dies 3 months, 5 years, or 50 years after conception? Someone might say things like &quot;well, so many people have had a great effect on the world, what if they had been aborted?&quot; I know women who have miscarried. What about those unborn people? Would they not have had an effect on the world? Can the world get along without some of the babies? It seems to do pretty well.<br>
<br>
I have heard Christians say &quot;life is sacred.&quot; If that's the case, then why are babies born dead or die in natural miscarriages? In the bible, god kills people outright. Where's the respect for the sanctity of life there? To say &quot;God gave life and thus has the right to take life&quot; or &quot;God's ways are mysterious&quot; is not answering the question, just ignoring it. If god hates abortion (murder, rape, child molestation) so much, why does he allow it to happen? If people stopped trying to convince women not to get abortions, would god stop the abortions himself since his children are slacking off in their policing duties? (I have the same question about airport security.) It seems that abortion is not BAD ENOUGH for god to actually take action on it when someone is about to do it. The &quot;free will&quot; programmed response doesn't answer the question either.  If the police know that someone is planning a murder or planning to bomb a plane, they will do whatever they can to stop it BEFORE it happens, &quot;free will&quot; be damned. Before I can accept that god hates abortion, I need to know why he doesn't stop it.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we should kill babies, but the arguments against abortion don't make any sense at all, especially the religious ones. From an unbiased perspective, it seems that these people are just overreacting emotionally to behavior that they personally abhor. It reminds me of how my dad used to get so mad when he saw people with tatoos. These days, few people would say that tatoos are bad, but he felt they were &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot;. I think he was full of crap, and I feel the same way about the Christians. There is no rationality behind their arguments, only emotion.<br>
<br>
For people who are supposedly backed by the most powerful being in the universe, Christians sure worry a lot. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=413072" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~lewfitz/images/YarkSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I am pro-life, but not because, “the bible says so.”<br>
<br>
The root of the matter all comes down to life at conception.  My opinion is that two gametes come together and at that moment human life exists.  That life is a parasite that attaches itself to a host, or mother, and then proceeds to feed off that host and grow.<br>
<br>
That life has its own DNA which means it is not part of the mother.  Again, it is a parasite.  It will remain a parasite until it is 18 years old and you boot it out the door.    The question you must ask yourself is what value do you place on it?  At what stage in its development does it have enough value to be given the right to life?  If we can kill it in the 3rd trimester for whatever reason, then can’t we use those same reasons to kill it when it is 4 years old?<br>
<br>
I don’t believe that one’s development should dictate one’s worth.  Each year, I don’t become more of a human.  I’ve always been human.  I’m no more human now than I was 10 years ago.  So I don’t believe that being located outside the mother means that you are more human or have more value than being located inside the mother.  I believe it is equally wrong to kill a fetus, child, or an adult.<br>
<br>
Now of course there are always exceptions.  I believe it is ok to kill someone in self defense for example.  Likewise, there should be exceptions made based on the circumstances involving unwanted pregnancy.  I’ll discuss two exceptions, but there are probably be more out there.<br>
<br>
I have no problem if a mother decides to abort a fetus if it places her life in danger.  You can not ask someone to sacrifice one’s self in order to save another life that may end in vain.<br>
<br>
The 2nd exception is when a life is created from the act of rape.  We already have one victim.  Not only does she have to deal with the trauma of the rape, she has to make a choice about the life growing inside of her.  I can understand if everything is just too much for her and she decides to abort the fetus.  But keep in mind that there is already one victim, does there need to be two?  I hope that the mom would be strong enough to try to prevent a 2nd victim, but I can understand if she chooses not to.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my opinion.<br>

By the way, who said life was sacred? Living people? Seems rather like a biased view if you asked me. Carlin did a whole rant on that issue, so I'll leave you guys to go find that one.<br>
<br>
It's the one-sidedness of the pro-life arguements that I hate. I'm not saying lets kill babies. I'm saying that a lot of times, we don't know what goes on in peoples' lives. Maybe aborting the baby is the best choice. <br>
<br>
Besides, you abort the baby, you live with the guilt. Trust me. There is no need for pro-lifers to try to make them feel even worse about it. Just having to deal with losing a potential child is a very damaging thing for a woman. It isn't exactly a picnic for the man involved either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104896">~Baron Nnod Fleshripper~</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Anti-war people who spit on soldiers to make their point.  Are all people against war like that?<br>
<br>
Environmentalists who spike trees which kills loggers.  Are all environmentalist like that?<br>
<br>
Pro-Life people who harrass people at abortion clinics.  Are all Pro-Life people like that?<br>
<br>
The answer is no to all of these, so making broad generalizations about a group of people who believe something based on the behavior of the most radical is a poor argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ameliarespiritblade>Ameliare Spiritblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sancrosanct Legion - GL</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/16/03 9:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: prochoice</span><hr size=1> My apologies, Liv.

<br>
Not all pro-life people are rabid, panties-in-a-wad moles.  It's just that those are the types most likely to be seen most often, publicly.  I've met several pro-life people who are intelligent, and who actually seem to care.  My example was more to point out mob mentality and the lack of human understanding that some seem to have.<br>

Rape is like the only &quot;it could go either way&quot; situation.  There is no easy answer for the abortion argument, and I realize that there's probably no way to make anyone agree with me or make them change their stance on the issue one way or the other but...<br>
<br>
Let's see... because Kelly and Billy like to have sex without some form of birth control... it's ok whenever she gets pregnant to kill what's living inside of her?<br>
<br>
Punish the unborn child because of the actions of the irresponsible mother &amp; father?  That's such garbage, guys.<br>
<br>
That child is given absolutely no chance to ever have a life.  It's easy to say that it's ok when you're not the one getting aborted.  &quot;But they can't think or feel before a certain point, so it's ok!&quot;.  Yeah... horseshit.<br>
<br>
Even if you don't want the child, the least you could do is let it be born and then put it up for adoption. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.nba.com/media/nba/orl.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A> at: 8/16/03 3:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tejers>Tejers</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.homestarrunner.com/hsicons/sbdance.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 333<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/16/03 7:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:prochoice</span><hr size=1> This is an issue that hits very close to home with me.  When I was 18, I got pregnant, because of my own mistakes.  The first words out of my mouth when I told my boyfriend is &quot;I'm going to get an abortion.&quot;  At that time, I was so afraid to tell people that my pregnancy had advanced to 4 months, so I had to get a partial-birth abortion.  <br>
<br>
It was a 2 day process.  The first day, it was in a clean, bright office.  The women were kind and helpful.  They asked me if I wanted counseling after the procedure and I said yes, because I had heard women could get messed up after they had abortions.  They told me at 7:30am the next morning, that I needed to go to a different building for the surgery.<br>
<br>
The next morning I go to this new building.  It was right smack dab in the middle of downtown Detroit.  A grey, signless building, the only one on the block.  I walk into a starch white waiting room, with no one in it.  A nurse tells my boyfriend that it will take about 3 hours.  She takes me into a back room, sticks a needle in my butt and an IV in my arm.  I soon pass out.<br>
<br>
Next thing I know I am waking up in a table in some stirrups and I feel this enormous pressure.  It hurts really bad.  I started crying and yelling that it hurt.  The doctor turns to me and says &quot;It doesn't hurt, shut up, give her some more drugs.&quot;  Then I pass out.  This was not a hallucination, I will never forget this as long as I live.<br>
<br>
When I wake up, I start crying.  I hear someone else crying, it's another girl who had the same thing done as me.  I just remember wanting my mom (who had NO clue about anything that was going on).  Finally, I was able to walk out with some help.  There was another girl there, who apparently had surgery too, but she was laughing and falling all around like in a drunken stupor.  Whoever was sent there to pick her up was laughing too, like this was an everyday thing, which right now I don't doubt that it was.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I remember beating myself up for months.  Thinking that I was going to go to hell, that I made the wrong decision.  To this day, I still feel I made the wrong decision, but I know I am not going to go to hell, I already had my peace with God.  Oh, and that counseling that was offered me?  Yeah right, never heard from anyone, so I bought a book, heh.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to make people feel sorry for me.  I have no qualms about telling my story.  I just want everyone to know that it isn't as easy as sucking some cells out of a vacuum.  I would say that at this time, due to personal experience, that I am pro-life.  If I could turn back time, I would have gone through with the pregnancy and gave the child up for adoption or just kept it.  I don't believe any longer that abortion is a form of birth control.<br>
<br>
On the same token though, I will not tell women who get abortions they will go to hell.  That is between them and God.  I would try to talk to them as much as I could to ask them not to have an abortion, but if they chose to go through with it, I would only be a voice of support because I know what they are going through.  Three years after I had mine, my sister got pregnant and decided to have an abortion.  I tried everything I could to get her to keep it, I told her my story that I had been holding inside for 3 years, I told her she could move in with me and that I would help take care of it.  She decided to have an abortion anyway.  But I did not turn my back on her, just as I would not turn my back on any other woman who did that.  And sure enough, just as I told her, she regrets it too.  She is pregnant now, and has opted to keep it, I am really happy for her, she's got a good man.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am trying to pretty much say is don't always stereotype pro-life people, some of them may know more than you.  But I would also ask pro-life people not to turn their backs on or condemn women who make the choice to terminate pregnancy, it's not our job to judge.  That is between them and One other.<br>

In the bible, god kills people outright. Where's the respect for the sanctity of life there? To say &quot;God gave life and thus has the right to take life&quot; or &quot;God's ways are mysterious&quot; is not answering the question, just ignoring it. If god hates abortion (murder, rape, child molestation) so much, why does he allow it to happen? If people stopped trying to convince women not to get abortions, would god stop the abortions himself since his children are slacking off in their policing duties? (I have the same question about airport security.) It seems that abortion is not BAD ENOUGH for god to actually take action on it when someone is about to do it. The &quot;free will&quot; programmed response doesn't answer the question either. If the police know that someone is planning a murder or planning to bomb a plane, they will do whatever they can to stop it BEFORE it happens, &quot;free will&quot; be damned. Before I can accept that god hates abortion, I need to know why he doesn't stop it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As far as &quot;why does God allow these things to happen if he hates them so much?&quot;, that's a good question, one I have asked before.  It also falls in line with &quot;why are we here if God is truly almighty and all knowing and knows what we're going to do before our life is over and if we're going to believe in him or not?&quot;  There are many more questions that can not be answered without a generalized response that really means nothing, such as &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have questioned many aspects of the Bible that no one can answer, and I at this point don't really know what to believe.  I am not an atheist, and I am not a Christian or anything else.  My feelings may change over time.<br>
<br>
However, it is important to note that if God does indeed exist, and knows everything before it happens and truly is almighty... it would be absurd of us for you, me, or any other human being to think that our level of intelligence would even be remotely close to His.  <br>
<br>
Assuming this is true, which it would have to be if He's an infallible being that is almighty, you never will understand why He does what He does, and will never even come close to thinking on His level.  I realize this is along the lines of &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot;, and that I already said those types of responses really mean nothing. <br>
<br>
It's really the only answer I could think of for this question, as well as my own questions, even though it really doesn't leave me with any satisfaction.  It's a better response than &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot;, in my opinion though.  Heh. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.nba.com/media/nba/orl.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A> at: 8/17/03 7:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=o8ithefitzi8o>O8I The Fitz I8O</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/18/03 9:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:prochoice</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, it is important to note that if God does indeed exist, and knows everything before it happens<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is one of the problems I have with the Christian Bible and it's God.  If everything that we will do is already known prior to our existance, then how can we be judged for what we do?  Do we have free will if everything is already predetermined?<br>
<br>
Take Peter and the rooster crowing three times.  Did he truly have the ability to not deny Jesus?  Jesus already knew that Peter would deny him, so how can Jesus hold that against Peter?  How can God hold that against Peter?<br>
<br>
If Jesus already knew he was going to die on the cross for everyone's sins, then why did he ask God to have the burden pass him by?  Wouldn't he already have known the anwser and what would happen to him in the future?  Or was he doing it for show becuase it would make a good story?  Jesus's path would have had to be predetermined otherwise at that point the future wasn't written.  Jesus not dieing would have affected everyone's destiny.<br>
<br>
The scary thing is that maybe Jesus was asking God to change his destiny becuase God is the only one who is capable of doing that.  That leads us again to the notion that free will does not exist.  If free will does not exist, then we can't be held accountable for our actions.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that you can't have free will and a predetermined destiny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=patmcrotch>patmcrotch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Get it? <br>

There is no point in debating this subject. The only people I have ever seen change their mind are women, who have either went from pro-choice to pro-life such as she did above, or from pro-life to pro-choice due to them fucking an ugly guy one night they met at a bar. The problem is that it is such a tricky, complicated argument.<br>
<br>
Personally, I am &quot;pro-life&quot;, I guess because, I think that if you can't keep your pants on and use birth control that cost $0.50, that you should pay the price. At the same time I am at odds with this because you could be a stupid fucking moron. You see I  believe that if you are stupid you don't need to spread your stupidity to future generations. Now, I am also for rape victims having the choice (I also believe that if the rapist is caught the victim should have the right to personally beat the living shit out of him,another discussion I know but hey). <br>
<br>
So there are so many dimensions to this argument it is hard to have a sane discussion. So far this thread hasn't got out of hand, I am impressed.  <p>Mcnubins Smith<br/>

I had an abortion.<br>

I aborted a embryo...not a child.<br>

I also had my gall bladder removed. Speaking as a biologist...both were human cells and neither were viable human beings. But one would have become one under horrible circumstances and with a father who should be castrated to prevent future reproduction.<br>

I did however seek other alternatives...we had a very active pro-choice group in town. Lots of very wealthy folks involved. I offered to allow any of them to adopt and I would go through the fun of a pregnancy and birth in a very difficult period in my life.<br>
Not one of that lovely bunch would step up and take on the responsibility that went with telling me what decision I should make.<br>

A mosquito is a more complicated 'form' of life than the cells at the moment of conception, do you call swatting flies 'murder'?<br>

No. Men push push women to have abortions all the time. There is no way 90% of the woman that have abortions used birth control. That is a ridiculously stupid statement, born only as a desperate need to justifiy an action when no justification is asked for. It might happen some. I'll grant you that but I'd put money down that most people who say they did and got pregnant are lying, and the percentage that actually did would be insignifigant. <br>
<br>
I personally have never told anyone they are right or wrong in their choice, I have close close friends who have had abortions and I think of them the same way I always did. Just I, personally, would want the chance to raise my child, wich would be half mine IMHO (here come the jeers and ITS MY BODY statements), if the mother didn't want the responsiblity........but that is just me, I try, to the best of my ability, to be accountable for my actions good or bad, for better or worse.<br>
<br>
Since we are sharing so openly. Toric for what it's worth, I know what it is like to be tricked into getting pregnant. My wife stopped taking her pills about 5 months after we got married and didn't tell me because she wanted a baby and she knew I didn't want one at the time. To make a long story short, did it almost ruin my marrage? Yes. Are we in debt still 5 years later because we had no insurance at the time and was still in college and couldn't get aid because I made, literally, $34.00 more a year than they would allow for medicaid? Yes. Do I love my daughter more than anything in the world and take care of her like the universe would stop if she wasn't happy? Yes. Would I change anything? No. Did I ever once think of her getting an abortion? No. Do I think or expect everyone to think and believe what I do? No. Do I like to voice my opinions and let them be heard, if nothing else just to hear myself speak? Yes, but who doesn't. Do I hope I can have, at least what I believe is, a possitive impact on someone else? Yes. Do I delude myself into thinking it will happen? No. Did I go overboard with this paragraph? Yes.<br>
<br>
I can only speak for myself, and I'll not ask anyone else to  do more than that. Which is why this debate sucks so bad because people start speaking for other people and trying to force their (both sides are equally guilty of this) will and opinions about the subject on everyone else. Also, idiots like me write huge long retarded explainations on their opinions. <p>Mcnubins Smith<br/>

Punish the unborn child because of the actions of the irresponsible mother &amp; father? That's such garbage, guys.<br>
<br>
That child is given absolutely no chance to ever have a life. It's easy to say that it's ok when you're not the one getting aborted. &quot;But they can't think or feel before a certain point, so it's ok!&quot;. Yeah... horseshit.<br>
<br>
Even if you don't want the child, the least you could do is let it be born and then put it up for adoption.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Jerking off isn't homicide, but it's another way of depriving what could be someone's life.  There's a big difference between that and abortion, however, even though they are somewhat similar.<br>
