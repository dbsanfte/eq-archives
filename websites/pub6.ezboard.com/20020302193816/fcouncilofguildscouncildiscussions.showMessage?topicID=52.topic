I've heard of many people who feel that the CoG should be a governing body, a place to go when someone kill steals you, or ninja loots, and talk of the banning powers of the CoG. I'm going to attempt to explain why hearing this bothers me. <br><br>I suppose I'm flattered that the CoG, in just one short year, has achieved enough of a presence in the server populations mind that we are thought of in that way. I must admit to being flattered when people ask if I am the leader of the CoG. I'm going to draw what might be a strange corollary to human history to illustrate the dangers inherent in these ideas. <br><br>Humanity as a civilization began with a tribal structure, centered around the core unit of family, with a very animalistic approach to the world around them. The air, the sea, everything around was alive and controlled by the gods, the great creator being/beings. As we progressed, tribes became bigger, becoming villages and towns and soon into nation states. Gods were reduced to icons in organized religions, and the tribes became fiefdoms, ruled by kings given the divine right to rule. As kings and religion became more assured and forceful in their application of governance (and in conflict with each other), the masses naturally reacted to this, imbuing the everyman with the right and therefore to power to self-goverance and self-determinism. Gods and kings were overthrown and the masses created goverance by representatives picked from their number. And on to the modern world, where governments, religions, gods and organizations are mistrusted and paranoia reigns. <br><br>While this is a quick, dirty and overly simplified version of human history, there are distinct corollaries to the world of Norrath. We created our characters, born into the world alone and unsure. As we grew, we learned of others and began to create some simple rules of etiquette for interacting with others, and soon little tribes of friends were born. From those tribes grew guilds, a banding together of one or more group of friends to achieve greater purpose. From those guilds came alliances, poised to do even mightier things, such as taking down dragons and slaying of gods. And then, to settle disputes by organizing a system, the KGC was born, to schedule planes and dragon runs. And by extension and somewhat in rebellion to the idea of doing only planes and dragons, the KCoG was born, to extend the world past what it was created to be. <br><br>In the beginning, we clustered in our holes, fearful of the monsters that patrolled the seas and hills and valleys outside of our hearth. Occasionally, we'd see a god, come down in avatar forms called guides and GMs. As we grew, the avatars granted us the divine right to rule our tribes, called guilds. As the guilds grew into alliances and the server became more populated, the hands of the gods seemed to appear less and less, and their justice seemed more abitrary and against the rules of interaction we'd set amongst ourselves. To the point we are now, where we mistrust large organizations (uber guilds) and mistrust even the gods themselves (guides and GM's).<br><br>And along comes the CoG... the ultimate everyman organization. Anyone is able to join its events, and it speaks of respect for everyone, regardless of guild, class or race. And we've kept it going, after year, providing fun events which even the gods (GM's and guides) don't seem willing or able to do. So why shouldn't the CoG be a place where we can go when we are kill stolen from or had a ninja looter? The Gods don't seem to care. <br><br>Here's my proposal for the CoG to be a governing body. Let's elect an upper Council of 3 to rule over, making laws and codes of conduct. Then lets' appoint a set of people to be the CoG Outriders, the law enforcement arm of the CoG. Their job will be to enforce the codes of conduct. So as an Outrider, when called you are to come enforce the law, no matter what you were doing. And the High Council will adjudicate on the law, judging innocence and guilt. Of course, we'll have votes and discussions on issues, with the final say decided on by the High Council, who will have use of the CoG Outriders to bring into action those decisions. <br><br>Does that sound like fun to you? How'd you like to be an Outrider, on call every minute you are online, ready to come to the rescue of any incident of Kill stealing? How'd you like to be a member of the High Council, listening and adjudicating on all instances of that? About to kill Nagafen, OOOPPPS, gotta run to the Lower Guk, the Frenzy just got ninjaed. <br><br>You might ask why would would need the Outriders? Laws and rules are guidelines that are enforced by an arbitrary power. In order to have a law, you must, at some point force your will upon those who will not follow the law. In real life, this is accomplished often by violence, carefully administered to the letter of the law. In the case of non-members of that country or other countries, this is enforced by the use of military force. <br><br>Now what happens in EQ when someone chooses not to follow the CoG laws? Without PvP, you cannot enforce your will on another player, at least not without some form of harrassment (i.e. illegal by Verant standards). You have no means to force your will onto someone else. What if a guild doesn't want to follow the CoG way? Again, no arbitrary means to enforce your will. Challenge them to a duel or guildwar? They have no reason to accept it. Again, you then have no means to enforce the laws/rules that you are trying to use. <br><br>When you set yourself up as the law, in what is essentially a lawless society, all those who don't believe in the law or the tenets you hold dear then become your enemy. And that's when the PR/Flame Wars begin. Friendships are destroyed and nothing is gained. And that's the point behind this.... nothing is to be gained by making the CoG a governing body. <br><br>I for one, though I can see the good intentions behind something like the Outriders, would never want the added chore/stress of being one. And what happens when someone less than scrupulous becomes an Outrider and abuses that power. <br><br>The KCoG exists as a forum for supporting, discussing, sponsoring and helping each other out on EVENTS. We're not about being guides or GM's. I don't want to be a player-appointed guide. I don't want to be told I'm doing something wrong by a player-appointed guide. The simple fact is we cannot change Verant's world, and we cannot enforce our own rules about many things within that world. <br><br>At it's heart the CoG is and always has been about respect. Respect for others playing time, respect for others guilds or for those who choose not to be in a guild. It's about bringing the fun into the world that isn't controlled by Verant, by the environment. <br><br>We don't control the scheduling of the planes. We aren't the arbitrators of good behaviour. We don't control the raids or the zones, and we don't presume to. <br><br>I'm not the leader of the CoG. If you want to do a CoG event, do it, just follow the guidelines set above. Respect. I don't have to attend every CoG event, nor does anyone else, nor do I have to run one. Friday night, Zellex ran a CoG raid on Kael Drakkel and my alliance, the Sacred Band ran one as well. We shared the zone quite well, no overlaps, no problems, he even helped us by sending us a cleric when we needed it. Other things like Pippi's chess Tourney or Junun's Naked Troll Run are things that help break up the tedium of leveling and bring fun back to us higher level folks close to burnout. <br><br>The CoG is not led. You make up the CoG, the events you do or choose not to do. If you don't attend or discuss or sponsor or help events, you aren't contributing to the CoG. The CoG works as a loose, dynamic organization that waxes and wanes with the energies of the people who sacrifice something for it. There is no reason that I can see, no gain I understand from formalizing into some structure of laws. <br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umirithal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirithal</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(3/31/01 11:27:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/miri4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The CoG is Not Law - Please Read</span><hr size=1> in the words of Fulgrim...........<br><br>Haemish for president <p><b><a href=mailto:mirithal@hotmail.com>Mirithal Darkbuster</a></b><br>High Commander of the <a href="http://twilite.org/~chrome">Illuminatus</a> Honor Gaurd<br>Paladin of the 41st Dawn<br>Knight of Mithaniel Marr<br><img src=http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/miritag.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uchizletrufuri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chizle Tru Furi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(4/29/01 9:40:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/ak5/chizle/face.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The CoG is Not Law - Please Read</span><hr size=1> Kudos <br><br>.,:`~`:,..,:`~`:,..,:`~`:,.<br>Chizle Tru'Furi<br>Druid of Karana<br>Semper Fi<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=70040">eq.castersrealm.com/playe...p?Id=70040</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>.,:`~`:,..,:`~`:,..,:`~`:,. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uchizletrufuri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chizle Tru Furi</A> at: 4/29/01 9:40:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Least Equipped 55th Level Druid</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/9/01 11:06:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The CoG is Not Law - Please Read</span><hr size=1> Just thought it might be good to add my post here that I posted on the dragon raid forum in response to some angry voices:<br><br>Everyone deserves a voice in the KCoG forum. That being said, everyone also has a choice to participate, attend or help - or not. Please realize that we are all in this together, there is no &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;. People have stopped coming to CoG raids since the inception of them, and most of the times, it was the &quot;us want good service... me not happy customer. Me leave.&quot; reaction that I have come to love so much in the RL (yea, insert sarcasm here).<br><br>If you want to participate in these KGoC raids, be aware that this is not about being as efficient and effective and oh-so-uber and getting good loot ... quite honestly, there are enough guilds and alliances out there that can do that. The challenge of the KGoC is to offer an alternative to these established groupings and to allow people to meet new people, to debate strategies, and just to have fun with people you don't interact with day-in and day-out.<br><br>I think the concerns raised should be raised here, and it's never an easy thing to come out and be critical, so my hats off to people who try to help by making constructive suggestions for the sake of improving this. <br><br>The only thing I would like to ask of people is to remember that everyone has feelings and opinion, regardless of who they are. Have enough dignity to treat people with respect and decency in any type of communication you may be involved in. Be aware and acknowledge that there are tasks that only a few such as Lagdalen and Flarren have volunteered to do without purely selfish reasons. <br><br>Pippi Langstrump  <p><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>     What concerns everyone can only be resolved by everyone.                                                                   -Friedrich Dürrenmatt</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A> at: 5/9/01 11:28:55 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showPrevMessage?topicID=52.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showNextMessage?topicID=52.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.emailToFriend?topicID=52.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.threadControl?topicID=52.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=52.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=52.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions>Council Discussions</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
