Quad-kiting, along with shammies/mages/necros/BLs/whoever killing lower lvl mobs for xp has been ruined.

Rogue AA pretty much sucks a$$, and I haven't really pursued it since I got Run 3. <br><br>That being said, I play 2 toons. I have a 52 cleric, and my 60 rogue with 30 misbegotten AA points. I will play Pah in exp groups when someone asks me to, or if we're going somewhere fun to exp, like Grieg's, CT, Umbral, etc.. I absolutely refuse to group with Pah in Seb, Velk's, the Hole, Chardok, etc.. Unless there is something in particular being sought after. The exp changes, I hope, will force lvl 60's to move onto other zones, instead of soloing thru mobs that were blue at 47 (i.e. Velk's/Seb/Howling Stones)<br><br>That's my point of view when playing Pah. My point of view from the cleric side, is that it really sucks to zone in, and say 52 Cleric LFG, only to be followed by &quot;60 Cleric LFG&quot;. AA points really screwed the game over, unless you're a mad power-gamer, that is lvl 60, and never plays alts. With the advent of AA, the difficult lvls to get groups switched from 30-50, to 50-59. Hopefully, the soloing lvl 60 monks/rangers/sk/pallies will get out of zones they should have left 10 lvls ago, and go do something challenging.<br><br>Just my 2 coppers,<br><br> <p>Pahraith Feydakin <BR>"One who can destroy a thing, Controls a thing."<BR><BR><a href="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Pahraith/fullsize/Sigpic+copy.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Pahraith/fullsize/Sigpic+copy.jpg" border="0" width="240"height="200"></a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umalakarude.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/4/02 5:02:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> this patch is obviously the end of solo (except for classes that can solo big mobs), and, that being, the end of casual playing.<br><br>It will be prolly one of the most controversed patch in EQ story if all stays like that.<br><br>Also, even if i had fun with my cleric and his hammer, i hope it will be nerfed, that is completely unfair to other classes.<br><br>Ragefire part will also be fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  on another server, a guild of a friend of mine did 2 epics this afternoon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upahraith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pahraith</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/4/02 5:07:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> One more thing.. At the expense of sounding like an ass..<br><br>As far as the 'anti-druid' part of the patch goes.. Druids and shamans are going to be just as effective for heals in group situations as clerics.. The healing abilities of druids in particular has been whined, bitched, moaned, and complained about more than any other class issue I have ever seen. It wasn't enough for those that play druids that they can port, sow, nuke, kite, dot, etc etc etc.. They had to be able to heal more. The basis for all of this is that 'We noble druids really don't care about our ability to simultaneously kill 4 mobs solo, while classes such as rogues, clerics, and warriors can't solo one.' <br><br>Well, looky here.. New heals are coming for druids, and lo and behold! Their ability to kite has been decreased.. Be careful what you ask for.

I have two toons I play as well, my Bard at 60 and my Beastlord about to hit 47 - and it seems to me the overall result of these changes will be positive.  If this patch means I can zone into CT or UP or something and shout Bard LFG and have more than a snowball's chance in hell of actually getting something, then I'm all for it - it'd be nice to see a lot of the zones that are good xp for high 50s/60 that have until now been BYOG zones only to start becoming pickup zones to rival Seb/Velk's etc.  Will it happen?  Who knows, time will tell.<br><br>Similarly, I agree with Pah's comment about looking for groups in the old xp zones - as a result of the easy accessibility of good gear at relatively low levels, it's easier than ever for low 50s groups to do well for themselves in Seb, Velk's etc, but the chances of such characters finding groups in those zones are severely impaired by the number of people AAing there.  I had initially intended to level my Beastlord solo til at least 54 or 55 before trying to group in those zones, simply because of the difficulty of finding groups.<br><br>The effect on soloing, however, I do not like the sound of - up until now, soloing was for the most part slightly better xp than grouping, but in my mind that was made up for by the boredom of it, lack of social interaction (not that that is always a bad thing), and having to pay full attention.  Subsequently, I enjoyed being able to solo low blues from time to time to move my xp along a little - with this patch, that's essentially gone all to hell.  This is not such a big thing for classes who can solo or group, such as Bards, but I can see it being severely detrimental to classes who's post 50-lives largely revolved around soloing in the past, such as necros and druids.  I can't see this as being a good thing.<br><br>And the hammer.. hopefully we will see that gone soon..

Does that mean I want to? No, I hate it. It takes roughly 20 mins with WD and ES vambs to kill one without some sort of clarity, and the xp reward for that hasn't jumped that much with the patch. Then I med for 12 mins or so and look for another. In the end, I have 2 kills in about 70-75 minutes of playing time.<br><br>This patch isn't going to stop lvl 60s from getting their aaxp in places like Velks, Seb, and KC. They're going to get less xp doing it, but do it they will. What has been done, though, is that several classes have had the basis of their style of play destroyed. Druids and wizzies quad-kiting raptors in TD? Ruined. Necros/shammies/mages killing wyverns in CS for good xp? Destroyed.<br><br>Since this game came out certain classes have been identified by their ability to solo, and this ability has been taken forcibly from us. While the essential group classes move on to fighting tougher mobs for better xp, we soloists will start to fade away, and I can't imagine I'll be one of the last to go. I hate grouping most of the time. I see nothing wrong with a nice relaxing day of killing mobs at my own pace and making decent xp doing it. But apparently VI does. Well, their option. If it hurts their bank account, then I'll be one of the first in line to rub it in their faces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umoongluum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moongluum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/4/02 5:23:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> Okay, my interpretations....seeing how everyone's jumping the bandwagon here.  I'm kinda glad for the progression changes in the 50's.  It seems that what they did in the lower levels by removing &quot;those&quot; hell levels, was only a natural progression that Veriant was looking at all along.  I don't think they accomplished all that they wanted though?  It could have been alot worse if you think about it.<br><br>Less exp for mobs less then your level? I thought this was directed at named NPC's.  I could have interpretted it wrong, but that's how I saw it.  If there is a little be less exp, that's because of the new balancing act they tried to perform for 50+ toons.  Don't look at it as the mob's not giving me all the exp I'm due, but as this could be apart of the re-org of exp.  The patch message did indicate this.  It doesn't change the amount of exp needed to attain max 60.

The vast majority of the people with whom I've spoken said that they would give up soloing to be more effective in groups, and raid situations. Well, just about all those classes have been given something that makes them more valuable to groups. <br><br>Druids get better heals, necros get group buffs, everyone has always wanted wizards, shamans will not only be able to solo just as well, but with dot stacking will probably solo better. Mages.. Well, mages haven't been changed that much.<br><br>Druids will still solo well, just not 4 mobs at a time.. Does that bother me? Not at all. And, from every discussion I've ever had with a druid regarding class balancing, it shouldn't bother druids either.<br><br>As far as lvl 60's being purged from lower lvl zones.. No, they won't leave entirely, but maybe they'll be more inspired to move towards higher end dungeons, and zones.<br><br> <p>Pahraith Feydakin <BR>"One who can destroy a thing, Controls a thing."<BR><BR><a href="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Pahraith/fullsize/Sigpic+copy.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Pahraith/fullsize/Sigpic+copy.jpg" border="0" width="240"height="200"></a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uelysianaheathertoes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElysianaHeathertoes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/4/02 5:43:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> &quot;As far as the 'anti-druid' part of the patch goes.. Druids and shamans are going to be just as effective for heals in group situations as clerics.. The healing abilities of druids in particular has been whined, bitched, moaned, and complained about more than any other class issue I have ever seen. It wasn't enough for those that play druids that they can port, sow, nuke, kite, dot, etc etc etc.. They had to be able to heal more. The basis for all of this is that 'We noble druids really don't care about our ability to simultaneously kill 4 mobs solo, while classes such as rogues, clerics, and warriors can't solo one.' &quot;<br><br>It occurs to me that I never whined, bithced, moaned, or complaied about a druid's ability to heal. I never found it to be a problem in a group with a cleric, and without a cleric, any group should know damned well to have two druids/shammies. I don't appreciate the concept of generalizing.<br><br>How high have you played a druid? Ever tried LFG as one? it's not fun. This is the same for necros and, in many situations mages, bards, and BL. So we take what we've got and make it work. Do you think VI conceived of quad-kiting when they designed EQ? Not at all, but since it worked they decided to let it go and let druids remain a solo class instead of giving them uber heals or buffs or whatever. I don't have a problem with that.<br><br>I don't think druids need better heals. At 55, with chloroblast I can do pretty well shooting a heal in quick. It heals 378 damage. Perfect for a chanter who needs a quick heal while the cleric's keeping the MT alive, or for the cleric who happened to get that CH off a little too soon. I don't know about most druids, but I personally have no desire to EVER be the main healer in a group. What I do care about is the fact that the one thing I enjoyed doing as a druid has been made uesless. And, no, I didn't just read the patch message and come to the flame boards. I spend 4 hours online in a growing state of disgust.<br><br>So whatever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugreendrake765.showPublicProfile?language=EN>greendrake765</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/4/02 5:46:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> Your ability to solo wasn't forcibly taken away, it was made pointless maybe, but you can still solo the same stuff. <br><br>From what I've seen and understand solo classes made a huge amount of exp off these camps like Raptors in TD and made it faster then grouping classes.
