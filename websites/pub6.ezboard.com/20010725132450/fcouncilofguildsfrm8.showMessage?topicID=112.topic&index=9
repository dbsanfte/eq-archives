I thouhgt it went well considering it was our first time and we were low on people.  Also thank you vaard and Ogun for rezing me six times.<br>
   I dont think there is anything new I can add other than there were a few people who were spamming way to much.  During a raid, either talk in &quot;tells&quot; or dont talk at all.  There is plenty of time later to chat.  Also, some commands like, ready, set, GO GO GO would have been great for our first wave.  I saw people going in helter skelter in stead of a massive wave.<br>
   In case others dont know, during the battle I was to transfer my mana to my group healer.  So to those of you telling me to get in there and nuke, I was already doing my job. Unfortunately, I dont have any relevant nukes that are not fire based.  So I was relegated to pumping mana for heals and rezzes.<br>
   Even though we lost, I really enjoyed being a part of that.  I am certain that we will have a much better outcome next time.  I hope we are back on the waiting list.  <br>
As a fellow Reptile, I have to say I am very ashamed of Lord Nagefen.  I hope you all will not judge the rest of we reptiles by his example.<br>

A couple people who could have did NOT do so, and they died very quickly, and were lost. The sad part is, is that that woulda taken him down I&quot;m sure b/c I know one of them was a good high level caster, and you have to die, remem, nuke, die, remem, nuke, over and over again. I personally probably came in second with 7 deaths, and every time I was going in, I did see people sitting there, or walking around by the entrance, talking in say, I'm NOT joking, I heard somebody say a joke while running around the room while I'm working my butt off running back in there for hopes of doing dmg.  As for Naggy's status, this is about how it went for me....Death 4-15%, Death 5-12%, Death 6-8%, Death 7-11% After death 7 I knew his regen was doing more than we were dmging so I knew it was over, plus Lag said for us to stop. However, I&quot;m really disappointed that many people weren't very relentless and didn't seem to care enough to keep going back in to fight, they stopped about 3 minutes before Lag said to stop.<br>
Anyways, thats enough of my comments, oh well, we gave it a good try, sorry I couldn't be there for a second attempt.<br>

P.S. I liked the strategy of splitting the tanks, and I think that it may be useful to instead of waiting 15 seconds to send pets in like we did, let them go in right away...Heres why: To start off every fight, Naggy and Vox both cast their fear at the first agro, fearing generally about 1/2 the tanks, and mage pets always. So I think we should just let them be and go after him once their fear wears(generally 8-10seconds). They generally do another fear every 20-30 seconds, and so by the time they actually get to naggy if we put em in at 15 seconds, they will be useless, but if they actualy start tanking at 15 seconds(by the time they get back to him after being feared), they'll have more time on him. Also, for the 45% caster nuke point, just a recommendation, but I think it should really go back to about 70%. The reason we failed is because there were no tanks left to keep it off the casters, well, tanks can't last that long, and have one life, so if casters go in earlier , we can take him down to 0% hp faster than if they wait, and if its faster, more likely we are to have tanks still alive, rather then all dead and faileing at 8% hp<br>
