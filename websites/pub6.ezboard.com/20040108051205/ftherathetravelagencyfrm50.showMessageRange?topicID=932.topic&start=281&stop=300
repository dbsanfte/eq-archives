to only a select few.  <br>
<br>
The forums are either open to everyone to &quot;view&quot; or password protected.<br>
<br>
The guilds involved have requested it be a private forum.  One that will be opened to guilds as they achieve Ele Plane Access.  The &quot;etiquette&quot;, once decided, will be added into the appropriate section.<br>
<br>
The precedent for password protected forums was instituted when the &quot;Trakanon Rotation Forum&quot; was created.  That forum evolved into the Rotation and Calendar Pages written by Milambus.  So, too, will the Elemental Forum. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trivilusbotsrep>TrivilusBotSrep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BotS - Rep</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/18/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> As milambus stated you have about the best non &quot;elitist&quot; as you like to call us guild rep there is for that forum, rogg.

<br>
As far as being fair, obviously after all the valid reasons for keeping it private you still havent changed your mind, i see that nothing will do this. Thats fine, you keep up with the conspiracy theory cause its going to stay private til you hit the planes. Even then it will be just your guild leader and reps that get access to the forum. <br>
<br>
As was stated already also, once we hammer everything out and finalize it most likely it will go public also as we will have resolved everything and wont have to worry about all the nonsense people outside the planes will toss in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

I assure you that with Ezboard you can make an &quot;invisble forum&quot; that only people who you select can see it.<br>
<br>
I use one on a board that I frequent alot.  If I log out, the forum is not visible.  If I log in, it is.<br>
<br>
Look into that if you wish.<br>

Who do you answer to, Milambus?  Yourselves?  Each other?  Please, give me a break.  The absence of a impartial, 3rd party, policing authority is, in and of itself, unfair to the community as a whole.  You simply cannot sit there and say &quot;we are being fair&quot; when neither you nor I can prove otherwise.  <br>
<br>
The community has such a policing authority ...it's called the RTA, the RTA Admins in some cases, the RTA Representatives in other cases, the entire community in the flame forums.  If I screwed up and did something really bad, like blow a ring event or, gasp, a rotation mob ...you can bet your sweet ass I would answer to someone for it, my guild leader, my guild, and probably a large contingent of RTA members.  If you screw up, who do you answer to??  Who has the right to question you, Milambus?  <br>
<br>
You make policy that the rest of the community has to abide by and no one ever has the right to question you on any decision you ever make.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Then explain to me how it is &quot;fair&quot; for one person to demand that a group of other people stop having a private conversation even if it is taking place in a public setting.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I understand that I have the unfortunate opportunity to fight on the side of the unpopular argument here, but do not assume that I am one person speaking.  I happen to know for a fact that other people agree with what I am attempting to debate here.  Their reasons for remaining silent I cannot and will not assume, but you cannot use that &quot;you are only one person&quot; argument ...it is simply not true.  Do I know all of their names?  Yep.  Am I going to tell you who they are?  Not in your lifetime.  They are perfectly within their right to remain silent as it is in my right not to.<br>
<br>
When that &quot;group of other people&quot; demand that their conversation be held privately in a public setting, that's when I can demand that it stop.  If you would have 'asked' for the forum and, when 'asked' for additional access, 'allowed' some kind of compromise ...we wouldn't be in this situation, would we?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You keep repeating how you don't trust myself and the other Guild Representatives of the guilds involoved, but somehow I am supposed to trust you or anyone you appoint to be your champion in this matter to keep private conmmunications private.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Careful Milambus, your elistist attitude is starting to shine through.  I am asking for the RTA Representatives to be my champions in this matter ...so, while I wouldn't ask that you trust them outright, I would have assumed that you already did trust them to some degree.  Of course, it could be that you trust them just enough to do your admin work, update the calendar once in a while, maybe have a token involvement in the RTA Representative Forum ...but really, when it comes to anything that actually affects you, they are too fucking stupid to comprehend the level of existance that you live on?  If you tell them, &quot;ok, we'll give you access on the condition that nothing within this forum be taken outside these forums for discussion in the General section&quot; ...I'm pretty certain that most of them are smart enough to read that, and maybe on a &quot;we are not elementally capable&quot; retarded sort of way, they might understand it.  If that forum really is all about rots and nothing more, there should never be any time where this would be the case.<br>
<br>
It's about oversight, everyone answers to someone, and you don't answer to anyone.  All kinds of people have thrown out so-called 'conspiracy theories' here ...of which I don't necessarily agree ...but really, how does anyone really know?  Just because it has 'always been that way (tm)' doesn't make it any more or less right.  As long as you want to use the RTA for your own personal gain while making policy for the entire community behind closed doors, I say you have to be policed by the RTA community.  No one gets to answer to no one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is already done. Roggulbuk as an RTA Administrator has access to this forum. And as he is not in any of the guilds involved in the discussions themselves he has no personal concern with how those conversation develop or with being an &quot;elitist prick&quot; out to repress the small guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->While I respect Roggulbuk far more than I ever will any of you, one person is hardly 'fair and impartial' representation ...but nice try.  If all of the RTA Admins were non-elemental capable, or even the majority of them wasn't elemental capable, I'd almost consider them as a sufficiently fair and impartial authority.  Unfortunately, 5 of the 6 belong to the group of elemental planes guilds and it is hardly fair to Roggulbuk to place him in that position.  On the one hand, he is a 'smaller guild leader' ...on the other, he's an RTA Admin ...and still on the other, he is the only non-elemental capable representative in that forum?  Christ, I'd shoot you dead myself if you ever put me in that position.  The sheer potential for conflict of interest is mind-boggling.<br>
<br>
Plus, lets not forget how trustworthy those Admins have been recently.  Hiding the elem planes forum and letting people 'assume' it was deleted (even by the one non-elemental capable admin!!), then bringing it back with no explanation to why or any consideration of the community.  Yeah, those guys aren't bought and paid for ...real impartial they are. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->These are stupid ideas and these people should be given a damn good thrashing with a clue stick.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.clanbashemded.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.clanbashemded.org/images/rigsig.gif" style="border:0;height:150;width:300;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=438887" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:verdana;font-size:x-small;">Magelo Profile</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

By the way. Please end all references to to RTA being a &quot;government&quot;. Its a council. While it can be considered a government in quite a few instances, this situation, however, is not one of them.<br>
<br>
As far as why we can't view the forums, I've been given a good, valid reason, and I think I speak for Hutt too when I say &quot;Reason accepted.&quot; <br>

Dont get me wrong. I dont play anymore, so I honestly have little say in this. My only active account is my cleric. and hes 54.

The way THIS board has been set up, there isn't any way to have it 'viewable' to only some, and 'postable' by a sub-set of that some.  Even making it invisible wouldn't solve the problem.  <br>
<br>
Having password protected forums is nothing new for this board.  It's just a new concept for some of the newer members of this board.  <br>

If you ever came up to me in public and told me i couldnt talk to someone im with unless i let you sit and listen, i'd tell you where to go and how to get there real quick.<br>
<br>
Next think you are going to want is for guilds to give everyone access to their members only section cuz it is also in a public setting. You going to goto the white house next and tell them you want to listen to the private phone calls and the defence meetings as well???<br>

Stop being a moron and drop the dam topic, you are just getting annoying now. Others have accepted the  reasons given for them not getting access wtf cant you.<br>

And honestly littleman if anyone on this board has an &quot;elitest&quot; attitude its you for thinking you have the right to tell everyone when and where they can talk in private.

If there was a grade on total twisting, exageration and manipulation of someones explanation, you would get an A!!  You as many others have, have totally twisted Riggors explanation.  It's like listening to the Activists twisting the constitution to whatever they want it to mean.  <br>
<br>
Riggore's post points out (simply put) that THIS is a COMMUNITY board.  The RTA is a COMMUNITY, not a club to join, as was pointed out many times in the teaming thread by representatives of the top tier guilds.  remember the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot;? So if this is a COMMUNITY, why is there a private forum for a few people of this COMMUNITY?  How many people donate money for this board that are not allowed in that forum?<br>
<br>
While it doesn't bother me about the no access, I'm getting tired of people exagerating with their analogies. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=286161" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dembire Deadbones</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
A rotation is an agreement between the parties that can kill a mobile in Everquest. It regulates the ethics and morals that the involved parties stick to when dealing with each other over the spawn in question. It is not a law, it's not an absolute. Note that I use the words 'the involved parties' here. I do this because until you are killing said mobile the rotation agreement doesn't concern you and doesn't effect you or your gameplay one jot.<br>
<br>
The key to two parties making an agreement is that they adress each other when doing so, not some third party. If I want to buy my friends cd player but do not have as much cash as he wants for it at the time and we agree that I'll pay him twenty dollars a month for it until he has all of the asking price then I don't send an email to Nyko Makasumi in South Korea asking if I can do this. It doesn't concern her. She may through some unlikely chain of incredible events end up buying it from me when I in turn want to sell it and I may offer her the same deal. Then again, she could say that she doesn't have even twenty dollars a month but that she can swing fifteen a month instead.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on turning rotational agreements into easily understood allegories but others have done so, I've done it once already and it still wont help will it?<br>
<br>
You want to argue from the standpoint that there is a governing body that stipulates rules in the interest of every individual on the server. That way lies fertile ground for the whole downtrodden masses with their just and moral outcry against the supressing elitists deal. I don't blame you really, it's a good and easy launch for a debate, it's just that it is inaccurate.<br>
<br>
What exists is an agreement between the guilds able to kill a mobile in Everquest. Furthermore, this is a board that publicizes said agreement so that others that are interested in joining the agreement in harmony with it's ethics may see what is required of them. They are free not to do so by relating to the mobile in question in any way the want. There is no law or rule that a kill has to go according to the rotational agreement if you are not part of the guilds that have entered into the agreement and therefore it's a silly notion to have a law that requires them to let anyone else see their discussion of the same agreement. If you really want to argue from your current platform then what we are now dealing with is attempted invasion of privacy.<br>
<br>
What is the RTA? It's a collection of agreements. NB, FK, TL and BotS agree to share mobile A in a manner that satisfies them all, or at least doesn't unfairly benefit one over the others <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Far Seekers, Muse and Merriment, Ring of Dragons and Raging Fury decides to share mobile B in a different way.<br>
<br>
What, Norrath Travel Bureau wants to kill mobile B also? Here you go guys, this is how we are doing it, if you do it by our standards we'll extend you the same courtesies as we do each other. Note the 'if', it implies choice. What, Norrath Travel Bureau notifies us that we should change this aspect of our agreement. Oh, do they want to kill mobile B also? No...they can't. I don't understand, why should we change the way we do things then, surely it's our concern and not theirs? Well they said they play on the same server...<br>
<br>
Are the rotational agreements the best way of doing things? Debatable, I'm sure. They do however provide one of the least stressful and confrontational athmospheres among all of the different servers. Good or bad, the agreements reward a cooperational spirit instead of an agressive one. So that is the much vaunted spirit of the Rathe.<br>
<br>
I admired your passion at first and it's not every day you see well written posts on this board but it is starting to get a little predictable and tired. Is it passion or self confirmation at this point? You will read my post and if you decide to adress it you'll keep on doing it from the same platform. I.E. there will be alot more reasoning involving the proper way a ruling body sets up a control system in order to insure impartialness in it's dealings with it's subordinates. In the end, you want a say in something that doesn't concern you, either by yourself or via proxy. You want to police my dealings in an area that has no contact surfaces with you, your game or your actions in it?<br>
<br>
Your guild leader seems fond of the saying 'my right to swing my arm ends where your nose starts'. Right now I am feeling the draft and you are dangerously close to stepping on my individual freedoms here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ruldarswiftnote>Ruldar Swiftnote</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/18/03 5:23 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let someone else have access that doesn't have any concern with those legitimate conversations, but who can act as a overseers for the community.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While I respect Roggulbuk far more than I ever will any of you, one person is hardly 'fair and impartial' representation ...but nice try.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And here I would have thought the original request was for one person.

I really don't understand the why the Elemental Planes Forum could ever have the importance of a 15 page thread written about it on either side.  Besides both sides repeating essentially the same thing for 15 pages it has been revealed that some members of the top guilds are elitism pricks (huge shocker here) and that some members of smaller guilds are whiney bitches.  <br>
<br>
The only problem I have with the admins atm is that this needed to be moved to Flame Central 13 pages ago.  I mean read this thread again, its full of personal attacks, conspiracy theories, profanity laced tirades, only Jurr's lovely picture collection is missing for the thread to be complete.<br>
<br>
Since the debate among the parties still left arguing is about as likely to change each others mind as beating a Rhino to death with a Gnome's dick let me ask why this isn't in Flame Central by now?  Can anyone give me a good answer to that question? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/sdomar69/S65.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Ask FK what happened to them when they screwed the rotation system we have in place on AoW. You will find out that we came down on them just as we would any other guild, including my own and any other. No guild is above our rules period. You speak out your ass making that assessment. <br>
<br>
Next lets get to the government type shit you keep bringing up. This is not a government so why keep bringing up government rules and quotes, we really dont care about them as they have nothing to do with us as much as you seem to think they do. <br>
<br>
Lastly, you say that Rogg isnt enough as far as admins go with reading the planar forum, well I have to tell you that those other members that are part of the &quot;elitist&quot; crew dont post in those forums as they are ADMINS not GUILD REPS as you like to keep posting. They have access to read the forum yet they have no say in how shit works out there  since they are only admins. <br>
<br>
If you dont trust Rogg as a smaller guild Rep who is an admin then I really dont know who you can trust. Rogg is one of the most trustworthy people i know in this game and has always been straightforward with everyone. By doubting his trust you show me that you in fact dont deserve either my trust or my respect, which i doubt you care about, and as i said before we arent going to change your mind and you arent going to change ours. <br>

If this 'agreement' was kept between 'the parties that can kill a mobile in Everquest', you could almost have a valid argument ...but it isn't.  Once this 'agreement' is made and agreed on by 'the parties that can kill a mobile in Everquest', it is passed as regulation (law) to everyone on the Rathe server to be abided by regardless of whether they can kill that mobile or not.  As long as a guild is not currently fighting that mobile, the law governing that mob is absolute (we have no say).  <br>

Do I need to go on?  Every 'agreement' you make, and make no mistake about who exactly made these laws, we have to abide by.  So, tell me, how does this not affect my gameplay one jot?

Cmon, people, all together now, what would happen if a guild 'chose' that it didn't want to abide by the rules of the RTA?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you really want to argue from your current platform then what we are now dealing with is attempted invasion of privacy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Dear God, someone shoot me, please.  The RTA doesn't recognize a constitution, a bill of rights, or anything remotely resembling a freedom of information act ...but it has no problem invoking a law of privacy?  Seriously, omg, I'm in tears, but I can't tell if they because I'm laughing or crying.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are the rotational agreements the best way of doing things? Debatable, I'm sure. They do however provide one of the least stressful and confrontational athmospheres among all of the different servers. Good or bad, the agreements reward a cooperational spirit instead of an agressive one. So that is the much vaunted spirit of the Rathe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I 100% agree with you on this point, as it pertains to the calendaring and technical scheduling system of the RTA.  If it was truly all about the fact that everyone has to stand in line for their fair and equal turn at content, we would not be having this conversation ...but it isn't, is it?  You don't simply put A_Firebeetle_01 on rotation and say, &quot;here, share&quot; ...You say, &quot;here, share, and oh btw ....&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I admired your passion at first and it's not every day you see well written posts on this board but it is starting to get a little predictable and tired. Is it passion or self confirmation at this point? You will read my post and if you decide to adress it you'll keep on doing it from the same platform. I.E. there will be alot more reasoning involving the proper way a ruling body sets up a control system in order to insure impartialness in it's dealings with it's subordinates. In the end, you want a say in something that doesn't concern you, either by yourself or via proxy. You want to police my dealings in an area that has no contact surfaces with you, your game or your actions in it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...and, once again, read anything on the so called 'etiquette' page and keep telling me how any of this 'has no contact surfaces with you, your game or your actions in it&quot;.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and me is that I gain absolutely nothing personally from this exchange, other than the knowledge that I am attempting to create a fair and impartial policy making system with the best interests of the community as a whole.  You are protecting what's yours ...I understand that ...but I believe with my very soul that it is wrong for a minority group of people to make policy that DOES AFFECT EVERYONE behind closed doors with no accountability to anyone other than themselves.<br>
<br>
The only argument you can claim is that it doesn't affect me.  I believe I have counter-pointed by example of the etiquette page that those 'policies' do affect me without my ever being on any rotation; therefore, we do deserve that those discussions take place with appropriate non-rotation representation.  Am I asking that *I* get access to that forum?  No.  Am I asking to *handpick* the people who would have access?  No.  The RTA Representatives are chosen by their respective guilds ...in affect, the community, and that is fine with me.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you dont trust Rogg as a smaller guild Rep who is an admin then I really dont know who you can trust. Rogg is one of the most trustworthy people i know in this game and has always been straightforward with everyone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Unlike you, I would never dream of placing Roggulbuk in the position that you are all so happy to put him in.  He has friends and loyalties on both sides of this fence and placing him in the middle is incredibly unfair to him, no matter what hat he is wearing.  The very second a discrepency comes up, you are going to have people from all sides attacking him as being partial to the other side ...something that, I might add, has already occured with the forum, and you would have to be a serious ass to wish that kind of crap on anyone.  I am not doubting this trustworthiness and integrity ...I simply wish to spare him the aggravation and frustration later of having to deal with that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By doubting his trust you show me that you in fact dont deserve either my trust or my respect, which i doubt you care about, and as i said before we arent going to change your mind and you arent going to change ours.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->On this, we can be in 100% agreement ...I don't care what you think of me personally, just as I would not expect you to care what I may think of you personally.  I am merely trying to debate an issue on which you and I are on two different sides.  You are wrong in the assumption that I would not change my mind if given enough acceptable reasons to do so ...unfortunately, &quot;because we said so!&quot; doesn't cut it ...&quot;because we are more entitled to do so!&quot; doesn't cut it ...and &quot;because this is the way it has always been!&quot; certainly won't do it.  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->These are stupid ideas and these people should be given a damn good thrashing with a clue stick.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.clanbashemded.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.clanbashemded.org/images/rigsig.gif" style="border:0;height:150;width:300;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=438887" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:verdana;font-size:x-small;">Magelo Profile</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vilgan>Vilgan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/19/03 11:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> This thread should be renamed &quot;conspiracy theorists of the world unite&quot; and be moved to the flame board already. points been made, I think its pretty obvious minds aren't going to get changed, and most of the posts have been personal attacks for the last 10 pages.

Btw that power outtage last week can be attributed to the mass plots of Tindi, BotS, NB, and FK. They were killing power to NYC to reduce the chances of another guild becoming elemental, didnt ya know? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
