Question....<br>
<br>
Last night... Our guild found out that hate was open and inny was up. We talked and decided to raid hate. I went to the luclin raid calendar and check reservations. I saw that Milyanna had reserved but canceled her raid. So I then went back online and sent milyanna a tell confirming her raid was off. She said it was off. So I came back to here and resrved hate on the calendar and in this message area. This put my raid reservations at 3 so I know I did not violate that rule. <br>
<br>
I receive an in game tell from a friend saying that it might be bad form for us to kill Inny, because United Soul has Hate reserved for Thursday. So I was wondering is this against reservation policies? I also checked and saw that Automn stated if she gets a pull team together they will do the plane. After I read that I decided we would continue and kill inny since I already spent the 2.5k from my own pocket, and was 90% done in clearing and ready to go for the kill. I ported a few more needed to kill him and we did. This was the first God Kill of our newly merged COL members and Veil of Shadows. Any comments, suggestions good or bad would be appreciated.<br>

I hate to make an  issue of this, but frankly it pisses me off.  <br>
<br>
Raid Calendar read for Hate<br>
<br>
Saturday IB<br>
Sunday Heroes <br>
<br>
I logged on Saturday night to find that Veil of Shadows was in Hate. In fact they were ACTUALLY there on Sunday (I logged at 4am and there were still there).  The day of MY raid.  I had heard that Inny was up and that we were going to have a chance to kill him.  Heroes has yet to kill him.  <br>
<br>
Well to make a long story short.<br>
<br>
Veil of Shadows was raiding Hate on the day I reserved.<br>
<br>
They killed a GOD because he was there with no regard for the calendar.  <br>
<br>
I was infact told by someone in Veil that they were not going to kill Inny which is the only reason I didn't start porting up Heroes that night saying it was our day to raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is the only way to kill a god to sneak into a plane the night before and Kill Steal him from another guild?<br>

What time is 4am for you? I just so happen to be on the pacific coast and I go by the server time, but most raids are scheduled to accommodate the east coast folks.  So if your saying it was 4am est, then that is only 1am pst.  That is barely over the 12pm get the hell out of the plane deadline.  (this isn't even a rule, just what most people go by).  Also I would bet they went up Saturday and not Sunday like you said, so the God is theirs.<br>
<br>
Basic rule on Gods.  If you are in the plane and the god is up, then that god is yours.  They went up, the god was there, that makes it theirs and not yours.<br>
<br>
I am getting very jaded with all the recent bickering over the calendar and I am leaning towards the thought that FFA on everything for a good month or two will help get everyone on the same page.  I think that this is a grey area that you should just shrug off and stop taking it personal.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Just wanted to add some more thoughts now that I read your post again.  You said, &quot;Is the only way to kill a god to sneak into a plane the night before and Kill Steal him from another guild?&quot;<br>
<br>
Couple questions I would like you to answer.<br>
1) How did they sneak into the plane?  If IB didn't take the God down, or raid the plane there is absolutely no reason someone else can't go up and do it.<br>
<br>
2) How did they Kill Steal from you?  IF IB had taken down the God in that plane for their scheduled raid, then would they have Kill Stole from you?<br>
<br>
3) Who led you to believe that Gods could be reserved?  Most everyone I know knows that if you reserve a plane for a specific date and the God is up, that God is yours.  If it is not up, better luck next time.<br>
<br>
Sorry to make this longer, but I figured I would ask some questions. <p><font color="green" size=+1 face="Arial">Pathfinder <A href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=1513">Uladar</a></Font><BR><font size=-1 face="Comic Sans MS" color="Navy">

The zone had repopped and was ready for our raid. I hope you got lot of great drops.  If IB had cancelled and you were there instead then that was lucky for you.  <br>
<br>
My problem is that you killed Inny, which I believe you did just 2 days before. So one God you kill back to back when there are many guilds that would like a chance to kill him. That to me is greedy and unfair. (Although that is a statement only about the one act. I KNOW that you are not a greedy person). My post is NOT to discredit you in anyway but to let you know your actions have hurt someone. <br>
<br>
Members of your guild even told me you were only killing Maestro so I did not distrust them (maybe that is an error on my part) Maybe they didn't really know and only &quot;thought&quot; that was the plan. I am not sure. <br>
<br>
I have not had a chance to killing Inny or CT in 4 months on any Heroes raid.  Ok maybe that is bad luck.<br>
<br>
It was 4am eastern time although the raid was not concluded at that time when I logged off.<br>
<br>
I sit back wondering how I am going to get to kill Inny or CT under the current rules or when he dies a few hours before I zone in.<br>

Air does not count because it takes more than a day to get anywhere.  For dragons, if your guild reserves a dragon, please make sure that you only have one active reservation for that dragon.<br>
<br>
If a plane is cancelled, you may reserve that plane.  However if that date is not within 48 hours, it counts as a reservation.  For example if January 25 POH raid was cancelled, anyone today may make reserve that date and it will not be counted against the 3 days.  If however, January 27th PoH raid is cancelled and you reserve it today, that counts as one of your 3 days.<br>

We did have a conflict of too many reservations so I cancelled 1 and clarified 1 date. Angelwind and I both thought we were suppose to make reservations in the guild. We discussed this matter and resolved over booking. We are not over booked following the rule of if a raid is canceled and you reserve within the 48 hour rule. So if we screwed up any on these sorry. Will try to do better in the future.<br>

There is a patch tomorrow and VoS has PoF reserved as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Last night... Our guild found out that hate was open and inny was up&quot;<br>
<br>
I hate to say it, but VoS is basically working within the loopholes of the calendar to get to Gods before other who also want the opportunity.<br>
<br>
1. First of all they have way more than 3 reservation on the calendar if anyone can count which violates any general consensus on calendar usuage.<br>
<br>
2. Booking planes only after finding out that a God will be available. Honestly would VoS be in either Hate or PoF if Cazic or Inny were not up for those last minute raids?<br>
<br>
Basically what I'm saying is that Gods are Free For All as VoS has demonstrated regardless on how they twist the calendar. If you really want a God then you better mobilize before any other group and flash post something on the calendar to justify your act with all the political BS for calendar users. Don't expect a God to be up even if groups on the calendar before you have said they won't touch a God.<br>
<br>
Yeah getting a God on a reservation is a crap shoot, but flash posting or raiding when you know a God is up is not. Doesn't really fall under plane reservations. More like God reservations which you can't reserve.<br>
<br>
Don't be surprised to see LoS in Fear tomorrow in Fear. We honor plane reservations, but Gods are Free For All and making a last minute plane reservation on a patch day isn't a plane reservation in my books. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulitli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Litli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/01 5:22:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=551.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question of raid policies</span><hr size=1> WE have some fubars in there I know for sure.

The reservation for Wednesday was posted on Monday, within the 48 hours - so I don't think there is anything wrong with that one.<br>
<br>
Edit: whoops, miscounted, they currently have 5 up, but one is cancelled, so they have four outstanding ones.  Another one needs to be cancelled<br>
<br>
DE has 4 on calendar, but one is cancelled<br>
<br>
Mily has 3 on calendar, but one is cancelled<br>

Apex has 1 day in Hate in hate and 4 days in Air - Air is on different rules<br>
