On a more serious note, I think Zatriz is done with his dragon raids for the time being.  With my time in EQ growing short with the impending arrival of DAoC, I am going to concentrate my efforts on my warrior, Mencar Pebblecrusher (some of you might recognize this name, and yes I am the original).  I'd like to see the other side of things, and actually see some of these monstrosities before they die.<br>
<br>
If things get really bad, feel free to call on Zatriz. <p><hr>

Congratulations FoF, Kommisar, Dominatra, Destava, Belce (for watching my back) and the CoG for proving what we are worth to Lady Vox.  We rocked and I really think we were making record time at one point.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to my group, Azketh, the lovely Judimar, Danoiele, Kavaran and Andellar.  You guys rocked and thanks for listening.  <br>
<br>
Please everyone watch for some future posts regarding raid discipline, responsibilities of a Group Leader and general co-operation to those are trying to get their job time.<br>

<br>
Well, overall I was very please by the raid.  I think it really proved what CoG can do.  While we did have a support group along for the ride, I believe most of it was still done by the 52 and under.  Due to my stance on support groups on our raids I wasnt originally planning on attending this raid as a raider but only as a porter and perhaps in a support role if things went bad.  Personally I'm glad Kommisar talked me out of that idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Talovar did mention that he turned down Valoran's help and I would like to thank him for the courage that must have taken, especially considering that we had to succeed this time or lost our spot on the rotation.  I think we proved what we can do and that we dont need a bunch of level 60's to hold our hands. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Things went very smoothly overall I think.  The only major problem I saw (I dont count the mess ups in the King room, that always seems to happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) was in the buff line.  Somewhere someone miscounted the number of buffs that were being given out and by the time they made it to me at the end of the line, some people had too many buffs on.  This caused several problems.  Cold and magic resistance are two of the most needed spells and having to stack people up while I dispelled them and hope I didnt dispell something important took up time and caused confusion.  Still, things did sort out in the end.  A note to the buffers tho.  I know this was the first time for many in the buff lines, but if your throwing junk buffs, only throw the ones you've been told to.  We have 16 spell slots for buffs and correctly done, each and every slot will be used.  There's no room for improvisation here.  If I need to dispell something and it turns out to be MR that tank might suddenly turn into a very pretty ornament under Vox's feet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also, unless your a cleric please dont pass up any buffs.  They are there for a reason.  Especially things like rune.  Yeah, its expensive but a) you paid for it already, and b) it might keep you alive that extra 10 seconds for an additional nuke or critical hit.  Also its one more spell Vox will need to dispell before getting to your Cold Resistance.  <br>
<br>
Also, in the chat room.  Please do not, and let me repeat this, do NOT spam the channels.  I know everyone is excited and wants to go in and kill.  But do not endanger the raid by spamming.  Considering one of the spammers was a guild officer I find that sort of unprofessional.  Only the raid commander and those they designate may give out instructions and tell people when to leave.  If you're not them, please be quiet.  I'm sure that you know what to do, but on CoG raids there are many newbies, for whom this might be their first large multi party raid.  They need that instruction and it needs to be clear.  <br>
<br>
But for the most part these were just minor problems.  Everyone still worked together and we got the job done.  Vox went down hard in under 5 minutes.  And even though we had some problems pulling corpses out of the pits I heard of very little complaining.  Especially from that bard that got stuck in the wall.  It took us something like 2 hours to rez her but to my knowlage she never complained about it.  That was the kind of patience we've been talking about.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Everyone, I and mean everyone, did a great job.  And I'm happy Kommisar talked me into attending.  It certainly made my week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
My first Vox raid was the night before and due to the holiday and a few other problems it just didnt happen.  In fact I spent part of the evening waiting for a res from the pits.  So last night was only the second time I stood before the Lady....and it totally rocked.  I had been somewhat jaded by the prior fail so it did me a world of good just to be there last night.<br>
<br>
Thank you to Dogedme for showing me the ropes of Pit CR.  I actually had a job I could do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and thanks to Celesial for being patient.

Also thanks to the big Ogre warrior whose named began with a K (sorry terrible with names lol) who won the Crystalline spear and then gave it to me.  All in all the night was a big success for me and I will be back.  <br>

I was hoping a rogue would get that spear.  That's an awesome rogue primary hand weapon.  I think the ogre's name was Kagaruck.  That's really cool that he gave it to you.  In my opinion the crystalline spear should only go to rogues.  Enjoy!<br>
<br>
My thanks to Kommisar and to everyone for making my last dragon raid a success.  At the beginning of the raid, I had just a half blue bubble left into 52, and I was worried that since my party was getting most of the IG kills, I would ding into 53 too soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
And yes, that was me putting on glamour with my Jaundiced Helm at the beginning (doh!).  I thought that there would be room for a pretty good level 39 (and thus harder to dispell) junk buff, but I had miscounted the buffs, and I'd like to apologize to Kommisar, Talovar, and Kellory for that.  <br>
<br>
Also, next time don't forget Talisman of Altuna!  That's an extra 250 hps, which would let tanks last one breath weapon or two claw attacks longer.  By the time I realized that no shaman had been assigned this buff, half of the raid party was done with buffs and it was too late.  In a couple months I will have Kragg, which is 450 hps or so.  Mmmmm, HP Goodness!<br>
