<br>
Our first event was a success, therefore, I would like to continue organizing these events in the future.  We will try for two events a month.  I would like to do PoF again, then after that hopefully move onto PoH. PoA may be quite awhile yet, I went their once and it's very tough (Eye balls hitting you for like 300, and it's pet for 120).  Also, PoA is probably more like a two day event then one.<br>
<br>
Here are the ideas I have, and would like some feedback.  However, before I do that, I would like to explain the goal of this event.  The idea behind this event is to allow all small guilds a chance to participate in planes, or non-guild members on Karana.  Basically any guild that is not capable of going to the planes by themselves.  I define this as, their guild has less then 24 members capable of entering any planes, and their guild doesn't frequently schedule plane events with KGC (Karana Guild Central).  Therefore giving everyone a chance on Karana to be able to go to the planes with having to join a big guild.<br>
<br>
Here are my ideas I have pertaining to future events:<br>
<br>
1) I would like Harbingers to continue co-sponsoring this event.  Managing the scheduling of this with KGC, helping me organize it, and helping manage the battle stragety to ensure a victorous assault.<br>
<br>
2) In the future I will request the presence of up to 45 people to join us, taking in consideration no shows, it should take us to good number of 28 to 36 people.  I hope to accomplish by the following means:<br>
<br>
- Request for a spot to be placed on Council of Karana for small guilds or single members to request to participate, I am choosing them because they contain the highest number of alliances of little guilds.  I don't want to maintain this several times on several boards.<br>
<br>
- The request to participate will be filled on a first come first serve basis.  Any names listed after the list fills up will be added to the next event.<br>
<br>
- The list will be cut off at 38 people.  The last 7 people will be recruited by any means necessary (even big guilds) to fill in the areas we are weak in.  Such as if only 2 clerics sign up out of the 38, I will actively pursue 4 more clerics to join us.<br>
<br>
3) The people in charge of this event will be Lirpa leader of Harbingers) and myself.  Lirpa and I will select any others, to help lead this event as we feel is necessary.  Such as last time, we selected Kexian to be the Battle Field Commander.<br>
<br>
4) When a Guild Leader, or officer signs up their guild to participate.  I need all the names and professions of the people they plan on having attend level is optional, keep in mind you must be level 46, I recommend level 47).  And I would like them to list if possible who definetely can make it, and who might be able to make it.  Scheduling for planes are done about a week in advance.<br>
<br>
5) If a lot of people drop out, I would like to know at least three days in advance, so I can make last minute re-scheduling.<br>
<br>
6) Optionally, depending on your feedback, we can do a standby list for the day of the event.  I won't turn anyone down if they have been invited.  However, if we have a lot of no shows, we don't want to be short on people.  So a standby list, would be if people don't show up, we will ask you to join in.  However, because it is a standby, that means if everyone shows up we would have to turn down those on the standby list.  I just hate to have someone standing in Ferrott for an hour, and then we say we don't need you.  However, if the majority would like to do a standby list in addition to the normal list, I will do it.<br>
<br>
7) If I missed anything please feel free to comment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Treasure rules:<br>
<br>
1) It will be lottoed for the class(es) that can use the item.<br>
<br>
2) Number rolls will be between 1 and 200, ties will reroll.<br>
<br>
3) Upon winning a lottery, you will be out of future lottos, until everyone in your class has obtained an item.  Once everyone has obtained an item, everyone will lotto for the next item, and then they are out again upon winning.  (repeat).<br>
<br>
4) Members that arrive late, which is after we break the planes, will sit out of the first lotto for their class.  This is intented to discourage arrive at anytime.  We need the most people for when we are breaking in.  Also so we are fair to the members that have been with us the whole time.  Afterall, if a paladin comes in 4 hours late, paladin boots drop, and the paladin that just arrives wins them, it's not too fair to the other paladins that have been their all day.<br>
<br>
If you happen to be late, don't let this discourage you from showing up all together.  You may say, &quot;Well I have to sit out of the first lotto, so I probably won't get anything anyways.&quot;  Well this isn't necessarily true.  I been to plane trips and seen 8 things drop for SK one time, then next time nothing drop for SK's.  It's completely random.  The last event we had one warrior that was late, but he got the item because only one other warrior, and he had the item already.<br>
<br>
5) If you win a lottery, you cannot log on as another character and have the other character obtain the item.  Only those that are present can win.<br>
<br>
Exceptions to the rules:<br>
<br>
If during the event someone leaves, and requires us to try and recruit someone out of necessity.  That person will not be considered late because he/she was just invited and will immediately be able to participate in lottos.<br>
<br>
If someone logs on as another character to help out out of necessity) such as last time a druid left to get out a warrior because we had none.  That person may choose to participate in Druid lottos instead of warrior lottos.  In which case will allow him, if he wins to log out and get the item with his other character.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, I think that covers all the basis.  I definetely would like some feedback on this before Wednesday of this week.   Because Thursday is the day to signup for the planes for the following week. <br>

<br>
I think this is an EXCELLENT idea. :-)<br>
<br>
Until such time as the Karana Council of Guilds can get it's own spot in the planes rotation (and I think we are about a month or more away from having this coordination and amount of level 46+ people), attaching the CoG guilds to the Harbingers/Watchmen raids are a perfect fit. Your goals of letting anyone get into a plane raid are right in line with ours (and with the spirit of our mixer hunt events). Here's what I will do to facilitate this.<br>
<br>
1) I'm moving this thread to a new forum that I will create, called CoG Planes Raid Schedule. Lirpa and yourself will schedule these raids with the KGC (as you are already in the rotation, this makes the most sense). You will then post the raid in the forum (and as always try to give me the most advance notice on this as possible). If I can, I'll advertise each raid on the CoG site. <br>
2) Once we've got the above mentioned Forum together, and you've posted the date and time of the next plane raid, I'll announce the presence of this forum on all the major EQ sites. This will bring in a TON of people (and since you are signing up on a first come first serve basis up until a certain number, I'll make sure to mention that), and it will also bring in people that are NOT either: <br>
a) In the KGC<br>
b) In the CoG<br>
c) Allied or affiliated with either of the above<br>
d) are not in a guild<br>
<br>
3) This will also make people aware of the need to schedule events like this in advance, not only because of the tremendous organization required to pull it off, but also the special needs of breaking into the zones. <br>
<br>
I think your looting rules are equitable, fair and also in line with the Council's loot rules on mixer hunts. <br>
<br>
Thanks Zellex, this will make the CoG's job that much easier. <br>

<br>
I really do think scheduling another plane raid again so soon is a bad idea.  Skipping a week in between weekend days is mandatory for the KGC but that mostly pertains to guilds/alliances who schedule week days regularly as well.  I believe there are around 20 guilds trying to share the planes now, and there are only 2 weekend days per week.  It's in the interest of fairness to them that I proposed we wait 3 weeks for another weekend day.<br>
<br>
Just a little background about me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I recently left a very large guild.  We often scheduled two planes a week (I was the person scheduling the raids for them).  I spent several months in hyper drive planning, organizing and leading plane raids and I'm a little sick of it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     One of the reasons I started Harbingers was to get back to basics and get away from the large raids which tax your patience.

Although I'm not leading these, here's what I'd say:<br>
<br>
I'd say NO for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1)Most Planar items are NO DROP, so it can't be done.<br>
<br>
2) Doing this generally rubs people the wrong way. I've seen guilds torn down because of planar looting rules issues that allowed this sort of thing. It's easier, and generally fair imho to not allow this.  If you wish to trade items that's fine...but no re-rolling once you've won.<br>
