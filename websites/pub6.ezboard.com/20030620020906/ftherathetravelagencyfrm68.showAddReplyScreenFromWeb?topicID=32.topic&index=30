Yes, the far right is protecting us all, lol. Since when is &quot;protecting us&quot; equivalent to advocating the removal of rights like freedom of speech? Equivalent to forcing religion in schools? Equivalent to forcing their &quot;morality&quot; based on religious doctrine onto everyone else regardless if those individuals even believe in their religion? Equivalent to being paranoid sociopaths that blame all their children's behavior on &quot;evil influences&quot;? The right wing is full of rich boys obsessed with keeping their rich boy toys, ex-military officers that were too fucking stupid to get promoted further and thus were discharged after continually being passed over for promotion (that's right, the makority of those &quot;military experts&quot; you see on Fox and CNN that had the rank of lt. colonel were losers that were honorably discharged after being passed over for promotion one too many times, as in the U.S. military, you can only be up for rank promotion a specific number of times, after which you must be discharged, its how they prevent the hierarchy from becoming too top-heavy), full of a bunch of middle-class fucks that have been brainwashed by the conservative ideology which tries and make it seem like right wing conservatives are trying to save them money, when the reality is those middle to upper middle class are getting no better tax representation than the lower classes from these fucks, full of a bunch of super-religious fucks that think if they bend over and grease up for the republicans long enough, they'll get their religion shoved down the throat of the rest of the country.<br>
<br>
Left wing liberals are naive idealists sucking their own party line dick, but they at least don't fucking scare the shit out of me. Right wing fucks try over and over to take away the rights specifically reserved for the citizens in the Bill of Rights, and so you can take your &quot;us right wingers are fighting for you&quot; bullshit and shove it up a diseased armadillos ass for what its worth. You are fighting for YOUR MORALITY, you are not fighting to protect anyone's fucking freedoms.<br>
<br>
What is international law? International law is the agreements between states, the treaties they have signed with each other. The UN is an international body that has been *given* - by its member nations - the power to mediate between nations, and the power to forcibly intercede on behalf of the member states with specific member states that are breaking the basic charter rules (UNESCO statement on human rights, for example). In order to keep ultimate power with the sovereign states, actions must be approved my the security council in order to authorize action by the UN.<br>
<br>
That is fucking international law.<br>
<br>
That is what Bush and co. is throwing out the fucking window.<br>
<br>
That is what the fucking problem is.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with fucking Saddam Hussein or any claim of his he isn't going after X weapon. The authority that member nations of the UN have given up to the UN in order to prevent the breakout of another fucking third world war has been fucked with, and as such, there is the fucking precedent of telling the UN to fuck itself. You think China is going to respond to UN action anymore? Do you think Russia is? Any fucking nation with the economic and military power to weather going against such resolutions will do so all the fucking time now.<br>
<br>
Its about biting off our nose to spite our face. The UN was a tool the US used to get what it wanted the majority of the time without having to start a tariff war, get its citizens harassed in foreign states, without having to send its troops everywhere all the fucking time.<br>
<br>
The resolution being cited as authority by the US states simply that Iraq must disarm or that there will be &quot;serious consequences&quot;. That's fucking it. If anyone here can fucking tell me &quot;serious consequences&quot; means forcible removal of the government of a sovereign nation with military action, you are either fucking deluded or a moron.<br>
<br>
Let me do a little logic exercise. No one has presented any evidence that Iraq has WMD. Only a few banned non-WMD weapons had been found (and they were borderline anyway), and they were being destroyed at the time of the invasion. If Bush and co had inviolate proof that Iraq still had these weapons, why didn't they give us that proof? They claimed for the last 18 months that they had that proof, and on at least 3 separate occasions claimed they would show that proof to the UN (once by Bush, once by Blair, once by Powell), and they proceeded to NOT DO SO. So, if you killed someone and went to prison, got out on parole, and then were arrested a year later, and all that was brought against you was, &quot;In the past you have broken the law by murdering someone, now you have to prove you didn't murder someone since then or you will go to prison&quot; what would you fucking think?<br>
<br>
The US will not fucking rebuild Iraq. They won't rebuild Afghanistan. There is no fucking incentive. Oil? Nope. Sure, Cheney is making sure his butt buddies get a few billion on the deal, but this war was never about oil. Its about fucking politics. It is a short sighted unjustified war.<br>
<br>
I'm a fucking patriot. I'm fucking standing up for the constitution and the premises of government contained therewithin. Do I walk around making qualifications about those rights like right wing fucks? Hell no! Do I fucking trample those ethics that we claim sets our form of government apart in dealing with international crises and then saying, &quot;might makes right! fuck off pussies!&quot;? Hell no! You take the fucking good with the bad if you want to keep those rights and keep those protections.<br>
<br>

<br>
How many resolutions were passed by the UN against Saddam and they were never enforced?  To all appearances, Saddam wasn't given the spanking he deserved because he was sitting on a huge ocean of oil.  Human rights violations were being committed daily by him, and no one did anything because it acted against their economic benefits.  To enforce the UN resolutions, several countries would have to act against their personal interests, which it seemed they and Germany and Russia didn't want to do.  Still, the majority of the UN countries were backing the US - it was the ones with economic interests in Iraq which were the ones vehemently against any military action against Saddam.  <br>
<br>
What exactly did the US get out of this?  Oil?  The US could have had that in 1991.  The US doesn't buy much at all of their oil from Iraq, anyway.  Political strength?  Russia, France and Germany allied against the US, so guess not.  Military strength?  I don't see how.  Will it alone get Bush elected for a second term?  It didn't for his dad.  Economic strength?  There might be some money gained back for some American companies in the reconstruction, but weighed against the cost that's gone into the sanctions against Saddam and the war itself, surely it will be marginal.<br>
<br>
The US gets nothing but the safety of American lives, the gratification of seeing Iraqi people dance on Saddam's head, and the seeds of a democracy in what was previously an anti-American state.  Oh yes, those are horribly wicked goals indeed.  <br>
<br>
Your vitriol should be saved for those people who commit true atrocities.  The evil of Saddam was magnitudes greater than anything of which you've accused the coalition.  I hate to use the word evil, it's so melodramatic.  But after seeing the list of what Saddam has done or condoned, it's hard to apply any other word. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frapparatea>frapparatea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 12:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pfft</span><hr size=1> ya, you're right.

When the direct product or even byproduct of a war or agenda means fewer people die over time, a tyrant is ousted or dead, torture is ended or minimized, and a population is more free than their culture has experienced for generations...  For many folks that's enough 'justification.'<br>
<br>
People against the war are saying this isn't &quot;liberation.&quot;  Then what is it?<br>
<br>
It sure isn't slavery.<br>
<br>
It sure isn't opression.<br>
<br>
It's the grip of a tyrannical man being broken.<br>
<br>
Abaz, you insinuate your patriotism is greater than the right and the left both?<br>

<br>
That 'they' you're talking about....  Should that not be 'us', the United States, your home where Milesburg, PA resides?  Your statements and self-removal from 'them' (The United States) is far from patriotic.  <br>
<br>
Aren't you doing exactly what you're preaching about; by classifying yourself as above both the right and the left?  You are criticizing the patriotism of folks being of a political ideal you don't approve of; yet you separate yourself from the United States when things aren't as you think they should be?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Abaz, but to me your post cried nothing more than hypocrisies and self-gratification at feeling above two political ideals you obviously (as you stated) detest.<br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer in the Constitution of the United States, but if we didn't have two drastically opposing political parties I don't think the values of the constitution would be realistic in our daily lives.  The left enforces some of those constitutional values, the right enforces some of those constitutional values.  Combined those values make the United States of America which, despite your opinion, upholds and believes in all values of the Constitution of which we as a country were created. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thegeekhost.com/musician1993/Nov02.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74894" target="top">Gwenwyvar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> ~ <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.frayedknot.net" target="top">Frayed Knot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abazagaroth>Abazagaroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/images/webring.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pfft</span><hr size=1> No, &quot;they&quot; as in the U.S. government.<br>

What makes you think that everyone who believes that the war in Iraq was justified and a good thing is a right wing extremist trying to shove religion down your throat?<br>
<br>
I think you have a lot of anger stemming from something to do with religion. Did you get fucked by a priest as a child? I wouldn't doubt it.<br>
<br>
Thing is, the bastard was ordering the murder of innocents. In my book that is grounds for an ass kicking no matter how big your guns are. <br>
<br>
As for the other tyrant leaders in the world today, they';re on the list too, but hey if someone put five cages in front of you and said open the doors and free the monkeys inside, but yo if you open the one in the middle first I'll give you $2000.00. I bet you would open the one in the middle first. It's not rocket science.<br>
<br>
Not everyone bases their morality on religeon. I happen to think religeon is all bull-shit, but I know for a fact that the morals that are written in religeous texts stem from human feelings about what should and should not be the proper treatment of your fellow human beings.<br>
Something I am sure you aren't familiar with judging by your willingness to step on someone's neck.<br>
<br>
You are a worthless waste of human skin, if you like your freedom so much I know about 800 miles of ocean that you can occupy. It's lawless and free and you can do whatever the fuck you want there, should be right up your alley.<br>

Are you in the CIA? Do you work at the NSA? Are you a top official anywhere, for any government? No? Then what the flying fuck do you need with any of that information?

Do you think that if they reveal the information and how they got it that the people who gave them that information will just be forgiven in Iraq? Let go to freely come to the USA? No they would be beaten, electrocuted, stabbed, then shot in the head and then buried upside down in a shallow unmarked grave. It is people like you who get people killed, in the police and in the intelligence agencies. Before you go talking about how unjustified it is to spy on people even if they are doing evil evil things. Imagine your wife, and how pretty she is, how much you love her. Now imagine her dead because of a bombing by terrorist financed by Saddam or anyone else for that matter, or raped and murdered by some freaked out Meth freak all because your privacy might or might not have been infringed on by the government you seem to hate so much and the laws where changed.

It does not matter how many facts you put in front of him, or how many smoking guns you show him. He is one of the sad few out there that hangs on to blind pride in his ideas, and cannot fathom that he might be wrong. So give up on it, he is locked in a box and cant think outside of it.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the UN and its &quot;laws&quot;. The UN ran into a major problem recently. 3 major powers of the UN saw that one of its laws were going to cost their countries Billions of dollars. Therefore they rallied under a flag of peace in order to save themselves from losing that money. <br>
<br>
The U.S. may or may not have had a valid reason in screaming about the WMD's, but either way, Iraq was making the UN look like the biggest chumps in the world. He constantly laughed in the UN's face. He disobeyed the UN's &quot;laws&quot; daily, and flaunted it. <br>
<br>
Abaz asks why China and others would follow the UN laws now that America attacked. <br>
I ask why would China follow the laws of a UN that is afraid to enforce its laws? Why? Because there are some members of the UN that WILL take extra steps to enforce them. The U.S, Britain, Italy, Austrailia, Bulgaria, Spain, and many many more countries stood up and said &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; I dont understand how people think that the U.S. and Britain are acting like lone warriors. Over half the world's nations are supporting this action by either words, money, food, medical supplies, or troops!!! And I dare ya to take a look at many of the nations that are not in support. Like France, Germany, and Russia....all of who are losing billions of dollars due to the fall of Saddam. Greed, that is what the problem has been all along......pure greed.<br>
<br>
So let the Abaz's around the world scream injustice with their limited concepts of world affairs, they are the minority in this situation. They are the same people you see at all the demonstrations. The same people that roam around talking the same talk, no matter what. (Hell, all Abaz can talk about is that ONE tank that helped pull down the ONE statue, at request of the civilians mind you. Yet you would think we have our tanks roaming Iraq, ignoring the enemy, looking for statues to pull down.) LOL Limited vision in its prime! <br>
<br>
Some people are like that, but that is what is great about free nations, they can be that way, and they can make it public. And those of us in uniform will wake up tomorrow, put on that uniform, and go and protect all the Abaz's of the free world so that they can continue to think &quot;In the box&quot;. (Keep in mind I am referring to more than just U.S. military there. I am also referring to our friends of many free nations that stand for a moral belief and stand strong in it)<br>
