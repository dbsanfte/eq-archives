After that we have 4 Generals and Colonels that can also make fairly strong statements about what the rules of the guild are, but seldom do.  Next we have the Officers.  About 1/4 of the guild are officers.  In this we have House Elders.  The leader of each house (Class) that is responsible for helping build the toons of that class.  This done by working epics, helping find the next good armor piece or weapon upgrade etc. (I am House Elder for the House of Death - Necromancers).  We have Raid leaders who are tasked with building Raid Events.  We have a &quot;Force Recon&quot; that is tasked with going to new zones and learning the layout and being able to provide scouting information on a zone.<br>
<br>
We do not charge a Guild Tax, but do ask for donations (Peridots looted are usually put in the guild bank for raids for example and some raids are for guildbank cash exclusively).<br>
<br>
We are 65 % Family 35% raid at this time.<br>
<br>
So that said....  What is your base structure?  Do you have a &quot;Tax&quot;.  I want to see how others are organized and debate a bit of pros and cons of each structure.<br>

In fact, there is so much spare cash floating around sometimes, you just don't have anything to do with it all.  You hand out 50k to each cleric every so often to buy dots, and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
When you get good droppable items that nobody needs, have a guild designated banker sell the items for platinum profit, and put the money in the guildbank.  use that money to buy raid supplies.<br>
<br>
It's wierd how Everquest works.  individuals and guilds are either on the &quot;poor as hell and can't buy a stack of dots&quot; line or the &quot;so rich we could not run out of raid supplies if we purposefully tried&quot; side of the line.<br>
<br>
Wait...thats not really wierd...its kinda like real life.<br>
<br>
So anyway...<br>
<br>
No taxes in most guilds.  Most guilds have a guild leader, and a few officers that sometimes double as raid leaders/recruiters. <p><P><br>

For the &quot;information Gathering&quot; part for some reason they picked me to do that.  I guess I am just sneaky or people trust me but for the two Court Martials they dragged me into the fact finder role.  We have not needed this to be formal yet.  We have only had a couple issues withoutsiders causing us crap and we tend to take care of that IMEMDIATELY in game.  Some picks on a lowbie they have 5 officers around them in minutes taking &quot;care&quot; of the situation.  Beyond issues with Necrobabe and Waango most of you dealings have been positive lately.  Even in a potentially contensious issue last night with another guild crashing our Paul Caverns camp we just sat down and worked it out.  They were PLing a LOW toon (Don't people understand that being PL'd means your skills SUCK and you fizzle and miss on attacks????)  But we wroked it out, gave them a tent and a side pop to keep and we had plenty for our full group to deal with.  An unguilded toon in our group got pissy and left.  He did not like it that we were talking to the other people.  Glad he left.  A bard trying to tank with a Pally and SK there was stupid and he was a &quot;bleeder&quot; for the cleric to deal with.  At least the ranger stayed back used arrows and came in after agro was built.  Smart player.  Smart Chanter too.  Good group.

We have no required tax.  If we require something, like items for bane weapons or components for a key quest, then we sometimes have events to obtain these items.  Items that are in the bank for a long period of time get sold in the bazaar.  We encourage people to help out fellow guildmembers and to contribute as much to the guild as they can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dennin>Dennin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dallow Abligo - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/29/03 2:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1106.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild Organization - What format do you have?</span><hr size=1> Well, our is real short and simple.

The entire guild always has a say.. so all ideas are given hearing, but it comes down to the GL and officers to make it rule.  As for a tax, we don't have any.  However, all raids we do, all gems, cash, and &quot;vendor loot&quot; goes to our guild bank (GL has a toon set aside for just this).  Doing it that way, we have always been able to affor dot's, pearls, air and hate stones.  All loot is NBG, and always goes to people that attended...if no one needs then we sell for guild <p>You go ahead of me, we let you die.<br>

In the past when the guild has gone through growth spurts and periods when we were raiding a lot, we have had 2 and even at one time 3 active Leaders.<br>
1 primarily responsible for 46+ level folks and their activities and 1 primarily for the low end folks and the third acted as mediary in the event that the leadership needed to make a policy decision.<br>
<br>
Active officers<br>
<br>
Raid Coordinator<br>
<br>
Treasurer<br>
<br>
Web master<br>
<br>
Judiciary officer - appointed as needed<br>
<br>
Inactive retired officers generally keep officer tag as long as they are playing and are treated with respect for their period of service as an active officer. We also generally allow them to resume active officer status as long as they make an effort to catch up on current guild status.<br>
<br>
We generally speaking do not split loot on raids, it all goes to the guild bank except for no drop items or items which could immediately benefit some deserving individual NBG. <br>
On occasion preannounced we also occasionally split loot with raid party, after expenses, such as dots and port components.<br>
<br>
Our structure over the years has remained pretty flexible. Because we have at times had as many as over 100 active members total roster over 300 and as few as 9 active when I agreed to be guild leader.<br>
Obviously when I had 9 active members our officer needs were different from when we decided to create a raiding guild apart from the main guild. At that point we had over 100 active members with 40 of them planable. At that point I decided we needed that third Leader tag.<br>
<br>
Flexibility has kep our lil family style guild alive, through loss due to poaching, seasonal slow downs, new games, and drama queens. <p>Shariona  56 Cleric  Circle of Virtue<br>
