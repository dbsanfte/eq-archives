<br>
   It's a common misconception though since E-4 through E-6 (about as high as most enlisted men go, and where most spend thier time) in both the Corps and Army have the same rank structure.  Lower however, Army Privates are E-1's and E-2's.  PFC's in the Corps are E-2's and PFC's in the Army are actually an E-3, same as a Lance Corporal.  Corps E-4's are Corporals as well.  I don't think the Corps has Specialists, but I could be wrong.  <br>
<br>
   NCO ranks start at Sergeant (E-5 for the core and Army, where you usually run a squad of 10-20 guys) though, unless you're in the Navy (E-4 CPO 3rd class). The NCO ranks get confusing at E-5 too, since a Staff Sergeant in the Air Force is an E-5, but Staff Sergeants in the Army and Marines are E-6.  Air Force are sort of one step behind for whatever reason.  Then you get to E-8's, which is where it gets even worse because it's all dependant on what exactly your purpose is.  For instance in the Army as an E-8, you're either a Master Sergeant or a First Sergeant depending on what size unit you run, and what that unit's responsibility is.  <br>
<br>
   There's 3 E-9's for Army, Navy and Marines, and 4 E-9 positions for the Air Force, all job dependant, one being the Command position of which there is only 1 for each branch.  <br>
<br>
  Another interesting thing for people not up on the Air Force is that E-7 E-8 and E-9 can all be a &quot;First Sergeant&quot; just different amounts of stripes and levels of responsibility.  <br>

<br>
In the Army their are 2 types of E4's. Specilist, which are the vast majority of E4's...and Corporals, which arn't near as common. However, Corporals are still considered NCO's in the Army. It's potentally one of the worst ranks to be in tho...if they need a soldier they pick you...if they need a NCO they pick you. <br>
<br>
And there are thousands of Sargent Major's(E9) out there. Their is, however, only one Sargent Major of the Army.<br>
<br>
What confuses me the most thos is the Navy rank. Everyone else uses chevrons and rockers(stripes). The Navy, however, uses something totally weird...after E7 they start using anchors on their lapells. I've broken down and started saluting just about every Navy I've come across because I can't tell if they are officer or enlisted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordmaldian>LordMaldian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 12:10:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1145.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://userpages.prexar.com/marsroy/Brenda/deathav.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Stupid POS Con Artist</span><hr size=1> Sigh...

Codean, the way to determine the rank of a Chief is simply count the stars on his anchor. If you see a Chief wearing 3 Stars on his anchor your talking to the God of sailors, Master Chief of the Navy<br>
Of course the fact that as your approaching that damn anchor is so small might as well salute to stay on the safe side incase it's a Lt. Commander which is the only other Ranked officer to have gold on his Lapels. All others insiginias are silver.<br>

NCO's and Staff NCO's can put in for the warrant officer package. The President has final approval on the package and signs off on them. Hence they get &quot;bulldog&quot; promoted. I had a Staff Sergeant that was promoted to CWO-1 when I was stationed at OCS. Shortly following that I recieved my silver dollar.<br>
<br>
BTW after the candidates gradutated and then went to be commisioned, I would stand outside saluting the entire time they walked out. Boy did I become rich for a short while. We would go take the silver dollars and cash them in for beer runs. Was so much fun. <br>
<br>
Another thing about OCS that I enjoyed was at the end of every cycle, we would change the washers and dryers out of the candidates barracks. We would drop them from the 3rd floor on the ground outside and rack up on loose change that fell out of them. It was like dropping a slot machine. Damn I had so much fun.

<br>
E-8 Master Sergeant if your admin, but if your in charge of the company on the enlisted side then...<br>
E-8 First Sergeant<br>
<br>
E-9s have three different titles,  ones for just admin, the other for in charge of unit, and other is for in charge of army<br>
<br>
E-9  Sergeant Major = admin and others<br>
E-9  Command Sergeant Major<br>
E-9  Command Sergeant Major of the Army.<br>

and who really cares about what the officer structure is =)<br>

<br>
1)  There are CWO5's in the Marine Corps (OLD CRUSTY BASTARDS)<br>
2)  The Commandant of the Marine Corps and Assistant Commandant are the only O-10 (General) billets currently permanently allotted to the USMC.  There are other Marine O-10's currently serving on active duty, particulary, Genereal Peter Pace (Director of Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and General James Jones (since giving up his post as CMC has taken over as EUCOM commander)  frequently Marine  Generals will be promoted to O-10 to take over the &quot;CINC&quot; jobs like CentCom, PaCom, or SouthCom.<br>
3)  and finally, the Marine Corps recognizes all Marines at the rank of E-4 as NCO's.<br>
    E4-E5 = NCO<br>
    E6-E9 = Staff NCO<br>
<br>
Hope this clears up any questions.<br>

I still wish the damn candidates that graduate would realize that we don't owe them a damn salute till they are commisioned..... then again.... they never got a salute from me after I collected that silver dollar. Hell... just because they go to college and get a degreee then jump into an officer billet doesn't make them high and almighty. When they get Captain... then I will salute them.<br>
<br>
Can you tell I used to get my ass chewed for not saluting? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I didn't salute lieutenats either unless I didn't have the 5-10 minutes to waste smirking while they tried to tell me that I was required to salute them because it was in the rules.   In some ways the military was to much fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
