And very mature aswell. Hard words from a little man...<br>
When we heard about you trying to kite him off us (if you would I'm sure we would have stopped and called victory to you) we formed 3 groups and I was with only 2 others in one group, due to the fact some people were already beating on the turtle, so I told the groupleader we needed more, to increase the possibility to get the kill. Nothing else. <br>
Maybe you should get some more information about the situation before you make a stupid post like this. <br>
Man you are embarrising yourself. <br>
<br>
I will quote myself as an answer for your loot question Stalkin:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fitz - you had no right at all to get the loot so why should we be happy about the loot?<br>
You win $1.000.000 and I steal your ticket to the treasure. I give you 100.000 because I want to be nice.. Do I expect you to be happy about this? Yes, if I were a moron!&quot; <p><font color=#345618>

You had 3<br>

You guys didnt KS it when we were pulling/kiting, u KS'ed us when we had 12 people beating on the mob.<br>

And most likely VERY high on the Hate list, from all the tug o war going on, trying to pull it to the KEG camp.. Notice i said PULL and NOT KITE.<br>
<br>
You played Tug o war, with keg pullers while they were trying to pull the turtle, to the groups waiting to kill him, while you kited him, to buy you time to get more people there.  Due to the tashes, and whatever bards do to aggro mobs, snares put them high on the hate list, thus when your no taunting groups attacked it, the keg pullers got the kill.<br>
<br>
<br>
I suggest next time not getting in a tug o war with the turtle.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIP FOR THE NOOBS:  Taunt raises your position on the hate list.<br>

Step in Mareth if you want to..<br>
<br>
Ignorance is a bad thing. You guys need to get your facts straight and till you do please just STFU with the flames. Your pissing me off with your petty lies and bad attitudes after I have tried to be nice about this whole thing. I said 6 or 7 times to your leader there to talk to Krieger so we could settle this, I tried hard to make things all good. I won't do it again after seeing what I get back.<br>
<br>
One post you sayd &quot;Autumnmoon was killed by the turtle&quot;, I post she was killed by your mobs you trained, then you say &quot;Ok she was killed by mobs but you trained them, now here is where I said &quot;Gee, yea this is how I did that, I ran all over Iceclad grabbing giants while Lodizals corpse was sitting there and ran them back to kill my own guild member and then I bent down to loot the mob cause I am so fast&quot; oh then this is where you say &quot;No you trained those when we were pulling the turtle&quot;, then I say &quot;No how could I train giants, wolfs, and the other things when I was in the water the whole time till we pulled it up on shore 30 feet&quot;..<br>
<br>
Comeon get your stories straight people. Tell one story not 5 of them. Also don't make things up IE:<br>
<br>
1Autumnmoon getting killed by the turtle cause she nuked so hard, she never did get killed by Lodizal. She got killed cause you trained her.<br>
<br>
2)Another was training Autumnmoon and myself and killing her and then stopping long enough to loot the corpse&quot; That makes alot of sense, no really it does. You can ask anyone in my guild, After we kill trak I run down to the flag room, DA and pull everything onto us and then I loot the corpse of trak. Its like a victory dance for me or something.<br>
<br>
3)Also you say &quot;Vashon didn't tell about a shell, then a few post later you say &quot;Vashon told me about the shell&quot;. WTF? Once again you telling different stories. <br>
<br>
4)You say we said &quot;We admit we KS'd you&quot; wtf? When did I say that? Even the guide said &quot;Well they say you said you did&quot; Don't put words in my mouth, even the guide was wondering why that was said by you if I never said it.<br>
<br>
I asked Krieger if we could give you guys loot because how screwed up the situation was IE (Your puller says you had first, Ours was saying we did, Your puller says they were kiting it for 30 mins, When we got their there was only him and one other Raging fury and we were ready to kill and so on.)<br>
<br>
I was on the damn turtle from the time we got the exp to the time where I stood up and Cathan looted the 2nd pair of boots and at that whole time. You say &quot;We engaged first, sorry your wrong I attacked the damn thing as soon as it was pulled off me on the shoreline&quot; So if you told that to a GM they would say &quot;SO you tried to KS from him and your upset? Sorry I can't help you&quot;. I didn't /petition to complain about being trained with mobs while on the corpse. I did /report a few of those tells/shouts/says calling me every obsense name you could think of cause that was uncalled for.<br>
<br>
As for you Eberan, you gave me countless tells saying &quot;Gimmie the shell, Multiquest the map with me&quot;, Well your person in charge their agreed on a split of loot and he didn't seem to mind getting what you got and we kept the map and shell. Also about multiquesting the map, err go read your spoiler again cause you can't do that. Whoever loots it has to do the quest. <p><EMBED src="http://www.geocities.com/vashon_freaq/vashon.swf" loop=false quality=high bgcolor=#000000  WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=135 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvashon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vashon</A> at: 2/26/01 11:12:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushyenkur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shyenkur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/26/01 11:17:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: People like you make me sick</span><hr size=1> Bwahahahah, 3 keg got the kill over 12 raging fury, that is soo hilarious....who feels stupid now?<br>

Its quite obvious to me that KEG dosnt give a shit about this whole situation, and that they see it as resolved since they bought us off with some crap loot.<br>

&quot;Vashon do not pull that BS on us that we tried to train you. You 3 came with the giants, wolves etc and we can all see here why your druid died. So don't say we trained you because we didn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Oh yea thats right, I found the giants out taking a dipping in the middle of the Ocean and decieded to pull them too. err wait giants or wolves don't path out there to pull from there. And I sure didn't go running off leaving the loot on the corpse for me to go pull mobs onto myself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our wizard kited it for maybe 30 mins before we got there.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Verant does not notice kiting as engaged, You were stalling for 30 mins while we were ready and trying to pull him in.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you were, but as you say by yourself (look at your Lodziak poll on your message board) if you don't engage it's FFA and when someone engage, show some friggin respect.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Why you think he was summoning right after coming out of the water? Cause I was hitting him and doing dmg. Therefor I was engaged.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;But as far as I know, we pulled, we engaged and we got KSed. If she didn't use memblur how did you manage to get the kill? There is no other way, and I believe memblur is anysort of exploit, and can probably.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- As far as I know, We pulled, you pulled off our puller and kited, I engaged, your wizard got summoned, I got kill. I don't know how we got the kill, maybe verant screwing up and giving bards duel wield of a warrior instead of defense like they said made me a mad damage machine (Ok, no more dreaming there). Exploit? Don't go toss that word around when it was not done.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you give us loot if you didn't felt like you KSed?&quot;<br>
<br>
-- I asked Krieger to work a deal cause I felt there was a big misunderstanding to &quot;WHO&quot; was pulling first and who really was entitled to the loot. I asked him to do some kind of split of the loots.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you bother to even discuss it if you didn't KS?&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Discuss what? Why did we discuss giving you items? cause like I said &quot;I felt there was a big mixup on who had it first and both sides were fighting with the idea of &quot;I am trying to prevent the others from KS'ing me&quot;. I attacked cause from what I knew, you were trying to KS us cause you pulled off our puller. You attacked cause you felt we were KS'ing you and that WE pulled off your puller. Like the guide said &quot;It was a big communication problem and nobody really is at fault for it, we both fought thinking the other party there was KS'ing us&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know alot of people that's getting tired of KEGs BS, maybe you should concern about your reputation or start to dig your own grave.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Wtf is that suppose to mean? I have always had good things said to me and I get along with most everyone I have met in this game. We have stepped down from mobs many times when there was 2 or more parties there when we knew we were out numbered or we were beat.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
To Neroes:<br>
<br>
1) If you ague kiting is engaging, Faiar did this first (KEG tried to pull it off him with no luck)<br>
<br>
-- Once again, from the previous times we were KS'd I can tell you this &quot;GM's do NOT consider kiting a mob as engaged in any way, shape, or form. I was the first person to attack him and thats is hard facts. I engaged so realize if you had killed it I could easily say &quot;I was KS'd from&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) If you ague engaging is like making damage to the mob… why would Faiar be summoned and killed as the first to go down, if he did not make any damage to the turtle? (at the time he died we where all engaging the turtle)<br>
<br>
-- Let me explain this one. Faiar was using his staff that cast a weak version of mage malosi that is called lesser elements. When you spam a mob with that it really pisses them off and wizards know this. I was hitting Lodizal just as we came out of the water and Faiar pulled him off me, in turn Lodizal then summoned the wizard that was spamming him with the lesser elements. Any wizard should be smart enough to know you don't nuke a summoning mob if you are pulling it cause it will then summon you and eat you alive. He never nuked it mid-pull but I did attack it once we hit the shore which means I was the &quot;First&quot; person to engage Lodizal but Faiar was higher on the hate list with his staff spamming. That explains that.<br>
<br>
Break down of that..<br>
<br>
A) Faiar spams him with stick to pull him off me once we hit shore.<br>
<br>
B) I attack and engaged him<br>
<br>
C) Faiar still keeps spamming him and gets summoned<br>
<br>
D) 2 groups of your peeps come charging in and attack when &quot;I&quot; was the only person attacking him<br>
<br>
E) I get kill, you then say &quot;We engaged first and called me obsense names&quot;<br>
<br>
Hope that clears that up.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) KEG did not get set up before we did, I think it all happened at about the same time, we just got set up at the Dragon bridge, as most of the ppl where coming in from EW. At the time I arrived to Iceglade, with 3 other members from RF, there where still only 4 or 5 ppl from KEG at the gnoll camp. <br>
<br>
--KEG had over 2 groups at Gnoll camps when you had just a few members there. You can't say you had more then us or were their before us.<br>
<br>
<br>
6) I still cant figure out how the 3 from KEG manage to get the kill, I think it must have been cause of all the other mobs there was pulled when all the ppl where rushing the turtle.<br>
<br>
--Yea, but who pulled it? Why would I stop attacking Lodizal and go round up some mobs to kill me while I was fighting him? Makes no sense to me at all. Why would any of the 3 of us go round up mobs when we were so greatly out numbered, wouldn't that be a big waste of time?<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
To Eberan:<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all 12 people beating the crap out of a mob = Engaged&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Very true, so does 1 bard attacking a mob.<br>
<br>
&quot;So the only thing we are not 100% certain of is who pulled it first. Faiar og Kathrynn. However I do believe Faiar when he says he pulled it first.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Very true again, but notice what you say in that sentence &quot;I do believe&quot;. Exactly my point and exactly why I said split the loot. I believe our puller said they had it first. By saying believe your not certain on who had it first as I am not certain. The guide said that and I posted that for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You can spin it all you want, fact is : you made a (BIG) mistake and your now afraid to take responsability for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Where did I ever say &quot;No, I didn't kill Lodizal! or No I didn't this or that&quot; I am taking responsability for killing him, and you know what? I don't think I or YOU did wrong, We both attacking in confusion cause we both &quot;Believed&quot; it was our pull and our mob and that we were both being KS'd.<br>

<br>
-- Smokescreen? Where? Like I said before, shutup about saying you engaged first, I was first person engaged. I am getting tired of you saying you had a &quot;Noob&quot; wizard cause I don't think he appriciates that. A wizard would have to be pretty bright to nuke a summoning mob while pulling. He had did 0 damage and I had did several hundred before you guys attacked. Lying? I am not the one that has changed your stories OVER AND OVER again to make it sound better..<br>

<br>
-Kiting does not count as engaged.<br>
-Pulling does not count as engaged.<br>
-There is nothing wrong with kiting for 30 mins (knowing that someone else might pull it from you at any time)<br>
-There is nothing wrong with taking an uber mob from a kiter.<br>
-Killing Lodizal with 12 people *IS* being engaged (no matter how long they kited).<br>
-Killing Lodizal with 3 people while 12 other people are tanking it *IS* KS'ing.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of respect for KEG, but this goes pretty low out there. Just cause you are mad because someone kited for 30 mins does not give anyone a right to KS once they &quot;engage.&quot;<br>

<br>
So you acknowledge there were 2 groups of RF there. I however must correct you that &quot;you&quot; did not get it up on shore, Faiar did, he was actively pulling it to dragon bridge to our groups, the KEG groups were at frozen tower I understand(at least none of them were anywhere near this).<br>
<br>
Then later:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the mem bluring, no kath never did mem blur and only nuked. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Us 3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> just got the kill and we felt we were the ones defending a mob from being KS'd so don't tell me we ran over and tried to KS it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So because you &quot;felt&quot; like it was your mob it was ok to killsteal it when a group with the numbers to kill it were taking it down. Despite you never engaged it first, and only had a druid/bard/chanter there(which does not constitute a force capable of killing lodizal) and we had 2 groups. <br>
<br>
As for Autumnmoon, yes I initally thought she was killed by Lodizal since I saw her summoned 3 times, as it turns out she apparently survived the beatings from lodizal, which is probably why you got the kill. But you really are grasping at straws when you try and claim we trained you with giants. There were a number of extra mobs arround that were beating on various ppl and I'm sure the mob AI took care of selecting a druid that were halfdead from lodizal as its target. And we had to kill numerous giants and dire wolves while we waited on the spot for a GM.<br>
<br>
Anyway we consider the matter closed. We posted trying to get an explation, but none of the involved are sorry in the least for what they did and apparently are sanctioned by KEG. The facts are posted for all to see and I'm sure the more mature people out there can draw their own conclusions.<br>

Don't try to dirt-cast our name with that train shit because that never happened. Maybe there was some mobs running around and beating on people (I only saw the giant on the bard) but there was no intentional training.<br>
<br>
Do not say the GM verified you didn't memblur the mob, because that's a total lie. He couldn't see what you looted but he could see what spells you casted? BS!<br>
The group that should get the killing (if the KEG-members shouldn't have memblurred) consisted of 60 cleric, 54 SK with Epic, 55 Warrior, 54 Warrior, 57 shaman and 60 druid.  <br>
You telling me that you KSed them without using memblur?<br>

&quot;Someone says in Guild Seblina has turtle and its incoming. (confusion!!)&quot;<br>
I'm assume that this is your first engage of the mob? <br>
Seblina started to nuke the turtle when Faiar already had him and was pulling it to our camp. If you want proof of this I have logged a conversation with her at that moment...<br>
and I'm sure she won't lie about something like this... Or would she?<br>

Kiting doesn't mean engaged?<br>
Pulling doesn't mean engaged?<br>
<br>
You people must have been raised in Highpass.<br>
<br>
I've read numerous times throughout the years Verant saying that the first to cast or melee own that particular spawn.  It's difficult to pull a creature without doing either.<br>
<br>
Y'all can claim the rules have changed...I really don't care...until you KS one of my group's pulls of a great creature like the turtle.  This ain't Highpass...you're supposed to know the rules as written by the time you're in your 50s.<br>
<br>
From www.everquest.com:<br>
<br>
You may not steal kills. <br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission.<br>
<br>

If you're that interested in killing Lodizal, you will stick a kill worthy group there until he spawns.  Otherwise, it's a race, that will always be full of debate over who was first, who ks'd who, what &quot;engaged&quot; means, and all this pointless bickering that seems to be so popular.  <br>

The only thing that astounds me is how poorly everyone treats each other.  Show some dignity, and composure.  How you choose to act has a huge impact on people treat you.  Maybe you would even have your precious shield right now, had you been so wise.<br>
