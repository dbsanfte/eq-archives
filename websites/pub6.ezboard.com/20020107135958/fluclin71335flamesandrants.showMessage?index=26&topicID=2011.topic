<br>
People do not &quot;pretend to commit suicide for attention&quot;.  People attempt suicide because they feel like they've lost all hope.<br>
<br>
Yes, I felt that way.  I had a rough breakup a few months back, I was out of school (and since I worked at school, I lost my job), my friends were all off in school, so I spent most of my day sitting at home staring at my computer screen.  Yes, it's quite sad and pathetic, but that's how it happened...<br>
<br>
I'm personally not thinking &quot;all of LoS are assholes who don't care&quot; because I know some members of LoS and I know that some of them are pretty cool people, so I hope none of you think that =) I was pretty shocked that Sky would cross the line of EQ and say what he said.  I would never tell the world of EQ of the RL things I've known Sky to be infamous for, because frankly, if he doesn't want it to be known, then it's none of my business to say anything.<br>
<br>
How am I doing now? Better.  Great? Nah, but better than before, which is a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Sky wanted attention and he got it, I'm sure he's happy in his own twisted sick way.<br>

There are ways that will definitely kill you, there are ways that might kill you or might not, and there are ways that sure as hell aren't going to kill you, and in fact are almost guaranteed to get you caught and draw attention to it.  Like that guy who tried to commit suicide by eating 200 aspirin.  WTF.<br>
<br>
Rasp, no, that's not saying you're the third type, just wanted to clear that up.  I've had way too many friends that chose the third method to believe that nobody ever does it when deep down all the want is attention.<br>

Oh, and Bremadle is someone who used to be a pretty cool guy and a lot of fun to hang out with, until he got his LoS tag.  Then the rest of the server stopped existing and wasn't worth talking to.<br>

I dont agree nor disagree with what Sky did and or said, Rasplorien and him have been at eachother for quite a while now. I dont pretend to like Rasp I aslo dont hate him, simply put I dont know him. What Sky said was out of anger because 150 of you dumb fucks decided to gang up on him for attempting to clear the water over an incident. <br>
<br>
Sky is one of the nicest, caring, helpfull and genuine people I know. You @#%$ &quot;short bus&quot; dumb fucks constanty personify stupidity with your jealous accusations against LoS, and then once one of their newer members posts he all of the sudden &quot;bragging about being in LoS&quot;. How many of you even know the people in LoS? Very few id bet, ITS A GOD DAMN GAME YOU JEALOUS @#%$ FREAKSHOWS.<br>
<br>
@#%$ go back to the box in the basement you crawled out of and chain yourself back up. I have h8 for almost no people in EQ and quite enjoy playing but when Fuckface 012321321223312 posts a direct attack on my friend whom fuckface doesnt even know then @#%$ that.<br>
<br>
Maybe just maybe some of you could understand that Sky is human he makes mistakes and I will bet my life that he regrets that post, even regrets starting that thread.  <p><img src="http://www.goodhomes.8m.com/wiz4.jpg"

<br>
Naw not true its just since I got the tag all I hear now is how someone in LoS did this and someone else did that and what a bunch of mean ass pricks they are etc.<br>
<br>
Its funny in the past week I've seen a lot of people (LoS) do a ton stuff for others, sky included, and then I come to the boards and read how we are drones, or haters of all who aren't LoS. Kinda burns you out on the whole grouping with others thing.<br>
<br>
Now I raid and have a blast, and play my twinks. Help out friends with epics and camps or whatever seems like fun atm.<br>
<br>
So anyways.. Flare send me a tell and maybe we can go play twinks or somethin'.<br>
<br>
BTW, I love the hypocrisy here its rampant, isn't it, Kiandria.(next time you tell some one to @#%$ off for judgeing others make sure you don't make a judgement on them in the next line.. carries more weight that way)<br>
<br>
But to some extent your right I made a judgement, Im just sick of everything being so melodramatic. If you want help seek it if you want to jump off a bridge, find the highest one possible. Either way you'll save yourself and those around you a lot of greif in the long run.<br>

There are many nice members of LoS out there to be sure.<br>

If Skyscreamer regrets the things he said, then perhaps he should apologize so everyone knows it.  I have no problems with the Kael events - things happen, even to uber guilds.  There are some members of LoS that I really dislike, and yes, that can prejudice my opinion of some others, but on the whole I like to take everyone in game for what they present.  Unfortunately, Skyscreamer, in his reply to Rasplorien, presented himself in a very poor light.  As I've said before, I can only hope he regrets this and apologizes. <p>Gobb Heartrender
