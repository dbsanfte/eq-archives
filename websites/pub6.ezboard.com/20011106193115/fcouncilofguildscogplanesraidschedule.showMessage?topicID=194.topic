 This is the member that apparently refused a level 49 rez , and left cause I was told by some guild buddies that was there that *we should just leave his body up here* . I think it was a bid misunderstanding that went bad. What really happen was , The point when i died , About 5 mins later aquin sent me a tell saying *back to old times again I see * (aquin has rezed me alot in the past hehe) *are you ready for your rez * I said yes. About 20 mins went by . And i heard in guild that our level 60 chanter obini(sp?) just died. And that aquin had to rez him first then he would get to me. Then I get a tell from a level 49 cleric saying are you ready for ur rez. I said not need to rez me aquin said he was going to rez me . But I guess I'll take it if thats all i can have. No were in there did I refuse a rez. Now what ever the cleric said in /ooc is beside the point . I know what the confursation was And have SS of it ... THat i would be more than happy to post. And like 5 mins later aquin sends me a tell rezining , me. So i think everything is fine . Untill I hear in /guild that my friends are telling me that they should have not rezed me and left me in Hate . No matter if its just to get things in order or not  you should not be saying that about someone. So I said for being my second time on KGoC raids I am not impressed by you guys. Understand it from my point of view.  So me and my guild buddy yizelar leave. Then I hear in guild that People were makeing fun of me after i had already left. Malliss was still up there from our guild. Now was it really called for that you guys had to make fun of me after i had already left PoH?? <br>
Is this how things on ran in KCoG's that we jump to a conclusion with out investigateing it or pointing there finger at one person with out asking what happen? Then when the person leaves you make fun of him ? Well then yes I am not impressed by KCoG's at all. KCoG's was givein a big gift of being the oversear for all of the events on Karana (ie plane dragon etc etc etc.) .. And this is how you act towards one person that did not refuse a rez just said that a person that just happend to be a 56 cleric was going to rez me so i can wait. ? Then make fun of them when they are gone ? <br>
    <br>
        Up untill that point i thought KCoGs was great . I just think it was a big misunderstanding . That if it was treated like adults would treat it . It would have never went as far as it did . I agree to some point with saying if you truely said they *next person that does not take a rez will be left * And not saying that we should just leave him up here haha ....<br>
 But really makeing fun of me when i have already left is just cold. Maybe it was just a big misunderstanding on both of our parts. In that case I hope to be on Raids in the future with KCoG's and prolly would get a better impression next time. <br>
<br>

But I'll make this point.<br>
<br>
You were in my group.  You could have asked for clarification.  You didnt.  You simply took the word of a guildmate without hearing from the raid leader.  I'm sure there was a misunderstanding.  But you bear a large part of that in not seeking clarification from me.  You speak about acting like adults, I ask you if abandoning your fellow raiders without even asking question one to me is an adult reaction?  Yes, to a large degree I overreacted, yet so did you.  <br>
<br>
I never saw anything that could be considered derogatory remarks about you after you left.  That doesnt mean they didnt happen, jsut that I never saw them.  Had I, I would not have condoned them. <br>

I realize this was a misunderstanding but this is not the point of this post.. I was there the ENTIRE time after you left.  Never once did I see anything said about you, either in my group, /say, /ooc, or /shout.. hell, i was the very LAST person out of Hate that night so I saw everything that was said from start to finish.  Please dont make generalizations about the KCoG based on your guildmate's recollections..<br>
<br>
I'm very sorry you feel this way about the raid, but I believe Kellory said what he did to make a point.  I probably would have done the same if it was me. <p><img src="http://users.boone.net/meliboo/silverlight.bmp"><br>

<br>
Secondly, it is a standing policy on raids that OOC complaints and/or harrassment is not tolerated. Period. Had it occured and been brought to Kellory's attention, OR had Kellory himself seen it, I'm sure the perpetrators would have been warned/kicked off. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, lots of tells go back and forth on a raid. A simple &quot;Yes, I'm ready&quot; to the rezzing cleric would have been fine. More words just confused the situation it appears. <br>
