<br>
and <br>
<br>
&quot;NO ONE can keep other guilds from killing Venril Sathir. But to kill him... you have to have quick feet.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Well this is what I was trying to get at with this post. <br>
<br>
I agree, no guild/player can stop you from killing anything. Everybody pays their 10 bux to play and has the right to kill whatever they want. <br>
<br>
What concerned me was the emergence of an alliance between the guilds on the rotation. <br>
<br>
An alliance whose sole purpose was to prevent guilds who may have stepped on the rotation guilds toes (whether this was accidental or intentional is irrelevant here) from ever killing VS again.<br>
<br>
This to me, seems like an unfair practice and would  probably violate the PnP policy.<br>
<br>
Friendly competition is fun. I for one like, the challenge in seeing who can mobilize their guild faster to accomplish a certain goal.<br>
<br>
I dont even mind multiple guilds teaming up to accomplish a goal either. <br>
<br>
It's when multiple guilds team up out of spite and possibly even hatred for another guild that bothers me.<br>
<br>
I know theres a lot of contention of mobs with the upper guilds. One of the goals that I know ever guild shares is to get their guild equipped with bigger, badder and better equipment. Everybody wants to move up and move on to bigger and harder challenges. Unfortunately loot only flows into the game so fast. No matter how fast they make it, its just never gonna be fast enuff. <br>
<br>
Here's where rotation lists come into play. They may not be the optimal solution, but as far as i can tell they work pretty damn good. <br>
<br>
I think a great example of this is the Ragefire rotation list. I have to say im pretty impressed with the communication that goes on in that thread. Everybody is always updating everybody else with what the latest haps are and whos doing what. Its what an old friend of mine would call good juju. <br>
<br>
I know recently we've had some issues pop up about KS'ing of spawns and and rotation violations and such. I'd like to say resolving these issues was handled in a great or even a decent manner, but I can't. In fact, Im pretty disappointed in how things were handled in the beginning. Stuff like the dragging people through the mud, flaming each other, calling each other ignorant, dumb, stupid, etc. Somthing I would expect from 5th graders. I think if everybody put all the issues out on the table and took the time to discuss them in a more (I really hate using this word) mature manner, I think we'd have resolved them alot faster. Anybody disagree?<br>
<br>
A few of you wonder why I dont post my character name on my posts. Well, this is probably one of the more prominent reasons I choose not to. You can drag me through the mud here all you want, but i dont want it to carry over into my characters world. The character I play in-game and the person I represent here are two different people. <br>
<br>
Re-reading over my post i think i touched base in quite a few areas, and alot of it just doesnt flow from point to point as smoothly as I had hoped and for that I apologize. I didnt intend on writing this much, but it looks like I did. Anyway, I'll just close with the following paragraph.<br>
<br>
All I'd like to see is just that everybody makes an effort to get along with each other and if an issue comes up, everybody works together in a civil manner to resolve the problem. The sooner we do, I think the better off we'll be as people, as guilds and as a server.<br>

<br>
So, speaking like a true newbie, I wanted to ask a few questions.  I ask this out of pure curiousity, but assume I'll get nicely flamed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As I undertand it, the rotation currently involves a few guilds (what, 8?) taking turns on these mobs.  Would it be unreasonable for a few guilds that ordinarily couldn't kill VS alone, to band together, and request a spot on the rotation?  I'm not talking a permanant spot, but a single VS.  Or maybe you could leave 1 out of 10 VS's around, for the smaller guilds to take a shot at?  <br>
<br>
This would be a great way to clear up those &quot;monopoly&quot; misgivings that people have been expressing, as well as letting others enjoy a raid they normally couldn't go on.  <br>
<br>
Somewhere above it's said: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Is it fair to the smaller guilds? Well, yes and no. Do they have an equal shot at it. If they can mobilize faster than the rotation guild to take the spawn, then yes, they have an equal shot. If not, well then learn to mobilize faster so you can get there before the rotation guild.&quot; <br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I don't think this is a reasonable solution.  Lets assume for a minute that 3 or 4 smaller guilds did manage to &quot;KS VS&quot;.  First, the guild who's turn it was on the rotation would be dissapointed, and most likely upset.  Secondly, that's not at all good for a guilds reputation. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that the reasonable solution would be giving away a free vs every once in a while... <br>
<br>
What are the thoughts on this?  If it's been covered before a million times, I'm sorry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Just wondering.<br>
