This isn't about flagging/progression, this is about Loot.<br>

If it was about flagging, then I would have never brought this up in the first place.  This is about a guild equipping their members using these mobs.  Anyone who wants FLAGS can join Clan X (or other members of the rotation) to get their flags via the backflagging agreement.  Any guild that wants on the rotation can kill the mobs and get on, just like every other rotation.<br>
<br>
Will someone PLEASE explain to me why this is different from other rotations.  I don't want speculative BS, and people trying to say this isn't how rotations work.  Rotations exist as a means for guilds to get the most turns possible at getting loot from a mob in the least amount of time.  They do this so that it is fair to all partied who both want loot from said mobs, and can kill said mobs.<br>
<br>
There is no reason that Clan X cannot ask for a rotation on these mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenaukamikaze>Kenau Kamikaze</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.student.utwente.nl/d.p.h.siehl/levlenna.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF - GL</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/20/03 10:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1164.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Simple Question</span><hr size=1> **EDIT** (this is a response to Mix. jesther posted while I was posting)<br>
<br>
You are right. And that is the reason why I mentioned the Agnarr rotation.  In that point of time several guilds needed Agnarr, to be able to move on. So at that point of time he suddenly became a bottleneck for the guilds that wanted to kill him. Once they had their 2 or 3 or 4 kills in, they left him alone. Even though he can drop some nice loot.<br>
But like you already pointed out also: The flagmobs higher up, (can) drop even better loot.<br>
There have been times that we could not find ANY HoH trials up. There have been times we could not find Bertoxxulous or Saryrn up. Did we discuss rotations? Yes rotations HAVE been discussed (not on our request btw) but those mobs were NEVER put on rotation because we (we=the guilds currently looking for them) saw that, once we were done with the flagging those rotations also would be obsolete again.<br>
<br>
I realise Clan X wants the mobs for the loot, but once they can kill the other flagmobs they would most likely leave Grummus/AD alone.<br>
And don't come telling me that we are elemental and therefor do not need the loot from those mobs. Before we were elemental we ALSO did not kill those mobs repeatedly just for loot. And no, we are NOT stuffed with Ssraa and/or VT loot. For those who missed it: VoF is NOT in VT and untill recently we hardly killed any ssraa mobs.<br>
There are other ways to gear up. (And I am not talking about bazaar or LDoN.) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kenau Kamikaze, Coercer of VoF ,  Levlenna, Archon of VoF.

<br>
If any 2 guilds wanted to start a rotation they can, its not to the detremint of anyone, it only makes it fair that everyone who wants a shot gets a shot every xxxx time.<br>
<br>
If there is 15guilds all killin a mob and 2 guilds want to start a rotation of course all 15 would be involved in the talks for a rotation, but the 2 guilds who want the rotation cannot be told no.<br>
<br>
We are a shareing server, if you dont like shareing please refer yourself to the server transfer option to an FFA server. <br>
<br>
Yes in this case 2 guilds can override the majority by simply asking for people to share. Shareing is the basis of the entire rotation system if they want to share they are garunteed for that to happen by the RTA.<br>
<br>
Now some limitations have been brought up before, a 24-48 hour mob has never been placed on rotation, and will not. <br>
Example of mobs but not limited :<br>
Vindicator, Lodizal.<br>
<br>
Why? they pop atleast in enough time that every guild on the server can have 20+ shots of this mob in a months time, that is to many available shots to be askin for a rotation.<br>
<br>
Mobs on 3 or longer spawn times are the only mobs that have ever actually been placed on rotation, and will continue to be.<br>
<br>
Its all about sharing , some find fun in race mobs, thats fine, but if you think you can block a rotation because &quot;only 2 want it&quot; think again, the RTA is based on sharing and by joinin you agreed to share mobs. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/a/c/acidlogic/vincesig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

<br>
I agree with this...BUT...if Clan X wants to have a bunch of rapid turns on  Grummus, even if the rotation will be dissolved 6 months down the road...who are we to tell them that they and some other guilds cannot form a rotation on him now?<br>
<br>
I see what you are saying.  You want to use the hindsight that other guilds have already produced to say &quot;We don't need a rotation on these mobs&quot;, and that's fine, but I'm just trying to ask:  <br>
<br>
If Clan X and some other guilds decide that they DO want a rotation on these mobs (a final decision, decided among themselves), they CAN form one, correct?<br>
<br>

Yes, it is very much in Clan X's discretion to request a rot on any mob that they are able to kill.  Period.  What you people are arguing is that they don't have the right because you don't agree that it should happen.  This is a fallacy, they have every right to request that these mobs be put on rotation.  The decision should come about like this....<br>
<br>
Clan X asks if MOBX can be a rotation because several guilds are killing it, and they would like fair content.<br>
<br>
Either in a forum, or in a channel a list is created of all the guilds that are currently killing MOBX....be it for loot, or for flagging progression.<br>
<br>
Finally, all of these guilds are asked to vote whether or not the rotation should be created.  Majority rules.  If you don't want on the rotation and you need backflags you are able (under current policy) to ask whichever guild is up next for MOBX if some of your members can tag along for flags...and being that they are on rotations there will, most likely be several empty flag spots for your guild to fill.<br>
<br>
If you don't like to have to ask those under you for a spot, I'm sorry if I feel no pity for you.<br>
<br>
Yes, in the past rotations were started primarily by 2-3 guilds, but that was because only those 2-3 guilds were able to kill said mob at the time.  BotS etc. didn't start rotations on the mobs we are discussing mostly because they had their eyes set on prizes much greater than this mob will give them.  They were in a hurry to get done with these mobs enough to get flags to move to the next level.  Most of the high raiding guilds aren't the least bit concerned about the loot that these guys drop, even when they were doing them for the first time...they were moving forward and conquering territory.<br>
<br>
No, 2 guilds could not make a policy that all others that are in the same place must follow....that is idiocy.  However, if all of the guilds it effects AT THIS MOMENT agree, then by the &quot;spirit of the Rathe&quot; it must be put on a rotation.<br>
<br>
Whether a mob is for flags, or for loot is irrelevant.  If the spawn is contested, for the most part, then the rotational rules of the server apply.<br>
<br>
And as several state over and over.......my opinions are my own and do not reflect VoLS, the Rathe, the government of the United States of America, the state of Mississippi, or my wife and children.<br>

I'm saying you get the guilds that kill these mobs together and ask them to vote on on whether or not they want them on rotation.  BUT, unlike in your scenario, if even two of the guilds that can kill him want the content rotated for loot, they should be able to form a rotation.  No majority vote needed.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If 2 or more guilds want to start a rotation on a mob that is FFA, they may, other guilds that commonly kill it FFA at that point would have to join the rotation and follow/ammend any rotation rules that were establised by the original guilds who started the rotation. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
All else has been argumentative for no other reason than wanting to be &quot;heard&quot;.<br>
<br>
The guilds involved in wanting to create a Rotation for a mob just need to state it in the Guild Rep Forum, with the spawn timer info, and what guilds and their kill order. The Rotation will then be created. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Part 2:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

A Rotation is dissolved when it's deemed, by the guilds on the Rotation, to no longer be necessary, or when everyone &quot;passes&quot; their turn.  Agnarr was made a Rot Mob, then it was decided it was no longer needed, and was removed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sandalorn>Sandalorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am the Highway!</span><br>  Posts: 539<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/20/03 11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1164.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Simple Question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>shei was on a rot a long time ago with i believe bots tindi nb and sot, after a while no one wanted to kill him so he came off rotation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ahhhh..That's right.  I was talking about Seru.  I always get those two mixed up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Apparently lost causes are my speciality.  This has just been one of many.  I realize that logic and fairness have no sway or hold here so I will just give up the ghost.<br>
<br>
So I guess Clan X and another guild will get this put on rotation and all the other 10-15 guilds that currently kill that mob will have bow to their will or face their punishment for killing said mob.  I don't care how that little gem of a rule was made, but how anyone can think that is logical and fair is absolutley beyond me.  Bending other guilds to your will is such a lovely way of making friends.  Good luck on that.<br>

If its just getting the flags and they aren't going there for loot, great then they will be back up again. If its for loot and they are continually doing them, then yes we will want it on a rotation. Its still early in the game to determine this and we're still checking to see how things go. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I was agreeing that they have the right to ask for a rotation.  Others were disagreeing with this, that was the stand I was taking.  What you and I disagree on is the reasoning on how to establish a rotation.  I know that technically there are no rules established for a situation such as this.  However, I can't see where it's fair to have two guilds determine the fate of 10 guilds that are currently killing said mobs.  I disagree that everyone who is able to kill said mob should have a say......just those that are currently killing it should have a say.  So, yes, I am agreeing with Sand in this case.  While I would like to think that all the guilds currently killing said mobs would agree to a rotation, I can't make that guarentee, hell I can't even make that call for my guild. <br>
<br>
 Seriously, if they call for a vote on a rotation I think that it would pass, the guilds that are killing them for just flags can always flag with those that are killing him for loot, and it saves them the raid organization and all that crap.  It would also let you know how to get ahold of whoever's gonna be killing this mob.  I personally think the rotation is a good idea, I just don't like the precedent of two guilds making rules for 10 guilds.  Part of fairness is majority rules, and two out of ten is not a majority.<br>

<br>
I know it was said the two guilds would make rules but rules still have to fall within the normal rotation guidelines. The only real rules to decide is when starting to the rotation is wether or not to put the Guilds on it who have already killed it, then let them choose to pass/auto or do it. Or instead decide they would have to kill the content again to break into the rotation. Other than that there are no real rules to make. I mean you couldn't say, &quot;You can only kill this mob on Friday the 13th, when there is a full moon and your raid force has to have an odd number of people, with no one with names starting with A.&quot; <br>
<br>
I'm not sure what other rules you guys are talking about guilds making... but there really isn't much other than that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I always viewed the RTA as a democratic way of dealing with things.<br>
<br>
If 2 of 3 guilds want a rotation, and it happens, that is democratic.<br>
<br>
If 2 of 10 guilds want a rotation, and it happens, that is very undemocratic and very unfair.<br>
<br>
If 8 of the 10 guilds like the way the spawn is handled, FFA, why should they have to be forced onto the rotation?<br>
<br>
Don't say this is the way it was done before, because the way I have seen it is the 2-3 guilds that were ACTIVELY killing the mob made the rotation, all others that came after than had to follow.<br>
<br>
It wasn't 2 or 3 of the 10 active guilds killing it that made the rotation for all others actively killing it to follow.<br>
<br>
Anyways, guess that is the same point as Sand and others made, but like I said I agree with him totally.

From what Senzii says this already the case. The difference would be, if there was a rotation, then you could check and see who was up for these mobs, and ask for the opportunity to do them.<br>

And I have real examples to demonstrate it.<br>
<br>
Klandicar was once a rotation between SOT, BotS, NB, TL.  People stopped killing him, the rotation disolved.  Then, a resurgence of interest in Klandicar arose, and a few new guilds wanted to rotate him.  Tindi wanted to join in, NB chose not to, nor did BotS.  The rotation continued.  the important part of this - it was a mob several guilds had already killed.  None of those guilds had to &quot;reprove&quot; themselves to get back on it - and they had to be offered the opportunity to join.<br>
<br>
Same with Agnarr, Tallon and Vallon Zeks.  When they formed, every guild that could kill them was offered a spot on the rotation.  BotS and Tindi both said no, then later requested to be added (which was done with no need to rekill to prove they could).  Agnarr fell out of favor rather quickly, but the other two have remained.<br>
<br>
The only reason only two guilds have been on rotation for a mob, has been because they are the only two to kill it.  Two guilds cannot form a rotation to the exclusion of other people who have already killed it.  If 15 guilds have killed Grummus, two guilds cannot form a rotation and exclude the others.<br>
<br>
I also don't think its completely accurate that AD, Grummus and TT are killed the instant they spawn.  Grummus I know has been up for three days, as is Aerin Dar.  However, if a rotation is formed, NB would join them, to make sure we get access to our need to backflag. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
