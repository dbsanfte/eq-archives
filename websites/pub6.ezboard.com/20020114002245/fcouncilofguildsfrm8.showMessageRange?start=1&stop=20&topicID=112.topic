<br>
There was good stuff and bad stuff and real bad stuff and frustrating stuff, where to start. Lets try from the beginning.<br>
<br>
First off if you're not going to show up on the raid why do you bother signing up? for example, I had 8 warriors signed up to go, only 1 of them showed up. Rbecka. Thank goodness we had alot of walkins.Of the 52 people we had listed as going, only 24 were there. 24! my GOD how the hell do you run a raid with 24 people?!?! You pray like hell you have enough walkins. Now granted a fe of you sent Flarren or I a tell before hand saying why you couldn't make it and for that we are grateful, but that is still only another 4 people that told us.<br>
<br>
Now counting the amount of people I had to work with and the lack of class choice I'd say we did really well. Did you know we had him down to under 10% the first time when everyone gave up? Food for thought. Most didn't cause they either stopped going in or were elsewhere. And for those of you complaining &quot;oh no! I died 3 times now!&quot; well I died over 8 times the first round alone and the next time I see you sitting back freeloading while the rest of us are dying to kill him I will tear you down so fast publicly you'll be lvl 1 again. You dont stop till the raid is called to a halt, which means the raid commander, battle commander or MA, whoever is alive to do it at the final point. And you, yes you know who you are, the freeloader, remember this. I know who you are.<br>
<br>
I believe I made 2 colossal mistakes (not counting the small ones too) thoughout the raid. In group movements to get inside I didn't take enough time to get my team aquainted with the system I wanted to use. That will be corrected. And mistake number 2 is not as easy to admit but *gulp* in the last final seconds before making our first rush I failed to notice a couple of my group leaders saying they were still missing their healer. Obviously hesitant they stopped (which they shouldn't have done anyway but I understood why they did) and everything back clogged in the first 20 seconds. <br>
<br>
I cant place into words how sorry I am for not doing these parts better. Especially the Attack command. For this I appologize profusely and beg everyone to remember it was my first time leading a dragon raid and that now I have learned ALOT from what I did wrong.<br>
<br>
There were a few that complained throughout about &quot;Man this is going slow&quot; or &quot;well thats not how MY alliance does it&quot; and a million other pointless comments. Put up with it or leave, simple. Are you the one running it? no. therefore dont bring that crap to my table since I never bring it to yours.<br>
<br>
There are a couple other topics I want to touch on. First was listening. Maybe its cause I'm a girl, or maybe not from SB Alliance, or maybe even that I have a name that in short form is funny, whatever the reason is, it is NO reason to ignore me. I dont shout out stuff for no reason and having to repeat myself should be completely un necessary. If you have a problem with me then send me a tell and we'll deal with it. Till then I dont care who is in the command seat, me or anyone else, you LISTEN to them.<br>
<br>
Other thing is, in Hindsight we shouldn't have tried the second run. I was very rutted in my failure at that time and wanted to see if anyone was willing to forgive and try again. Some of you are incredibly brave and thank you to all those extras from absolutely everywhere that came to just see him if anything. And special thank you to Ogun with his purdy Rez stick for saving me my lvl and many other people's lvls too.<br>
<br>
There are too many raiders to mention between both runs but everyone there deserves a pat on the back for patience and understanding with a new raid leader.<br>
<br>
Reagent money. We have written down those that used reagents or donated in. Contact Fellowship of Faydark and we will distribute it out. Try and get ahold of Flarren or myself, barring that then anyone from the riad that you remember.<br>
<br>
I am hoping you guys will have the guts to sign up for Vox as we try again with our lessons learned for all.<br>

I am glad I came. One thing you mentioned tho did seem obvious -- I was aware of who signed up (for the most part) but I didnt know that most of them didnt show.. that amazes me. Yes there was some real good aspects of the raid, and I am damned glad I was there to see this. Most of the time, it appeared that /assist was being used (even in that massive, chaotic battle in King Trannix's room.. gawd, I still cant believe we didnt get wiped out there! Kudos to all for keeping a cool head!) and the buff line was great! That was smooth sailing. <br>
<br>
You also mentioned about people listening to what is being told.. after last night, I wonder if some raid members had /shout disabled. Heh.. I did notice one thing that makes me say that in particular. Almost immediately after you (or Flarren) shouted 'Dont sit on the throne' someone shouted 'For &quot;buffXXX, see me on the throne'. /blink ... /ponder. Come on, people. Regardless of your 'thoughts' or past experience, if your raid leader says 'do this' or 'dont do this', they have a reason. Listen to them and do as asked.<br>
<br>
I can try to make the Vox raid, but the only way I will be able to is if my uncle (Kordail) can not.. also, if possible could I speak to either of you in game? Thanks.<br>

Your setup was great, I thought, and your plan was sound. You did a great job of getting things moving, particularly in light of the number of no-shows.<br>
<br>
Like Rbecka, I was thrilled with the way the fight in the throne room went. I believe we had 6 FG's working there, and to still be standing at the end, though battered and bloody, was quite a thrill. Of course pulling that many at one time was not intentional, but good organization and sheer stubborness on the part of most of the raiders saw us through in fine fashion.<br>
<br>
The one time most everyone appeared to listen and follow orders was during the buffline. Where was that level of cooperation the rest of the night?<br>
<br>
Yes, the charge was called before the raid was ready. Both times, in fact (on the second charge, none of the healers were more than about half mana). And yes, that was a critical error. My question is, what happened to the stubborness and unwillingness to admit defeat that saw us take down the FG train? Is Naggy that awe inspiring? Do people not trust Ogun to stand by his word when he says he'll do rezes? If ALL the casters had stayed after it, Naggy would have died during the first attempt. Yes, I make that as an unqualified statement.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it wasn't clear to you why you were required to bind in the buff room. It was so, when you were killed, you could mem your damage spell and charge again! After my first death, I actually had to jump over casters who were sitting on their butts so I could get back in the fight! You think maybe you're special? You think you can jump in and have your shot at the dragon loot without doing your part? Well think again. If you want to charge in once, do your piddly little damage, then sit out the rest of the fight, then you better get used to the idea that you will never, EVER see ONE PIECE of dragon loot. This wasn't the first hard fight the CoG has had against a dragon, you know. Several times, the carnage has been insane by the time Naggy falls... but fall he will if the pressure is kept up. He doesn't have a healer.. even if you only land one spell before you die again, you're doing your part. Mem it and go do it again.<br>
<br>
/rant off. Sorry, but if we're gonna lose to a dragon, I'd rather it be because the target is too hard for us, not because half the raiders give up midway through the battle.<br>
<br>
Ogun, special thanks to you once again. I don't know how many times you've come out to support CoG raids, but each and every one is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Raiders who stayed with the fight... and there were some who did.. congratulations. You almost pulled it off in spite of the large number of slackers and freeloaders!<br>
<br>
All the FoF management team proved themselves worthy on this raid. If everyone will listen and follow orders, the CoG tradition of taking down one dragon after another will continue under FoF's leadership. If you choose not to listen and follow, then know that you're breaking the tradition, not FoF. They're doing their part.. are you?<br>

I enjoyed my first dragon raid, except for a few people that obviously did not listen to Lagdalen or the other raid management.  <br>
<br>
Once the rush was called to attack Nagafen, I got to see some true heroics.  I was truly amazed to see so many people come back so quickly for a heal.  I went OOM so fast that I thought I was going to kill myself trying to Canibalize! (* See note below)  Even with the lack of tanks, which I was not aware we had a lack, the healers were hard pressed to keep people healed.  The one complaint about the heal line that I have is that some healers, or pet owners, stood right where the tanks come in and targetting was hard.<br>
<br>
So, there I am trying to convert as much health into mana as I can to get 1 more heal off when I see Lagdalen fall (she was my group leader).  Soon as she spawned I see her run into the lair naked.  Not 5 seconds later she is dead again..... I saw her repeat that at least 6 times, and I had not died once (except for the time in Trannix's room).  Course soon as I thought that, I was summoned.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I managed to survive long enough to see corpses everywhere (and no live people) and to figure out what happened.<br>
<br>
I am truly sorry that I could not stay for round 2 and if that makes someone mad, I am sorry.  I was close to being awake for 24 hours straight, and the last 14 without food or drink.   And you can bet that I will be there for the next one as well!<br>
<br>
* Note:  This is not a rant or questioning authority, but to be honest I saw no reason for the healers to sacrifice Wisdom for MR and FR.  I could have squeezed out quite a few more heals had I not sacrificed Wisdom.  But I also know that there must be a reason for it.  Someone educate me on this one please. <p><hr>

However I would just like to point out that the day of the raid was also a bit vague (I understand the reason why, but it still makes it difficult to plan to attend when you have to set aside three possible days for the raid).  As I had stated before, I have never been on a raid so I REALLY don't understand the process and timing of these events.  Could someone please post a topic or point me to one that explains how you know when a raid is to occur?  I would dearly love to get involved in the various raids as I get higher in level but I know I have alot to learn about raids if I am to be productive member of a raid.<br>

<br>
First off, I would like to apologize for not showing up to the raid on time. My ISP was down &amp; by the time they got it up, it was already around 9:30 PM CST. I don't know if you remember this or not, but I sent you a tell as soon as I got on...letting you know what happened.<br>
<br>
Since I was sure that you were very busy coordinating the raid, I didn't bother to send you another tell although I never got a reply for my first tell. I just didn't want to flood you with that while you're leading the raid.<br>
<br>
After sending you that tell, I then went on to play my alt...thinking you guys already had enough tanks &amp; people for the raid. Had I known that the raid was short of people/tanks, I would have had my warrior around to help the raid with the first attack.<br>
<br>
I know that some of you might think that one extra person wouldn't make a difference, but I do not agree.  One extra person can mean an additional 1000+ dmg pts dished out. With Naggy down to less than 10% (as said in Lagdalen's post) in the first attack, having an extra tank might buy a few seconds for the casters to med up &amp; land the finishing nukes. I truly am sorry for not being there from the beginning.<br>
<br>
However, I'm glad though that I was able to help later with keeping the fire giants area clear during CR &amp; rezzes. It was pretty scary fighting those big boys in diapers when you didn't have any healer in the 'pick-up' group because she just got killed &amp; you didn't even know if there were any healers from other groups near you. =)<br>
<br>
Again, I wish I could be more of a help earlier than that. But, unfortunately I didn't know what was going on with the raid until about 3:00 AM in the morning...that's when a guildmate of mine mentioned it in the guild chat.<br>
<br>
I also want to say that I think you did a good job for a first-timer dragon raid leader, Lagdalen. Please do not get discouraged from leading this kind of events in the future.<br>

I thouhgt it went well considering it was our first time and we were low on people.  Also thank you vaard and Ogun for rezing me six times.<br>
   I dont think there is anything new I can add other than there were a few people who were spamming way to much.  During a raid, either talk in &quot;tells&quot; or dont talk at all.  There is plenty of time later to chat.  Also, some commands like, ready, set, GO GO GO would have been great for our first wave.  I saw people going in helter skelter in stead of a massive wave.<br>
   In case others dont know, during the battle I was to transfer my mana to my group healer.  So to those of you telling me to get in there and nuke, I was already doing my job. Unfortunately, I dont have any relevant nukes that are not fire based.  So I was relegated to pumping mana for heals and rezzes.<br>
   Even though we lost, I really enjoyed being a part of that.  I am certain that we will have a much better outcome next time.  I hope we are back on the waiting list.  <br>
As a fellow Reptile, I have to say I am very ashamed of Lord Nagefen.  I hope you all will not judge the rest of we reptiles by his example.<br>

As for Naggy's status, this is about how it went for me....Death 4-15%, Death 5-12%, Death 6-8%, Death 7-11% After death 7 I knew his regen was doing more than we were dmging so I knew it was over, plus Lag said for us to stop. However, I&quot;m really disappointed that many people weren't very relentless and didn't seem to care enough to keep going back in to fight, they stopped about 3 minutes before Lag said to stop.<br>
Anyways, thats enough of my comments, oh well, we gave it a good try, sorry I couldn't be there for a second attempt.<br>

P.S. I liked the strategy of splitting the tanks, and I think that it may be useful to instead of waiting 15 seconds to send pets in like we did, let them go in right away...Heres why: To start off every fight, Naggy and Vox both cast their fear at the first agro, fearing generally about 1/2 the tanks, and mage pets always. So I think we should just let them be and go after him once their fear wears(generally 8-10seconds). They generally do another fear every 20-30 seconds, and so by the time they actually get to naggy if we put em in at 15 seconds, they will be useless, but if they actualy start tanking at 15 seconds(by the time they get back to him after being feared), they'll have more time on him. Also, for the 45% caster nuke point, just a recommendation, but I think it should really go back to about 70%. The reason we failed is because there were no tanks left to keep it off the casters, well, tanks can't last that long, and have one life, so if casters go in earlier , we can take him down to 0% hp faster than if they wait, and if its faster, more likely we are to have tanks still alive, rather then all dead and faileing at 8% hp<br>

<br>
About the train in the TR when Muji pulled the FG he had 3 of them and got off a good FD when there was one left I jumped up and grabed him how we ended up with 4 i do not know but that area seems to be a bit buggy and on the next go around we may want to keep the group a bit further back to give us some more room to work with.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Lagdalen dont be to hard on yourself this is how you learn you will be better for it....and I myself felt like like bonking some ppl...the easiest way I think to avoid the trble with discipline is to have some ppl in reserve and if someone is not listening give a warning via /t and if the prob continues replace him....I know this seems a bit harsh but this is the only way I know and it does seem to work.....<br>
<br>
Again thank you all for the fun time and if you ever need another tank or puller for him feel free to ask me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I had some very important guild business that I had to do and could not wait on. I hated to miss this, as it was my first chance to attend a dragon raid without having to run one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was still online when the first run ended in failure, so being close by, I ran my barbarian butt to the bank, got my resist gear (which in my haste I didn't put it all on /bonk). I went LD in the 2nd bat room (with my guildmates there), came back, almost got killed by those pesky Lava duct crawlers, made it in, got in a group, and got ready to go. <br>
<br>
Lagdalen did a good job getting people together very quickly (more quickly than I would have). We decided to go in without the buffing line the second time (which might have helped, but I don't think it would have made the difference). I can say this based on what I saw in the time I was there. I have had some discipline problems on my dragon raids for the CoG, but I have NEVER EVER seen such a high number of undisciplined YAHOOS as were running around on this one. I can't even begin to name them. No, it wasn't the majority of people on this raid, and certainly not the people who have posted on this board. But my god, was I the only one who even heard the call to charge? I had a full 10 seconds of running up the steps, seeing no one else behind me, turning around to see a few tanks coming up behind me, then run into the lair. I made it right to Nagafen's spawn point, got feared, and THEN, only THEN, something like 20-30 seconds AFTER the charge had been given there were tanks running in. I think we had about 5 tanks in the room when I turned around out of control from fear. I don't think there were ever more than 5 tanks in the room fighting Nagafen, and generally speaking less than that. I had to go back for healing REALLY quickly, basically right after the fear wore off, and I was in and out of healing 5 times. Nagafen was being fought on the bridge over and over, and he spent most of his time fighting on the bridge. <br>
<br>
Lagdalen, you explained yourself well, and for the lack of discipline, you are definitely not to blame. There were WAY too many people just plain NOT listening. This cannot happen and still have a successful raid. The raid commander should not have to repeat his or herself over and over again to get people to listen. <br>
<br>
There were casters who didn't bind in the buffing room? This is unacceptable. It's in the strategy post, but this was obviously too much for some to read. It was specified in the briefing. Lagdalen said to remem your spell and get back in there. Any caster who gave up after 3 deaths should just not attend the next one. On my first successful CoG Nagafen run, Lothax, a wizard died 7 times from bind rushing with ice comet, over and over again, and was almost down an 8th time. Brisos and Lagdalen both died 8 times the first time. Brisos ended up with 14 corpses between both raids, and he was a HEALER. After he was summoned and killed as a healer, he memmed a damage spell and ran in their to start blasting, because there was no one else to heal. Are you telling me that YOUR experience is more important than Lag's or Brisos's? Selfish, inexcusable, and you know who you are. YOU DO NOT embody what the CoG is about, please do NOT show up for the next raid. I, as founder of the CoG, would rather that Lagdalen, Flarren and people like them did not give up their time and effort for people like you, because it's worth more than the stress and heartache that Lag and Flarren are going to go through just so you can bitch and moan about your loss of experience. <br>
<br>
I don't usually let my anger about something like this show in a public forum, but unfortunately, this is a trend I've seen more and more. Selfish people who are using the fact that the CoG does dragons and planes raids as their excuse to go try to mooch off some &quot;phat lewtz.&quot; Grubby, scum-sucking bottom feeders like that are NOT why the CoG does things like this. I know that at least one person there was /auction an item ALL NIGHT, even after the first unsuccessful run. I'm sure that Lag had /auction off to cut down on spam and didn't see this, but this is nuts. What if this person got a tell in the middle of combat, and missed throwing off a crucial spell or hitting the right mob, or missed buffing or strategy discussions all so they could sell an item? For the person who did this, you know who you are, don't come again, and I know who you are, and will be informing your guild leader. <br>
<br>
All I can say is those people who are here for the CoG, for the vision it embodies, please don't let this discourage you. Killing dragons in the CoG mode, can be done. It can be, and I've got the dragon's heads on my wall to prove it. Don't let the selfish people get to you, they don't deserve the amount of time you'll devote to thinking about them. <br>
<br>
About the strategy, my only comments is that I'd recommend sending in the casters at 50%-70% health, simply because the warriors are going to be pretty battered by the time 40-45% health rolls around. The warriors have to be there when the casters come in, to take a little bit of aggro off of the casters. We all know casters can usually only take 1 shot of the fire breat, or a couple of claws before they die. With lots of tanks still fresh in there to taunt Naggie, the casters will get less attention. They will still die, but maybe not as much. Also, remember, there wasn't an enchanter on this raid (at least not one that I know of), so not having clarity on the healers/casters also had a lot to do with it. <br>
<br>
As for sending in the pets first, on Nagafen that might work, on Vox it won't. The pets would get feared and fall into the pits, which has the potential to draw a train out into the lair. This potential is still there when you send them in later, but your chances of a train coming too early are lessened in this way. I still think sending pets in after the last set of tanks is best though. I also would have sent the paladins in first with the warriors, instead of or in addition to the rangers. The paladins can sometimes get LOH off on a warrior in their group, or themselves, saving a heal or two. <br>
<br>
As always, the opinions expressed above are mine and mine alone. Take them as you will. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Especially since it was your first time leading a dragon raid. It was the first time I had ever attended a such a large scale raid and was very nervous to begin with. But as the raid progressed i realised I had nothing to worry about, I had read the strategy briefing and knew the basic plan, and with Lags very detailed instructions at every point they were needed I had nothing to fear.<br>
<br>
On the down side I was astounded at some people inability to read what was being said. On our way through the FG area, everytime we advanced it was shouted not to go further and in fact to stay behind Kommisar who was main assist. So I stuck right behind him. Yet time and time again people would run forwards and look round a corner or do a little exploring. This could have put every single raider in jepardy.<br>
<br>
Also attacking at the right time was a big issue on every encounter we were instructed to wait until Kommisar called his target before attacking yet time and again people ran forward the moment the pull was called to engage. Also when we asaulted Naggy we were told not to engage before we reached the back wall of the lair. I was always in the second asault wave but there was only a 10 second gap between waves and I have to ask why when I ran up the steps and headed in to the lair were people on the bridge figting. Yet most of the tanks seemed to still be at the far wall. If there was a reason for this then I missed it.<br>
<br>
Also Lag was the Raid Commander not the Raid dissucsion leader if she says enter the room and head left to the wall and stay there. Then you enter the room turn left go to the wall and damn well stay there. You don't go wandering off and have a poke around the room, or just see whats around the corner. If you didn't want to follow instuctions maybe you should have saved us all a bit of hassle and just headed straight in to Naggys lair on your own and seen how far you would get.<br>
 <br>
Another person I feel needs a big cheer is Gruz. As a puller on a raid like this you put yourself on the line. I had never even been on such a huge raid before let alone pulled on one, but if the first time I step up to pull I do as well as Gruz I will be a happy man. I felt you did great.<br>
<br>
As a tank the worst thing for me was the feeling of helplessness I had once I died it ws horrible to be in Fp and to hear Brisos calling heals on someone and knowing I could do nothing to help. I wish there was some way I could have gotten back sooner. You said Lag that you thought the second assault was a mistake I don't agree, I am sure there are many others out there who feel the same way. We were so close first time around and I felt that we had the ability to succed. Even though by the time i got my corpse and a rez after the second assault it was almost 12pm my time if you had called it I would have followed you in a third time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   During the second asault I definately felt the difference without the buffing line I was dead before I even struck a blow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have something to add that I think no one said yet. It'sd explaining some behaviour.<br>
 First of all... About healers. We had a healer line were TANKS were supposed to come back AFTER 50% HP lost. I would liek other hjealers there to support me in that, how many pure casters did yo usee coming back for a heal? Truely, unless I m wrong and pure casers are not suposed to die to get mana back, I saw many dumbasses... I healed one of them and then he came back to get another heal then I idd an OOC saying nukers are suposed to die mem a DD spell and go back to fight. TYhey have to die if they are oom even if not aggroed by Naggy, die on purpose... That is the first thing I think, being a healer,  Isaw being a reason of failure.<br>
<br>
 Second is about healer themselves. Beside Shamans every healers going out of mana should jsut go in the lair to tickle Naggy, yes jsut to get killed so you can be full mana again. Shamans can canniblize and SHOULD die too canniblizing. I think shaman shouldn't go to lair when oom even if that means gettign ful mana faster. I don't say that cause I'm a shaman. First attempt I died 5 or 6 times, cause I think I did agood job. Yes diing get mana back faster than cannible. but if yo ucannible  while other healer die that means always soem healers able to heal at least a bit. Beside that I swear that if yo uspend Full mana and cannible like some shaman did, you WILL be summoned and killed. I was happy, had a smile up to my ears when I got summoed by Naggy, I was oom and 40% HP of canniblize. I was happy cause I knew I ghave all of myself for this first life. Then  Idied 5 mroe times healing and then trying to go to naggy and blast. I never did a blast got killed first. I got killed fast even healing cause all tanks or almsot were dead and most of casters just were waiting cause they died once...<br>
<br>
 I also want to complain again about these pure casters who did nt go back to fight after first death. I wil lalso explain why thye, or some of them, did not go back. They DO NOT read patch messages. Let me explain.<br>
 Some weeks ago a patch said that when you die with NO EQUIPMENT on your corpse your dead corpse will NOT decade before 3 hours. And I heard some people saying &quot;GIVE ME A COPPER, GIVE ME A COPPER OR I WILL LOSE MY CORPSE&quot;... I told some of them in private tel, mistake I did since they were too dumb to listen to others, saying they will not lsoe corpse before 3 hours...<br>
<br>
 That is 3 things I saw being a healer in heal line. I thin khealers did a quite good job not regarding some of us did nt die to get mana.<br>
<br>
 We had enough people, ebnough tanks to kill Naggy. I am amazed to know half of thsoe who siged up did nt come. cause we were enogugh without them. IMHO if we failed it's cause of the casters who didn't listen to order aand then didn't do their job.<br>
 I didn't see how the fight in lair went. But I think they didn't pull Naggy off Bridge if I believe all the &quot;GET BACK PULL BACK&quot; shouts I saw. If I m not wrong that means half of the tansk were fightign on bridge, and other half waiting at end of lair for them to pull it. That is liek we sent half of our tanks then waited for them to die and then sending other half...<br>
 You know there wil lalways be soemoen not lsitening to orders. And you don't want it to be yourself. If one or even two tanks fought on bridge then fien let them do, I wouldn't be wrong saying they will die cause of their own fault anbd that even the seond tank might have a genius light seeign he s soloing Naggy everyoen laughing at him, andthat he might pull naggy as far as possible before diing in shame... Yes I exagerate... but I hope I give a good picture of my view on how this raid happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Lagdalen (you will have to explain me why your name is funny hon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and Flarren did a good Job leading. I laugh thinking of those saying they don't do same with their own alliance... If you have spomethign to say, if your alliance does better come on psot below and say what you think, critics wil lhelp our leaders if it's done as built thoughts. My own posts is not to help leader doign a better job though it is to blame those people. No it wo nt help them to be beter next raid, the other posts will have this effect. Let's say my own post is for these persons who wil lnot change and will never listen to orders... <br>
 Let me be hard and make morepeople hate me. If you re not gonna give your life for your leaders, with risk not to get full xp back (that happens soemtiems raids don't have 49+ clerics), with risk to have to wait sittign on your boring butt during corpse run don't come to a dragon raid. Don't come to the raid, cause look at it, the raid didn't need you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubribrisos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bribrisos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/6/01 9:37:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I forgot that...</span><hr size=1>  Thanks a lot to the clerics for the rezes, Ogun, Aeranna, Bain, and maybe others.

Gruz, I would be proud to have you pull for us anytime. I had no idea you were new to the whole tank thing but you volunteered quickly enough and wow man that took guts! Breaking the Magus from Naggy's lair was nothing short of a miraculous job done well.<br>
<br>
To those who died for the cause and to those left standing at the end of the TR incident, what a rush eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I really didn't think we'd live through that one but it was a job very well done by all.<br>
<br>
Buff line - Dogedme, thnx for helpin out Flarren. He and I as you can imagine were inindated with tells and stuff all night and your help was invaluable. Good job to the buffers and raiders for going through stuff so smoothly as well.<br>
<br>
And to those that posted advice above, THANK YOU! Every little bit helps and I dont think we were probably clear enough or had timing down well enough to explain to our Dragon Newbies what was truly required of them. Next time you guys will hate me cause I'm not gonna miss a single thing if I can avoid it lol, but it will be just as important to read the whole thing so as to know whats going on. The more you know the easier it is on everyone.<br>
<br>
We will take down Vox as long as you all have the heart I just read here. Thank you for all of you keeping faith in us.<br>
<br>
And Brisos - Je sait ma grammaire est terrible mais merci beaucoup mon ami, vous ettais las pour moi dans tout le bon est le pas asez bon. Vien est grouper avec moi quand meme tu veux est je suis la pour toi! Encore Merci *bow*<br>
<br>
PS Rbecka I'll find you as soon as I can, look for either of us or Ravenlark (my alt) if you still needed to talk.<br>

Naggy decided to be slow in spawning and I was only available for the first two days he could have spawned.  I do appologize for not being around.  It WON'T happen again.<br>
<br>
From the sounds of things motivation was the lacking factor in this raid, nothing else.  Not motivation on the whole, but motivation for a certain few (no idea who they are) to do what their told and give no regard for exp loss initially.  That's what clerics are for...who gives a damn if you died a lot...you'd get to say you killed Naggy/Vox!<br>
<br>
Just reading about the laziness and half-assed stuff that went on during the raid makes me want to beat the offenders senseless with the arms and legs of the people that died due to their screw-up.  <br>
<br>
I don't know how the leadership of the raids works, but if I EVER see anyone acting anywhere near what has been reported here on a dragon or planular raid, or if i find out anyone was acting like this, you'll never be able to sit again after the ass-chewing I give you.  Raid organizer or not, I will not stand by and watch the fun of others be ruined because some idiot decides that he doesn't want to do it the way he's been told.  <br>
<br>
Raids are not democracies, they're dictatorships.  You do EXACTLY as your told or you don't show your face at another raid again.  That simple.<br>
<br>
Occasional errors are expected, but laziness or &quot;my guild/uber group doesn't do it this way&quot; is no excuse.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp, ya don't like it, don't come. <p>Good Journies,<BR>
