If any of you still play on Luclin, do you remember this day?<br>
<br>
A tale of heroism<br>
	The heat was unbearable, the air thick with steam from the fizzling lava nearby.  Scowls in the dark whispered perilous danger in a glutteral, primitive tongue.  The only bleak light filtering through the dank, musty cavern emmanated from the raw molten pools of bright crimson flame.  However, the combination of these dreary elements did nothing to dampen the spirits of the six who have gathered in the bowels of Norrath known as Solusek.  For these were no ordinary mortals who dared look death in the face and laugh at her insinuating threats, but Dragoons, elite champions of the realm who scoff in the face of danger and brush away fear as if dust upon their mantles. <br>
	"It stinks in here... reaks of goblin dung.  Deris, did you forget to wipe again?"  asked the half-elvin ranger, plugging her nose in disgust. <br>
	"No, Droken made sure I was good and clean before he allowed me to leave those bushes.  I think it's just that time of the month for you, Karmic," sneered the blue-skinned one known as Deris, the faint red light catching the blade of his unholy sword he called Dark Reaver. <br>
	"Rar!" Before the compannions had time to react, death rained from above in the form of an Asian ninja, err... stumpy halfling with rotund belly and the most blank look on his face.  Grinning wide from ear to ear, the nimble Phatz giggled profusely and pointed straight upwards when the shocked expression on their group leader's face clearly asked where the heck he'd come from.  Up above swung a jagged overhanging ledge. <br>
	"Now quit fooling around you guys," commanded Droken, trying to regain his composure and dignity as he dusted off small bits of rock from his pointy ears.  "We must act swiftly before the enchantment placed upon our boots wears off, and the spirit of the wolf leaves us."  He looked back towards their trailing two compannions, a tall Erudian in dark robes and an even darker face, and a scantly clad wood elvin maiden with staff in hand. <br>
	"Is everyone ready?"<br>
	Phatz nodded.  Karmic toyed with her weapons impatiently.  Qvintra thudded her staff to the ground in acknowledgement.  There was a rustling of robes as Calidorn fumbled to equip his duel-wielding beggar's mugs.  Deris drooled.  <br>
	Closing his eyes, Droken slowed his breath and tried to concentrate.  His fingers traced invisible trails of magic in the air unseen to all but the most advanced employers of the arcane.  Channeling this hidden source of power into his own mortal being, he whispered a few words in an ancient tongue as mist arose from the ground to enshroud the party.  One by one, they slowly vanished from sight. <br>
	"Oooooh!  I wanna get to thirty so I can do that too!" giggled Deris with exitement. <br>
	"I still don't understand why we don't just rampage in there and leave a trail of blood and fallen corpses upon the ground to mark where we've been," snarled Karmic, her sword arm eager to unleash its pent up rage upon the nearest victim. <br>
	"It's simple," explained the beggar, err... Calidorn.  "We don't want to have to waste our energy and time on these lowly virmin.  I'm all for avoiding any fight we don't have to engage in." <br>
	Probaby because the weakling would be the first to die, thought Droken although he kept it to himself.  <br>
	And so the six Dragoons embarked upon their first adventure together deep within the core of a fiery mountain.  Although things did not go quite according to plan, they fought as if they've been together all their lives.  Karmic leapt in front of a thrusted dagger, protecting Qvintra with her own body as her invisibility broke and goblins from all around swarmed to attack.  At one point in time Deris faltered, his knee hitting the ground as fatigue enraptured his tired body, but just as the wicked blade of a snarling red goblin was about to do him in, blue light gathered around him as a surge of energy rushed within him, his arms heaving the great two-handed sword straight upwards as if of their own accord, cleaving the beast in two down the midline from groin to head.  <br>
	Magic was in the air.  The acrid stentch of burnt flesh could be smelled.  Red sparks lit up the hallways.  Goblin wizards and shamans, seeing through the veil of deception casted about the compannions, took the initiative to attack, weaving their deathly spells of fire and poisen.  Bolts of pure force arched through their weary bodies as they made their way deeper into the heart of the maelstrom, slowly, but surely.  Bodies of their conquered foes littered the corridors.  <br>
	Inevitably, they made their way to their desired destination, sitting to rest behind a crudely fashioned wooden table left behind by the inhabitants of this soon to be abandoned underground fortress.  Before them loomed an intimidating stone door, marked with the sign of royalty.  There, behind that door, would be their target -- the goblin captain.  <br>
	Binding their wounds, meditating to clear their heads for the ensuing battle to come, the compannions casted spells of protection over their allies and held their breath in anticipation.  Slowly, the stone slab creaked ajar as Deris lead the first two guards to their quick demise.  Six others followed them as the true battle began.  Snarls and threats were issued.  Blades flickered in the dim light.  Bolts of lightning bursted in the room.  Droken did all he could to keep his allies healthy and strong.  Phatz wailed his arms and the ground shook with a mighty tremor, hitting every opponent in the room.  Balls of red energy flew from Qvintra's hands.  Deris slashed madly at his nearby adversaries.  Karmic plunged her blade deep into the heart of a wailing goblin, turning to bash another with her mace as it rushed their casters.  <br>
	"Deris SMASH!!!"  the dark elf howled his furious battle cry. <br>
	Resting amidst battle, Droken gauged the health of his compannions, fighting hard decisions with each course of actions.  The battle was long and hard going, and with each spell casted he had to decide whether stand their ground or admit defeat and flee with their lives.  However, it seemed the advantage was theirs.  <br>
	A shrill cry of panic broke his concentration, his eyes bursting wide open in alarm just in time to catch sight of an escaping goblin.  Rushing to intercept the creature before it could have the oppertunity to alert its friends, Droken sighed in relief as the beast knelt over from a burst of lightning emmanating from his blazing fingers, however, his relief turned to terror as he whitnessed another goblin leap over the body of its fallen comrad to make its way into the hall.  It appears the Dragoons in the room were too preoccupied with their current opponents to notice they'd let one escape.  <br>
	Six more sets of red eyes gleamed in anger through the darkness, and soon a second battle launched itself towards the fatigued compannions before allowing them even a second of rest. <br>
	Run!  Zone!  Fight?  Win?  All these thoughts rushed Droken at once.  Daggers were thrown, a sharp rapier thrusted at him.  Just as the impossibility of conquering such a grim situation sunk into his hard head and the words to a spell of Eastern Wind were upon his lips, a warm light bathed the room.  Many goblins stopped in their tracks.  Standing alert, the Erudian  smirked with his duel beggar's mugs poised for coin collecting.  The goblins stood mesmerized by his bravado as their friends fell to the ground, shrieking horrible curses.  <br>
	More blades swung.  Deris slumped to the ground more than once.  Phatz was having trouble holding his own.  Four goblins still fought desperately to rid their home of these invaders, and it seemed they were about to prevail.  Now?  Should he cast the Eastern Winds now?  No... battered and beaten, not a single one of his compannions showed any signs of fear.  Never once was the thought of retreat whispered, and he wasn't about to be the one to oathe it.  <br>
	Sighing at the seemingly hopeless odds, Droken judged his fatigue and estimated approximately two more heals before total collapse of the body.  Standing tall and proud, he lit off another burst of energy through the body of a bleeding Deris.  One... one more left...  Sitting back down, he tried to meditate a few more ounces of capability from his battle weary body, but lurched in pain as a dagger bit through the thin leather of his tunic and sharply into his arm.  He lept backwards, the goblin ensueing its relentless attacks.  Droken looked to his compannions for aid, but they were all preoccupied with their own battles.  <br>
	VROOM!  The black man chucked his mugs together once again and two more goblins stood mesmerized amidst battle.  <br>
	Run?  He must run.  There is no way to win now... but no... He can't.  They were too deep within the caverns now to make their way out with all members in tact.  Karmic wailed in pain.  Damn it!  He will fight!  Weaving his fingers about as if playing an invisible harp, Droken used his last ounce of mana to chant a prayer of healing.  That's it.. no more.. there would be no more running now.. They will stay and fight and prevail, or they will die. <br>
	"One more!"  Deris yelled as another goblin rushed into the room, weapons drawn. <br>
	Blood spilled.  Sweat poured.  Sparks flew.  Their two bladeswingers were panting in fatigue, their casters were leaning against the walls from sheer exhausting, bleeding profusely themselves, but none seemed to have fallen.  However, three goblins still stood strong and opposing, and one was upon him. <br>
	"Calidorn, mez!" he shouted in panic.<br>
	"Out of mana!  Medding," <br>
	Droken cursed under his breath and ran to the corner of the room in hopes of drawing the goblin's attention towards one of his more stout of body compannions, however, it had other plans.  Just then, searing heat rushed through his body from behind. <br>
	A blazing elemental shouts, "It's wood elves like you who have ruined your own lands, you will not ruin mine!" <br>
	Blood poured from his lips as he is struck from behind, death slowly creeping towards him.  His eyes seeing everything in a soft red light, he saw five Dragoons still holding their own against the remaining goblins, and even in his injured state he remembered an old adventurer's tale of gnomes in these caverns who had a distaste of elementals.  Would he make it?  Would he find their hidden home in this labyrinth?  Or would there be more goblins waiting outside to do him in as he turned the corner from the room?  <br>
	Another bash from hands of fire singed his skin.  He had no choice.  He had to try.  Taking flight, he left the fate of his compannions to the devices of their own skill, the blazing elemental fast behind him.  <br>
	Whether it be the luck of the devil, or in thanks to divine protection from the Mother of All, he managed to make his way to the gnome guards where upon seeing their ancestral enemy, leapt to do battle with the fiery beast. <br>
	"Droken?!" a telepathic message came to him from one of his compannions. <br>
	"I am fine," he replied, a bit too too early as the pair of fiery hands came at him once again.  <br>
	Damn it!  Two gnome guards attacked the elemental fiercly, however it refused to slow its assult on his bleeding, battle-wracked body.  He gauged the health of the elemental and his own.  He would die long before it would... His life flashed before his eyes as he ran deeper still towards more gnome guards, and across a bridge over hot flame.  	<br>
	"Droken?!"  the voice came again. <br>
	"I am fine," he replied yet again, a smidge away from death.  <br>
	More guards rushed the elemental, however it was obvious he had remembered to run to them a little too late.  Beckoning to the gods for greater healing, his weary body relied with insufficient mana.  <br>
	"Gate!" he shouted as the hands struck at him once more.  Regaining his concentration, Droken was able to tear a hole in the fabric of time and space and retreat just before the hands came at him another time, which would've surely done him in.  Out of the corner of his eyes, just before disappearing to ride the winds of teleportation, he caught the face of a panting Phatz who'd rushed  in to assist him.  <br>
	The winds carried him elsewhere far, far away.  Bleeding and exhausted, he collapsed upon the very ground where he was dropped by the spirits of fate, afraid that if even a small orc pawn attacked, it would do him in.  The sweet scent of Kelethin elvin wine and warm baking bread wafting in the breeze assured him in the darkness that he was safe, but how were his friends?  A small voice came to him through the telepathic channel. <br>
	"Droken are you ok?  I came to heal you just as you disappeared."  It was Phatz.  <br>
	"I'm... alive.  Did we lose anyone?"<br>
	"No.. everyone made it.  There are a horde of goblin bodies lying about us, but no captain."<br>
	"Quite alright... we live... and we have prevailed!  Against ungainly odds, we prevailed.. as true Dragoons.  We can always return another day, but what matters most is that we are all alive."<br>
	Just then, a poorly dressed dwarf approached him as he laid there resting amidst a pool of his own blood.  "Good sir, would you be able to spare a few coins for a low level adventurer?" asked the dwarf. <br>
	Beggars... yep.. I'm back in Kelethin alright. <br>

After all this time? <br>
<br>
I've reverted to real life.. or well, tried to anyways. No more nights of playing games all day, 24+ hour sessions, skipping sleep and food, holding restroom visits 'til just before the point of bladder combustion.. heh..<br>
<br>
I moved back to California and am back in school again. It hit me one day that since I moved out to Boston to study, and wasn't studying one bit, but was really just EQ-ing all the time, that I could essentially do the same thing back home and be emmersed within my friends and family.  I thought to continue EQ-ing while going to school, but that didn't work out at all with my procrastinative habbits and all. <br>
<br>
I should really get rid of my Tholuxe accounts though.. have 3 of them still open and I haven't logged in game in like 5 months.  That's 30 bucks a month =( <br>
<br>
I played a lotta non-online games like Civilization 3, Pool of Radiance, and best of all, Baldur's gate 2 and expansion.  I absolutely loved Baldur's gate 2.. played it over consequetively like 3 times.  <br>
<br>
Asside from that, I've gotten into Dungeons and Dragons. My friends and I hardly get a chance to play though with people obligated to school and work.  We meet maybe twice a month, and pity the DM's always on a friggin power trip.  I tried looking for online gaming groups, and there's this great program called openrpg that is designed just for it, but the problem is the DMs I've run into online hardly know half the rules and I hate, as a player character, knowing more rules than the DMs do.  That's like knowing more rules than the GMs in EQ. It just wouldn't work.  <br>
<br>
Wheras you guys make comments on this board, I frequent the D&amp;D board at wizards.com<br>
<br>
Before I quit EQ 5 months ago, I was running a guild on Tholuxe.  It was going pretty successful too.  No power-guild in any shape or form, but we were getting over 30 members 55+, had our rotation about once a month with ragefire.. was really sorry to have to let it go.  I gave the guild access to my characters in this time I've been gone.  Hope I don't log back in stripped one day ;P  That's what happened when I logged into Droken on Luclin one day after playing on Tholuxe.. found 'em naked except for junky stuff in the bank.  Only a few other close friends had his access.    <br>
<br>
Asside from video games, I just discovered the power of Morpheus and have been keeping it on 24/7 downloading anime, movies, porn.... hehe..<br>
<br>
Deris, I'm glad there's no bad blood, bro.  I really miss you, you blue pipsqueek.<br>
<br>
Karmy, you're not married yet, are you? You never invited me to the wedding.. =( and you never write me! =(~<br>
<br>
Whelp, as far as school goes, I'm sitting here typing this right now after getting no sleep last night.. I have an 8 page research report due on wednesday that I haven't started.. *LMAO* an exam for Chemistry I just today found out will be comprehensive.. and I don't even know when my math exam will be.  Yet instead of studying, I'm checking e-mails and answering message boards.. heh.<br>
<br>
How're you two doing and what have you been up to?<br>
<br>
With best wishes,<br>

<br>
Your into D&amp;D? I dont know ya but I used to play AD&amp;D a LOT in college and in high school. (Yes that IS an admission of geekdom I suppose, but I was on SC too so *ppffffffttt*) I always played the DM, and had quite a following, and am very well versed in the system. So if you and your friends playing online, where would I go to find out more about this OpenRPG? I also know one or two more peeps who might want to play D&amp;D but 2 or 3 people arnt much of a game.  Might be fun to run a campaign or 2 again. Generally Im more of a &quot;Player's DM&quot;. I like to be a storyteller, not some lunatic who designed a pet dungeon and only wants victims.   <p>Balearon Stridingwolf<br>
