<br>
-You and I talk, agree that the guild to kill Aaryonar gets N tov. Our other rotations remain the same and respected.<br>
<br>
- For 3 weeks, we stay out of N tov honoring the agreement.<br>
<br>
-After hearing that our agreement wasn't known by members of bots, just as Emil has posted below, I talk to you and you say that Bots would go into N tov when we kill Aaryonar.<br>
<br>
-You annul the agreement, we go in to N tov. Our other rotations remain the same and respected.<br>
<br>
You can bring up however you &quot;felt&quot; disrespected in ST as much as you want, but racism from Sssorn is more disrespect than anything game related. My members can thank themselves for going into POM and killing N tov dragons. If Aaryonar was up more than one day we would go at him too. But, at this point he isn't and knowing that if we went at him the next 11 dragons would be dead is pointless. Cut the political @#%$ and YOU send me a tell saying the agreement is back on, or things will continue how they are. Lame threats and cheesy flaming do @#%$.<br>

Reply  Re: A question for the guild leaders.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 After reading every post on both subjects that Fitten started, I'm going to try to be a voice of reason.<br>
1) Shei says Mista told him that if we killed Aary, they still wouldn't let us at any of the NToV Dragons after he was dead cause they'd go in afterwards and kill them after our raiding slot was over.<br>
2) Mista says it was never discussed because he wouldn't start discussions on NToV rotations until we have proven our ability to kill Aary. Much as the same rationale as we've used for several other Boss Mobs to get on a rotation.<br>
3) 1+2 means MISCOMMUNICATION, why the heck are we, as well as a large number of BoTS members, starting all this &quot;hate&quot; crap over a mistake? We're mad, they're mad, big friggen deal. Take a deep breath, and go back and actually try to come to an agreement about NToV AFTER we kill Aary, just as we started in on rotations for Trak, Tormax, Dain, CT, ect....<br>
4) If BoTS have asked for a rotation on ST, and Vindi/Statue, then I wholeheartedly agree that we should have one. We have farmed the crap out of both for quite awhile now, while the loot is nice, I would prefer to wait even longer for a chance at Primal *anything*, and be able to play without the anger/annoyance that became part of everyday life before the server split. <br>
5) I don't think any of our Leaders/Officers did anything shady intentionally. A miscommunication about NToV lead to an action which has inflamed relations between 2 guilds that used to, and should again, get along very well.<br>
6) I also feel, that if a rotation was asked for with ST/Vindi/Statue, then not doing so was wrong. It takes us a little while longer to get thier loot drops, so what? We've come to grips with the idea that every melee isn't going to get a Bile Choker right away, and every caster isn't going to get a Brain right away, Statue loot and Primals can be looked at the same way. I feel mutual respect and cooperation between large Guilds over a limited number of spawns is more important than getting as much loot as quick as we can.<br>
7) Concerning the Tindi/Zlandicar issue and us &quot;bullying&quot; them.<br>
Am I the only one that was present there that still remembers that they only had 24-27 people, about 75% of whom where level 55-59? They did not have sufficent force there with thier classes to kill the beast, it was a matter of FCFS, and even so we sat back to let them try. I saw them self-train themselves the first time, before second train I went LD at waterfall, got back on at waterfall to be greeted by Zland and immeadiatly turned into dragon-chow. Cause of dragon being there? I didn't see what/who, and there are lots of stories on both sides, take your pick.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Concerning Doz/Telk and confrontations with NB&amp;Tindi? Not on-line at time, lots of neat stories to choose from, your choice again.<br>
9) I, for one, will not play this game if this situation degenerates into the mass flames/hate/petty bickering that characterized The Rathe when CiW, KEG, and BoTS all vied for a very finite number of mobs in Kunark, competition is good, aggrevation isn't.   <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0"><area href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/rana1.jpg" coord="0, 1, 319, 239" shape="rect"></map><img border="0" src="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/rana1small.jpg" usemap="#FPMap0" width="240" height="180"><br><b><font face="comic sana MS" size="2"> 60th Level Warder <br><a href="http://oelph.com/sotsite/">Wolflord, Sprit of Tunare</a><br> The Rathe<br></font</b></p>  </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzranamule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zranamule</A> at: 10/31/01 1:45:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uqanin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qanin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 2:28:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> Definitly a 9.8 out of 10 here.

<br>
Circa server split:<br>
<br>
CT became CT2.0<br>
BotS killed 1st, and we had the luxury of being the sole killers for about 1 month.  Almost every time he poped, we had no problem whatsoever letting SoT take shots at him, and onec he was killed we established a rotation - with provisions for other guilds across the rathe to make requests to try him.  <br>
<br>
Since then, RF, NB, Tindi has tried him, NB has killed him.  NB was consequently added to the rotation.  People are still free to try him.  But, and this is the big but - not for multiple days in a row.<br>
<br>
Dain Frostreaver.<br>
BotS was the only guild killing Dain (with the exception of perhaps KEG, prior to split - my memory slips me here) for an extremely long period of time.  However SoT made several attempts on Dain.  Never once did BotS pressure SoT, or attempt any form of harassment in the situation.  We willingly, and quite patiently let you try him upwards of 3 or 4 times on given days.  SoT killed him, we established a rotation.<br>
<br>
Zlandicar.<br>
For a long time, BotS was the only guild to kill this dragon.  I believe SoT tried him a few times prior to killing him.  Once SoT killed him, we have not seen him alive (save one extremely late night when we attempted him with what, 17? needless to say we didnt kill him).  Since this time, i believe Tindi has tried him at least 2 times, both ending with reports of SoT bullying / Leapfrogging / Training / KSing.  Tindi has killed him now (i believe) and there is no mention whatsoever of any form of rotation.<br>
<br>
Klandicar.<br>
See Zlandicar<br>
<br>
Vindicator<br>
Moot - he spawns about 2x a day.<br>
<br>
Statue of Rallos.<br>
Again, BotS killed the Statue long ago, and had him to ourselves for quite some time.  I believe RF has killed him at least once, and I know NB has killed him a few times.  Since SoT was able to kill him, they have taken probably 90% of the Statues - again no mention of rotation, in fact a rejected offer from BotS (fitten).<br>
<br>
Tormax.<br>
Same story, SoT entered recently - we have a rotation now.<br>
<br>
Sleepers Tomb.<br>
BotS has this entire Zone to ourselves for an extremely long time.  After we woke kerafrym, we changed sleepers (not on purpose, i blame kendrick).  The mobs there now are substantially easier to kill.  The zone is not dangerous anymore.  What has happened principally is 3 primal dropping mobs pop every 48 hours.  Since SoT first killed these 3 golems, BotS has perhaps killed them 3 times each.  A rotation was rejected when asked for.<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is power, and the responsibility to use that power in a mutually benefitial way, spanning all those involved (read: the rathe server).  <br>
<br>
BotS has been in power for as long as i can remember.  With very few exceptions, i think we have handled this power quite well - trying to be fair, and trying to share with people who achieve a level to glean rewards from killing certain mobs.<br>
<br>
All rotations are fundamentally based on sharing, in addition they are based on bringing MAXIMUM loot to a server.  This is why we, on the RTA have tried to make provisions that CT dies w/in 24 hours of spawn.  This precident has been set, and is carried out on basically all rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
I can tell you for a fact, that if Tindi didnt kill Dozekar the day he last spawned, then NB's dozekar would have never poped last night, before the patch.  It is benefitial to kill mobs fast.<br>
<br>
How does this apply to Shei's wanting to have an entire zone rotated to him by killing 3/14 of the mobs there:  <br>
<br>
Firstly, killing arrynar does not by any means give proof that SoT is capable of killing the other 12 dragons.  Fundamentally, to get on a rotation, you must kill the mob (this stems from the track rotation and has been a cornerstone of the entire rotation process).<br>
<br>
Secondly, If by killing arrynar, you think that mistabone somehow aggreed to leave ToVn to sot untill you learn/kill/ or leave the zone, indefinately is honestly crazy.  The first one being the time involved.  What you are asking for (or saying mista said - which i do not think he meant - ie: you misinterpreted) is analagous to letting a guild who can clear fear try to kill CT all week long, simply because they cleared the zone.  It is not condusive to spawns entering the game.<br>
<br>
One of the major reasons SoT is getting a lack of cooperation with BotS is the way you, as a guild has handled your corner on the market involving the statue, zlandicar and sleepers.  You have a time zone advantage - it is undeniable although many are denying it.  You, in effect have power here, over these 3 mobs - and you have demonstrated that when you have power you abuse it.<br>
<br>
On Zlandicar, there should be a rotation with tindi bots and sot, if you want to follow the precidents.<br>
<br>
On the statue there should be a rotation with nb bots sot rf, if you want to follow the precidents.<br>
<br>
On sleepers, there shoud be a rotation with tindi bots sot, if you want to follow the precidents.<br>
<br>
You have the power in the above three instances, and you are letting your greed supercede the peace of the server.<br>
<br>

The thing that gets me is Falconus calling us zergs.  Rofl man, good one.  Yes, we zerged tormax that ONE time.  If you saw the aftermath of the fight, you prolly laughed, hell I laughed.  If you would have stuck around you could have seen him die cleanly after, with no zerging involved.  The thing that gets me is that this is coming from a member of NB.  I don't have an issue with most of your members, as I don't with just about every guild.  But you coming here and calling US zergs is funny.  Isn't this the guild that lost to cazic with ~85 in the zone?<br>
<br>
As for spying..most of that is in your minds.  If you look at the mobs we've killed, then look at what strategy was used..sure they may be similar.  Does that mean we 'stole' them?  Errrr no.  You say we stole Vindi tactic, not true.  We didn't even fight in the same spot as you in the beginning..near same area but not the same spot.  We did not steal pulling tactics on vindi.  I should know..me and Haxxe pulled our first vindi, and it took a while doing it, as we had to figure out how.  For tormax?  If you think we couldn't pull tormax without stealing bots tactics, watch the pull a bit closer.  It's not brain science, it's not even hard.  As for fighting at WL zone?  Duh.  The actual fight?  Like any velious fight..its not something you have to steal.  Mista, about yelinak..you are wrong.  We fight in a totally different spot than you..ask Fitten, he is at all of our raids..he should be able to tell you.  You saying our members at your raids is a joke.  You have people in our eyes every single @#%$ tov raid.  Every dain, who was above the ice?  Fitten.  Yelinak tries, who was sitting IN our camp?  Fitten.  You think you can sit people in our camps watching us fight because you have already killed the mobs?  It goes both ways, you can't have members sitting IN OUR CAMP while we are fighting then bitch at us for having a member in the same damn zone.  Bind sight...we don't use it on bots, sorry.  Think that if you want, but we don't.  BoTS uses it on us every fuggin tov raid.<br>
<br>
For tindi and zland, and everyone who wasn't there, you shouldn't believe everything you hear.  We would in no way go in on a mob that was already being fought..if they beat us, they beat us..wait for them to kill or die as has happened in the past on zland.  I wasn't even at this incident, but from what I hear, Merloc claimed to agro first by using staff of temp flux? (correct me if im wrong, of course.)  Heh. <p>Lazreth Bonechiller<BR>

<br>
Racism is only possible when there is a race of people involved. National boundaries do not constitute race, and it belittles people who have been racially discriminated against to suggest that disliking members of a particular country, or continent, is racisim. Certainly  Sssorn's posts do carry a weight of anti-european sentiment, to which any who suggest otherwise would have to be seen as willfully blind, but he has not been racist. <br>
<br>
Oh, and for my part for this flame, while CoH past hard mobs may have tactically been a great advantage, which obviously it was, it was, bottom line, bad form. Even as a non-uber raider, I can see that. Had it been BotS that CoH'd past, I'd say the same thing: I expect more from the big guys. <br>

<br>
Once again lying to everyone to try and make what you did was ok. I said many MANY times kill roy and we'd talk.<br>
<br>
- For 3 weeks, we stay out of N tov honoring the agreement.<br>
No for 2 of 3 weeks you got chewed up and spit out by Roy in quick fashion. Week 4 you can't take it anymore and decide to bottomfeed and quite frankly preform the lamest act this server has seen to date. Looks to me from your members posts lots of them agree with me on this.<br>
<br>
-After hearing that our agreement wasn't known by members of bots, just as Emil has posted below, I talk to you and you say that Bots would go into N tov when we kill Aaryonar<br>
Got lies? I said kill roy and we'd talk AGAIN and AGAIN while you were babbling on more than sssorn on a 5 coffee morning. And his mouse pointer poised on refresh on noows.<br>
<br>
-You annul the agreement, we go in to N tov. Our other rotations remain the same and respected<br>
You broke the agreement not us Have you killed roy? No. After all your lies and totally lame acts over the past month will we reach one? Probably not you have proven that you cannot be trusted. And will only deal in any way when something favors you. See the pleanty of documented posts about ST, Statue, Zland rotations.<br>
<br>
-You can bring up however you &quot;felt&quot; disrespected in ST as much as you want, but racism from Sssorn is more disrespect than anything game related<br>
Boo Hoo? Got report? If someone is acting out of line in racial terms let the GM's take care of him i dont care if its one of my members tindi or anyone else. Sssorn is one person. Not 9 of my guild members including 2 officers. One person is not 4 or 5 members spying on every thing you do to get tactics because you cant develop your own.<br>
<br>
-If Aaryonar was up more than one day we would go at him too<br>
Want us to leave him up for a week? Sure otw! Get a grip you hypocritical fuckstick. You wont even wait 5 minutes on yelinik for a bots member to do a quest. Delay statue for an hour so we can try the AOW. Yea we'll leave him up for a week for you'll to see how fast you can take a one way ticket to keal. You have proven that you cannot be trusted and i'm pretty sure every other guild on this server see's the same thing so please keep babbling it gets deeper every post.<br>

<br>
On Kland, he stays up roughly 90% of the time, we killed him i believe on sat or sunday, theres been weeks where if bots didn't kill him he died with the reset, he's simply not killed that much.<br>
<br>
Sot has maybe 20 european players, out of a guild that has approx 70 active members, thats less than half the guild.<br>
<br>
Do we like to kill early? yes, because it allows us to have the forces we need on to do so.  Do we do it because it locks us in to a spawn?  hardly.<br>
<br>
As it gets later other guilds gain that advantage, the reason a 24 hour window is specified for many of these mobs is because of SoT's euro population whihc means if something spawns late at night we have the following day to kill.<br>
<br>
Bots and other guild want the spawns on timetables they can handle killing, I respect and understand that request, sot wishes the same thing, what that does it cuts sot out of the equation, essentially the same thing happening that we are being acused of doing, only in reverse.<br>
<br>
Whats the answer?  Rotations plain and simple, do i think we have done well on rotations, yes we have honestly, i've never had a problem getting with Bots or NB to swap a day or take our turn because mob x spawned to late for us.<br>
<br>
The problem is this with Ntov, when sot takes down Aary, we will want to be able to know the following day or 2 we can go in and take down the rest of the dragons, thus establishing the &quot;killing of the mobs&quot; in a rotation, what deal we thought we had with bots originally was to allow that.<br>
<br>
Now as you are saying if Bots goes in and cleans out the remaining 11 dragons after sot nails Aary, how do we prove we can kill them?  We wait and try to kill them the next week only to have it happen again?  There definitely needs to be something worked out here tho.<br>
<br>
I personally don't know what the answer is, but i think if our 2 guilds sit down and have a open minded meeting about it we can come to some agreement that will end this mess that has happened, if it ends up with more rotations then great if it allows peace.<br>
<br>
Thats my thoughts on this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umadleon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madleon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 3:09:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> Good points Emil...<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, by the actions taken by SoT I doubt that any of that will ever happen. I've been observing what they have been doing the last few months and am very dissapointed by their actions. I'm sure they'll go on to say they don't give a flying fork or whatnot but whatever, that doesn't matter. That just shows they don't have respect for anyone else on the server. They have shown time and time again, they will only comply with a neighboring guild if it's in their best interests only. <br>
<br>
I have watched SoT on numerous occasions show no respect to the other guilds of the Rathe and kill what they want. I have heard and witnessed first hand about the aforementioned spying, leapfrogging and KSing, this has happened numerous times so your denials and excuses are futile.<br>
<br>
The solution is simple though folks. Show them the same courtesy they have shown everyone else. Consider any mob that they have planned, camped or prepped for open game. Consider their personal camps open as well. I have seen them do this large scale and small and they deserve the same treatment they emplore daily. Make a point to your buffer's and porters not to provide any assistance to SoT in any form. They don't deserve any help from neighboring guilds and since they consider themselves above everyone, they can handle their own daily chores of travel and buffs. Again, they will remark how they do this anyways as they are beyond uberiffic and everyone is but the dried jizm on the tips of their enormous euro penii and that's great because you'll never get any assistance from me. <br>
<br>
The best course of action is really a simple one. Apply for /movelog. Since most of SoT is euro trash, why not? It will save the embarrassment of broken english in /ooc and think of the new guilds you can f*ck over! Oh what fun. Maybe you can strike a deal with RF so they don't let your little secret out. You'll never be more uber than BoTS so just give up now and hope you're the best of the euro scum (that's like winning a medal in the special olympics).<br>
<br>
Man, I really hope SoT moves into Shadowbane when it comes out. At least there you will pay for your antics and I know alot of people will be licking their chops waiting for ya.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umistabone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mIstabone</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 3:16:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> Laz you are being brainwashed into accepting your bottomfeeder status as well shei is doing a knock up job. I watched 4 to 5 of your players follow our pullers step by step for 4 tomax raids in a row. Of course it was in my mind I watched it! And its pretty obvious they were taking pleanty of notes.<br>
&quot;watch the pull a bit closer. It's not brain science, it's not even hard&quot; Then why do it? However sot members continued to for not one not two but FOUR tomax killings.<br>
<br>
Yea Fittens stealing tactics on mobs that we've killed 50 times now like dain. Or 25 like yelinik. He likes to eat popcorn and see how fast the /who spirt goes to zero. Think he said the record was 30 - 40 seconds for 40 people on zlec yesterday keep up the good work!<br>
<br>
&quot;Mista, about yelinak..you are wrong. We fight in a totally different spot than you&quot; Then why does andreass feel the need to watch all our raids on mobs that you HAVEN'T killed. Why do your officers like Nhyca and Thunderon bring more peopel into ST when its obvious with the 30 people we have there what were doing? Theres a big difference between eatting popcorn and watching people fall over that fitten does and what your lame people do as of late. <p><br>

I dont intentionally train anyone.  It is true i didn't really wanna be at the Doze attempt. I felt that we would not kill any thing else to finsih any quest any time soon thus killing it was  a waste. But i will go where guild goes. In those tells i thought we were both having a good laugh about this and that. Making jokes about trains and such. But it was no more than blowing sunshine up your ass im afraid. Since what was gonna happen was gonna be bad for u guys i thought a smile might lift your spirits.Actually  everyone will remember that the ancient wvern we fought just before we rushed doze was pushed in the column there in the center and he &quot;poofed&quot;. Of course i was first one summoned and died on the spot.  If mobs came after that , then thats some funny @#%$ and can see where u would say i trained my guild.  Since we were just talking about it.  But i had to run back to tov from kael. i missed the entire doze attmpt and had to get a coffin for body.<br>
<br>
Im not going to result to name calling here or any thing rude to anyone. I just wanted to clear up this matter as it was brought to my attention by a few poeple.  I have friend in TL  NB  / BoTs  i personally have np with anyone...  most of us are all old school players who have known each other befoer we were guilded.  Don't go saying @#%$ about me to try and get back at the guild as a whole. Yes i did say i dont know why the @#%$ we bother killing this mob... but that is all i said. <br>
I have no beef with anyone on server. If u have beef with SOT  plz take it up with leaders. And not individuals.  Thats about all i got to say bout that...   see ya   online.            BTW  im trying to type this on a laptop since main comp is at tormax so  tons of grammer errors<br>

You've seen them complain about how they all lag and go LD when there are like two other people near them? Clearly the computers they buy in Belgium (no doubt made of waffles and tulips) can barely take the pressure of one person on the screen, much less two. They are scared to admit that their third world computers can't take the heat, though, so on their webpage (which is written using special Flemish coding techniques, which is why half the links are broken) they feel the need to post flowery excuses for their failures. I look forward to the day of honesty when Shei or Wendel will post:<br>

We failed to Vulak'aer because I gutted part of my computer to put a can of beans near the processor to keep it warm. Oh, I am so hungry, and the tundra of Brussels so harsh.

We play the game for fun, not as an outlet for our hormones.<br>
<br>
When a mob spawns, the cry is always, &quot;Quick, everyone to Zone X, there is no one at Mob X and he's up!&quot;<br>
<br>
We do not shout, &quot;Quick, everyone to Zlandicar, Tindi'Losi is there, but they are slow buffers, so maybe we can accidently train them, and steamroll them to Zlandicar while they are rebuffing&quot;.<br>
<br>
Why yes, that's R-E-S-P-E-C-T... Something that Spirit of Tunare lacks as a guild, as least in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Do you care what my opinion is? Maybe not, but it does affect many things to a certain degree, and if Spirit of Tunare wants to change my opinion, along with the opinions of many others on The Rathe, they are going to have to change themselves as a guild.<br>
<br>
I could list and nitpick the details of many instances that Spirit of Tunare has committed offenses against Tindi'Losi, but I won't. Suffice it to say, respect is an institution which is mutually beneficial to all parties who enter into it.<br>
<br>
From my vantage point, Spirit of Tunare is happy enough to accept respect from other guilds, when it comes to sharing spawns.  However, when the time comes to reciprocate, they are sorely lacking.  In effect, they are gaming the system.<br>
<br>
Respect has nothing to do with likes or dislikes.  There many guilds on The Rathe, and often times I find myself involved in disputes.  But there is always an element of respect in those disputes, lines that most guilds will not cross.  Why? Because of respect, you have to give it to get it.<br>
<br>
If Tindi'Losi has misjudged The Spirit of Tunare, prove us wrong, agree to rotations for Zlandicar, Statue, and other uber mobs.<br>
<br>
But until then, you are savages, reason and diplomacy are tricks and diversions that you use to your advantage.<br>
<br>
I speak for myself, and for Tindi'Losi in my position as Ambassador.<br>
<br>
Diplomacy is Dead.<br>
<br>
Within the rules governing EverQuest, and the RTA we will assume that at all times your intentions are dishonorable and hostile, and act accordingly.  When you enter into a zone with us, we will assume that your intention is to spy, train, ks, ninjaloot, or harass.<br>
<br>
Our respect was offered for free, but our contempt you have hard earned.<br>
<br>
I really don't care if you hate me (send me hate mail), or think I'm a dick.  I have nothing against individual members of Spirit of Tunare, outside the leadership.  Unfortunately, I have no choice... I will be an ass to any person wearing the guild tag &quot;Spirit of Tunare&quot;.  The only alternative is to bend over and let them to continue to abuse the respect we've shown them in the past, but will no longer.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
If you want the respect of Tindi'Losi again, it needs to be earned.  Agree to rotations on ST, Zlandicar, and The Statue... until then, there isn't anything else to say.<br>

<br>
What we did last night is to be considered lame yes, but not all our members (read: including me) knew the exact reason why we did it, until this morning I thought BotS refused any sort of rotation on NToV. Seems I was wrong...<br>
<br>
But does the entire god damn server have to jump on us for that? One day you're Cr'ing a guild in fear, the next day they'll call you evil KS'ers who leapfrog for mobs and bind rush Tormax <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
It's gone beyond bad taste now, it's just aweful seeing my entire guild slurred like that, even by people we've helped loads in the past...<br>
What exactly do we do wrong... almost anything we kill is on a rotation, and if it's not we're competing with either NB/TL or RF.. WTF are those people from other guilds posting here how evil we are? You don't even know us, maybe you once met one of our members in velks and couldn't stand him, tough luck, don't call me names for it.<br>
<br>
Oh and 1 more thing, I'd like to see proof of everything we're being accused off, like 90% of it is BS...<br>
<br>
What I know is that we don't spy (yes, we don't, we don't need to, you're not gods gift to this game, every guild with strong leadership can accomplish @#%$), we don't train on purpose (prove me wrong), and we definitely don't KS (trust me, if we had KS'd that Zland TL would have petitioned us, but they know they have no foot to stand on, logs show when and on who a mob aggro's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Less speculating, more facts...<br>
