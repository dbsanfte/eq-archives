Gor and others are removed from the rot list because the list would be &quot;stupid large&quot;; when does Sev hit that stupid large list?<br>

I would bet that several of the bigger guilds are no longer interested in Gor, Tal and Fay... just a guess though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugafgariondaslanty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gafgarion Da Slanty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 12:38:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Named drakes in doze wing.....</span><hr size=1> nycah please lock this post to consolidate the posts for the drakes/named argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 12:50:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Named drakes in doze wing.....</span><hr size=1> Not true Shadyn, we have a bard who needs his scale and a paladin or two that need frost books.

I personally have no qualms about making Tal or Gore on rotation, but I understand some of the frustrating issues about it.  Faydedar is not up long enough to be considered for rotation however. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can see how this would have been misunderstood, and I'm glad to have the chance to clear it up. <br>
<br>
If you propose that the named drakes are free for all, and anyone can kill them whenever they feel like, and that it is at least desireable to do so, you will no doubt find that it makes completing the quests involved far more time consuming than needs to be. No one wants that, I'm sure. <br>
<br>
If you propose that anyone who can kill the named drakes can get on a rotation for them, you will find a long list of guilds, only some of which can actually kill dozekar. That also makes completing the quests much more lengthy and unnecessairily so. Alone, they are too easy for a rotation, yes. <br>
<br>
However, since we are not talking about them alone on a rotation, that point is moot. We're talking about them being on a rotation with Dozekar, which, to the best of my knowledge, is not easy, compared to the named drakes in any event. <br>
<br>
Now that the example of ToVN has been clairified for us, I would still submit that it is a relevent example: Many mobs of various difficulty falling under the same rotational situation. <br>
<br>
Seems polite and fair to me. /shrug<br>

<br>
We sometimes have people come here and say why do you have a rotation on some mobs but not others. We need to understand why each mob is on the list, wheather it is there for a quest or because it is hard. To explain to others on why we are doing what we are doing, we need to know first. Hence my discussions.<br>
<br>
my 2cp, doz and the named need to be combined. Gore shouldnt be added to the list; but I do wonder why Trak and Sev are still on the list. Loot? Quests? what? Gor, Fay, Tal all have similar loot and quests and such on them.<br>

<br>
Agreed! I, as a member of a guild that would someday like to be on the dozekar rotation, I'd like to see the named drakes and doze as a group. Gore, I believe, because the mob is so readily accessable, that the rotations would be long, and few and far between. Same with Talendor. Small groups of wizards notwithstanding, the mobs can often be up for a while. <br>
<br>
Trakanon I believe because of the keys to Veeshan's peak, which allow access to a relatively empty zone, with nice loot, and above all, a relatively untapped source of green scales (Wahoo!). <br>
<br>
Fay, the real fay, wouldn't be, because as I understand, he depops after 4ish hours. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think that, mostly, it is due to their accessability: Talendor, Gorenaire, Kalor'dar (Velious, I know, but not a bad example) all exist in zones which have teleport pads for both teleporting classes, can be killed with a relatively small number of people by guilds at the higher end, drop pieces that are not the most rare to get ahold of, etc etc etc. <br>
<br>
I would think a gore/talendor rotation would be prohibitively long, but I'd be at least interested to see how it worked. However, I'm certainly not going to call for a rotation on every mob that I'd ever like to kill. <br>
<br>
Thats me though.<br>

<br>
For quite a while, Sev was the ONLY source of green scales for the warrior epic.<br>
<br>
So being that it was a FFA mob, smaller guilds who were capable of killing Sev, but not capable of mobilzing as fast were cut out from getting their warriors epic weapons.<br>
<br>
This being the case, The Rathe Commuity as a whole decided it would only be fair to put Sev on rotation so guilds could have a shot at getting their warroirs their epics.<br>
<br>
Since that time, one other source of green scales has been added, Hoshakr in Veeshan's Peak.  Still not a readily available source, so Sev has stayed on rotation.  Maybe not the fastest way to get warrior epics out, but the most fair to the server as a whole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 2:49:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: mobs</span><hr size=1> Trakanon is still on the rotation for the newer/smaller guilds to continue to have shots at Kunark armor.

<br>
Trakanon can be killed by a single group of well outfitted/AA skilled players.  He is trivial for two groups.  The rotation is there so that the higher tiered guilds will respect the rotation and leave it alone for the most part. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 11:51:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadynstormsurge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadynstormsurge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 4:03:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   mobs</span><hr size=1> well gromm, if trak is on the rot list to let smaller newr guilds get kunark armor, and sev is on there for war epics.

I am not trying to make waves, but if your reasoning for this one yes and that one no is not sound, we should look at it again.<br>
<br>
if you are going to reply, expain gor isnt on the list without using reasoning that works on another dragon that is on the list.
