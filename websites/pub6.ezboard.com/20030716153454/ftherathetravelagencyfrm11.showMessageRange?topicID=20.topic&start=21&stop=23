As Deus Factum was specifically mentioned in the first post in this thread, we feel we need to respond. <br>
<br>
Gondil, a respected member of Deus wrote an excellent post on our DF board and we feel it serves as an appropriate reply. I was thinking of editing some of this post, but decided to keep the enitire post intact, thanks very much.<br>

I just read this thread tonight, and I need to point something out and explain why Deus Factum had to cancel the Sky raid so late in the evening...I was not there, I was tied up in RL, but this is what happened that night.<br>
<br>
In DF, someone has to step up and organize every raid in our guild, but the 3 planes raids were not treated any differently than each other. This is where we made our mistake. Hate and Fear are much easier to organize for, as I'm sure you know. The Sky raid was posted, and a raid thread was begun to get attendance listed in our Events forum as it standard for us. There were many people who could not make this Sky raid from DF for RL reasons, though, so the person who stepped to do this raid, being inexperienced, invited some individual guests and another guild; ironically enough, YOUR GUILD, to fill in some of the blanks for the raid. He thought it was safe to depend on outside assistance for key classes for Sky like Clerics, Wizards, and Necros.<br>
<br>
Well, Trak was up that night and CIW wanted him. Guess what happened? Most of the &quot;outside help&quot; failed to show, and we could not get replacements...so the raid had to be cancelled after everything bogged down once people were up there (yes, DF did go up). We could have legitimately IMO, since DF did go up, just hopped off the island and said &quot;raid complete&quot; and went on our merry way, and we would have no &quot;letter of the law&quot; violation. Instead, Dauldon came here since our rep was not around and cancelled the raid, so that even though it was late, somebody might have a shot at using the plane that night.<br>
<br>
In addition, we took steps to ensure that this will not happen again. Unlike Hate and Fear, where we just reserve the first dates available, we will no longer book *any* Sky dates until an organizer takes the lead for the raid first and proves they have enough people in the right classes. In effect, we have removed our own Sky postings for a period at yet undetermined. If you want to push to remove our next Sky date as would be the normal punishment as I understand it, then we have already taken this action for you, although I suppose we could book a date for Sky and you could then take it away from us if that will make you feel better.<br>
<br>
The organizer of the raid has said he will never try to do another, in spite of many in our guild trying to tell him it was not entirely his fault and to not be so down on himself about it. He learned a harsh lesson: loot is always #1 for some people, even when they seem to be your friends and have given you a commitment.<br>
<br>
As always, I speak for myself, not my guild.<br>

I'm sorry the raid fell through, and my post was nothing personal against DF. I had been in contact with Hexum about swapping Friday with you guys, or doing a combo raid to show you guys the ropes. I got no response from anyone but Hexum, and he said someone would get in touch with me, or post on our board. So we made other plans when we recieved no replies. Give me a tell in game if you want to speak on the subject....Q <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ustygar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stygar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clan Icewind Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/9/01 6:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqraid.org/images/characters/qwaifitz2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: KoP asking for help on non-god day wtf?</span><hr size=1> Hrm can't edit the post above.
