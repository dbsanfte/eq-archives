<br>
Only 2 guilds are on the rotation atm and neither guild really needs the loot from them...so the mobs basically get sat on for weeks at times because of this, and guilds like mine that would actively pursue the mobs for the loot upgrades cannot.<br>
<br>
I don't think there should be a problem with SoY going down to attempt to get on the ancients rotation after VoF has passed to NB and NB has sat on the mobs for over a week.  I dont see why this should be like the Statue/Idol/AoW rotation, the amount of times a guild should attempt AoW is limited so that no spawns are wasted.  In this case no spawns are wasted if we fail on the 4th Dragon, however there are being a ton of ST Ancients wasted from the mobs being left up and passed on and repassed on.  <br>
<br>
It's my opinion that the way the rotation is set up mobs are up to long and new guilds have to wait longer than they should to try.  I think its appropriate to set some sort of limit to how long the current guilds have to clean up ST, and if they fail to do so they can 'pass' and then the mobs would go FFA, and not just to the next guild who will more than likely be farming PoP or Ssra and will get to ST when they feel like it because it really cant be touched by many guild and the loot almost isnt even worth it to them.<br>

<br>
Thats my point exactly!  VoF wont go down to do their job as 'clean up' if less than 4 mobs are up, hrmm guess what neither will NB.  So why isnt SoY allowed to go down and attempt to kill them?  Otherwise the mobs are left up for a full week and then its still VERY possible that the next guild up will pass anyways.   It would be well worth it for us.  <br>
<br>
The rotation rules should be changed anyways....if you can kill the 4th Dragon(AE Slow) you should be put on the rotation.  Anyone who has fought the dragons knows that if you can beat him you can kill anything in ST.<br>

<br>
Which is no matter what name is applied to the rotation, Guilds cannot kill the ancients without it being on their MoTG/Prog rotation turn, and the only 2 guilds who are allowed to kill the ancients dont do it often and the mobs remain up for an extended period of time. <br>
<br>
The rules make it so that these mobs never go FFA, and so the mobs remain up and are not effectivly being killed, even though the guild who is up for them isnt killing them because its not worth their time.  That makes absoutely no sense.<br>

Never had a tell from ANY guild. EVER.<br>
<br>
I just look at the rot calendar what guild is up, and if they have marked their turn as being done. If I know it's a guild that is not going after the Ancients, then we go in and kill the Ancients (ALL of them). If there's only 1 or 2, we don't bother, nor does NB.<br>
All of you can get on the rotation, on your turn. Simple as that, but with only 2 guilds on rotation we have come to an agreement of a *loose* rotation, sort of like Tunare now if some kind of a *loose* rotation because of many guilds passing. If you make it on the rotation we will mark that we are passing in a timely manner so you can go in and take your turn.<br>
It is really no use that we pass today, NB passes tomorrow, we pass again the day after tomorrow, NB passes the day after that and so on and so forth. If there is only 1 or 2 up we pass. Simple. You cannot FORCE us to go in and clean them. If we take the loot to our destroy button because noone needs it, it is as much of a waste as if it is eaten by a patch. If we let them stay up, then a week later all of them will be up again (if no patch in between) and then we can go in and kill all 4 if the ST guild didn't kill them.<br>
By the description in the rotations section it is indeed a clean up, I didn't notice that. Point scored for you. But noone is harmed or misses out on any loot but ourselves if we pass.<br>
Just get on the rotation and you can get them too and you will get many chances to kill because  Vof won't be changing how we do this, and I doubt that NB will.<br>

Yeah but that means there are 2 less Ancients spawned, so basically 2 mobs wasted.  Which is part of my concern.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By the description in the rotations section it is indeed a clean up, I didn't notice that. Point scored for you. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Not keeping score here, just trying to show the RTA my logic, this is by no means me fighting against VoF and or NB.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just get on the rotation and you can get them too and you will get many chances to kill because Vof won't be changing how we do this, and I doubt that NB will.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, im not trying to get NB or VoF to change the way they do things.  Im trying to be logical about the way this rotation is run, as far as cleaning up the ST mobs that the ancients rotation guilds do not want.  VoF and NB are not intrested in killing 1-3 dragons, its all or not, and even with 4 up sometimes the mobs remain untouched for weeks.  In cases where 1-2 dragons are up or the mobs are up for an extended period of time I  dont think its unreasonable for another guild to go down and clear them regardless of if its their turn for MoTG/Prog.   <br>
<br>
Once the 4th dragon(AE slow) is killed by that guild add them to the rotation, the guild having to kill all 4 dragons in one clean sweep is also BS.  MoTG/Prog can be killed in 2 seperate nights and you'll get a place on the ST rotation why is ancients any diffrent?   If you can kill the 4th, you should be added to the rotation, I think the guild having done that has proven themsleves worthy of the rotation.<br>

<br>
the only concern brought forth so far seems to be that whenever there is a respawn and the ST guild does not touch Ancients at all during their turn, there would be ancients missing for the cleanup rotation guild if someone else had gone in to kill the 1-3 ancients you did not bother killing after the previous ST guild left the week before.  You made it very clear that neither of the two rotation guilds bother with cleaning up ST if one or more dragons are missing (sometimes, even then the rotation guild does not go for it).  <br>
<br>
Therefore, if the rule was changed to read &quot;if the ancient rotation guilds are not interested in cleaning up the current spawn cycle, any ST rotation guild can go in and attempt to clear the ancients on the day after the ST rotation guild finished their rotation turn&quot;, these wasted mobs could be very well put to use and guilds could get on this rotation more easily.<br>
<br>
What would this mean for the guilds on rotation?  Nothing at all.  If people went in one day after the rotation guild is done, then the full respawn will be up if and when you decide to take your turn.<br>
<br>
You were correct, you cannot be forced to go in.  But it seems very unfair to not allow others to make use of spawns you so often waste and that others can very well benefit from. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

This argument is somewhat flawed.  If the cleanup guild goes in a day or two after the ST guild is done (let's assume all 4 ancients are up), then by the time MotG and Prog spawn and the next ST rotation guild takes their turn, ancients would not be up either.  If guilds were allowed to clean up the mobs left up (and that the anients rotation guild does not bother with) on the day following the ST rotation guilds turn, then there would be no difference between a non-ancients rotation guild cleaning up and VoF/NB cleaning up. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

No you won’t actually, because if you could, you would be on rotation.  Guilds on ST rotation trying to get on Ancients rotation don’t kill the 3rd and 4th, and leave the first two up.  In fact, that would be quite an accomplishment of exploitive pulling, considering you would have to pull either the 1st or 2nd first to even get to the 3rd or 4th.<br>

Again, the 1-2 that are wasting are mobs “wasting” that if you could kill, you would already be on the rotation and not having this discussion.<br>

While it’s true VoF has been more active than we are on the Ancients rotation, what is your source of info that they are left up “for weeks at a time”.  You can’t track them from the zone in.  VoF from my understanding has been very active on killing the Ancients, and we go when we have enough people who need primal for us to go.  At 3 dragons, you are at the cusp of my interest, and you are right, I don’t feel like clearing all the way down to do the two hardest dragons for only 2-4 pieces of primal when I am looking for specific types.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Once the 4th dragon(AE slow) is killed by that guild add them to the rotation, the guild having to kill all 4 dragons in one clean sweep is also BS.

If you can kill the 4th, you should be added to the rotation, I think the guild having done that has proven themsleves worthy of the rotation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You have your info wrong Kenshirro.  If you only kill MotG one night, the Prog won’t be up the next night for you to do him.  No guild on the rotation is going to kill Prog and leave MotG up either, just like no one is going to kill the two hard dragons and leave the two easy ones up.  The rules work, kill all four dragons, on your ST turn, and welcome to the rotation.  Don’t snipe mobs that you aren’t on rotation for – it’s no different than killing Ikky and Eashen when you can’t kill Roy.  It hinders the guilds on the Ancients rotation from doing their mobs.<br>

Just like I said to Kenshiiro – if you could kill the mobs being left up, i.e. the 3rd and 4th Ancients, you would already be on rotation.  No one kills the last two and leaves the front two up – indeed, I would be impressed if they could, right before I petitioned them for exploiting.  You deciding on your own, to go down and snipe mobs that you aren’t on rotation for is as bad as guilds that did the same to Ikky and Eashen in the N ToV days.  Additionally, the Ancients guilds go down the day after the ST rotation guild, they don’t go down midweek like you seem to want free reign to do for the non-Ancients guilds.  Sorry, that’s not fair to the up and coming ST guilds who want their shots at the Ancients and aren’t up on a patch day.<br>

I think if you proved you could kill MOTG, Prog, FA, and all 4 Ancients in one clearing, then it is safe to say you could mobilize fast enough in a cleanup situation to get the Ancients killed as fast as possible (which would mean less distance between spawns of MotG/Prog and Ancients).<br>
<br>
After reading the replies of everyone here, I still think at the end exactly what I was thinking when I first saw the post...why not just kill them all on your next turn and get on the rotation?  If someone kills a couple ancients and leaves two up...and you aren't capable of killing the 4th, then would you really want to fight all the way down for one Ancient loot?  I can tell you it isn't worth it, trust me.  If you are worried that on your next turn you will fight down and all Ancients wont be up, then just get an SoS rogue with a mage, and run down and check...if all ancients aren't up, I doubt any guild on the rotation would mind you waiting to do your turn until they were.  So then you have to wait just until your next turn, and go down and kill them...done, you're on rotation with just 3 guilds, 2 of which won't kill every week anymore.<br>
<br>
As far as what VoF has done with Ancients in past months, it wasn't until probably the past few weeks that we slowed down on doing Ancients.  We have wanted to get all of our melees primals, and until recently, we were killing Ancients close to every week, and never less than once every other week.<br>
<br>
I can understand your idea of wanting to cleanup if the cleanup guild doesn't go in.  I guess I just think it would be a whole lot easier if you just got on rotation.  When we were trying to bring in more primals, we made sure we knew the rules, took 25 people down to the Ancients, and got on the rotation.  Don't hold yourselves back from killing the 4th Ancient, because he's killable with less and less these days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenshiiro@therathetravelagency>Kenshiiro </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadows of Yamabushi</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/13/03 8:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=330.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> <br>
Next time we are up for ST we will be on the Ancients rotation.  Thats not my point, its not just for SoY, I just see flaws in the Ancients rotation, and if no guild on the rot is willing to do the clean up, why shouldnt another ST enabled guild have the right to go clear some FFA mobs the next night(or attempt to)?  Having spawns 24hrs or less apart for 1 week isnt going to hurt anyone.<br>
<br>
Karadin,<br>
<br>
Its actually easy(well, not easy, but possible) to pull ancients criss cross and actually even past each other, mobs warp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  However if 2 were left up we would kill the one and then attempt the AE slow dragon.<br>
<br>
I kept track of the RTA rotations page, thats the only way I was able to estimate when the ancients were last killed.<br>
<br>
But your right Bog, this is not going to be a SoY issue in a week or so, I just thought I would bring this to the other Rep's attention and see what everyone else's thoughts were.<br>

<br>
This would leave 1 ancient up for the guilds on 'clean up', and block guilds from attempting the ancients themselves. <br>
<br>
Just like the rule exists that it's not good form to kill Eashan and Ikitar and 'fail' on Roy to get a couple shots at loot, it's not good form to try to kill the ancients every week until you get on the rotation.<br>
<br>
That's why guilds are not allowed to attempt to clear the ancients off of their own turn. <br>
<br>
I wonder why, if in a week you'll be on the ancients rotation, you would ask for a change that basically would ensure that, you'd really not see the full four ancients again?<br>
<br>
Because if a guild was able to, on their own rotation turn or not, attempt to clear the ancients, then the spawns of the ancients would really only line up after a patch and quickly fall away from a close respawn. <br>
<br>
The rule could be implimented that guilds could stall off their ST rotation turn until all mobs were up, but...<br>
<br>
Why when we can just keep the rules as they are, would we want to make the rotation longer for all involved?<br>

<br>
My question, in which I only sought clarification, was why for this particular rotation do you have to wait your regular ST rotation turn to try and join the Ancient rotation. It's different than AoW in that there will be no mob lost if the guild does not succeed. I thought that was the reason why guilds were not allowed to try AoW &quot;out of turn&quot;. So I didn't understand the reasoning of applying this rule to the Ancient rotation.<br>
<br>
I only wanted clarification but instead the chosen representatives decided there was an arterial motive from SoY (i.e. trying to go in sweep mobs and &quot;fail on the 4th&quot; so that we can get more loot each time we &quot;tried&quot;).<br>
<br>
Could we perhaps actually discuss issues rather than assume the worst of one another?<br>

However ST is not set up like that, its set up like AoW where as you cannot try to get on the rotation until its your turn, even though the mobs are sitting down there rotting, which again is not the case with NToV mobs.<br>

Why kill them on your own turn? Bogarthamule already answered that a few posts ago, namely: If you can clear ALL in one turn then it is more than likely that you can go  in an  *clean up* fast too.<br>
On the other hand, if you can go in and try to get on the *ancients clean up* when ever a guild had killed MoTG and Prot, who can tell how fast you can do it, not wipe in between, maybe delaying spawns for hours due to  CR's etc. and all in all delay the repop (not purposely) so that the next guild will have to wait a day longer untill all would be back up again. Then they go in, kill  MoTG and Prot but not the Ancients, Next guild comes in and the story repeats, again, in the end, delaying the spawn.<br>

What Kenshiiro wants to know is this:<br>
<br>
When a guild like yours doesn't WANT to go clean up the rotation, beause the previous guild only left 1 or 2 up, why can't WE go kill those 1 or 2 if they are just going to rot there?<br>

Go back to the thread and answer the damn question instead of being a prick and not addressing the subject.<br>
