I posted it once on the Monly Business board and some thought provoking comments were made.----------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.&quot; (Origin of Species, 6th ed. (198<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , p. 154) – Darwin<br>
It’s understandable that there exists a theological debate among differing religious views.  After all, religious understanding and belief derives its momentum from faith-driven exercises rather than hard empirical evidence.  But one would expect scientific debate to avoid such quibbles and disagreements in light of their own scientific method, which does derive its momentum from hard empirical evidence.  Unfortunately, science is overseen by humans, and the same biases, institutionalized thinking, and raw power involved with any human venture are also present in science.  <br>
One debate, looming large on the horizon, pits the “high priests” of evolution against the proponents of “intelligent design.”  In this article I examine Intelligent Design and its claims against evolution. <br>
Intelligent Design<br>
In 1802, William Paley penned his famous pocketwatch analogy.  To wit, if we find a pocketwatch in the desert we assume that some human hand was involved and that the watch did not materialize through some blind natural process.  The analogy here is that the complexity of nature points to an intelligent designing force.  <br>
This was the prevailing scientific view until Darwin published his Origin of Species in 1859.  The evidence that Darwin asserted took the scientific community by storm and evolution has been the prevailing modus operandi since that day. <br>
Evolutionary biology teaches that all biological complexity is “the result of material mechanisms.”  In short, evolution claims that all things came into existence by means of natural selection and mutation, in minute “baby steps” of progression over millions of years.  Organisms adapt for conditions adding to their functionality piece by piece until we are what we are today.  <br>
We should note here that no one doubts natural selection as a robust scientific theory.  For example, a desert fox has developed longer ears over time to help expel heat from his body.  If this were all that evolution purports, everyone would go home happy.  Instead the debate turns on Darwin’s theory that all species evolved from a handful of previous species.  Intelligent Design is a growing scientific movement that challenges Darwin and his naturalistic legacy.<br>
Intelligent Design derives its impetus from systems that are “irreducibly complex.”  Here’s a common analogy that’s used to explain the theory.  <br>
An everyday example of an irreducibly complex system is the humble mousetrap. It consists of (1) a flat wooden platform or base; (2) a metal hammer, which crushes the mouse; (3) a spring with extended ends to power the hammer; (4) a catch that releases the spring; and (5) a metal bar that connects to the catch and holds the hammer back. You can't catch a mouse with just a platform, then add a spring and catch a few more mice, then add a holding bar and catch a few more. All the pieces have to be in place before you catch any mice. [1] <br>
According to evolution, you should be able to reduce every biological system, piece by piece, down to its beginning.  Evolution then could not be the scientific origin of the mouse trap, there must have been some intelligent hand involved.  As Darwin admits in our opening quote, if you can demonstrate a complex biological system along the same line of reasoning, then his theory would break down.<br>
Bacterium Flagellum<br>
The question then is this: Are there biological systems that exhibit such complexity?  One prominent example is that of bacterium flagellum.  Bacterium flagellum are whip-like appendages that move bacteria throughout our body.  These flagellum work very much like a motor; each has a rotor, a stator, O-rings, bushings, and a drive shaft.  They are powered by the combination of 50 different proteins.  These proteins exist independently within the human body and come together to power the flagellum.  Take one of these proteins away, and the flagellum fails to operate.  The mathematical probability of these 50 proteins coming together under the theory of evolution is so outrageous as to almost insist that there was some higher power involved.   <br>
Plasmids<br>
Plasmids are circular pieces of DNA that can easily be exchanged among bacteria.  Plasmids can also confer antibiotic resistance.  When one bacterium releases a plasmid, another can absorb it, information from the Plasmid is infused from one into the other.  The problem begins when we ask &quot;where did the bacterium that released the plasmid information in turn derive it?&quot;  Any evolutionary explanation will be circular reasoning and insufficient to explain the matter.<br>
Eukaryotic Cells<br>
Michael Behe, one of the major proponents of intelligent design explains another example: <br>
Another example of irreducible complexity is the system that allows proteins to reach the appropriate subcellular compartments. In the eukaryotic cell there are a number of places where specialized tasks, such as digestion of nutrients and excretion of wastes, take place. Proteins are synthesized outside these compartments and can reach their proper destinations only with the help of &quot;signal&quot; chemicals that turn other reactions on and off at the appropriate times. This constant, regulated traffic flow in the cell comprises another remarkably complex, irreducible system. All parts must function in synchrony or the system breaks down. [2] <br>
Blood Clotting<br>
The system that prevents our blood from clotting is yet another example.  Blood clotting consists of a complex cascade of enzymes and cofactors which must be in place to work.  The evolutionist’s rebuttal to this is that blood clotting experiments on mice have removed certain enzymes successfully.  The Intelligent Design (ID) response is that the mice in the experiment were detrimentally affected by the reduced enzymes; which flies in the face of another evolutionary postulate: the mutated change in an organism must benefit the organism (survival of the fittest after all).<br>
People, Places and Theories<br>
There are a number of prominent players currently working on ID.  Here are a few bios and links that you can peruse:<br>
Philip E. Johnson, is a graduate of Harward and the University of Chicago. He was a law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren and has taught law for over twenty years at the University of California at Berkeley.<br>
Johnson's most prominent contribution has been Darwin on Trial which examines Evolution from a standpoint of sound reasoning and scientific support.<br>
Michael Behe received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 1978, is a professor of biological sciences at Pennsylvania's Lehigh University. His current research involves the roles of design and natural selection in building protein structure. His book Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution is available in paperback (Touchstone Books, 199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
Behe is one of primary proponents of ID.  His book has been the focus of many of the evolutionist’s rebuttal.  Behe has been lambasted and harangued for his viewpoints and his responses are mostly ignored by peer publications.  Hmm… sounds like a familiar brick wall. <br>
William A. Dembski,  holds Ph.D.'s in mathematics and philosophy, is an associate research professor at Baylor University and a senior fellow with the Discovery Institute in Seattle. His books include The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance Through Small Probabilities (Cambridge University Press, 199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence (Rowman and Littlefield, 2001). links<br>
Dembski is known as the Isaac Newton of ID.  He has taken informational mathematics to calculate the probability of irreducibly complex biological systems.  He has also brought an historical perspective to the movement demonstrating how evolution failed to adequately dismiss British natural theology.<br>
Jonathan Wells received two Ph.D.'s, one in molecular and cell biology from the University of California, Berkeley, and one in religious studies from Yale University. He has worked as a postdoctoral research biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and has taught biology at California State University, Hayward. Wells is also the author of Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution Is Wrong (Regnery Publishing, 2000).<br>
Wells’ book has approached ID from an attack vantage point.  He details 10 major flaws within evolution and shows how many supposed supports of evolution are nearly fraudulent but are still taught in our schools.  Wells has been at the front of a debate in Ohio which is considering whether or not to allow ID to be taught as an alternative to evolution.<br>
Conclusion<br>
We should note that Intelligent Design is a theory just like Evolution is a theory. The debate between the parties is raging on and may eventaully reach a fervent pitch. Currently, several school boards across the country are examing its validity to determine if they should allow it to be taught in schools. Intelligent Design is an exciting venture for us to examine.  <br>

<br>
The greatest achievements in science come from people questioning the generally accepted. Interpretations of empirical evidence can be false due to lack of other empirical evidence. For instance, I can look down the street and see a red fire hydrant. I might conclude that all fire hydrants are red, because the one I see is. On seeing more fire hydrants, I might support or falsify this conclusion, depending on if I see more red fire hydrants, or fire hydrants of different colors such as yellow.<br>
<br>
In order to find empirical evidence, one usually has to be looking for it. Scientists who question accepted rules look for empirical evidence that supports their questioning, or rather, fails to support the accepted rule (as the author does later in the post)<br>
<br>
Ok, now to the meat of the post. The author, in his support of 'Intelligent Design' fails to see something. A feature can evolve using things that evolved for separate functions. In fact, this tends to happen. A common mutation in a genome is to copy a whole gene and place it somewhere else in the genome. This allows evolution to 'tinker' with the gene without disrupting the original (kind of like you might make a copy of something before you start changing it, in case you mess it up) Originally, the process of evolution would select against mutations in the gene because it would negatively affect the function (if it positively affects the function or gives it a new function that gives the organism more fitness than the previous function, it is selected for, not against) but with a second copy, mutations can occur in one or the other without negatively affecting the organism as a whole.<br>
<br>
For the mousetrap analogy. Sure, a piece of wood would not have any use in catching mice before, but it had a use in building furniture. The spring had previous uses as well. The inventor of the mousetrap did not use entirely new items, he utilized things that were already around and being used for other functions.<br>
<br>
The bacterial flagellum most likely did the same thing. Some of the 50 different proteins in the flagellum are also used in the skeletal support of the bacteria, and in other movement-based structures. It is possible that the flagellum originated as a large cilia, and selection picked out random mutations that slowly gave the flagellum more function, and thus gave the bacteria a greater chance at living than his fellows.<br>
<br>
As for plasmids, there are various ways that a small circular piece of DNA could have been cut off the single, parental circular piece of DNA. An error in homolohous recombination could have cut off a loop of DNA. There are viruses that, in attacking a cell, will cut up the cellular DNA. If ligase were to have reattached DNA randomly, several plasmids could have arisen. <br>
Bacteria have several ways to take up foreign DNA and use it. A bacterium can take up a plasmid from a dead bacteria, in essence 'eating it', and utilize the DNA therein. Another organism that can use DNA it 'eats' is C. elegans, a small multicellular worm. From this taking up DNA from dead bacteria, sharing DNA between bacteria could have arisen easily from this, as any steps would likely give the evolving bacteria a greater fitness than his neighbors (fitness being the ability to produce more living offspring than his neighbor, in this case more likely because he lives longer)<br>
Plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance is consequential. Antibiotic resistance can also be carried in the chromosome, and plasmids, to my knowledge, can carry any gene<br>
<br>
The funny thing about cell signaling is that proteins and chemicals involved in them signal several different things. Protein Kinase A, and Cyclic AMP are common chemicals in cell signaling pathways. Cyclic AMP is a simple modification of a molecule already used in the cell, Adenine Monophosphate, which is the 'used' form of ATP (adenine triphosphate) the most common energy currency in a cell. Many other chemicals in cell signaling can be linked to other functions in the cell. Since the cell is the most basic unit of life, most cell signaling pathways would have had a large amount of time to evolve, and would thus be highly complex.<br>
<br>
Back to the pocketwatch analogy. If you break a pocketwatch down to it's components, no single component would work in and of itself. If you take pieces away from the pocketwatch, most likely it will no longer function. But, a pocketwatch of today is much more complex than the first pocketwatches. There are many more gears and springs, and some items that weren't even IN the first pocketwatches, but the first pocketwatches were still functional. So, even though, when you break the modern pocketwatch down to it's component parts, and take parts away, it no longer works, you can still have a pocketwatch that is less complex.<br>

<br>
Original post: there are complex features in biology that cannot be broken down to components and still work, this means they can't have evolved, and can be explained by intelligent design.<br>
<br>
My response: Components are used in other, simpler biological features and can have evolved there, then combined in mutations to produce a new working, function. Or, whole features can mutate and be used for a new function. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dembiredeadbones>Dembire Deadbones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.w3.org/Icons/Misc/skeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/4/03 3:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intelligent Design</span><hr size=1> soooo if everything evolved from bacteria, then where did the Bacteria come from?

Basically, before you had life, you had chemicals (RNA) that could replicate themselves from basic components. It wasn't with high fidelity, and after a while, those basic components would run out, so any advantages an individual molecule might have over another would run under the rules of evolution, those that have the most advantage will replicate the most and will have the most copies. Eventually, they started interacting with each other, and proteins. Since RNA can code for proteins, and RNA can read that code and make the proteins, the protiens were copyable too. This goes on until you get a membrane that contains these systems of molecules (there are a few theories about where membranes came from) and copies itself. From there, you have a basic single-celled organism, and life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=genaiellee>Genaiel Lee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/4/03 4:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intelligent Design</span><hr size=1> My question to hese people would be this.

Actually the most serious problem with ID and many other bazaar theories is that unlike other scientific realms evolution challenges religious dogma.<br>
<br>
Challenging someones beliefs tends to make them react in self defense. <br>
<br>
The result is you have people who are totally unqualified to have an opinion developing theories which sound perfectly reasonable to other unqualified people.<br>
<br>
ID sounds pretty rediculous to anyone who actually has studied biology, chemistry, geology, and physics. <br>
<br>
But to someone who has only a BA in biology and a minor in religion it sounds perfectly valid.

I remember something my teacher once said back in highschool. &quot;The purpose of science is to explain things, and the purpose of religion is to explain things that can't be explained.&quot;  The conflict arises where they meet.<br>
<br>
The fact is that evelution exists.  Will we ever know if the origins of life came from the same starting blocks?  We'll probably never know.<br>
<br>
Religion is designed to explain things to the common person at the time.  I can imagine a religious figure or creator trying to teach the cave men about biology, chemisty, physics, mathematics, etc.  Then giving up and saying, &quot;I wanted it and so it came to be.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dembiredeadbones>Dembire Deadbones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.w3.org/Icons/Misc/skeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/5/03 3:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intelligent Design</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Actually the most serious problem with ID and many other bazaar theories is that unlike other scientific realms evolution challenges religious dogma.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's amazing how you totally discredit something that YOU don't happen to believe.  If it is different than what you believe then it's bazaar.  Evolution is nothing more than a theory. Theories are NOT facts!!!  There have been too many gaps that scientists still cannot explain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Challenging someones beliefs tends to make them react in self defense. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Evolution is also a belief and many scientists also act in self defense  when challenged.<br>

I don't think you understand what an OPINION is!!  Just because you have one does not make you any more qualified than another who has a differing one.  Frankly you sound pefectly unreasonable to me.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>ID sounds pretty rediculous to anyone who actually has studied biology, chemistry, geology, and physics. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

And other belief systems that you believe in sound ridiculous to others who have also studied history along with some of the others you listed.<br>
