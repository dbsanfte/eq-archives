The next time you get ripped off by a player you should look at doing a few things.  <br>
<br>
Prior too getting a trade between players, turn on your log to gather all data prior to the trade to incuding all chat between parties.  There are some players I know who always have their log running and can get too them quickly to confirm an incident and post it if needed.<br>
<br>
If you get ripped off /report it.  /report will send text currently visible in your text window to the GM's.  /petition and give as much information as you can on what occurred.  Try to get the individual that ripped you off to admit he did it and once he does immediately /report this information as it will also be used against the thief to show proof off the incident.<br>
<br>
You CAN get your PP, Items, or whatever else was stolen back if you have the proof to show what happened.  I have 2nd hand knowledge of 2 guild mates who had been ripped off in the Bazaar and they were able to get thier PP/Items back after the incidents being investigated.<br>

Your viciousness is unwarranted and is, in fact not helpful to Tyrants or your guild in any way.  Yours and Tyrants’ lack of anger management while composing your posts is doing more to make this an ongoing issue than what Kathartic or anyone else has done.  A simple, well-thought point-by-point argument of why you feel Kathartic is wrong would have been more useful for Tyrants and your guild.  But, you and Tyrants haven’t chosen that route.<br>
<br>
In Tyrants case, his anger gives the reader the impression that he has something to hide.<br>
<br>
In your case, your anger makes it appear you’re a self-involved martyr, caught up in the less-than-earth-shattering drama of your own doings.  It seems you have little appreciation for actions that would better help you, your guild and Tyrants.<br>
<br>
You can rant and rave at Kathartic and whoever all you want.  (I guess I also painted a big ol’ target on yours truly.)  Ask yourself, however, if you really want to help Tyrants and your guild.  I’m suggesting the best approach would have been and still is:  rebut and shut-up.<br>

Wow, sucks to be pwned that hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Kathartic said was that he <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MIGHT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> be the same person.  He made it damn well clear that he was in no way sure, and had no facts other than the coincidence of the two characters logging in/out, and Ddeath being in a recruit channel that he shouldn't have known about.   Time and time again he said its just a hunch .. just a possibility. <br>
<br>
Tyrant has admitted to having access to Ddeath.  Thats good to know.. when you play someone else account, and you are open about it, that cool.  Bonus points for honesty.  But guess what?  Yep, you guessed it, You are subject to their reputation as well.  <br>
<br>
How do we know Tyrant didn't do it?  How do we know he did?  We don't, so the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only thing we can do is try to put the piece together, from what both parties have said, and come to our own conclusion.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  <br>
<br>
Tryant's posts were anger filled, mass defensive, &quot;omg it wasn't me, fuck u!&quot; filled posts.   Katharic presented evidence, and well worded, and sound arguments. Lets also add to the fact that no ddeath, or any of the possible players have posted here in his defense, except Tryant.  Which could also mean Ddeath is guilty, and Tryant is just getting screwed, but could mean Tryand is at fault?  Its possible.<br>
<br>
But, to put it in very small words, but in very big text .. so as to maybe you will understand the fucking words that have been said, I'll put some colors, too .. to add the First grade feel...<br>

<br>
I was going to let it go and believe it wasn't tyrant that did it, and figure to just watch out for the Ddeath name .. But I will be sure to stay away from Tyrant, too, as he acts like a 12 year old.   You too for that matter Jassmanna.  You are both on my &quot;Not so smart people&quot; list.  <br>

<br>
Jas,<br>
It's quite simple.  He was an applicant to DHG.  Therefore making me &quot;an interested party&quot;.  If you have a position in your guild that would cause you to have to deal with information about an applicant then &quot;YOU&quot; accepted that position and I did not cause this &quot;extreme hardship&quot; for you.  <br>
<br>
If you are not in that position in your guild then there is some serious irony in your statement about being insignificant.<br>
<br>
If, as you seem to claim, that the accusation is so far out there that a reasonable person with the same information would not conclude the same then your course of action is clear.  If it is believable, but not you are not convinced, your course of action is clear though might require you to do something.  If it's convincing then your course of action is clear.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I didn't deny Tyrants' application to DHG based on the unproven and somewhat unsubstantiated claim.  I did however raise my veto on the basis of his reaction to the allegation.  It would seem to me that if some dispute arose while tagged with DHG his behavior would be inappropriate as compared to what we would expect from a member.  <br>
<br>
Character is not something that is &quot;quantifiable&quot; in that you have an amount somewhere between none and some.  Character is something everyone has. It's the traits of that character that people like, dislike, respect or disrespect.   It is encompassing of the individual's personality.  <br>
<br>
It is my judgement that there are some people with whom you can have a discourse, pleasant or unpleasant, and there are others with which there is no opportunity for discussion of concepts, ideas, beliefs or facts.  The latter seem to quickly take any discussion and degenerate to name calling, personal attacks and seem unable to seperate the person from the ideas they argue.  In the former there is possibility of some opinions being swayed one direction or the other.  In the latter there is no fruitful outcome of the discussion.   So the topic becomes about the personalities involved instead of about the topic.  This is the technique of attempting to make an opposing argument less believable by making the arguer less believable.  This can, and does regularly, backfire.<br>

I don't understand how you can expect someone to not be angry and defensive when you call them out on the RTA Flame Central and accuse them of scamming. <br>
<br>
A reputation is built over a few years and within a couple days it can be completely tarnished. I learned it the hard way. I didn't believe it really mattered. I hit a brick wall.<br>
<br>
The accusations didn't have to make it here especially when it's a hit or miss like this. You either nailed it on the head or you've completely reached way off base. And the problem is.. people can come to their own conclusions. You giving public imaginitive ideas about someone so that other people will be predjudiced no matter if you're right or wrong about the events. <br>
<br>
Either way I don't plan on anything coming up to completely disvalidate your concerns and opinions - nothing short of a GM showing proof to each an every reader that this person did not do such a thing. And then it would come down to people wondering if it was really an admin. It's a no win battle for anyone being accused. Innocent or not. The scar remains. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=salura>salura</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/30/03 5:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1395.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I wonder if this is the same Ddeath that had another character Liight whom I met in Velks about this time last year?<br>

As the group leader, Ddeath would loot the mobs.  Whn a nice item dropped, he'd loot it and said we'd roll on it later.  After 5 hours I announced I had to leave and I was told &quot;cya&quot; and removed.<br>
<br>
It was then I realized that Ddeath was passing all the gems to his other toons and had no intention of ever sharring the loot.<br>
<br>
Knowing I was suckered, I just let my guild and other aquaintences know of his tactics.<br>
<br>
Could this be the same Ddeath? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beljaro>Beljaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/2/03 4:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1395.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   you asked for it</span><hr size=1> you share that account with at least 3 &quot;other people&quot;?  sorry, Tyrants, you asked for this.

And frankly, I'm not familiar with Ddeath or Tyrants.<br>
<br>
But....<br>
<br>
I have to question his character regarding this:<br>
<br>
He refuses to help. Simply saying that he promised someone he would never use that character again is a bullshit excuse, when he would only be doing it to help justify a wrong done by someone else using the same character, is a BULLSHIT excuse. <br>
<br>
If I was in the same situation as Tyrants (and I never would be - No way in Hell I'd ever share an account with anyone), I'd log Ddeath to get the EEs in a heartbeat. I'd explain to the person why I was breaking the promise (after the fact, if its one of the people with access to the account, since they could either be the scammer or at least in on it with the person who is), and if they couldn't cope with that....FUCK `EM!!<br>

If you're so determined to scream your innocence, why not log into that account you admit to sharing, get the EE's or the platinum, and do the right thing?  <br>
<br>
Even if you didn't do the deed to begin with, you can help make things right.<br>
