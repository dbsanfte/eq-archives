<br>
A History of the Tal Hraptur (1st edit) <br>
<br>
There is no doubt in Iksar history that Rile, son of Venril Sathir, had deposed his father through a violent means of succession. As second Emperor of Sebilis, Rile was nothing short of a military as well as political genius. <br>
<br>
Because of the manner in which he ascended to the throne, Rile himself was understandably paranoid of future successors that could plot to overthrow his rule. Early on he realized that a group of elite guards had to be formed to protect his own interests. <br>
<br>
The young Rile summoned the Jarsath chieftain named Karzakar, one of the few remaining elders of the Jarsath tribe that had earlier been vanquished by the victorious Kunzar troops of his father Venril. In return for the Jarsath's eternal pledge of loyalty, the young Rile had spared the life of the enslaved chief. <br>
<br>
It was Karzakar that Emperor Rile commissioned to organize the original Tal Hraptur, the Brood of Fear. Initially consisting of several dozen Jarsathi monk-warriors, the Brood served as the elite bodyguards to the Emperor himself. Soon after, it was clear that the Tal Hraptur had demonstrated its brutal effectiveness by intimidating, cowering and hunting down all of the Emperor's enemies, both internal and external. The Tal Hraptur soon manifested itself into a Praetorian role, part secret service, part military crack troops, and part Imperial Guards. <br>
<br>
Warriors within the Brood of Fear answered to no other general but the Emperor himself. Rile had used the Tal Hraptur's warriors and knights as his personal mercenary legion, whimsically sending them away on brutal campaigns to vanquish enemies in distant lands. <br>
<br>
The monk-warriors within the Brood, deadly with only the strike of their tails and fists, discouraged any attempts on the Emperor's life. Many warlocks and shadow knights were enlisted as spies and assassins capable of hiding in the shadows while stalking their targets, and were often sent on missions to assassinate enemies of the state. The shamans themselves served as the backbone support of any important mission. <br>
<br>
It is not known how the original Brood of Fear was disbanded after Rile's death. It was hypothesized that leaders that succeeded Rile were simply too annoyed or too fearful to allow the group to exist under their own rule. Perhaps they feared that the Tal Hraptur was so intensely loyal to the Second Emperor, that even in his death, they would eventually find a way to keep serving an Undead Master. <br>
<br>
It was not until the reign of Vekin, the current emperor of New Sebilis, that the Brood of Fear was once again brought into service. Much in the same way that Rile had used them, Vekin has purposely re-energized the Brood of Fear to serve as a potent and fearsome cabal that serves the deepest interests of the Emperor, the Iksar Empire, and the faceless deity Cazic Thule. <br>
<br>
Because of the clandestine nature of the Brood itself, not much else is known of the inner workings of the Brood of Fear. The current cabal is loyal to Emperor Vekin, pledging allegiance to Cazic Thule, and is led by an Overseer of the Brood, the current one being Massadar Obulus (a descendant of the Obulus Grand Warlock Razagal). The Overseer leads the Brood in the same vein as an ancient tribal chieftain. <br>
<br>
The Overseer is assisted by a council of officers, referred to as Brood Claws. The Claws are responsible for delegating the day to day activity of the Brood. A small handful on non-Iksar have also been enlisted as mercenary allies of the Brood of Fear, many of them Dark Elves, Ogres or Trolls coming from the necromantic professions (Necromancers and Shadow Knights). <br>

Footnotes<br>
<br>
1a. Tal Hraptur - from the ancient Jarsathi tongue, loosely translates to &quot;those who tear apart&quot;. This refers to the fact that the original Jarsathi monk-warriors literally tore apart their enemies during and after combat. Not only did they mutilate the bodies of dead enemies, but ancient Jarsathi had a nasty habit of also eating their fallen victims. Emperor Venril found the practice a bit unsettling and abolished cannibalism soon after assimilating the other four tribes. <br>
<br>
1b. Tak Harastur - the Kunzar dialect had butchered the original spelling and meaning of the Tal Hraptur. In the Kunzar tongue, the same words grossly translate to &quot;those who are pretty damn scary&quot;. This is how the group came to be known as the Brood of Fear. <br>
<br>
2. Jarsath - one of the five original Iksar tribe-states before Vekin's Sebilis Empire. The tribes were Kunzar, Kylong, Nathsar, Jarsath, and Obulus. <br>
<br>
3. Cazic Thule - the Iksar people worship this faceless deity, who rules over the Plane of Fear. <br>
