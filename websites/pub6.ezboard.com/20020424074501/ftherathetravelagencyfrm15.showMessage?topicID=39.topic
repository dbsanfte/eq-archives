I see what other people are blind to, be it cause of political affiliation, greed, or simple stupidity.  I can't not sit here and say i am above anyone here, nor that im smarter, better or wiser in some fashion, cause i dont sit above you.  However no one here sits above, below, in front, or behind.  We all are side by side in this mess one way or another.<br>
<br>
When a nerf hits the servers, everyone is affected in some form.  That great cleric spell you once relied on now becomes useless, and you feel personally affected by it.  Its known as a chain reaction, something that happens to one affets the other.  Dominos is a classic example of this.<br>
<br>
Lets take that view toward the current political mess for a second.  Everyone believes that everyone else has their own agenda.  This isn't something i would call unrational, however like then way i opened this paragraph, it is a generalized statement, which can never hold total facts.<br>
<br>
In every organization i see a person or persons whom i could live without.  I also in each and every one of these organizations see good people.  To make a generalized statement using a political affiliation would condem not only the bad, but you also condem the good as well.<br>
<br>
The entity under attack feels threatened as a whole, thus giving them a common ground besides their tag.  They as a whole were accused of a wrongful action on a public board without any prior notificaton of the action.  It is in their views a sneak attack with the express intent of kicking them when they are not looking.<br>
<br>
They respond to this simply by uniting many times, unable to sort the truth from fiction they take sides with those whom sit in the same boat as they, often with no real way to know one way or another the truth.  No leader as of yet has come forth to take responsibility for any wrongful action, its the random soldier whom fires the first shot that held no orders to do which starts the war.  Guilds draw &quot;do not cross&quot; lines and isolate themselves.  <br>
<br>
I am one of the few who look to walk between these lines.  I admit that i once held this idea that everyone was accountable for the actions of one, however reality and common sense got the better of me.  I see good people related to some bad, wound up in one flag and given their marching orders, often times the orders might conflict with their own morals, but in war against an enemy, there are no rules, so its ok to bypass these morals.<br>
<br>
It is my hope that i remain forever neutral when it comes to political problems.  Having an opinion about something should not warrent attacking those whom you might consider different from yourself.  I believe that we all deserve a chance to get to be known by others on a personal level.  I emplore all of you whom might fall into any of the categories i implied in my previous posts to seriously consider taking a good hard look at yourself.  <br>
<br>
It is more than a game, this is a part of our daily activities.  We all enjoy eachothers company most of the time, however we only seem to fight when items and wealth are on the line.  If we all can't decide when enough is enough, i believe its our duty to step down and remove ourselves from the situation.<br>
<br>
I almost fell into it, i almost became that which i see happen to many people.  I might very well have become an asskisser, or an elitist whom wants to go through everyone else to get what he wants, or an alliance maker, pretending to be friendly in order to gain what he wanted.  I felt this desperation to advance, to get in on the goods, after all i have had 2 years in the game, and i was starting to justify my reasons for deserving it.  This could not be allowed to happen.<br>
<br>
Its fairly obvious what i did, if not then do a /who all manas next time you are on line.  I stopped myself from bypassing my morals and betraying my friends, whom i genuinly care for.  I also stopped myself from becoming untrue to those whom i wanted to get to know, those whom are a total pleasure to dungeon crawl with.  <br>
<br>
I miss alot of the mid and high level of the game.  I miss being apart of a really great group, earning tons of experience without worrying who was going to loot what.  I wish i could go back to it, back to cazic thule, back to when i was able to hang with old time friends and meet new folks whom had passed me and come back around with a second toon, no matter their alignment, personal beliefs, or previous actions.  I miss just being able to trust that my group of six people were all on the same page, rolling wasn't nessassary, and we were going to go have fun without any bad feelings.<br>
<br>
That is the end of whats on my mind personally today, take it easy.  <p><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Stalker reborn<br>
