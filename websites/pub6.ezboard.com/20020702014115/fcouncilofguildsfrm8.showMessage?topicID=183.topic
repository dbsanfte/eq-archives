<br>
RBB - went to Toxikk<br>
<br>
2 Crystal spears - Havyk and Flarren<br>
<br>
2 Ice comet spells - one to Lyraic even though she had to leave early, and the other will be lotto'd or given out as a prize to some deserving wizard at an upcoming CoG event <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
We did pretty darn well, I'd say... especially given that we were missing 3 buffs that are normally considered vital to a Vox raid (Circle of Summer, Dead Man Floating, and Group Resist Magic)...<br>
<br>
As usual, I'll compose a more detailed write-up in the morning when I'm not deliriously coming down off a caffeine high and my wrists don't hurt so much from the non-stop typing I tend to do on these things... heh. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

But it was fun all around, my first dragon raid, so I had a good time. Grats to all who won loots, and grats to all that collected epic pieces as well. There were several inside, as well as a few druids who scrounged up a needed item outside before we went in.<br>

CoK failed on Vox.  I gotta run a Vox raid today... which means I can't watch the Sharks vs. Devils game on TV.  Damn Dragon!<br>
<br>
So I show up in Everfrost around 4:30 my time or so... and there's 2 people already there.  And by around 5pm there's only about 20.  Things are looking grim.  Lagdalen and Flarren arrive a little after that and several more people have shown up by then... so maybe this is just gonna be a normal Vox raid... one that starts late with people trickling in between 5pm and 6pm PST... heh.<br>
<br>
After a little while, a few shouts about classes we were real short on, and a few people needing TP's from various places (thanks to all the Druids that went and got people, by the way, I know Auldywen made several trips out to retrieve raiders)... it looked like we'd got a raid going here after all.  So I form up groups, and sure enough, we've got almost 9 full combat groups, and a lot of our tanks are in the 50-52 range... this bodes well.  A few stragglers added in and we ended up just shy of 10 groups.<br>
<br>
I can't remember exactly when we headed in... I wasn't really looking at the clock at this point... but my group was one of the last in, and I remember seeing a ton of people waiting at the zone inside.  Heh.  The groups ahead of us had already pulled the first room's Ice Giants... ahh well... no matter.<br>
<br>
So after a little sorting out of admin, getting people bound behind the rock, forgetting to assign a raid loot master - something I never really did, actually... the people that looted lotto-able items just held on to them (namely Elwud, Minadir, and Flarren) - Teressa and myself went out to start pulling Ice Giants.<br>
<br>
Teressa was sorta there for the ride, as it turned out (though I could never have pulled the lair without her).  I ended up doing the &quot;Train all the Giants in each Wing of the tunnels to the crowd&quot; method of pulling... I think my second pull had 4 giants (maybe more?) and a couple of spiders... and only ONE death from that conflaguration!  This was a raid that was dropping giants without breaking a sweat, always a good sign.<br>
<br>
After all the terrors and pre-lair spawns were dropped (with a quickness, yo! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), Teressa ventured forth into the lair and we pulled pretty much all the lair spawns in a single go, as well.  That battle ended up being pretty chaotic, but I don't remember anyone dying... so we obviously we're kicking some serious buttock at this point.<br>
<br>
While Lagdalen was setting up the buffline, our fearless monk puller managed to slowly but surely work her way out of the pit she had... er... fallen down.  Vox made an appearence in the buffing hallway, apparently for the express purpose of killing Performer and no other... and we had a good scare and everyone camped out.  Most came back, but a few wandered around in the chat-rooms for a bit... heh.<br>
<br>
I'd like to point out in the future that ONLY raid admin should call for camp.  If anyone else shouts it, please ignore them.  Just because we hear the dragon roar does not always mean we need to camp immediatly... Vox doesn't start summoning people when she's at full life, so there's not any immediate danger.  We just need to clear agro from Vox before a 53+ person buffs us, as she'll boot them from the zone when that happens.<br>
<br>
So again... RAID ADMIN ONLY on the shout channel please.  No one else should be shouting, and no one else should call for camp.  If all the admin folks are dead before something as important as that can be decided, then the situation is probably bad enough that it's too late for camping anyone but a cleric to be very productive anyway.<br>
<br>
So... I seem to be starting a lot of paragraphs with that word... oh well.  Buffing went off without too many problems... we lacked Circle of Summer, Group Resist Magic, and Dead Man Floating... normally buffs that I wouldn't dream of going after Vox without... but apparently they aren't needed after all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
After a fairly brief interlude in the chat-room, complete with the usual spammy chat during the strategy sessions (Folks, for the sake of the rookies on the raid, try to keep it down in there... while it's all stuff you've heard before, many of them haven't... and if they miss something really crucial, it could end up being bad for all of us), we logged back in and started to re-group.<br>
<br>
I realized as soon as I got back on that I'd forgotten to warn people about the pits.  So I figure, aww hell... I'll go stand on the correct ramp and give a shout.  So without checking exactly _where_ I had camped... I head up a ramp, composing the shout in my mind... not really paying attention... and THUMP.  Yeah, everyone, follow the stellar example of your raid leader!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Lagdalen took over organizing the charge in my uh... absence...  I did manage to make it out in time to see Vox die, and even get a couple good swings in.  I'd like to thank Lagdalen for taking over without breaking a stride, and everyone else for listening to her without question... it was exactly the right thing to do (a certain dead dragon is evidence enough, neh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).<br>
<br>
Congrats to Flarren's group of Lagdalen, Teressa, Dwen, and Sylvio for getting the xp off Vox (I woulda been in that group, but I was spelunking at the time... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  Did anyone catch who got the killing blow?  I seem to be missing that a lot these days...<br>
<br>
Steelheart (as seems to be his habit, thank Marr <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) was on hand to pull the few corpses down in the pits, and Ogun started in res'ing folks promptly.  Ogun, by the way, was pulling triple-duty on this raid.  Not only was he there to buff and res us, he was playing as Gorgo, a level 46 Iksar Warrior during the actual combat!  You, sirs, are welcome to come on any raid of mine, ever. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I'd also like to thank Kegdas, Talovar, Axemaster, and Steelheart (pulling double-duty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) for being on hand to take care of giant repops during the buffing and fighting the dragon.  Axemaster had planned to bring Lilaxe as a combatant on the raid, but was willing to bring &quot;big&quot;-Axe at my request... thanks Axe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Talovar actually wanted to bring Irolia along for the combat, but uh... someone translocated the little gnome warrior out due to lack of raid fee... Raid fees are important, people, but I can always collect them later... especially from someone in my own guild... there's no need to be quite that strict about them.<br>
<br>
The loot (what little there was... can we get a refund, our dragon seemed to be defective?  I think Vox must have ditched her goodies when she saw us coming... selfish lizard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) was lotto'd out and folks ported out without much incident.  No one had any objections to how I wanted to distribute the Ice Comet spell scrolls, proving, once again, how KCoG raiders can put others before themselves.  In case no one's said this recently, y'all rule.<br>
<br>
After everyone had wandered off, and I was sitting in WC chatting with a few friends, I got a tell from a person on the raid who had ported back to check and see if anyone else needed a ride out of the lair (a noble cause)... and managed to fall down a pit and die.  Bad pit traps, bad!  No biscuit!  Heh...<br>
<br>
Once again, Ogun proved his mettle by conjuring up a Necro in the form of Jabberwauk, and I ported them around with Cynimon so we could get a coffin and summon the body to the zone, where it was res'd.  Thanks to both of you for helping out like that... that's above and beyind the call of duty.  Even if you are a &quot;rez-bitch&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Great raid everyone.  Thanks for coming.  We're 2nd up for Naggy now... and there's a patch on Tuesday... so we could be up real soon.  Everyone ready for another fun day dropping a big lizard?<br>
<br>
PS - the Sharks, after scoring in the first 18 seconds of the game, ended up loosing 6-1 to the Devils... so I'm actually kind of glad I didn't get to watch the game... this was much more fun than that would have been. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

Just so's we all know why we were missin those 3 buffs, no druid there had CoW, lost our necro for DMF just before we started buffing and Azure was kindly enough to fill in, and group resist magic... well I didn't know I was setting up buff line till kings room when Flarren leaned over irl and said &quot;dear you have the buff line list ready right?&quot; AKKK!!! so I did my best.<br>
