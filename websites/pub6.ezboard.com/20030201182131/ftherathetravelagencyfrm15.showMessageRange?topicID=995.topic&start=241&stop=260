I knew I should have worded that better.  It was intended for those that are &quot;whining&quot; in your defense about you being called a trailer trash ho, fugly, a bleeding heart liberal, a Clinton support, that you voted for Ralph Nader, that your mother wears army boots, and that you have more testosterone than the entire Olympic East German weight-lifting team.  And most of the rest that I quote you on above ... uhm ... wtf ... I ... am ... unable ... to ... understand ... bzztt pfrttt ping whir ... Danger Will Robinson ... Danger Will Robinson.  /slap Seperith!  Oh, there's something I can understand now.  Did I miss something?  Did someone accuse you of KS'g and training?  I thought YOU started the flame about Kuras KS'g and training.  Ahh, now we get to something good:  You, nor anyone else, proved that Kuras (or anyone from ED) KS'd or trained.  That's the truth and I don't lie.  However, I could be wrong (I'm not perfect either).  But you could also be wrong, couldn't you?  Being wrong doesn't mean you lie.  C'mon, admit it.  You know you wan't to.  C'mon, say it with me, &quot;I could be wrong.&quot;  There, now don't we feel better.  See, the world didn't come to a grinding halt.  And that's my whole point:  Everyone on here is wrong (and right) to some extent, because nobody knows everthing.  It's the truth and I don't lie.<br>
<br>
Now, here's some conjecture (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com" target="top">www.dictionary.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> You guys were on your 3rd CR from a complete wipe on Paeruk the Strong (did I get his name wrong?).  You guys were Waaaaaay over at the watefall because you all were pulling Ocean giants there.  ED moved over by the OCEAN so that they could clear OCEAN giants to get to the named OCEAN giant (aka Paeruk the Owned).  Somehow there was some confusion about the OCEAN giants and the named OCEAN giant (aka Paeruk the OCEAN Wimp) being camped.  ED looked around the &quot;named camp&quot; where just about anybody that pulls OCEAN giants actually pulls them to.  Hmmmm, nobody camping OCEAN giants it seems.  ED pulls OCEAN giants and kills said OCEAN giants.  ED is splitting some OCEAN giants from the named OCEAN giant (Paeruk the I'llscrewyourdaughterandgetherpregnant).  BAM! SHITSTORM! SCREAMING! YELLING! /OOC! /SHOUT! /AUCTION! /REPORT! /PETITION! BITCHING! WHINING!  Paeruk peers out of his hut to see what all the commotion is, and see's some ugly humanoid things over by the OCEAN and decides to spanks their asses for being naughty.  Paeruk spies a 133t leaf-armor wearing thing shooting arrows at him and gives him a big-toe enema (Rikko, why did you tell Paeruk that Kit_of_VoLS voted for Ralph Nader?) .... Uhm, where was I.  Fuck it, I forgot.  Anyway, is OCEAN (hmmm, ocean) spelled correctly?  I think it is, but it doesn't look right in all caps, does it?  I wonder if I can fill up a whole page on this thread with just one post?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sorry we aren't as sinsiter as Kuras to take screenshots and make up stories about them, especially when our friends and guildies are in battle with 2+ giants.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I kinda understood about 42.835% of that post.  Of the portion that I think I kinda sorta understand, let me respond:  I think what Kuras was trying to do was shed some light on what he thought had happened.  He kinda sorta got it wrong, cause he put the &quot;sinister&quot; big red circle in the wrong place.  Then the sinister big red circle was sinisterly (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com" target="top">www.dictionary.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;-- that link is for me to go back and check the spelling of sinisterly) replaced with an even more sinister big white semicircle.  Then there were about pi to the 28th more screenshots that were posted (these were sinisterly (note to self, check the spelling on that word) stolen from another guilds website, and I think that guild hunts on the Torvonilllus server).<br>
<br>
So, as you can clearly see (I proved it!)  The named Sinister Big White Semicircle KS'd from the names Sinister Big Red Circle.  In retaliation, the named Sinister Big Red Circle trained the named Sinister Big White Semicircle.  This all happened while two guilds (their names are of no consequence because they both get raped by Paeruk the Rapist) were screaming and shouting at each other.  It's the truth and I don't lie, DAMMIT!  As a side note, there is a named Sinister Blue Octagon running around in ToV stealing camps, training people, and KS'g the named large rats (I just thought I should warn you of that!).  The next time me and Rikko get together we are going to go there and duo his sorry ass!  After that we are going to skyfire and killing the named Violet Rectangle!<br>
<br>
The tips of my fingers are bloody from all this typing, but I'm glad I could get to the bottom off this confusion.  You all can thank me in game by giving me your glyphed runes or metallic liquids.<br>

I'm curious if this was meant as a response to my post?  Did you call me an ass?

That seems a bit different than saying someone is an ass.  If you can't comprehend the difference between saying someone is acting like an asshole and what I stated previously, then obviously you fall under ED member #2.<br>

Yes I do understand.  You calling others names is okay, but it's not okay for others to call others names.  Well, not exactly, it just depends on how bad the name was.

No we went over to FG's after we finally got The Strong.<br>

Then on page 7 you said:<br>
<br>
No we had Ocean camped only, do i really have to keep repeating myself on that?? Pay attention boys.<br>
<br>
How can you be only camping the Ocean if you went to the FG’s? Sounds to me like you don’t know where you were or perhaps trying to claim all the named giants.<br>
<br>
ED came in and went to the OG named, you saw them and came running from the FG’s and tried to claim ownership. A pissing match ensued, thus a post on the flame board.<br>
<br>
Good job on the flame.<br>
<br>
But you are just as guilty in this matter as Kuras is. It takes two to create a fight. Personally, I think Vols is taking a shitstain along with ED. Kuras is truning out to be  mean necro and you are becomming a whiner.<br>
