PoF Recap 10/6</span><hr size=1> And this time, he left via the exit!  Woohoo!<br><br>I would first like to thank everyone who showed up.  It meant a lot to me to see a lot of people there who really only wanted to have fun and kill stuff.  You made my last regularly scheduled KCoG plane raid memorable.  I wish you all luck in the future.<br><br>I'd also like to thank everyone for waiting so patiently at the SW corner.  I was surprised this morning when I logged on at about 10am PST with my alliance doing a Phinny raid.  They were a tad short at the time so I went to help them out.  We got him, but it was almost 12pm PST when we did.  This is partly why I'm stepping down.  I dont like making choices between my guild, my alliance, and KCoG.  And sometimes those will come up.  But enough of that.  Everyone was calm and happily waiting the start of the festivities.<br><br>We quickly got groups formed up and Zellex even showed his head.  Of course, it took him a bit to get down since he was busy charming those sirens in CS.  Or was it getting charmed by them...  Anyway, we quickly formed 9 groups up.  Zellex scouted the portal and we buffed.  I'd like to thank some members of the Forged Alliance and especially Siena for coming down and helping to buff us with high level Shammie buffs.  It made a difference to the break group.<br><br>Once things were clear at the portal, we sent the first 4 groups on through to break the camp.  Now generally what htis means is that the first 4 groups break in, kill 3 or 4 wandering mobs, then evac.  Then reform at the portal and rinse and repeat till cleared.  While generally safer than having everyone zone in since things are easier to control, it often takes longer.  But not this time.  No sir, this time the break group zoned in and moved to camp.  There we killed continuously for almost 15 minutes with only a single death.  After that, the camp was clear.  Yup, we broke Fear with only 1 death.  Easy for uber guilds, outstanding for KCoG.  This was one of the smoothest fastest KCoG breaks I have ever seen.  And I want to congratulate everyone.  Sure others may do this regularly.  We dont and today we proved we can do anything Valoran or Grey Hawke do.<br><br>By 2pm the camp was clear and we had called the other groups into Fear.  This is where I stated what my plans were.  I wanted to clear the plane and WALK out of the zone.  To my knowlage this is something KCoG has never done.  Not with a fully pop'd plane in any event.<br><br>Yup, although the mini's werent up since Paralax took out CT last night, the plane was fully spawned except for that.  We formed up, and proceeded to kick ass.  Zellex and the pullers performed wonderfully as they pulled several mobs at once and went out for more.  During this period we had relatively few deaths and almost no downtime.<br><br>By 5pm people had started to leave.  But that was okay because we had a constant flow of people into the raid.  Yup, since I had thrown it wide open I also figured we'll take anyone late who showed up.  And many did.  For most of the raid we had upwards of 55 people inzone.  This caused some lag problems for some, but most people stuck it out.<br><br>By about 6pm mobs were getting scarce and the Broken Golem was up.  So the wizards figured out who would turn their piece in and we moved south to confront this Epic mob.  Now you turn in a piece to the broken golem who in turn spawns I believe the Enraged Golem or something like that.  This bad by looks like a Sprite Golem from Hate, is almost totally MR, and has about 150,000 hitpoints.  Thats right, this isnt a 1 group fight.  This sucker even resisted Harm Touch, although I was able to score several nukes, none was for full damage.  But we buffed up and kicked butt.  It was a long and tough fight.  Almost 7 minutes from start to finish I believe.  But in the end, we were victorious!  And with only ONE! death!  How cool was that?  And Macron became the proud owner of another step in his Epic Search.<br><br>We then moved back to the west camp and proceeded to pull the temple.  Yes, by 6:30pm the temple was all that was left.  This is where it got exciting.<br><br>There are about 15-20 Amy shellhead type mobs in the temple.  Zellex and Goreytor began to pull and kite several strings of mobs to the camp.  Somewhere in there I got a string of about 10 or 12 of them.  They didnt seem to want to break off into doable bunchs so I egress'd out and let them wander back.  However, our intrepid pullers soon found them again and pulled about 8 of them.  With the go from the enchanter, we brought all 8 of them plus a protoblob to camp at once.  Anyone who's been to Fear knows how bad 1 of these things can be.  We now had 8.  The enchanters were incredible, running all over mezing mobs.  Several people took the inititive to grab a mob and kite them away from the camp while we got things under control.  For awhile it looked bad.  We lost two enchanters, a number of people were dead, the clerics were going oom and so were the enchanters that were left.  I was ready to throw it in and let the remaining clerics camp.<br><br>But, so long as Odini was alive I felt there was hope.  So I watched as our two remaining enchanters went about keeping all the mobs mez'd while Rmog was able to concentrate on 1 of them and take it down.  This was increadible.  For a few minutes there, it was total chaos.  Mobs where everywhere, people were dropping, the screams and shouts could probably be heard in the Ferrot.  But no one paniced.  No one gated or evaced.  No one camped.  And no one broke mez.  Everyone used their assist keys and kept cool heads.  Within 10 minutes we had things under control.  This was one of the mobs incredible experiences of teamwork I have ever seen in the game.  I've seen more mobs taken down in Fear using AE techniques, but never on a one on one basis like today.  Anyone else would have been wiped out.  Anyone else would have had to camp their clerics and wash their hands of the matter.  But you didnt.  You kept at it, and everyone kicked ass.  When it was all over, we had a lot of dead raiders.  But over two thirds of us were still alive and there were less than 6 mobs still alive.<br><br>Yes, 6 mobs.  This doesnt iclude some Glare Lords and pets that arent worth anyone's trouble that sit quietly.  In a couple of small pulls we took out the remaining Amy's in the temple and pulled back to the West camp.<br><br>We did have a few LD's during this, and one person apparently fell asleep at his keyboard, but everything was fine.  Our LD's apparently managed to get back okay, and we ported the AFK person out of the zone.  There a guide quickly answered the petition and logged him out of the game.  Now how cool is that?  I dont care what people say about Verant and CS, when I've needed them, they've been there.  I forgot the guide's name, but thank you as well.  But enough about that.<br><br>Oh yes.  Its now 7pm.  AND FEAR IS CLEARED.  Yes, let me say this again.  WE CLEARED FEAR IN 5 HOURS.  I've been on CoG raids where we're still trying to break the camp at this point.  And we were done.  I had people asking if they could still join and they couldnt believe we were finished.  Even the largest guilds dont do all that much better.  5 hours people.  You all did an awesome job.<br><br>And so we finish lottoing off the rest of the trinkets and stuff.  And we say our goodbyes and thank yous.  The mobs droped a fairly standard amount of loot, dissapointing to some, great for others.  But in the end we had a lot of fun I think.  We did something not all that many people do.  Then we did something that few players in the game ever get a chance to do.  We walked out of Fear.  Through the exit portal in the temple.<br><br>This had been my goal from the begining.  And everyone that came helped make a part of it true.  I'd like to thank everyone who came and helped.  It didnt matter if you came in the begining, middle, or end.  If you stayed all the way, or had to leave early.  You all had a part in this, and I thank each and every one of you.  And for those who were able to stay, you got one of the choicest treats in the game.  We walked to the temple beyond the firewall in Fear.  Walked to the exit.  Then zoned out without having to port or gate.  Unless  you are very lucky, or are helping a CT guild clear the plane, this is something you may never experience again.  What makes it even more special to me is how everyone helped to make it happen.<br><br>I've never been on a KCoG raid where more people have come together to do more and have a good time than this one.  I never heard any complaints, I didnt see people screwing up left and right.  Everyone did what they had to and had fun the rest of the time.  I've always been proud to have been on CoG raids.  They havent been easy or always fun.  They're often a lot of work and worry.  But the pride and joy come from seeing so many diverse people, from so many time zones, guilds, even countries come together for a common cause.  Not for alliance, or guild, or country, but for each other.  Watching people come together to help each other is what I think this is all about.  And I've never been prouder to have said I've been part of KCoG than tonight.<br><br>All too soon many of us will move on.  To other guilds and alliances, to other games, to real life commitments, and the future beyond.  I hope those who were there tonight, and those who share in these events vicariously, will always take with them the knowlage of something special.  KCoG was unique when it started.  The idea of many smaller and less capable guilds banding together outside of alliances to do large targets simply was scoffed at.  The idea that so many different people could get together was absurd.  Over the last year and a half everyone has proven just how absurd an idea it was.  Now there are Guild Concils on many different servers, all because of the faith and determination everyone had.<br><br>I've said it before, I've never led a raid here.  I've merely shown a path and people have followed.  And I thank everyone who had the faith in me to do so.  That means far more to me than any amount of loot can ever mean.  Because the memories I've shared with everyone here and on other raids will always follow me wherever I go.<br><br>I have no doubt KCoG will endure as long as Everquest does.  And even when Everquest is finshed and done, those of you who have been a part will take that with you whever you go.  And so I thank you all for coming and helping to share in a vision not your own.  I'll leave with one of my favorite quotes.<br><br>May the road rise up to meet you, and may the sun always be at your back.<br><br>It has been an honor and pleasure to have know people such as all of you.  I'll raid with all of you anytime.<br><br>Kellory Silverstar<br>Druid, 55, Crunchy!<br>KCoG Plane Raid Liason<br>The Watchmen <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umechyhimeros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mechy Himeros</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/7/01 3:06:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://circleofmisteq.homestead.com/files/Mechy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kellory has Left the Building!
