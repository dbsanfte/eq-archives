<br>
I would like to add, this area is subject to raids...I thought one of the major reasons for the calendar was to help guilds plan raids..and prevent squabbles and race wars in these zones.<br>
<br>
The example of SEB may have some merit for adding SEB to the calendar, though I have yet to encounter a raid there...luck I suppose,...but I have encountered raid confusion recently in Hate...because one guild was under the misunderstanding that Hate had been removed from the calendar...not just under discussion.<br>
<br>
To quote a an NB rep....&quot;Why fix what ain't broke?&quot;<br>
<br>
As to people not going for exp grinding on FFA days....sounds like a personal problem. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

There is no reason for some of the current rules and restirctions of the reservation system to apply to Hate anymore.<br>
<br>
This is what I propose:<br>
<br>
1.  Leave Hate on the reservation system, to allow guilds the ability to plan thier raids in advance.<br>
2.  Modify the current reservation rules to include this note:<br>
<br>
&quot;The Plane of Hate may be considered a normal FFA exp zone as long as the alliance that has that paticular day reserved is not actively raiding the zone.  When the alliance that has that day reserved first ports into the Plane they need to inform anyone that maybe in the zone that they will be beginning thier raid soon.  Anyone that is not part of that alliance must vacate the zone as soon as possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
* Note:  These changes would only apply to the reservation system for Hate, the rules for Fear woudl remain the same.<br>
<br>
This allows guilds the ability to still reserve the plane, while removing the penatly for actions that do not harm those reserving the plane. <p>&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A HREF=&amp;quot;http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus&amp;quot; TARGET=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;IMG SRC=&amp;quot;http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg&amp;quot; HEIGHT=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; WIDTH=&amp;quot;400&amp;quot; ALT=&amp;quot;Milambus Mandragon&amp;quot; BORDER=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shariona>Shariona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mirth's Virtue - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/19/03 2:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=388.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Posting privs on Guild Rep forum, and PoH feedback.</span><hr size=1> Well we have pretty much beat this dead horse into Glue.<br>
<br>
While I agree from the standpoint of the larger guilds, removing Hate makes sense. I do not agree that it makes sense for those of us who are regularly reserving the zone.<br>
<br>
You have made a clear proposal.<br>
<br>
So far only 8 guilds have actually stated their vote one way or another.<br>
Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears to 3 guilds for remove from calendar, 4 for leave as is and 1 abstention.<br>
<br>
And about dozen more guilds who should have an opinion, but have not commented.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should make a separate thread state the proposal and ask for only votes....no debate on that thread.<br>
<br>
As it stands right now consensus is for leave as is. In spite of Rogg's literary talents...he is only one vote. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

<br>
That's not the issue. <br>
<br>
The issue is if it is a 'bad thing' if a group is killing mobs that will repop in 30 minutes or less, before that reserving guild or entity goes in to kill stuff. <br>
<br>
Let me be absolutely crystal clear for the people who think that there is potential to piss in pools...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I agree that any group of CB could go in and probably take down Maestro and Inny and waltz through Hate with no problem.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is more than incorrect, this is absurd. Our entire guild could not kill Inny at the moment; the *old* version, maybe, but just as the zone has been upgraded, so have the zone bosses. Inny would be a raid level encounter suitable for Noble Blade, BotS, Tindi, FK, etc. The descussion about waltzing through the zone has been, and always will be, centered on mobs that repop in 30 minutes. It isn't about farming the boss mobs, it's about killing mobs that act, work, and exist like xp mobs. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Can you agree, that just as it was in the begginning there are guilds and alliances as posting entities....who do not have the capability to do that?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
No. I do not agree. ANY guild or alliance with 40+ planeable members (remember, they have to have that to reserve the day...) any guild that has 40 planable members, who have any gear from kunark and above, would be able to kill the same mobs that I am talking about. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Hang around the entrance...yes...but waltz through...no<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Last night my group of 4 was pulling from the maestro's spawn area (he was down). There is *no mob* in hate that repops in 20 minutes that my group of 4 cannot kill. There is no mob in hate that respawns in 20 minutes, that a group of 6 who have kunark/early *EARLY* velious armor cannot kill, so long as their people know their ass from their elbow. If they don't, no gear would save them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
How about Sky....which is still on Calendar?<br>
<br>
It is not death on entrance to go there...why not take it off Calendar?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Fear is not an easy break in...but I have seen groups enter and kill near the entrance with no problem. So why not open Fear so those over 65 with great gear can go farm Fear? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What's the repop in sky? Eight hours or more. If you zone in and kill the mobs, you ruin the reserved raid. <br>
<br>
Are you purposely missing the point? Hate has been changed, it no longer works, acts, or looks like an old world plane. Hate is no longer able to be compared to fear or sky with regards to the normal zone mobs. ALL of the non-raid level mobs repop in 30 minutes or less. There is no potential to ruin someone's raid *at all* even if you killed *every single zone mob* 2 minutes before they got there. <br>
<br>
If sky and fear repopped in 30 minutes, minus the bosses, than, frankly, yes, they should also be open to the groups that want to go in and farm items or get some xp. The *only* exception to that would be sky, as Sirran the Lunitic can only be up on one island at a time, if I recall, and that would be potentially raid ruining. <br>
<br>
However! Those are moot points, since Hate is completely and utterly differant than when it went on the Calandar originally. <br>
<br>
It is not *just* the fact that it is a safe zone in, like sebilis. It is not *just* the fact that it is a fast respawn with easy mobs, like sebilis.<br>
It is not *just* the fact that anyone who can reserve a day, and really, any balanced group of 50+, can kill successfully in the zone and not impact anyone's raid in the very least<br>
<br>
It is all of them considered *together*<br>
<br>
As for counting the above statements as votes? The issue itself hadn't been resolved; some of the people above were posting as if the only options were 'leave it as it is&quot; or &quot;always FFA&quot;. <br>
<br>
That's not the question, or the situation at all. <br>
<br>
The question isn't &quot;FFA or As it is now&quot;, the question is &quot;Is it suitable to have a rule against being there on a reserved day, if killing the normal zone mobs can't possibly impact on someone's raid?&quot;<br>
<br>
The answer to that, unless you are completely unreasonable, is 'no, it is not suitable to punish people for killing zone mobs that don't impact the people reserving the plane at all&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Amended reservation rule for hate would be the solution I am after, as it keeps the zone reserved for the people who reserve it, but doesn't make it a 24 hour no fly zone that doesn't have to be there, and doesn't make sense to be there. <br>

Any given mob has a chance to drop certain items.  For example, mage epic staff from hate drops from any male revenant (including the magi p'tasa miniboss or named).  Every spawn point has a chance to spawn certain mobs.  There are a lot of spawns that can spawn a male revenant.  There is one spawn point that can spawn Magi.  If it doesn't spawn a Magi, it spawns something else.  As soon as you kill the mob that spawned there in about 20 minutes something will spawn.  That spawn can be a Magi or something else.  What spawned there before has no bearing on what will spawn there next.<br>
<br>
I camped the AC in OoT for about 9 hours once.  It finally spawned, I killed and looted ring.  We were just getting ready to leave and pop... another AC.  Killed again.  Any given spawn will produce certain mobs.  The chance for a given mob to spawn there is the same each time something spawns there and there is no facility in the game to know what spawned last for purposes of determining what will spawn now.  When a spawn is due, a choice is made what mob to spawn weighted only by the percentage chance of any particular mob spawning.  <br>
<br>
Loot is much the same way.  A given mob has a chance to drop a variety of things likely weighted by a percentage chance.  It would be entirely feasible to go to Hate, kill male revenants and get 0 mage epic staves 42 raids in a row.  Then go one time and get 3 on 3 consecutive kills.  It isn't likely that either of those will happen but it is possible.  What the mob dropped last time it was killed has no bearing on what it will drop next time.<br>
<br>
I hope that is helpful information.  With the exception of mobs that only spawn over long periods of time, one can go there and kill every mob in the place and when you show up you still have the same opportunity to get the items / spawns you were looking for some 20-30 minutes later.<br>
<br>
That is why I support changing the rules but leaving on reservation.  Reservation is very helpful to smaller guilds.  Without it I suspect DHG would be less progressed than currently.  I do not wish to deny that advantage to any other guilds that can use the advantage.   On the other hand, if someone kills mobs for 3 hours before you arrive you have lost nothing except maybe 20-30 minutes before respawns occur.  You still know you have a place to raid, when it will start and know that you have &quot;control&quot; over the plane.<br>
<br>
Indeed, with the proposed rule change, you could reserve the plane, go up in the morning spend a few hours there and leave.  Go back in the evening and do it all again.  This was not possible under the previous rules as once you vacated the plane it became FCFS.<br>
<br>
I understand why you are against the rule change.  It doesn't seem to be based on facts as I know them though.  If the facts were as you stated, that someone killing mobs before you got there would impact the loot you could receive, I wouldn't support a rule change.<br>

Though I am not sure it changes my personal opinion, it may change the alliance opinion.<br>
<br>
I still think that what is going to happen will be confusion and arguments when a raid comes into zone and encounters exp groups. And they are goign to be ugly ones.<br>

No, I believe that I have actually said what I want, and to recap, what I want is *not* to take hate off a reservation system. I also said what I want is to allow guilds that have to reserve hate, to still do so, without taking the entire 24 hour period to themselves, when they will raid for what? 12 hours is a long day, so go with 12 hours. That's still 36 spawns per spawn point that are unused. Why?<br>
<br>

The size of your guild, as you brought up in the general thread, is not a relevant factor. The gear and progression in the game, maybe, or your attendance, maybe, but the guild size is standardized for calandar posting rights at 40 level 46+. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I will ignore the accusation in that statement because we are on the guild rep forum. Quite frankly, your dissenting opinion has been full of mistakes, and points on which you are/were wrong. When you made factual errors, I replied to them. If you feel that having someone correct you when you are wrong, is 'drowning you out', I cannot help you. <br>
<br>
For me, this is an exercise in true/false replies to questions.<br>
<br>
The purpose of a reserved day is to protect guilds from finding out their hate raid has no mobs up: True<br>
The mobs once popped at 8 hours or more: True<br>
The zone has recently been changed: True<br>
The mobs no longer pop at 8 hours or more: True<br>
The zone mobs will not be down for any significant amount of time: True<br>
The rules for the zone mobs no longer reflect the mechanics of the zone: True<br>
<br>
What does all that mean? It means that logically, and factually, ignoring the truth that the rules no longer reflect the mechanics of the zone is answering &quot;false&quot; to that last question, or really any of them, which is impossible. The rules made to protect raids from finding no zone mobs up, no matter what spin you put on it, no longer reflect the pop times of the zone mobs. <br>
<br>
If the one worry you have is that people won't leave when asked, that has never been an issue that the reservation system fixed. If people didn't leave, that was their call. <br>
<br>
I am, however, interested in making the punishment harsher for not leaving a plane on a reserved day, but only if the &quot;crime&quot; is well defined and actually fits with the mechanics of the zone. Harsh and terrible punishments for ...killing a mob that will be back in 20 minutes? <br>
<br>
Only someone who either didn't understand the argument, or wanted to be incredibly stubborn and unfair, would think that was suitable. <br>

<br>
I think the proposed rule change makes the rules quite clear.  If someone has the plane booked, when they arrive, they have the &quot;say-so&quot; as to what happens.  There's nothing to really discuss and the final decision lies with the reserving entity.<br>
<br>
I've been on both sides of this.  We took a couple groups up to farm for some epic pieces on an unscheduled evening.  There was already 3 people (a 3 box I believe) at zone in.  I asked if they minded if we stayed making it clear it was up to them since they were there first.  After knowing where we were going they said fine.<br>
<br>
We had a scheduled day up there.  I was asked prior by someone that also wanted to go up.  I stated what area we were going to clear.  I let them go up with the understanding that the area we wanted was to be left untouched.  We co-existed nicely.  They even waited to go up until I was available to agree.<br>
<br>
In both cases there was no argument as it was clear who had the right to make the decision.  It is my opinion that a great deal of the guilds and players are decent reasonable folks.  Sure there are some tards around which is one of the reasons we have rules at all.  In my experience MOST situations are resolved very amicably.  The ones that aren't get hashed out by RTA and/or FC.  <br>
<br>
It's quite possible that there will be some problems that crop up however the proposed rule is just as clear as the old rule.  If you have it scheduled, it's your plane and you make the decisions on who can be in zone and who can't.  Indeed the only real change is that there can be someone there ahead of you in the plane which must leave when you arrive.  If they get belligerent about it then no consideration need be given, just tell them to get out it's reserved and if they don't like it take it up here.<br>
<br>
I'd even bet a great deal of the time there will be no competition for the zone at all.  If someone has it scheduled I wouldn't even bother going.<br>

A guild pulling to zone in will never get some of the mini's to pop.  The way it is set up now you have to move around, or have a lot of people to beat the respawns to get the mini's.<br>

I'm going to pretend that doesn't rip a hole in my mind!<br>
<br>
Yep, they've absolutely changed the zone around. It's vastly differant in terms of pathing, mob location, building location, and layout. It looks very pretty now, and is a lot less 'dark' than the old hate. You should go, Nyca, it's really a nice zone.<br>
<br>
Maestro and Hand and Inny are around the zone, I've only been to the Maestro and Hand spawn points myself, in a cathedral building. They are not on the list of mini's, because really, they arn't mini's any more (hand is, kinda, but not really).<br>

Thanks for making my point.<br>
<br>
That is defintely a matter of perspective Rogg. They are for a small less well equiped guild.<br>
And if we pass the change in rule...that perspectivewill be a constant pain, because of that nonchalant attitude from people who can kill them easily. They aren't kinda...they are,..period.<br>
