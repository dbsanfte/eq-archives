How can you not care if someone tried to commet suicide?  And you see one of your 'friends'(Guildmate) making fun of them and pushing them for it?  I forgot, you have to have basic human decency for that.  I guess I'm weak, just seeing people like this makes me sick, how can you even stand to not care about another human being, whether you know them or not? <p><a target=_blank href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9997>

<br>
If something tragic happened to your RL friends happened, would you not want it to be published on an internet public board?  I don't think so.  You would want to respect the persons privacy.  <br>
<br>
Sky isn't just being ripped on for training some frigging monsters in a stupid zone in a game.  He's being attacked BECAUSE he brought out something that someone wanted to be kept private on a public forum.  Ask yourself this...if this happened to your RL best friend or a close one, would YOU want this on the net?  F*** no.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, friendships in RL are made through EQ.  And, like a good friend, I stick up for those who get attacked like this...humiliated like this.  <br>
<br>
So ask yourself what I asked above...about respecting peoples RL privacy, before defending him and saying he's right to bring that out in the public.  Think about it.<br>

<br>
People do not &quot;pretend to commit suicide for attention&quot;.  People attempt suicide because they feel like they've lost all hope.<br>
<br>
Yes, I felt that way.  I had a rough breakup a few months back, I was out of school (and since I worked at school, I lost my job), my friends were all off in school, so I spent most of my day sitting at home staring at my computer screen.  Yes, it's quite sad and pathetic, but that's how it happened...<br>
<br>
I'm personally not thinking &quot;all of LoS are assholes who don't care&quot; because I know some members of LoS and I know that some of them are pretty cool people, so I hope none of you think that =) I was pretty shocked that Sky would cross the line of EQ and say what he said.  I would never tell the world of EQ of the RL things I've known Sky to be infamous for, because frankly, if he doesn't want it to be known, then it's none of my business to say anything.<br>
<br>
How am I doing now? Better.  Great? Nah, but better than before, which is a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Sky wanted attention and he got it, I'm sure he's happy in his own twisted sick way.<br>

There are ways that will definitely kill you, there are ways that might kill you or might not, and there are ways that sure as hell aren't going to kill you, and in fact are almost guaranteed to get you caught and draw attention to it.  Like that guy who tried to commit suicide by eating 200 aspirin.  WTF.<br>
<br>
Rasp, no, that's not saying you're the third type, just wanted to clear that up.  I've had way too many friends that chose the third method to believe that nobody ever does it when deep down all the want is attention.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Bremadle is someone who used to be a pretty cool guy and a lot of fun to hang out with, until he got his LoS tag.  Then the rest of the server stopped existing and wasn't worth talking to.<br>
