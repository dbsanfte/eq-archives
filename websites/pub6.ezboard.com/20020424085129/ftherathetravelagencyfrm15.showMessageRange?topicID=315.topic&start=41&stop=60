We had a few extra people come up(which was almost immediately afterwards voted on to change the rules so that WE were right), and we attempted to kill Cazic Thule under the BB cluase and failed.  Unfortunately, we were unable to do so due to the time being so late and people logging.  By the time we called in the BB, we were in violation of that clause due to it being to late.  Of course, 3 days later, that point was moot when they revamped the planes.<br>
<br>
Our punishment:  Banning from posting raids on this calandar for one month, even though 90% of the community thought that we should have had the rules bent for us.  At that time, I was a little pissed at the decision, however we lived with it knowing that at that point and time, we WERE in the wrong.<br>
<br>
My point is this.  Be it a small rule, or a large rule, if you break them, then you should be held responsible for it.  Don't get me wrong, I know quite a few people that are in SoT, some in RL, and hell they are great people, but as the saying goes; If you wanna play in the game, you have to abide by the rules.<br>
<br>
I'm actually a rather new member to Tindi, however I'm starting to get a hang of the &quot;high end&quot; game now that I am.  I think that the same rules that apply LoM, EotF, etc etc (examples only) should apply to everyone.  You may say that the rules don't apply due to them not being on the rotation, however if you look instead at the spirit of rules rather than the exact rule itself, I think you'll agree.<br>
<br>
Anyways, just my two bits here.. hope this can be worked out. <p><CENTER>

<br>
You get your day. <br>
<br>
And you get a privilege : The server promises to leave you alone with the mob on rotation that day. No one will interfere, no one will try to race and kill.<br>
<br>
<br>
You also make a commitement : You will do your upmost to kill that mob within your time frame and if you fail no one will be pissed, @#%$ happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
What happened here is a guild had a few rotations up (luck of the draw).<br>
Not impossible to do thanks to their power but hard nevertheless because of their &quot;short&quot; window of effectiveness (timewise).<br>
This guild decided to kill OTHER mobs than those on rotation and also refused to discuss or solve their problem of respecting the rotation.<br>
<br>
We all understand the concept of real Life and work and familly.<br>
Had this guild gone directly for the rotation mobs and have had to overstepped the 24h limit would they have been aggressed by the other members of the community ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Most surely NOT.<br>
<br>
I do hope you are honest enough to realise this as the truth.<br>
<br>
The problem we are facing today doesn't not come per se from the few hours late of King Tormax death, this community as shown often enough it's willingness to act in fairness and openmindedness rather than a measly sticking to the wording of the rules.<br>
<br>
The problem comes from the way it was done. The guild holding the rotation rights choose to ABUSE it's privileges and the goodwill of it's neighbours to try and rake in as many l33t m3bs as possible.<br>
<br>
This guild choose to stay death to openings from other members of this community to try and solve the difficulties that were obvious to all.<br>
<br>
Then this guild did a little PR spinning and basically did as it wanted to do which is abuse the system.<br>
<br>
My dear SoTs, i wil stand by you against anyone that insults you and uses unacceptable racists terms such as some we sawfloating around a few weeks back but what you did yesterday was as much an insult to the whole community.<br>
<br>
And neither are acceptable. <p>Ootampa Nitekiksass<br>*Worldcup 98 Eurocup 2000*</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulukieb2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukieb2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/29/01 10:34:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SoT violates is hypocracy to the be King Tormax Rotation</span><hr size=1>    Ssorn: I was being sarcastic when i called you a god, and /kneeled or whatever. <br>
<br>
   I am not part of SoT but I believe that enough is enough.  I've sat back for almost a month and read all this bullshit over and over again.  You sit there and say that their diplomacy is elementary etc...That in itself is hypocracy.  Diplomacy is met when leaders get together and have discussions about issues.  What I have seen over the past month is a bunch of @#%$ being blown out of proportion.  What has been the best part of it all is people coming onto these boards feeding the fire and saying &quot;SoT's leadership sucks blah blah blah&quot;.  Maybe you should start questioning your leadership.  Part of leadership is having control of your people and keeping them in acceptable form. When guildies come onto flames and make posts IT IS a  direct reflection upon the guild and it's leader.  This type of stuff should stay in game and should be discussed between guild leaders, not everyone just throwing @#%$ at each other.  <br>
<br>
  Added to this is the fact that you guys all have screwed up at one point in time and can't even admit to it.  Instead, you lower your heads and charge in like you have something constructive to say and spew @#%$ all over this board.  This place looks like Jerry Springer - bb .  So, either you can continue acting like you are and entertain everyone, or you can do something constructive and leave your leaders to do their job of diplomacy.  BTW,  I don't think that includes coming to flame boards and flaming other guilds..<br>

<br>
Enough fooking drama!   And starting this in Flame Central showed intent.   I wont say I agree or disagree with keeping a stopwatch on standby on some spawn issues..  but ENOUGH of the drama.<br>
<br>
Time for the guild leaders to stop measuring piss lines and stuff the ego long enough to talk to nip this god damned soap opra in the bud before it gets out of control and draws ALL of us in like the pre-split RTA days.    <br>
<br>
This includes going to other server boards and throwing hissy fits.    There is stupid @#%$ being tossed around from all camps..  all of you grow the @#%$ up and work it out.<br>

All we have in this virtual world are the words someone else types out. You become familar with that person or persons and base your judgements about them from what they say and what they do.<br>
<br>
You are also forgetting, it seems, that by your involvement on the rotations of these mobs, you have the responcibility to uphold TIME frames. Pardon me if I'm wrong, but didn't ALL the guilds on rotation AGREE to these time frames?<br>
<br>
I mean hell...it's not like &lt;small guild X that has nothing to do with the rotations or could even kill those mobs&gt; told all those on rotation what we wanted you to do and when. YOU all talked about the rules. YOU all made those rules. YOU all agreed to those rules.<br>
<br>
If there are rules with no consequences..then why the hell have rules??<br>
<br>
As for BoTs coming to the boards to post this here instead of going directly to the GM or officers of SoT....I doubt he would waste his time after the ToV situation.<br>
<br>
To those only with the wit to have a responce like &lt;get a life and fresh air&gt;, please feel free to spend your time doing just that instead of posting it here. <br>
<br>
BoTs asked if SoT was going for King T since SoT was up on rotation for him. SoT said yes and stated the time guaranteeing he would be dead by then. SoT was many hours off that time because they were killing other mobs.<br>
<br>
Seems pretty simple to me. Then again, I'm a firm believer in K.I.S.S.<br>

<br>
I don't think Merloc posted here with the intent to flame.  He proposed a separate topic in the General area to propose a punitive system for those that break the rules of rotation.  His posted ended up drawing a couple of flames but I think it has become civil and constructive again.  Hell when you have Falconus and Umbali agreeing, either the moon is made of cheeze or there is acutally something constructive going on.<br>
<br>
BTW, this is a &quot;Flame Central:  Flame here!  Anything goes!&quot; board.  I don't think I will have to explain that to you.  You seem intelligent enough to figure it out.<br>
<br>
I am sure this is being/will be discussed.  An agreement was made by SoT as far as Emil posts states and SoT still broke the agreement.  People will flame here especially those that don't like SoT (obvious to me Sssorn is a SoT basher).  I don't like some people in their guild but like a lot of them too.  Same applies to BotS and the other guilds.  <br>
<br>
I don't come here to truly flame unless Kagato opens his hole (btw, GG SoT nice choice for a guildie lol).  I honestly try to call them without bias and just state my opinion.  I piss off some of each of the guilds on the Rathe with what I say but guess what like it or not I play on this server too.  As far as controlling what your guildies post, is the foundation of Deviants of Norrath based on communism?<br>

1.  EVERY time we have been contacted about whether or not we will kill MobX within the rotation time we have responded and abided by what we have said.  Example: Shei contacted Emil over 2 patch nights ago asking about CT when we were in ToV-N, we told him that we couldn't meet the 24-hour rule so we passed.<br>
2.  After 24 hours, the next guild can kill MobX.  If we left a mob up over 24 hours, if you go back and check, I'm sure we left the 24 hour slot in for the next guild to kill MobX.  The Tormax that was left up was left up over 48 hours -- 24 hours for us, 24 hours for SoT, next 24 hours is ours because there are only two guilds on the rotation.<br>

So the question is why all the bitching all of the sudden? Could it perhaps be we were somewhat succesful in ntov and taking loot that would normally go to you? Was very entertaining to see fitten's oocs in tov to try to get us to leave and kill yeli / tormax espec sense they left yeli a good amount of time the following week.<br>

Unless you are severely dillusional, you will realize that other guilds (other than SoT even) will be in ToV-N eventually.  We realized this back at Trakanon while SoT was still raiding Lower Guk.  If you look back at our initial rotation agreements with KEG on Trakanon, you will see the provisions for other guilds to join into the rotation that were agreed upon with the original rotation agreement.  This is not about who gets what loot.  This is about giving people fair shots and easing server tensions.  If you would like, I will post the discussion that Shei, Haxx, Thundaron, Karadoc, Emil, and I had in PoM the other night, specifically outlining a rotation agreement with provisions for the NEXT guilds to join the rotation as well.  If you go back and actually read my /ooc's, you will see that I was requesting a clear answer on the following question, since Shei was determined to give me NO answer whatsoever (yes, he told me specifically that he would not answer my question one way or another).   My question was:  Will SoT be able to kill Tormax within the 24 hour limit of the rotation agreement or will they pass?  The answer I got from Shei was that he wouldn't answer me at all.  Karadoc then /tell me to talk with him for a while so I did.  We then agreed to meet in PoM to discuss Tormax and ToV-N rotations.  At that discussion, I asked could SoT kill Tormax by noon Eastern.  SoT said they probably couldn't but could by noon Pacific.  Emil and I agreed to extend the 24 hour window for them (the server was up at noon Eastern) to noon Pacific to accomodate SoT (3 extra hours at their request).  All four members of SoT agreed to this time as did both member of BotS.  Yesterday at noon Pacific, there were 24 members of SoT in Kael and they were waiting to start the raid.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, I have been sending emails to Shei for over two weeks and Thundaron now for several days trying to discuss rotations on ToV-N (Shei asked me to discuss it over email with him).  As of yet, I have sent four emails to Shei (three of them also to Thundaron) over the past 9 days and have not received a response from them.  I have posted on SoT's General Board asking for Thundaron's email address and have posted a request today that they read their email and respond.<br>
<br>
There is the whole issue of what happened in ToV-N Tuesday night that we can address as well.  Specifically since Shei discussed with me one course of action then did another that we specifically discussed wouldn't be a good idea.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that I will be making a huge post on this board again soon, unfortunately.  So far, Thundaron and I have been discussing things every night to clear up some issues but he has told me that there are things that he can't do.  He has asked me to hold off on posting the whole deal here and I have been at his request so we can attempt to work things out. <p><P>

<br>
If you haven't noticed the high end game on blue servers is primarily raid based PvE. Bots had nothing to kill that day outside of Ntov due to rotations, SoT had 3(KT+CT+sleepers) possibly 4(i am not sure on yeli rotation status) things to do outside Ntov. Sot goes to Ntov which means Bots can't really get anywhere there, and are still under rotation rules. so they try to find out the status of the other rotation mobs so they might have something to do on the patch day, and sot gives them @#%$.<br>
<br>
To all those people who say &quot;go do your game while we do ours&quot; it would be nice if that was possible in a situation like this, and i would like a hit off the fatty your smoking if you believe it is.<br>
<br>
So anyways bots enforces the rotation rules after being ignored and being stuck with not much to do on the patch day, and gives sot the full 24 hours on several mobs to only have Sot violate the rotation rules on KT which Bots could have easily takin down patch day. This seems a big deal to me when one guild has an overcrowded day of mobs, chooses to add more, then takes the next day to kill ones they were supposed to the first. <br>
<br>
Then members from Sot come and flame/insult people for coming here and saying they would like a punishment for the rules violated and say it doesn't matter he wouldn't spawn between *now* and the next patch day. what if the servers had dropped Patch night? it's very possible considering all the new work they are doing for luclin. *poof* wasted rotation mob.<br>
<br>
The point of rotations are to spread things out to assure all mobs die in a timely fashion. SoT could have very EASILY been patient enough to wait until this coming luclin patch (where Bots would be up for ST/KT/yeli?) to take their jaunt into Ntov. Once agian, if you don't believe this true give me a puff please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Fact is the rules were violated when another guild enforced them, and as such a punishment should be administered.<br>
<br>

<br>
Your post is an indictment of not only me, but of anyone who chooses to flame, and thus remains quite toothless.  Further, if enough is enough to you, why don't you kindly stop reading the flame board?  <br>
<br>
See, here is where you are missing the whole point of the flame board my dear anonymoid.  Folks tend to be on their best behavior when the teacher is in the room, or a cop walks by.  Why is that?  Because these people have the power to punish transgressions.  Similarly, the flame board is EQ's 'cop' because it also gives members the power to punish transgressions through social ostracism, flames and laughter directed at the transgressors.<br>
<br>
It's funny that this has to be spelled out three years into this game really.  Everyone knows the flames and flame boards serve an important purpose since there is basically no other way to police intentionally inappropriate or disrespectful behavior in this game.  However, the impact of flame boards upon transgressors is only as effective as the level of 'care' such people have at being ostracized and laughed at.  The more that members of SoT respond to flames and thus exhibit a high level of care, the more obvious it is that the flame board is an effective way to police their conduct.<br>
<br>
That, after all, is what makes every SoT post herein claiming otherwise, a joke unto itself.<br>

<br>
The King Tormax and Lord Yelinak agreements have zero to do with the RTA. The RTA began and has continued to govern only the Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate, and Plane of Sky. Thus, the only dates on the RTA calender that individuals can sign up on are for those three planes. Both King Tormax and Lord Yelinak rotations were set up by representivies of Bots and SOT. And, now of recent Tindi has entered the King Tormax rotation upon killing him this past weekend. Consequently, all marks and rules of the rotations are run by those three guilds who are involved, and not by the RTA. Posts are made here on them and newly created sections in the &quot;Rotation&quot; area because this is the community message board as well. On Bots' previous Lord Yelinak which Gromm initated a rotaiton on, and King Tormax both were killed far past the 24 hour mark. If there are any ramifications for SOT doing that, the same should be imposed on Bots.<br>
<br>
Obviously your post, which is in the flame section was meant  not to work out what to do in instances of killing past duration or time order. but to create another piss fight in which people use slander rather than content. If you truly had the intent of working on the rules and actions of them, you would coordinate a meeting with all three guild leaders. I have a pretty good relationship with Lalu and Gradukk, ( I haven't spoken to Datalore much) and a meeting would not be difficult. Instead, you posted creating more pointless bickering that gets no where and damages the game for everyone. <br>
<br>
Addressing SOT COHing into Northern Tov and killing the seven dragons, we were *never* in any agreement about not doing so. In fact, after killing Aaryonar one of the first tells I got was from Gromm/Fitten asking that Bots be in a rotation on Ikitair, Eashen, and Aaryonar and wanted to do them next week, I said fine. For one week, zero agreements on SOT would do that week were made. What Bots expected us to do that next patch was is still unknown. If they really wanted to make an agreement they would have called a meeting. On the night before the patch day, one of SOT's officers contacted Emil, an officer and leader in Bots addressing SOT's plans.  <br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue Nov 27 00:08:49 2001] Emil tells you, 'my only misgivings with you all cohing up there, is that its somewhat artificial progression'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 00:08:55 2001] Emil tells you, 'but ill see what others say'<br>
<br>
At this point Emil told Rara he would talk to Mistabone.<br>
<br>
Later that night with no response Rara sent these tells.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:13:31 2001] You told emil, 'logging in a few mins'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:13:31 2001] Emil tells you, 'AFK Message: for a while'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:14:33 2001] You told emil, 'assuming that since a rot was outlined and at this stage it is our understanding that all we needed to do was to kill aary to be 'allowed' into ntov'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:14:33 2001] Emil tells you, 'AFK Message: for a while'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:14:50 2001] You told Emil, 'and we killed him last week'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:14:51 2001] Emil tells you, 'AFK Message: for a while'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:15:44 2001] You told Emil, 'so unless we hear from you a deffinite Dont Go we will be heading there tomorrow and coh'ing in to the back part'<br>
[Tue Nov 27 01:15:45 2001] Emil tells you, 'AFK Message: for a while'<br>
<br>
<br>
Where as Emil was AFK, Rara is from England and is 8 hours ahead of PST. I was on all night until 4 AM EST and never received any tells from Emil nor did anyone in my guild.<br>
<br>
If it was clear that there was an agreement for SOT not to go into N tov on Patch day then why would a Bots Officer and one of it's main leaders even have to check the night before the patch. How can one expect SOT to know and follow a supposed official agreement if one was never made. Emil obviouslly did not know of one, how could a whole other guild. <br>
<br>
The are posts by Bots members of SOT being liars and other mindless slander, show that they are making uninformed responses. EMIL Bots 2nd or 3rd in command did not know of a supposed &quot;agreement&quot; made the night before the patch. <br>
<br>
At this point there are heavy talks underway in E-Mail and in /t form to reform the rotation system between Bots and SOT and have a consistant place for it. Vincecross did set up Rotation forums for people to dicuss which is a start. <br>
<br>
Be safe.<br>

  There you go again bud.  Anonynoid ROFL.  Sorry, if you don't know me, I must be anonymous.  Get my IP and start tracing me down.  And you do have a point, I am against most of this flaming bullshit because that is all it is BULLSHIT.  People come to this place and act like they have a mission and that mission is &quot;I'm going to save the world, let people know that someone is doing something wrong, give my two cents, and all my sputtering will teach them a lesson and thus fix the problem.&quot; Maybe I am the only one who believes that this stuff doesn't help a problem, yet it only makes it worse.  You all preech GUILD RELATIONS.  Yes,  we are going to work on guild relations and fix all this bullshit.  Then why is this stuff on the flames board? Why are leaders allowing their members(or officers which is even funnier) to rekindle a fire? <br>
   <br>
  It seems like just common sense that problems would be solved in game, by respected leaders and those involved in the rotation.  I am not saying that I believe SoT did or did not do something wrong,  I am just saying that spewing this @#%$ all over the place is nonsense.  I believe that's why guilds have leaders...I know myself as a guild leader would be insulted if one of my players came on here and started flaming another guild.  It is MY sole responsibility to deal with guild relations and the flame board is not the spot.  <br>
  <br>
  To add to this, what is the point of bringing this to a public board if not to cause more @#%$ to be spewed towards one guild.  And if anyone is being laughed at, it's you guys who take the time out of your day to come on here to whine and cry about a game.  It's hilarious ..no matter what they do at one point in time, they get their names brought up here.  They killed yelinek and you guys came on here to cried gimp kill blah blah blah.  <br>
<br>
So..if you guys are interested in solving problems, i would say you take your problems to the guild leaders.  Else, you keep throwing @#%$ on here and make RTA the jerry springer of EQ.  The show that's funny for the first 10 minutes and then gets sickening .<br>

The answer is:<br>
/em drumroll.<br>
<br>
To keep the Rathe as a comunity informed.  I don't particularly like Sssorn's posting style as it does come across as bashing and not being constructive but he is right.  It is good the Rathe is kept &quot;informed&quot; and it is a form of &quot;policing&quot; so to speak.  <br>

Is it like being a teenager and using the cool in words?<br>
<br>
Then you have the reverse...people who try to toss in big words to seem smart..even tho their content is rather lame..sorta like wanting to be more nerdy lol.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now as far as a flame section goes..yes it can be a * punishment* tool.  Often times it doesnt help at all.  I think its a good tool to get information out.  <br>
<br>
Realistically tho any guild leader that wanted to actually make progress would show restraint and not resort to name calling here  ( knowing full well his guild members prolly would fill pages here doing just that ) and contact his counter parts in game and discuss things.<br>
<br>
For a guild leader to come here and call other guilds names  whether based on tactics or their perception of that guild , is clearly counter productive.<br>
<br>
Personally Im adult enuf to see behavior on both sides of an issue that I dont agree with.  I dont feel compelled to say I agree with 100% of a guildees actions , simply becuase Im guilded with him.<br>
<br>
I think both sides need to grow up a bit and make the decision to work together even if it means sacrificing something a time or two.<br>
<br>
Sssorn since you seem to think your all knowing..I expect this to fall on deaf ears , but you never know....If you really want to make a difference or make progress , try posting without the petty insults laced into your post and the air of superiority.  Im sure you would get better results , unless your intent is to actually bait people into flaming and avoiding the issue by responding out of anger to you.  You seem to be a BB veteran and prolly know this but figured I'd take a shot anyway.<br>
<br>
Oh yah I'd also like to say that im heavily medicated this week and thats prolly why I agreed with Falc...sorry   :P <p><p><BR><center>

<br>
  I agree, it's also a sign of greed.  Hogging all the &quot;uber&quot; mobs to get as much loot as possible, without giving any regard to the time limitation that was specified.  It's like putting too much on your plate and trying to eat it all.  And now, because of that, the community has a stomach ache. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  Another thing.  When asked if your guild is going to take their turn on a rotation mob, a Guild Leader should definitely answer to the best of his or her ability.  By not answering, guilds like BotS in this case are left twiddling their thumbs waiting patiently on the edge of their seats ready to piss their pants in excitement while they wait on you hand-and-foot in hopes you'll give them a straight answer on what mob you're killing (and when you are going to in fact kill it)!  Just to reiterate, not answering is lame and just plain rude.  People don't play this game to sit around deciding what mobs you want to kill.  Contrary to any other belief's, the world does not revolve around you and the rest of the Rathe doesn't cater to your needs.<br>
<br>
  SoT did something wrong and are now being slapped on the wrists for it.  Merloc posted an honest issue he had with the breaking of a rotation.  He did not slander SoT, but instead proposed how to penalize them and even called for outside opinions.  What was he met with?  Whiners, flamers, sarcasm, and attitude.  Instead of getting all up in arms about the situation, SoT should realize that they need to be penalized for breaking the 24 hour time allotment.  If it goes neglected and falls by the wayside, then other guilds will might assume: &quot;Oh we can push this mob past 24hrs, I remember when SoT did it on KT and they got away with it..&quot;<br>
<br>
  Ignoring the breaking of the 24hr time allotment does not make the issue go away and sets a bad example for the rest of the guilds on the rotation, those soon to be on the rotation, and those that one day WILL be on the rotation.  <br>
<br>
  Solutions are found by confronting the problem and that is exactly what Merloc did.  Put down your wooden spoon's, back away slowly, and I promise you everything will be okay.<br>
