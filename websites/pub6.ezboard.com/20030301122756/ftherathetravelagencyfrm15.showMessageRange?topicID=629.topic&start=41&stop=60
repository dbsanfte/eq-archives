WRONG!!!<br>
<br>
There are certain things in this world that are simply wrong. Simply EVIL. simply DEBOCHEROUS. Among these things are willful unprovoked harm to others (in this case, not only the gang rape of an uninvolved CHILD, but the society's open acceptance of it...ORDER of it).<br>
<br>
To defend this type of action in ANY way is so unbelievably dumbfounding, that any logic used to refute the defence is inconsequential. ANYONE who says that this should be tolerated until we can understand and change it is in every way morrally defunct.<br>
<br>
My DOG knows he did something wrong when he jumps on the counter and steals a turkey, you cant tell me that ANY amount of culture (or lack thereof) can make a human being think that behavior of this sort is even THINKABLE, much less acceptable...encouragable?<br>
<br>
These people KNOW this type of behavior is wrong. It is inherent in human nature to be empathetic. The reaction to ones empathy can be driven out through desensitization, but the core knowledge of basic right and wrong exists in all sane people.<br>
<br>
This leads to one of 3 conclusions. First, these rapists are not human. Second, these people are not sane. Third, These people CHOOSE to do what they KNOW is wrong.<br>
<br>
You decide, but these facts are irrefutable.<br>

<br>
WRONG AGAIN!!!<br>
<br>
ANY culture that tolerates, accepts, and most of all encourages this type of act has demonized themselves. I am not talking about the whole of Pakistan mind you, but the community (and others like it) that let this occur.<br>
<br>
Remember Nazi Germany, they were following laws and orders that they had been taught as well. Doesn't mean the Nazi's weren't evil in their actions.<br>
<br>
You ask us to try to think of productive means of solving this problem by looking at its source. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The ONLY cultures in my history books that were EVER &quot;enlightened&quot; by outside cultures were ones that were militarily taken over and forced to change.<br>
<br>
I don't want to take over these Pakistani tribes, or change them. If a culture condones activities of this nature, I want them wiped out. Closed minded? @#%$ RIGHT I am. There are no 2 sides to this.<br>
<br>
I don't initiate evil acts, I try to prevent them and when I fail, I must react to them. This behavior is not worthy of rehabilitation. It is worthy of execution.<br>

<br>
It does Dalilah - sorry! <br>
Every day we kill endangered animals in the rain forests and the oceans to provide humans with goods. Your culture (which ever country that is) will go to war if threatened and kill people.<br>
<br>
And consider this: If someone came and wanted to kill your WHOLE family and we gave you a gun and said go for it, you can kill him...in fact we shall give you a medal for it...you wouldn't do it?<br>
Don't say it's not in your nature - it is - just like every other human you will protect the ones you love.<br>
<br>
And regarding your &quot;whatever&quot; - I don't know where you are from but I think punishing your kids by hitting them or shaking them/grapping them hard/yanking them is allowed in most of the world...something you can't do to grownups without being arrested. <br>
Using this form of &quot;parental means&quot; was banned only a few years ago in Denmark and not many other countries has followed.<br>
<br>
And in some states in USA they still have death sentence...even if you don't live in the states this IS your culture (civilisation you know).<br>
<br>
We have wars, famin, rape, crusades, abuse, incarceration, unnecessary education, extinction of species, polluting the seas and the skies in this world and just because YOU don't pull the trigger, you are still a part of it and you don't spend your entire life fighting it. So it's in your nature allright...<br>
<br>
And yes they DO know what is right and wrong, we all do, but somehow we are taught differently and the man who beats his wife also knows he is doing the wrong thing but he does not know how to change his ways cause he was not given an alternative. To live in his part of the world he must do as the culture &quot;says&quot;.<br>
So turning your back on them and judging them is just going to make them even more fatalistic - it will not show them any alternatives.<br>
Someone made a post about the muslim countries banning TV and withholding people from education and this is what it is all about - enlightenment.<br>
<br>
I do understand that you are repulsed by the thought of rape but are you gonna do something about it other than write on a board in cyberspace? Not judging you - just asking...<br>
<br>
I am not polishing my own crown here - I use the goods we produce and play EQ instead of doing anything about the horrors of the world. I have tried though...but that's a different story hehe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukluztzul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KluzTZul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/5/02 6:03:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=629.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Unbelievable!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My DOG knows he did something wrong when he jumps on the counter and steals a turkey<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
He actually did this too.<br>
<br>
Actually, im a little disgusted at a lot of you coming here flaming Abaz. You call him closeminded, and anti-religion. Saying that simply because his opinion is different than yours, he calls you &quot;wrong.&quot; <br>
<br>
Honestly, it seems to me thats what YOU are doing to him. Simply because his post didnt consist of &quot;BURN THEM ALIVE!&quot; Somehow, hes the enemy. His post is well thought, and actually pretty intelligent, and he never said that he is condoning or excusing what happened. Only that culture leads these peopl to do what they did. (and from reading the article, it seems to me that their culture will also be taking action against the people who did this.)<br>
<br>
Where do I stand? Rape is wrong. In fact, any punishment for what the 13 year old kid did is pretty ridiculous in iteself. I jsut want to make that clear. Now...let me say this.<br>
<br>
You cant take a Western solution to an Eastern problem. It wont work. Along with that, we're westerners judging an eastern problem. I beleive that was Abaz's point. And trust me, I've been on the receiving end of an ongoing flame before. When your in that position, its very easy to mix up your words and be misunderstood, trying to defend yourself, and yet make a point at the same time.<br>
<br>
Im also kindof wondering why this situation is &quot;newsy&quot; enough to make the RTA, but the rape that occurs in our country isnt. Rape happens here too. In fact...the very same thing happens in our country. Granted, it happens in the underworld of America and not within the System of Law, but yes, there are definatly leader types that order the rape of their enemies female kin. Personally, I credit that to our (as a country) obsession with the &quot;do-goodings&quot; of other countrys faults.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to restate a comment made by Abaz:<br>
<br>
&quot;Replace &quot;Gang rape&quot; with &quot;murder&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I may be wrong, but I think he was talking about the death sentence, which the US still has. I know Hutterr disagrees with me on this (laughs), and he always will, But personally, I just think dying in prison is better poetic justice for a murderer...<br>
<br>
...and I think getting raped in prison is much better poetic justice for a rapist.<br>

Well, this is true if you go about it in a political manner and try to get them to change their ways. Im not interested in that as I stated before. Im interested in the removal of the evil that allows these acts. As I said before, I only know of 1 way that can be accomplished. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

<br>
&quot; If my culture allowed me to rape, murder, whatever, I wouldn't do it. It is not in my nature. Are we to believe that these people have no means of knowing what is right and wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
Think about this.  As I've been told by my German teacher a few years ago, most Europeans do not have a top slice of bread on sandwiches, and use a fork and a knife.  I, an American, think that is weird because I use two slices and use my hands.  But to them, we seems barbaric using our hands to eat or food rather then utensils.  Now the question is, who is right?<br>
<br>
If you are grown up around a basic principle you will adapt to that principle and use it to determine and judge an issue, no matter what it is.  To say its not your nature is, well, wrong.  Why?  Well, human nature is not quite all that different from normal animals you see at the zoo, we all have the same basic instincts.  We care for our pack, as in family, community, society.  We learn off the elders, and adapt from their teachings, as in we learn by what they say.  We also have a viscous instinct, and if you are grown up around that environment where that instinct can be plucked at and exploited, well expect that you will become animalistic.<br>
<br>
Also.  Saying its not your nature to do as the others around you would do, so you would not do it?  So lets just say, you live in a socially advanced country but its not your nature to wear pants, but it is to wear spaghetti on your head, run around screaming &quot;I like cheese&quot;, and think its natural to not take showers.  Yes, you could carry on that lifestyle and not take part in what others are doing, but, in that society you are mentioning which i will bring back up, rape, murder, whatever, you know what they will do?  You are not one of them, so they are going to do all three of those things to you, because you are a minority of their society.  So chances are, you're dead.  Sorry whosever this quote is, it just caught my eye, I'm not flamming you, just the quote.<br>
<br>
These people would be just like us, but their society is different then ours.  Instead of condeming them to hell, how about figuring out a way to change it.  You may think, I'm just an EQer, what the hell should i care or what the hell am i suppose to do?  Well also remember, Einstein was just some Austrian scientist looking  for a home. <p><CENTER>

How can you compare someone defending their family to murder?  You going to tell me it takes the same kind of person to kill an attacker that it does to murder an innocent person?<br>
<br>
And I don't think it is ever right to beat a child.  But some force is nesessary to protect them from themselves.  The unfortunate thing is that some parents don't know the difference.<br>
<br>
As I stated before, I can and will judge other people by my own standards of decency.  I am NOT speaking for my culture or against another culture. <br>

you said…<br>

“ His post is well thought, and actually pretty intelligent, “<br>
<br>
but this is how Azab starts his post…..<br>
<br>
“Take a look at your own sects' histories rather than forgetting them with that bible shoved so far up your a$$”<br>
<br>
that is well thought out and intelligent?”.<br>
<br>
Aba then goes on to say….<br>
<br>
“and anyone that states, &quot;Just another example of why we need another 40 days &amp; nights Flood,&quot; implying they believe in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement. “<br>
<br>
 is this well thought out too?<br>
<br>
 I think this statement sums Aba up nicely as a bigoted hateful HYPOCRITE , that thinks its fine and dandy to label every Bible believing Christian , Torah believing Jew, and Koran Believing Muslim…. As a religious moron <br>
<br>
I havent really addressed his issues I’m pointing out BY HIS OWN WORDS that he is a bigoted secular humanist that HATES  Christians , Jews., And Muslims for their beliefs!!!!!  yet stands in his ivory tower of academia and looks down on us and deems it his place to tell us how moronic and close minded WE are when in fact HE is the cowardly hateful  arrogant dogmatic scumbag he likes to tell other people THEY are!<br>
<br>
And since he feels its OK to bash people for their beliefs I shall bash him for his beliefs <br>

<br>

<br>
* These specific acts in the Middle East are reprehensible.<br>
<br>
* The 'comparable' acts in 'our own backyard' are just as reprehensible.  Were these acts the topic of this thread, they would be dencounced just as passionately (and have been in the past).<br>

The fact it was done in the name of &quot;family honor&quot; and that it was ordered by elders of a tribe doesn't make it any more or less wrong. I would be equally outraged if this happened three miles from my home, or 3,000. From all the accounts I have read &quot;the affair&quot; that her brother and the girl from the other tribe consisted of them walking together unchaperoned, and the outrage coming from the fact that he was a lower caste (poorer). <br>
<br>
I see a group of people jumping up and down with pitchforks and torches ready to start a lynching party (/em grabs an oil soaked rag and stick). Others, while not defending the act itself, are asking to look at why it happened and want to effectively change the root cause, but giving no means of which to punish those who commited the act.<br>
<br>
Cause: Idiotic caste system and disregard for others well being<br>
<br>
How do you deal with an incident like this? My feelings, no matter what caused the incident are Kill the dirty fuckers. Killing the perpetrators and the elders will effect change by 1) showing such behavior is EXTREMELY unacceptable 2) Putting new people in charge of the tribe that hopefully learned #1<br>

Yes, back then, their understanding was that the witches threatened their lives, therefore it was self-defense, therefore NOT murder.<br>
<br>
Now, we understand the witches (if they were indeed witches) were not a threat, therefore it was murder.<br>
<br>
In 50 years, when the aliens come and tell us the witches were actually a criminal faction of aliens bent on the destruction of earth, and that burning them was indeed the correct action, for fire is the only thing that could have destroyed them, then it will again be self-defense, and therefore NOT murder.<br>
<br>
'Morality' did not change, our understanding of the circumstances are what changed.  We act in a way we believe to be moral at the time, based on the information we have.  It is the best we can do.<br>

<br>
Why would someone jump to the conclusing that someone else thinks children are 'evil' when they state the obvious fact that children need to be protected from themselves?  Children lack the experience, perspective, and intellect to discern all the danger that is around them.  Often it is necessary to 'forcefully' remove them from danger before trying to 'reason' with them about WHY they were in danger.<br>
