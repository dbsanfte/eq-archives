and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> I understand perfectly that rules for rotations are made to help not only current rotation guilds but future ones as well.  I also understand that two wrongs don't make a right...if anything some of us are just frustrated because no one ever brought this particular rule to our attention until we were just about ready to try again (Granted, there needs to be responsibility on boths sides to find out or inform how rotations work, which we didn't do for AoW...instead relying on standard rotation rules and what LoM did thinking it must be ok).<br>
<br>
That's a good point concerning a non-rot guild getting more chances at a mob than a rot guild.  Really, that does not seem fair, but...<br>
<br>
As I pointed out before, I don't think it's fair to use a rule that will eventually be harder on other guilds down the line.  When just BotS, TL, and NB were on the AoW rotation, then a guild trying to get on the rotation would only have to wait 3 spawns to get their shot.  The next guild would have to wait 4.  Now an arguement can be made that getting there first gives them that luxury of not having to wait as long, but when dealing with multiple guilds all getting on rotation around the same time, that issue shouldn't hold up as much (Just look at the additions to the NToV rotation lately...any one of those guilds could have cleared the following week or the previous week...was just chance that the guilds entered in the order they did).<br>
<br>
Even if guild A having to wait 4 spawns, then guild B having to wait 5 spawns, then guild C having to wait 6 is a fair rule...I do NOT think guild J (obviously way down the line) having to wait 13 spawns in between attempts is fair.  Controlling the amount of attempts by how many guilds are on a rotation is not going to be fair to guilds in the future since the rotations will generally always get bigger.  That's the exact reason waiting for Statue turn doesn't work now.  Maybe the fair way NOW would be to use Karadin's point of only trying AoW once per rotation cycle, but that rule will eventually become unfair the way the old rule has become.<br>
<br>
Like I said, the point of non-rot guilds getting more attempts than rot guilds IS an important issue, but setting rules that we KNOW will eventually become unfair will cause problems.  Who's to say how many guilds will need to be on the AoW rot before this idea becomes unfair?  You can bet the first guild this rule actually hurts will be upset because of it.  I really think the most fair rule is one that will not change.  Whether it is 1 spawn between kills or 10 needs to be decided.  Whatever rule is decided, I think it's best to make it so similar problems won't happen in the future. (I think one way of doing this would be to set a &quot;penalty&quot; of sorts for if a guild failed two or maybe three times in a row...then that guild has to wait a month, two months, etc until they can try again...this might make a guild think twice to try everytime the rule allows them to if they just aren't ready yet) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thundaxstormkeeper>Thundax Stormkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/20/02 7:09:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> Why should rules that have existed for ages be changed now so that guilds currently trying AoW should have a better chance at getting on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Surely the pioneering the earlier guilds did should be to their advantage and not used as an example to give the guilds following them new and easier rules to join them on that rotation.<br>
<br>
For a guild currently on a rotation, I don't think many people really care if another guild joins that rotation. Everyone is used to the fact that as time goes on, more and more guilds will be killing each mob, What people don't want to be seeing is mobs going to waste. This is most noticable on AoW because after someone fails, it is 5 days before anyone can try again. Let's look at the current situation where both VoF and FK are looking at trying AoW and joining the rotation. If these guilds rushed to the mob each time Statue was being killed, no one else would see AoW again until both those guilds were on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Part of the advantage of being on a rotation is it is a guaranteed shot. You don't have to camp the mob so you can engage as soon as it spawns. You have the ability to check when it is up and then go and kill it. For this reasonl there is often plenty of hours of a mob being up before the guild on rotation for it will go there and attempt it. For this reason, there will always be time windows for mobs to be attempted by new guilds. If these guilds tried these mobs all night, and then came back the next night to try again it would be unfair as they are barring the rotation guilds from shots at their mobs.<br>
<br>
Rules are made to protect guilds currently on a rotation and also those who will be on that rotation in the future. If everyone abides by them, things run smoothly. Otherwise, problems arise and everyone will end up unhappy.<br>

<br>
Because times change. The Statue rotation then was 3 guilds. Now it is 10 and will be growing again. A several week wait between attempts will not be palatable to any guild wanting on this rotation.<br>

<br>
You're being a tad alarmist, first of all assuming the guilds will just be slavering over the idol spawn, ignoring all over considerations like, oh, OTHER ROTATIONS, guild attendance that night, etc.  FK won't be taking a shot unless we are sure we can win without interference.<br>
<br>
And the flipside of that, I doubt very much that either guild will need more then 1 more shot each to enter the rotation.<br>

In short, there's no need to be obstructionary, and good reasons not to be.<br>

The guild on rotation enjoy the protection from other guilds who are capable of killing the mob, so that way no one is shafted.  The guilds that are trying to get onto the rotation often have to &quot;race&quot; to get their shot.  Not only that, but the guilds who are on rotation enjoy the benefits of the kill (loot, prestige, etc.).  The guilds trying to get onto the rotation do not get any of that until they succeed.<br>
<br>
Having a guild have to wait a full cycle is unfair to the guilds who are trying to get on and will be slowing them down.  The guild trying to get onto a rotation is spending guild resources and people's playing time.  Both of which can be used for something else (another rotation, exp, whatever).  That is enough of the price to pay for an attempt.  <br>
<br>
Also, something very important to keep in mind.  Currently the rotation is 4 guilds, what happens when more and more get onto the rotation?  I propose that instead of having to change the rules down the line, you make one rule now that will hold no matter now many guilds are on the rotation.  Guilds trying to get onto rotation can try every other spawn, or have to wait 2 spawns between tries.  Either one will hold over time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1323<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/20/02 1:05:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> The Etiquette has been amended to add:<br>

<br>
You can't call AoW a race.  Until the Statue guild takes down Statue, no one can do AoW.  It's fairly rude to have your guild waiting in the wings causing the Statue guild lag, not to mention a waste of the AoW guild's time (in reference to your point about wasting time &quot;racing&quot; to AoW).  At no time should a guild not on rotation see, and waste, more AoW's than a guild who is on rotation.  Every person that attempts and fails is depriving another guilld (and the server) of AoW loot.  Every guild that tries and fails on AoW removes one more AoW that would put us closer to leaving the rotation, thus slowing us down.  It's about give and take.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your Statue turn, I have sympathy and can see a reason for change.  However, watching FK, VoF, and any other guild down the line, get 2-3 shots to each of NB's shots hardly seems like a rotation to me.  Rotations are about sharing content between those who can kill, not those who are trying to.  While I understand your desire to progress, and your confidence in your guild's ability to kill AoW with &quot;one more shot&quot;, it isn't proven and can't be taken as fact.  The current AoW rotation guilds can point to a dead AoW (or more) and show why they shouldn't have to watch AoWs wasted excessively (every or every other AoW).  I see nothing wrong with you taking a shot, but then let all other guilds on the AoW rotation take their fair shot, which they earned.  They shouldn't have to be continually pushed off while you work out the kinks. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

Kara, I have known you for a while now, and its not like you to leave yourself wide open like that for an easy shot.<br>
<br>
My vote and reasoning is posted under the other thread.  I think its a reasonable compromise to let a guild that is trying to get on rotation try after 2 guilds on rotation go, vs doing it back to back, and your idea of once per rotation.<br>

He's an 8 hour spawn, so no reason to grab the one right in front of the Statue guild.  Had he been dead when we showed up, no big deal, but you guys were forming mere moments before us and knew it was our rotation shot.  And if us being in right arena caused you guys to wipe to Vindi, well I will apologize, because that wasn't our intent.  But I would also recommend not letting Eros try and grab Vindicator moments before the guild that is up for Statue is forming up.  The old navy protocol for port right of way comes to mind, with a five day rotation being a bit more critical than an 8 hour mob.<br>
<br>
As for compromise, the compromise of once per AoW cycle is already a change from once per Statue rotation.  Give someone an inch, they want a mile?  It's still unfair for FK or VOF to get two shots to every one shot NB gets at AoW.  We have killed him, and thus have a stronger claim. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>
