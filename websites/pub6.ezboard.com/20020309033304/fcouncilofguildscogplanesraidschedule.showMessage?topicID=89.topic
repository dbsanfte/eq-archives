<br>
1) We had a bunch of late comers, some I addded some I didn't. For the most part people were on time. Need to make sure this is kept up. <br>
2) WE NEED MORE CLERICS! If you are a cleric, you are needed on this raid. I'll take clerics from guilds who wouldn't normally be allowed on these raids (i.e. from big guilds) I'll take any clerics. We tried break-in last night with ONE Cleric, and luckily on his third run in, he made it and camped out. We should not have had to ask this of him. Thanks to Tsal and Kyros for stepping in and helping us out with this at the last minute. If you are a cleric or an enchanter, you will be put high on the list of people needed for these raids, simply because we don't have enough as it is. If you have clerics in your guild who don't come to Fear raids, find out why. If it's because their planar armour doesn't drop there, let me know. Simply put, clerics and enchanters are VITAL to the success of any Fear raid. If the choice comes between taking a cleric vs. another class, I will take the cleric if we need more clerics. I don't say this because I think others can't contribute, I say this because clerics are vital to the success of the raid, and without them, it becomes MUCH tougher. <br>
3) Supplies such as essence emeralds, reagents, SOW potions, etc. The Sacred Band's raids will probably start to require that 10-20pp in coin are taken up as a collection for all the things that are needed on this raid. Such as our clerics, enchanters, wizards, shamans, paladins and anyone else who uses expensive reagents for buffs. We will split this money among ALL of these classes who use reagents, and it will be collected at the beginning of the raid. I see no reason that an enchanter should shell out 250pp for constant runes on tanks if the tanks won't contribute to helping. Things like Rune, symbols, SOW potions for pullers and feign death folks, etc. are as vital to the success as clerics with res capabilities. One essence emerald last night could have cut our break-in time in half. At 20pp per person on a 40 person raid, that's 800pp.... it won't cover all the reagent cost, but will show our enchanters, clerics, etc. that we care about the sacrifice they are making. This won't just go to these classes that are Sacred Band members, but to ALL of these classes that participate in the raid. <br>
4) Organization will be better next time. As my first attempt at organizing a planes raid, I think I did ok, but know a LOT better know what to do and what not to do. <br>
5) Thanks to everyone who came out, and to those folks who sat patient and naked while we did corpse recovery. Special thanks go out to Zellex, Aere, Volenix and Cheriour for being the great Feign deathers they are, and for overseeing the camp, corpse recovery, etc. that helped us break in here. <br>
6) Discipline needs to be maintained. That means not breaking mezzes, NOT training the camp, even when no one is there yet, and being ready quickly to zone in. You have about a 30 second or less window from the moment the monk tells the commander to zone in the next group til the time you can't zone in again. Be ready, get in the zone quick and make sure you make it to the firewall (if doing a north camp). <br>
<br>
A good start, and the more we do these, the better they will get! Let's hear some comments, folks!<br>

<br>
1. I had a good time. I learned alot.<br>
<br>
2. Thanks to everyone that helped organize and lead this event. Haemish, Belce, Cassia, Zellex, Aere, Volenix and Cheriour and others I think did a great job.<br>
<br>
3. I was disappointed at the poor attitudes some people had, the nasty comments some made during the raid, the lack of respect some showed for others, the greed some displayed, and the lack of cooperation and respect some ppl showed to the leadership. <br>
<br>
4. I agree fee should be charged for these raids to cover expenses.<br>
<br>
5. I think we should plan fear and hate raids so that if you go on one you are expected to go on the other. Anyone that went to fear last night should be committed to a hate raid before they go on another fear raid. If you cant make the next hate raid its not a problem, just wait out the next fear raid til you can go to hate again. <br>

<br>
Hate seemed so much smoother....but I think there might have been a bug on /assist in Fear towards end of night from what I was hearing people say. I look forward to doing both raids again to see the difference in operation..but for sure I wish to thank all involved!<br>
<br>
Compared to the Hate raid...I don't think people waited to attack the mobs until the lead tank had declared a target in Fear...this was VERY noticable. Hate ran soo great cause no one touched the mezzed mobs and everyone targeted the correct one at the right time...wow what a difference.<br>
<br>
I hope to see this on the next Fear run. Once again, though, this was my first fear raid so things may just work a lot different there then Hate....I still had a lot of fun...and WOW does that firewall lag!!!  hehe<br>

Thanks for the adventure<br>

But I have heard that there were times when assist was not used right, though it sounds like there was zone trouble. <br>

When taking into consideration the dozen of scarlings roaming the portal, the fact we had only one cleric to begin with, and that this was a first experience for some of those involved; We did an excellent job doing something that is very close to being considered impossible and not worth risking.  I was amazed.  The only complaining that was going on was because people were trying to organize and make things go smoother.  It takes time for people to learn their roles and time along with organization is something that can work against you on a fear raid.  I had a great time and I look forward to working with yall wonderfull people on more successful raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=augie>Augie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/30/01 3:14:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monday 1/29 Fear Recap</span><hr size=1> All in all I had a good time.  4 things I would like to bring up, though.  The first was the choice of camp.  The only reason I bring this up is NOT because I thought it was a bad way to break into fear, but because breaking in that way requires much more time to do than west camp type break in.  This was monday, meaning a weekday, and people do have work and school the next day.  The way we broke in last night was fine for the weekend, but not for a weekday night, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Second thing was main assist.  The main assist needs to be someone that is alert at all times and has a good ISP connection.  I saw, on numerous occasions, single mobs penetrating the camp and a full 15 to 20 seconds going by before the main assist had it aquired and started attacking it.  The rest of us, by adhering to the rules, could do nothing but stab at our assist keys in vain.  Every tank was around the mob watching it pound the crap out of the casters, who were dropping like flies.  This is NOT acceptable.  Same thing was happening with multiple mobs.  If the main assist doesn't attack something, the enchanter doesn't know which of the other mobs to mezz, therefore letting them ALL run around smacking people.  The number of caster deaths as opposed to the number of tank deaths was ridiculous.  You can be the best main assist in the world but if you're having lag/ISP problems, it negates all that skill and you need to step aside and let someone else do the job.  Also, main assist does not need to be a warrior.  I have seen monks, SKs, rangers, and paladins be excellent main assists in both planes.  All you need is good armor class and a good cleric healing you.<br>
<br>
Third thing is pets.  I saw the pets attacking mobs by themselves while the rest of us were on another one.  Don't like this.  Don't like it at all.<br>
<br>
Fourth thing is DoTs.  People WERE dotting.  There had been an issue of mobs poofing if the person dotting wasn't making the hate list. I don't know if the issue has been resolved or corrected but I'd like to be on the safe side and have no DoTs in the planes.  Before we started pulling the raid leader specifically said that DoTs were not to be used and there is no question that some people disregarded that.<br>
<br>
Aside from those four things, I had a good time.  It was truly hilarious watching the planes newbies roll for Nightmare hide cloaks and Wraithstones.  I guess everyone wants a memento from their first time in Fear.  Congrats to all who got something to remember this night by.  GMs didn't need to be called in, and I've seen things get much more crazy in Fear than anything that happened last night. For a first planned raid here, I would call it a success.  Drops sucked,  But that's the way it goes sometimes.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/30/01 3:25:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monday 1/29 Fear Recap</span><hr size=1> I think adding a no pets policy might be in order, as this is another thing I've seen a lot of talk about. We definitely need to make sure we don't have pets running around breaking mez and aggroing things. <br>
<br>
Not sure about the DoT's thing, as they might negate some of the SK and Necro strengths. <br>
<br>
Main assist does need a strong ISP connection, relatively lag free, etc. However, I will say that I've lately noticed in a lot of zones that assist just isn't working right. <br>

Haemish, I think you and Sacred Band did a great job.  These aren't easy to organize and keep everyone in tow.  The next one will be better and then the one after that and the one after that.  It was a good learning experience for everyone.  <br>
<br>
One thing I've noticed with CoG events is that communication has always been very, very good.   A lot of information is given in shouts and ooc so we know what's going on.  If someone doesn't know...then they aren't paying attention and possibly goofing around.  However, this IS a game so I think everyone is entitled to a little goofing around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Augie Hit most of the issue's on the nose. But one thing he left out was the group formation. After the final break-in, it took way to long to re-organize and re-group. This went on though out the night as people leave, Zellex had to keep reminding and suggesting on groupings.  Somebody should be on top of this right away, if someone leaves or a group is not balanced, it should not take a whole 1hr to re-arrange everything.  A master list of the core leaders and group leaders should be readily available at all times and not be made on the spot.<br>
<br>
Towards the end, people were getting restless, frustrated and sloppy.  This could be attributed to other factors such as the Assist problems, unbalanced groups, Pets breaking mez and MANY deaths each round of battle.<br>
<br>
I know that for most of us, this was a first for a Fear raid. So the Key to this raids Success is the Improvements we make on the next one.<br>

<br>
The last 2 (maybe 3 can't remember) raids we tried West Camp breaks and it ended in disaster 4-6 hour CR inwhich ended up only to be saved by two other guilds. (Valoran and Eternal Wrath) This break was a lot quicker and less frustrating than the other ones. I would recommend doing a north camp break this way again anytime. If we had more clerics we probably would have gotten one camped the first try in and been ready to go right away. <br>
<br>
Or another option which Zellex and I talked about was that we camp a cleric in Fear the night before the raid. Then all we have to do is make sure that everyone makes it to the Firewall before they die. We could use this strategy for Hate also.<br>
<br>
All in all I had a blast though. Better loot would have been nice. And ya I did get a kick out of lottoing off Nightmare Hides. The warts didn't surprise me though every time I go those are lottoed off. :P<br>

<br>
I'm curious why multiple pets were on multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
Pets autoprotect their masters which to me suggests that at some point the caster was attacked.<br>
<br>
If that was the case - is there a way to have the pet classes take themselves out of harm's way and wait say a full 15 seconds before they send their pets into battle?  I mean literally putting them off to the side as the 'cavalry' and send them charging in once the primary target has been selected and mobs properly charmed or mezzed.<br>
<br>
It might be a little nerve wracking standing there watching your groups get pounded on but I honestly feel like there IS a way to make it work.<br>
<br>
In a perfect world it would probably work that way, but when you introduce 'switches' into the equation - when pets are involved there's just no way to call them off.  If the main tank calls SWITCH - and the pets have engaged mob 1,  expect a 2 fight battle but just let the pets continue doing what they're doing while you take out the priority threat.<br>
<br>
I'm curious though - precisely when did the pets start attacking multiple mobs?  Under what conditions did this occur?  <br>
<br>
I wasn't there so I can't intelligently comment on what happened, but I HAVE fought with various pet classes in multiple groups and I've seen it work - the main distinction was that the pet was sent in long after the battle had begun.  But when it worked, the necro and the mage I was playing with took a full 10-15 seconds to wait to send their pets in plus they took every precaution NOT to get hit even if it meant separating themselves from the group by a sizable distance.<br>
<br>
I know there's a way around this and pets are WAY TOO powerful to be negated from combat - and it very well may end up being that they're more trouble then they're worth but I honestly feel there's a way to make it work.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw - there IS a bug with /assist that stems from assisting TOO soon.<br>
<br>
Here's the situation:<br>
<br>
1)  Puller leaves to grab a mob and is outside of visible range<br>
2)  Puller calls a target and heads back to the camp<br>
3)  Main assist hits '/assist Puller' a moment later but puller is still out of visible range<br>
4)  Puller gets back to camp and Main Assist is now bugged and CANNOT hit the mob<br>
5)  Raiding party hits their '/assist Main assist' - but Main assist is bugged so no one can hit anything.<br>
6)  Casters die while tanks watch (grim)<br>
<br>
NB** There's also an issue that if that the Main assist doesn't hit their attack key - the raiding party has nothing to assist on.  So in essence - you can be targeting a mob but not attacking.  I'm not sure if this is still the case but I'll test it out first chance I get.  <br>
<br>
I was in a guild xp group in Dreadlands a long time ago and this VERY thing happened.  My group was targeting everything BUT the mob that I was on because I was acquiring targets from thousands of map points away and they were hitting their assist keys the moment I called a target.<br>
<br>
So the fix?<br>
<br>
1)  Main assist MUST hit their assist key ONLY when the puller is in view or if you want to be sure - when you've confirmed that the puller has started attacking the mob.<br>
<br>
2)  My usual key press line up is <br>
- Hit escape to clear targeting in the event that I have myself or a buffer targeted<br>
- Hit F8 to target the closest mob (or /assist if I'm not main tank) <br>
- Hit my attack key<br>
- Hit my /shout Target on - %T - hotkey<br>
If I'm lucky and I'm on the ball - it takes all of 2-3 seconds to acquire a target and shout it out.<br>
<br>
3)  Don't think you can hit your assist key - wait for the puller to return then expect your toon to start fighting the mob once it enters camp - most likely you'll be bugged and will have to ESCAPE/ASSIST to retarget.<br>
<br>
<br>

Because of the huge aggro radius on most mobs, all the players in the camp have to stay in as tight a circle as possible. So it may not be possible to separate the pet classes from the others by enough distance to make a difference. <br>
<br>
But it's an interesting topic of discussion. I'd like to hear thoughts on it as well.<br>

<br>
1. On pets: The casters usually should stand on the other side from which the pulls are coming.  Also, casters will get attacked if they are medding on a pull.  When the puller announces an inc there is a sequence of things that must occur:<br>
<br>
a) All casters stop medding and stand up - the mobs WILL charge the medding casters before anyone else.<br>
b) The primary assist gets ready to tag a mob ASAP - he actually better do this before the mobs are at the camp.  Again this prevents casters getting whacked.<br>
c) Folks use their assist key and press A once they are 100 % sure that they see the primary tank attacking and they have the good target.<br>
d) At the same time the enchanter(s) should already have at least one mob mesmerized and working on others if more.  The shamans should help with roots and slows - rooting if the enchanter gets resisted. Enchanters should expect a sizeable amount of resists on mesmerizes before you reach level 53 or so - especially on Agmydalans and Worry Wraiths and make sure to pair up a cleric in their party who can cast Marzin-Heroism along with a secondary healer.<br>
<br>
2. On lack of clerics: Actually this is a side effect of the current way CoG structures it's raids.  Let's be honest: Doing a fear breakin as a cleric or enchanter or whatever class who don't have drops there provides nothing but helping. But why would someone help strangers if they can't have anything in exchange? I heard there was like 12 druids there, I wonder how many of those were on the POH raid?  And heck you could have given the blue diamond that dropped to the lone cleric who came instead of rolling among 30 folks.  And out of curiosity I wonder where your probably many clerics who were in POH sunday were gone monday? I see three solutions:<br>
<br>
a) Either you change the way the management crew works to include the classes that don't have drops there (say, have 2 clerics and 2 enchanters among management) but are required. But again who'd volunteer an evening and most probably precious exp helping folks who just come to gank some loot?  Not targeting everyone in there but obviously something is wrong.<br>
<br>
b) Require folks who gets drops in fear to go into a hate raid first and folks who go into hate to do fear first.  It's not a perfect solution either but if you keep the ones who joins on a free for all basis then yes you may have to end up doing that.<br>
<br>
c) Hope folks will understand and try to establish some kind of community spirit.  Haemish probably strives for that one, and I sincerely hope it will work out that way for you all.<br>
<br>
Time's running short, work to do - anyways the above should provide some matter to munch on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Take care and keep up the good work - Zellex you are a saint to organize these raids. Not sure I'd have the patience and human skills to go through all that.<br>

<br>
You help here for no return, eventually that &quot;selfless&quot; sense of helping will be returned by being able to get something for yourself.<br>
<br>
I know, I'll take off my rose-colored glasses now. <br>
<br>
My view of the CoG is that it is an organization of enlightened self-interest. I sponsor events for others on the server (like tournaments and dances and mixer hunts and large scale raids) that I may not profit from, in the hopes that OTHERS on the server will sponsor events that I will profit from (like tournaments and dances and mixer hunts and large scale raids). This works for the most part, though not as often as I'd like. <br>
<br>
So if a cleric goes to fear and gets nothing, perhaps another time he'll go to Hate and get something, being helped by the person who got something from Fear on the first raid. It's a circle of good feelings, of each person giving a little in the present to get something in the future and vice versa. I would hope that ALL those who come to the planes raids we run approach it with that spirit. <br>
<br>
I am not, however, blind enough that I think that that is what happens for many of the people who come to the CoG raids. <br>
<br>
For my part, I think we'll change up the raid policy a little in the future. First, we'll take up a collection of 30-100pp for each person on the plane raid, to be given to clerics and enchanters who come for recouping their cost of reagents. Second, for loot like diamonds, gems etc. ONLY those classes who can either: 1) Craft something from the item (like blue diamond jewelry or smithing with diamonds, etc.) or 2) Need the item in an epic quest; may roll on them. Would this make more clerics happy or would that change nothing? <br>

<br>
1. Pets are not a problem if the caster has a brain. Not only an attack key but a back off key and either always have invis up or use the quest boots that make you invis on a hotkey. And always always hit the back off key after every kill. DUH<br>
<br>
2. If I had to go back to fear and do another west break I would refuse. I hear this one was better, good, stick with it.<br>
<br>
3. As a class that does not get armor in the opposite plane, you either show up to the other plane once or you miss out the first lotto on a piece you need. Any class who is self centered enough to not go on both should not get the benefits.<br>
<br>
4. I agree that the main should not be laggy but it is a station of dignity and NO one has the right to badmouth him. If he felt he could do it then that was his or the raid leaders call.<br>
<br>
5. The best main assist I ever saw was a wiz too, now think about that one  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
6. back to pets, Mage yes, necro yes, anyone else NO. Ench too dumb (the pet, no worries I'm not bashing your intelect), shaman too low, druid way too low, sk too low.. we seeing a patern here?...<br>
<br>
7. Rudeness. I cant believe some of you would have the balls to make arses of yourselves in public again. GROW UP, the world does not revolve around you and if you have the brains to get yourself to planes lvl we would have hoped you'd have the brains to BE NICE. Always do this - Diffuse, not Provoke.<br>

and that is probably way too much for a short and sweet message but in my eyes it had to be said and those were the shortest words possible.<br>

And I got extremely lucky this sunday with the druid shield drop, so noone can say that one of the planes does not drop anything for their class... <br>
<br>
I think rather than forcing people or promising rewards for specific classes for showing up in a particular raid, lets hope we have friends and supporters who have the goodwill and time to spend time with us and like helping others and the server overall.  Don't forget, we had at least 2 warriors and 3 enchanters in fear (and Steelheart, the most friendliest rogue *hug), so either that means that clerics are a particularly selfish class (nooo, don't shoot me just yet), or timing was just bad.  All we need is to have a solid core of people from across all the classes who are not item obsessed, and we can make this work.<br>
<br>
To Lagdalan's 7... I fully agree... if you can't control your emotions or feel the need to yell or attack people verbally, I'd suggest you consider avoiding CoG and join in guild/alliance plane raids instead... items or raid efficiency is NOT our main priority for ANY CoG events, friendship, fun and a sense of community feeling is.  <br>
<br>
Sorry to say, but CoG really is only for the mature and polite ones, and if you think you can get away with being a jerk just so you can get an item, think again: You are spoiling the fun for 40+ other people in one shot.  Don't EVER expect that people will forget that.  From my own experience, I know I have not forgotten a single person that has treated me or someone else shabbily on EQ.<br>

Ok, I have waited to see how this thread was going to go, I have read all the posts and agree and disagree with some of the posts. There are lots of good info hear on what took place and how to correct the problems we encountered. I am not one to beat a dead horse. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
This is what I know to be true;<br>
1) We can breakin, with out haveing to call in a GM or uber guild to help. We proved that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
2) We can aquire the camp and pull to it and kill many mobs. We proved that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
3) From what I can tell from this thread we all want to learn how to do it better. So Lets Do It!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
My feeling on the pets.  Lagdalen, you're absolutely right, pets can be useful, and can be controlled.  However, for the most part, I would say that they are a detriment to the raiding party unless we are about to hit a big mob such as Maestro.<br>
<br>
I was being chased about by a glare lord I'd mezzed.  I did maybe three circuts around the camp trying to get him off me.  I couldn't because there was this necro pet bashing on him, not getting him off me, of course, just keeping me from Mezzing him.  And then I died.  I very clearly remember hearing a necro tell his pet to back off...unfortunately, it wasn't the one that was chasing me.  LOL<br>
<br>
As for your suggestions, Shoji, there good ones, but I doubt they'd work and here's why:  In Hate, the mobs all came from a predictable direction, so casters could get out of the way.  In Fear, as far as I could tell, they can from multiple directions on the same pull.  To make matters worse, many of them have area effect spells (dispell) and thereby aggro pets, regardless of the positioning of the caster.  <br>
<br>
I personally feel that the pets did not add enough to the combat to be worth the trouble they caused.  Again, I fully agree with Lagdalen that its possible to make it work, I just think that the risk/reward here just isn't worth it.  I feel pets should only be used for the boss mobs on the planes...at least until we all have a lot more experience under our belts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvaardlifeshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaard Lifeshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/31/01 11:40:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CoG Planes Raid Schedule</span><hr size=1> Sorry about going LD at beginning of raid... i got disconnected and it wouldn't let me sign on to EQ for 2 days after... everytime i tried to connect, it said host was not found. i could access some websites, but not others... seems i could access east coast sites, but not west coast ones.... not the first time it happened, but first time it lasted 2 days...
