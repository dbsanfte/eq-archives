People need to get creative with passwords..   too simple = easy hack<br>
<br>
say it and chant it with me.<br>
<br>
NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE, and never use common phrases or words you use in conversations.  Do not use common words(also commonly used passwords) No swear words, LOVE, GOD, ROOT, all this dumb stuff.   do not use dictionary words.  Mix letters and numbers uppercase and lower case.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope you get some closure on the lost items and plat.  I was under the impression that GM's would re-imburse everything except NO DROP Items?<br>

Very sorry to hear about this. Any idea how this was done? Do you use the same password or something on any MSG boards that you use for EQ? Does anyone else have access to your account? Makes me wanna go change my password real quick. Leycrow has always been a pretty fair GM. Did he give any reasons why, if he knows all the facts and knows wrong was done, why he won't help? <p><BR>

<br>
*IF* this really did happen, my guess if the account info was shared and got into the wrong hands.  That's *if* this really happened.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to flame the original poster, but before I make a judgement about another player or a scam, I need a little more proof or witnesses and such. I'm sure that if I made statements about the original poster he would want to be &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot; <p>Zaboo Krusher<BR>

All of which were professional and fair. You state you have "personal issues with our GM-admin". I'd say they are just that... Personal issues. That worth starting personal issues with me for some reason? You don't even know me. <br>
The real issues are DID the original poster actually get hacked? WHY exactly does the GM team not deem necessary to step in and help after looking at records and all the facts? <br>
<br>
I'm starting to have to side with Zaboo here. I think if there was nothing fishy going on, then he would have no trouble getting resolution from Leycrow on this matter. At least SOME resolution. He just hasn't ever impressed me as the kind to make snap decisions based on his mood or whatever. Why not reinstate his account as it was from a backup, change the password and/or username login and instruct him to be more careful in the future. Sounds to me like there may be some history here that we aren't aware of but Leycrow is.<br>
<br>
Then again, maybe it's another one of those goofy VI policies that screws everyone involved.  /shrug<br>
<br>
My humble opinions here of course. <p><BR>

<br>
As far as people's accounts being hacked..... I've seen this happen to a lot of people.  And oddly enough, in the majority of the cases it's ended up being an account they bought from someone, or they had given their password out to a &quot;friend&quot;.  And even though some of them have been my friends, if you do something that stupid, don't cry to me when your stuff vanishes.<br>

<br>
If you dont want this to happen to you, then your path is simple. Give your password out to no one. By no one, I really mean no one. Make it really hard to guess with goofy characters *%&amp;#^$&amp;%, numbers, etc in it. Dont use the same password for your EQ account that you use elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the rest, It's hard to guess why Leycrow couldnt help, he's always been a fair GM, so I have got to assume his hands were tied by some kind of policy or reason from above him. I would think that since no &quot;real&quot; hacks hardly ever happen, they assumed that you allowed someone else to use the account by giving out your PW, which of course is against the little thing you agree to every time you play. <br>
<br>
I think you have to think like a cheater to guess why they might not be able to help if your &quot;account is compromised&quot;. They cant tell the difference between a &quot;Real hack&quot; (assuming there ever is such a thing) and you giving out your PW. If you could do this sort of thing, and expect reimbursals later when you tell the GM you were hacked, then you and a friend could: create a new account with $50 that you dont care about if it gets banned. Give that character a bunch of your super-rare expensive stuff, have that character then give all those items out elsewhere several times far into circulation, petition the GM and get a brand-new set of equipment created for you, go back to step 1 and repeat.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt that this was done here with this in mind, I bet that someone really was taken advantage of, but I also doubt that Verant could have known for sure what exactly happened to every one of those items. If the person who &quot;hacked&quot; (read: given the password) the account sold it all off, and all that stuff is untracable, then they cant really create a whole new set of rare expensive stuff out of thin air and give it to you. If they did, that would be pretty much a legal way of doubling your equipment. I have no illusions that people are all angels and would never do such a thing, if I thought about it just now, I bet hundreds of others have before too, making such an unfair-sounding policy necessary. <p>Cayleu Starshine

my level 5 twink character with 6500 pp and a boat load of rares died, corpse not able to be found, disintegrated while i waited for a petition to be answered, was told to wait 5 days to talk with leycrow who only seems to work one or two days a week. Was told that i should not be twinking characters and was told i could get equipment back that he deemed a level 5 character should have, by the time i talked with him, i was level 10 going on 11...<br>
<br>
so when you say hes so proffessional, hes human, and has issues with players that go straight into how he decides to give customer service to people. if he had a bad day, expect to get screwed by him. <br>
<br>
I have had three or four incounters with him, and i hate to say it... the only one time that i got any kind of real solution was when my character got pushed off a boat for some unknown reason and fell through the water into the sky and took 10000hp damage and died...<br>
<br>
say what you want, but leycrow is NOT proffessional in dealing with people. if your lucky to catch him happy, expect something to happenthat rules say, otherwise get ready to go round after round with sending in emails to verant/sony to get any kind of resolve.<br>

I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but if you load down a twink that hasn't even reached level 6 yet, with several k worth of equipment, knowing that your corpse will only take 30 minutes to decay, your not getting a lot of sympathy from me. <p>Cayleu Starshine

I agree with Zaboo completely. It's totally unfair to blackball a guy without having the full story. The original post was very little info. I'd also like to know how he knows who did it.<br>
<br>
I also agree that it's ridiculous to twink out a character with 30minute decay time... Level 1-5 is so fast anyway, just get some cheapy stuff, blast through it, and then put your stuff on.<br>
<br>
About accounts getting hacked...are they really that easy to get into? What exactly does the hacker need to have to get into your account? If I haven't told anybody my station ID and password, aren't I safe? (Not that anyone would want what I have anyway, but...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=2671.topic"> << Prev Topic </a> &nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=2694.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.emailToFriend?topicID=2685.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend">Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.threadControl?topicID=2685.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2685.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2685.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><b>jump to:</b><br><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants</select><br><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.luclin.com">Luclin.com</a></center> <br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=compstratgames" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
