[Moved here by Aenae]</span><hr size=1> As some of you know, i as well as many clerics clerics have been working on my epic. I was up to Ragefire and quite excited. So a few days ago, i posted a reservation(i know some of you will stop reading at this point) for Ragefire in solb on Tues Jan 30. On the 29th i grouped with 5 Hyakka Roukoun(sp?) members, including the GL, Yukimura, and we took Korocust down 5 times. He asked me where i was on my epic and i told him that the following day i was taking down Ragefire, and couldnt wait. Hmmmm. Well yesterday(the 30th) I started getting tells, asking me if i had Ragefire reserved, because Hyakka was en force in the backside of Solb, and every single member was on anon(ie tag didnt show)  I proceeded to send Yukimura a tell. it was 1 sentence, sorta. &quot;hi, you were aware i had Ragefire reserved on the calendar for today werent you?&quot; He replied, You need to send Train or Wingarm a tell, its not my raid. So i dent each the exact same tell, no response.  I waited a while before repeating these tells. Ppl in the zone sent me tells they were still there, and i could send them tells, and do a who all(specific name) but a who all Hyakka showed they had noone on line. I tried to send Yukimura another tell, hoping the GL could clear this up, no response. Maybe 1 and 1/2 hours later Train finally sent me a tell. We lost...Ragefire despawned. I kinda exploded at this point, and sent Yukimura a lengthy tell, but realizing english wasnt their 1st language came off as polite yet expressed the fact i was furious. I receive another tell from Train, saying shes sorry, but Tiarcs stole their camp so they moved in when they left, thats how it goes, but we lost and despawned Ragefire. Well, i did a little checking, and Tiarcs moved in to Solb on the day thay had it reserved, and futheremore, moved out before my reservation.  Hyakka has it reserved for tomorrow, yet decided to move in early because they didnt get it when they last had it reserved. I am fully aware that this may get moved to the flames section, but i simply was floored by this situation, tried to settle it with them and got blown off. Many of my friends told me to petition. My response was petition what?? The calendar system is based on the honor of the people who play the game, not on any Verant policy, and i understand GM's wont touch epic disputes with a 10 foot pole anyway. Oh well, i will still get my epic, it will just be delayed for a while.  I just wanted to let the people of Luclin know what happened, and the fact that all took their guild tags off showed that this was a calculated act. Im done, sorry about the length of this post, and the odd time its on, but i share a computer with my roommate and since i had no raid, got off to let her play. Hehe i woke up in the middle of the night and had to get this off my chest. <p>Styme Foradrink, humvle cleric and officer of LotC</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aenae</A> at: 1/31/01 10:29:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uiggnatius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iggnatius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/01 1:55:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really just happened..</span><hr size=1> 2 words: Fucked Up.<br><br>Iggnatius Bloodbringer<br>53 Reaver of Innoruk<br>Sorrow's End <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvyperhandgrimslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vyperhand Grimslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/01 2:06:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Teahouse/5090/conan16_art.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really just happened..</span><hr size=1> Geeeeeeeezz.... everytime they do something like this i hear oh but they dont speak english. how many times can that excuse be used sheeeeesh.

We came to SolB at our scheduled time and they did not want to leave till the day ended at PST.  We said ok, since at the time it was 11 minutes to go, and then we moved in.  They had a person on the camp, in the shadows, about the whole time.<br><br>Now is the question of Ragefire pops.  According to several sources after Nagafen and Magus Roykl are dead he will pop in 0 - 72 hours. After Zordak is killed he is supposed to be a 23-24 hour pop.  I am not sure what a despawn is.  So I think the guild who need a cleric epic should set up Zordak reservations like this:<br><br>Nagafen dead- Guild A gets to sit in that room for 0 - 72 hours waiting.  After they kill Ragefire once they let the next guild know the time and tell their person to come have a seat and stare at the wall.  If he pops in the first 20 minutes as with Aenae, great; the next guild comes on in after he is dead (or to help kill him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  If he pops in hour 71, uhg what a long sit, but he dies and the next guild moves in. <br><br>Then after the second Ragefire kiled the next guild moves in.  They get the luxury of the 24 hour camp.  <br><br>Now we all know the Ragefire spawns are not set in stone, but I do believe that we will be very knowledgable of how he pops after the 15 clerics in waiting get through with him.  I know this family of Luclin can work it out, and we will all be better off with more cleric epics.<br><br>I may have gotten off the subject a bit, and I will move most of this post to its own thread.<br><br>Styme, my little Dwarf friend, I am so sorry.

Before this situation all my dealings with Hyakka have always been very professional and polite.  This was a guild that usually would not hinder other people’s gameplay and most players on Luclin respected this guild.<br><br>Well, here are some of my problems with their assassination attempt on Ragefire:<br><br>1.  Players on the server should either respect the calendar or disregard it.  There are those who support both sides of the reservation system.  That is your freedom on this issue but damn at least show some consistency.  The fact that they had a complaint against other guilds for not respecting their reservations and then they pull this hypocritical BS?<br><br>2.  The fact that they wined and dined Styme before they decided to gang rape him the next day.  So did Hyakka ask Styme to group with them on Monday because he was a friend of theirs or because they wanted to interrogate him before their act of deception?  What the hell was this?  The Yakuza???  And then they think that a &quot;sorry&quot; is a sufficient form of compensation for this unspeakable act?  If they were even thinking that an apology was in order then they felt guilty that their taking of Ragefire was downright wrong to begin with.<br><br>3.  Ninja anon tactics.  Wow, I have to give them credit on that.  When you are about to screw someone royally I guess it is better if people do not know your identity.  That the entire guild was anon just goes to further support that they knew what they were doing was at least wrong in their eyes.  Can someone please pass the lubrication?<br><br>4.  Putting the blame on Tiarcs.  Now what the hell was this using another guild's actions as a friggin scapegoat?  Tiarcs did not violate anyone's spawn or reservation.  They came into SolB on their reservation date and after patiently waiting to no avail for Ragefire to spawn they left when Styme's reservation came up.  How did Tiarcs KS Hyakka?  Where does this line if illogical reasoning even stem from?  Now if the situation was different and say a guild did come in on the day of Hyakka's reservation and KS'd Ragefire from them, does this really justify them using a KS Domino Theory?  Hey Styme!  Check to see who next has Ragefire reserved so we can plan out a KS!!!  Sorry Tiarcs that Hyakka tried to pass blame to you guys, but who would buy that as an acceptable excuse anyways.<br><br>To sum it up what Hyakka did was something that was immensely dishonorable and void of any reasonable integrity for a guild that seems to live by this code of conduct.  Ragefire owning them almost can be seen as denying them any form of hari-kari.  I don't by any means dislike or hate anyone in Hyakka.  They have always been polite to me in every dealing I have had with them, but this act as a guild was a conscious malignant act with participation by all of their members therefore I have a bitter taste in my mouth.<br><br>Thoughts from a pissed off lizzy whose dorf buddy got bitch-slapped hard yesterday <p><html><body><b><font face="copperplate gothic bold"><font color="#660000"><font size=+2>Chopasuey Wasabi</font></font><br><font color="#333333">Iksar Master of the 55 Fists<br>Officer of LoC on Luclin<br>"The Moo Goo Guy Pain"</font></body></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uveladorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veladorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/01 9:07:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really just happened..</span><hr size=1> It seems to me the calandar and reservation system is breaking down and I'm not all too pleased with it.<br><br>-Anvar posting 8 raids, all on a Sat, all PoF.<br>-Hyakka ignoring anothers reservation<br>-Sterm &amp; IB using open raids as a diseption so they can get more God spawns.<br><br>All of this happend just this week alone.<br><br>It truely is sad because it means more and more were sliding into FFA which will hurt everyone.<br><br>As Segal once said, Only CT wins in a FFA situation. <br><br>I think the same will go for all the zones. <p>Valas Defai</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulumudan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lumudan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/01 9:15:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really just happened..</span><hr size=1> Sorry bud, tried to warn ya to have people there soon as we left.

Despicable, yes, but not the systems's fault, Hyakka's.<br><br>Sterm and IB using open raids as a deception.  Give me a break!  If you had been on Sterm's raid Monday night, you'd have a pretty good idea why he cancelled Wednesday.  Though it's not his fault that PoF fell apart, he feels responsible because he led the raid, and very likely didn't have the strength or inclination to do it all again.  I feel for the guy, I really do.  Your conspiracy theory, though interesting, is way off base, and probably hurtful to Sterm himself.  Please keep the facts straight -- I don't like to see an honest person or guild being torpedoed like that.<br><br><br>What the calendar system needs is simply to be respected.  I don't give a @#%$ whether you speak English or not, or whether you're making some sort of political statement by posting 8 dates.  It's disrespectful, it affects everybody around you, and it's completely uncalled for. <p><hr align="center" size="1"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><center><IMG SRC="http://members.home.net/dondelinger/SS/sbvorpal4.gif"><BR><B>Stryke Repeatedly</B><BR>Non-Political Planar Hippie Warrior<BR><hr align="center" size="1" width="10%"><B>Glimpse Morningtide</B><BR>Early 40s Hippie Druid<BR><hr align="center" size="1" width="10%">Harried High Commander, Silent Sentinels<BR><A HREF = "http://www.silentsentinels.com" TARGET = "_blank">Come See Us!</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ualzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/01 11:41:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really just happened..

Being in a very small guild, we HAVE to plan ahead or we will be woefully short on personell.  I like the idea of consequences for actions, but am not sure there is a realistic, feasable way to handle it.  After all this is a game, albeit one that does affect our emotions to a degree, and i see no way to alleviate these issues, as all the guilds have their own agendas. For the most part, ive foud 90% + of the people on Luclin to be nice individuals. I have never had a problem with any guild untilthis incident.  I may simply wait until all the guilds who can muster forces quickly get theirs, and then ill post a raid and hopefully will be honored. I may be naive in my assumption that if i let others get theirs , they will let me get mine. Epics bring out a level of dementia in ppl, but as a whole ive found the clerical community to be level headed, nice ppl. So to all of you, good luck on obtaining your epics. ill get mine eventually) Good luck and take care. <p>Styme Foradrink, humble cleric and officer of LotC</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uigmod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igmod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/01 4:19:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=580.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You go boy!</span><hr size=1> Hope you get it soon Styme.
