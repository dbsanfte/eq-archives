<br>
1. How many people are on the Rathe Server?<br>
2. How many of those people are planable?<br>
3. How many planable guilds are there?<br>
4. How many planable people/guilds run the RTA board?<br>
5. Do we even like the people who run the RTA?<br>
6. Why do we need the, sorry to say, dictator guilds telling everyone else where they can hunt and when? <br>
7. Why do we allow these people to tell us when we can camp ragefire?<br>
8. Why is it ragefire is not allowed to be camped by anyone under lvl 56?<br>
9. Is Rathe so an@l retentive that we tell clerics &quot;don't do your epic cause your not ALLOWED to get it until lvl 56, because RTA says so?&quot;<br>
-I don't understand this, we all pay the same amount to play, we all experience the game the way we enjoy it, so <br>
10. WHY!!!! are the people who run RTA telling the server how and when to play?<br>
11. Is the Rathe made up of a bunch of children who need direction and guidance from other children?<br>
12. Why do we have a rotation calendar? <br>
13. Why do we have to sign up and why are there rules?<br>
14. Why do I need permission to go to the planes?<br>
15. What are the GM's/Verant views to my guild going to the planes while not on the RTA board?<br>
-No where in the EQ manual or on the server select screen under The Rathe does it say , must check RTA to be able to play the way you want.<br>
16. How is it that you all fight about RF all the time but no one has the balls to say screw the RTA my guild will take it down if we engage first. Then to have whining little babies come running to the RTA/Flame board, just so they can bash someone for playing the game by the game rules?<br>
17. Why is my guild not allowed to bring more then 6 people from another posting entity guild to my raid?<br>
18. Who makes up all these rules?<br>
19. So can I make an RTA board add a Flame central then start spouting rules and you will all follow them?<br>
20. So is the RTA a majority or is it a handful of people telling a few thousand what to do?<br>
- So basically you are all little robots being controlled by the bigger guilds telling you how to play. I think I am understanding this a little but would still like my questions answered so I can understand it better for my next post on why.<br>
-Oh one more thing, don't bother wasting space by badgering me over having one post here or picking apart spelling errors. You know who you are cause thats the only thing you know how to post.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How many people are on the Rathe Server?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Lots. Someone once told me were the oldest server. Is this true?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How many of those people are planable?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
The majority...four times over. Many have up to 11 planable toons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How many planable guilds are there?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Count the guilds on the rotation list. Then add 5.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How many planable people/guilds run the RTA board?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As my understanding, its more of a collaboration of the guilds involved. Each guild has a few representatives.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do we even like the people who run the RTA?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
the guild reps or the moderators? Cuz the way the RTA is set up, theres no room for dictatorship.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do we need the, sorry to say, dictator guilds telling everyone else where they can hunt and when?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Which guilds would those be, cuz I've never been told where and when I can hunt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do we allow these people to tell us when we can camp ragefire?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your questions are swerving to a direction that doesnt exist. Nobody tells anyone WHEN we can kill ragefire. We tell ourselves when we can kill ragefire.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 8. Why is it ragefire is not allowed to be camped by anyone under lvl 56?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because if the level cap was 30, we'd have too many damn clerics on the list, and, correct me if im wrong, the epic is unusable and unnattainable before 56.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 9. Is Rathe so an@l retentive that we tell clerics &quot;don't do your epic cause your not ALLOWED to get it until lvl 56, because RTA says so?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not sure how that constitutes being anal retentive, but yes, if you want to be part of the civilized world, wait until youre 56.<br>

<br>
Im assuming you not familiar with the way RTA runs, which is cool. Theres nobody in charge, accept ourselves. Its a skewed version of democracy. Each guild fullfills the requirements (certain amount of planable toons), then is allowed into the committee, so to speak. The guild assigns its own reps, and those reps speak for the guild. Then ALL the reps from ALL the guilds collaborate to keep the Rathe civil. In this case, there is no president. So, I dont see where you think there is dictatorship, or corruption.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 11. Is the Rathe made up of a bunch of children who need direction and guidance from other children?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sadly, yes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 12. Why do we have a rotation calendar? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because if we didnt, people would have /guildwar assigned to a hotkey. There would be constant fighting over planes, epic mobs, dragons, etc. and nothing would ever get killed. 5 guilds would show up in Hate at the same time, and all get wiped out while wondering why 4 other guilds are there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 13. Why do we have to sign up and why are there rules?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Why are there rules? As opposed to....what..NOT having rules?<br>

If your guild is planable, sign up on the RTA.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No where in the EQ manual or on the server select screen under The Rathe does it say , must check RTA to be able to play the way you want.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Nowhere. Notice it doesnt say that here either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 16. How is it that you all fight about RF all the time but no one has the balls to say screw the RTA my guild will take it down if we engage first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
One guild did. And they received a lot of flak for it. The reason why we dont do that? We're gentlemen here, and we're civil.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then to have whining little babies come running to the RTA/Flame board, just so they can bash someone for playing the game by the game rules?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm....Its funny you see it this way: &quot;RTA rules are a dictatorship, and unjust, but the games rules ARE fair.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heres the thing, the way the GMs run the game, IS fair, but its not JUST. The RTA is the Rathes attempt to correct those problems on a gentlemans agreement basis. Beleive it or not, the game would not be much fun if everyone was warring over everything. If that was the case, there WOULD be dictator guilds saying things like &quot;Hmmm...52 weeks from now, you can have Ragefire. Hes ours until then.&quot; simply because they can. One guild would always come out on top.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 17. Why is my guild not allowed to bring more then 6 people from another posting entity guild to my raid?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think it has something to do with cheating about the number of planable toons your guild has, and more than 6 people would constitute a sharing of a plane. To be honest, the rule is overlooked, with the exception of specific mobs that MUST be taken down by your guild ALONE to get on rotation, proving that your guild is powerful enough to do it alone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 18. Who makes up all these rules?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We do. If every rep agreed, we could do away with the above rule. not that we ever would.<br>
<br>

I'm not sure where you got the above information from, but this is not a part of the Gentleman's Agreement that was proposed back in April and agreed to by the majority of the guild representatives. The only requirement that we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ask</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people to abide by, is that you have completed your epic up to the Ragefire point - specifically that you have your note from Chardok. There is no way to enforce this, but most guilds have agreed not to allow their clerics to camp Ragefire without the note. Clerics can use their epic starting at level 51.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, Kluz pretty much covered it all. Hopefully you'll read his post with an open mind. <p><center>

Well back when you could still do a &quot;/who count all&quot; at peak times there were around 3000.  Most peopel figured that was about half of the total people that played on the Rathe.  Hard to know how many now, but probably at least 8000 or more.<br>

hmm haven't seen this.  BotS doesn't tell my guild where/when we can hunt.  In fact no other guild has either, nor we would allow one.  Guilds have agreed to follow certain process for certain zones/npcs.  That is why we have the rotation system for npcs,  and why we have the planes calendar.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 7. Why do we allow these people to tell us when we can camp ragefire?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Any cleric that wants to camp ragefire can.  However The guilds on the server have agreed that a cleric should only need the ragefire drop to complete epic before camping ragefire.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 8. Why is it ragefire is not allowed to be camped by anyone under lvl 56?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A cleric under level 56 can camp ragefire.  I know of of no such rule for this. I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> think</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the epic is only useable to 51+, might be wrong not for sure. So really doesn't make sense for a cleric under 51 then to camp ragefire.<br>

See above, not for sure where you are getting this information. Maybe you shoudl read the Rathe Etiquette Forum<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 10. WHY!!!! are the people who run RTA telling the server how and when to play?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
They don't.  The Planes Calendar was a system discussed over several months about 2 years ago, by all the guilds of the server.  It was an agreed upon method.  Rotation systems were agreed upon by guilds that coudl kill the NPC.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 11. Is the Rathe made up of a bunch of children who need direction and guidance from other children?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well at one point in time before we tried to become a civil server  it very well may have appeared this way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 12. Why do we have a rotation calendar? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Have you been part of group going after a race npc?  Take Venril Sathir for instance.  Have you been part of a group going to kill him when there is a second group going for him?  Imagine 2 guilds running through Karnors Castle trying to get him.  It can be chaotic, lots of deaths,  flames erupt that make Talendor's breath seem like a cold december wind, and that is if it doesn't go to badly.  So those guilds that could kill an NPC that was highly desired like Tormax,  Dozekar, NTOV, and such agreed to rotate the NPC instead of racing each other for it, and creating problems.  SIDE NOTE:  Sounds very grown upish if you ask me,  see question 11.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 13. Why do we have to sign up and why are there rules?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Simply put 2 years ago this server got tired of the flames, fights, training, name calling, and not getting to see things, that they created the Rathe Travel Agency here to discuss Rathe Server issues.  Guilds sent representatives here to speak on behalf of their guild.  What was created was the Rathe Planes Calendar. This allowed many guild to go the planes alone, where they could have the entire planes to themselves.  Instead of the previous of having 2-3 guilds in the planes generally making each other miserable.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 14. Why do I need permission to go to the planes?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Simply put you do not.  The Planes Calendar is a Reservation system. It simply states that Guild/Alliance  X  has reserved Plane Y  on day Z, and all other guilds/alliances on the Planes Calendar respects Guild/Alliance X claim to the planes day Z.  Anyone can enter the planes on a day that is not reserved.  However entering the Planes on a day that is reserved and it is not your reservation, is well very bad form.  The Repurcussiosn are many guilds would be less likely to help you on a wipeout, or in the future when you have other problem.  Remeber your reputation is what you carry forward. <br>

Well for planes raids this was one of the agreed upon rules by all the Guild Leaders/Representatives when the Planes calendar was decided upon.  The rule no more than 6 from the same posting entity that is not your enitity.  This is to prevent double dipping.<br>

The Guild Leaders/Representatives and the guilds on the rotation for a particular npc.  Clerics to an extent have defined the Ragefire Rules.  The rules are made by those it effects.  <br>

You don't have to follow the rules of the RTA. You can jump in line for Ragefire or play in the planes on someone else's day or kill a rotation mob out of turn multiple times. Just don't expect to find many friends, get any help, or get many groups outside of your rogue guild after that. You will more or less be ostrasized from the rest of the server who have agreed to these rules. The Rathe is a virtual society. That means there are codes people play by that the majority have agreed to. If you don't like them, the best thing to do is try to change them through discussion or switch servers. <br>

Rathe by far has less fights over those mobs, but some of the servers, well Planer raids per guild just don't exist, Fear is a pickup raid, so is Hate.  (doesn't make sense to me, I'd rather know most of the people I go with, makes for a better raid)<br>

<br>
1.  The RTA agreements protect the small guilds as much as the big guilds.  If no such agreements were in place, the odds are that no smaller guilds would ever see mobs that are Statue of Rallos Zek caliber or higher.  One of three guilds would have them perma-killed.  Any time a smaller guild would check out any plane, it would be empty.<br>
<br>
2.  The Rathe isn't the oldest server, it's one of them though.  It existed in early betas.  I think it was one of the original 4 or 6.<br>
<br>
3.  The Rathe is *extremely* well known around VI.  It is the only server where the players work together to resolve disputes.  If you ask any GM how many times they have to intervene in guild-guild disputes on The Rathe, that number would be maybe once per month if not fewer.  Compare that to any other server.  The Rathe is the only server that is 'mature' (VI's words, not mine) enough to have actually established a 'government' that is run by the whole server and not dictated by a very small subset of guilds.  Go to Veeshan and see how much content you will have for your $13/month.  On The Rathe, the people police themselves and each other.  If someone does something bad, the whole server knows about it and deals with it accordingly.  On other servers, Ragefire and other mobs are ruled by the 'might-makes-right' principle.  How would you feel to FINALLY get a shot at Statue, fail once and then while you are rezing your members, watch another guild come kill the mob in front of you?  That wouldn't happen on The Rathe without some serious fallout on RTA.  The RTA system on The Rathe is known enough at VI that they have forced its implementation on Stormhammer.  The problem with Stormhammer is that they are getting the system force upon them with no history behind it.  For us, it evolved out of necessity to maintain sanity and fairness.  It is 'of the people, by the people, for the people' and tries to be fair to all.  If you don't think it is fair, go check the rotation page out and see how many guilds have access to Trakanon, Severilous, Zlandicar, Statue of Rallos Zek, and other mobs.  The guilds on those lists are GUARANTEED to see those mobs periodically.  As an example of what it could be like, before RTA was thought up, my guild perma-killed Trakanon.  We saw 30+ Trakanons before ANY other guild killed him, and it wasn't for lack of trying... we simply knew when he'd spawn and would set up and hold the camp early.  That is 3 months worth of spawns.  By your reasoning, that is $39 of your money that you WERE NOT ALLOWED <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PERIOD</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to see Trakanon.  Because of the stress of all those camps with other guilds, we all decided to sit down and set up the RTA so that *ALL* guilds, not just the big ones, have fair access to all mobs, given that they can prove they are capable by killing a mob once.<br>
<br>
4.  As for the common &quot;I pay money too so why do you tell me where I can play&quot;, consider this:  the RTA that we have in place INSURES that you can at least see content periodically once you attain the strength to see it.  On any other server, the odds of an up-and-coming guild seeing an interesting mob alive are extremely slim.  Go complain to those people about how much money you pay and that they should leave mobs up so you can kill them - you will get laughed at in the face while the mob is killed in front of your guild while you are buffing.  On The Rathe, you WILL see them, guaranteed, if you can kill them at least once.  THAT is guaranteeing that you at least get your $XX worth of your play time.<br>
<br>
5.  If you don't like our community, you are free to pay $50 and move to another server and leave us alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/31/02 5:42:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> To answer the questions by point:<br>
<br>
1. How many people are on the Rathe Server?<br>
- Lots, several thousand.<br>
<br>
2. How many of those people are planable?<br>
- Quite a few.<br>
<br>
3. How many planable guilds are there?<br>
- I don't know the exact number, but there are quite a few of those.  Simply check the planes reservation calander for a list.<br>
<br>
4. How many planable people/guilds run the RTA board?<br>
- All of them.<br>
<br>
5. Do we even like the people who run the RTA?<br>
- For the most part, yes.  Everyone has representation.<br>
<br>
6. Why do we need the, sorry to say, dictator guilds telling everyone else where they can hunt and when? <br>
- If 'all of the people of the Rathe' is considered a dictator, I guess everyone is telling everyone else where they can hunt and when.<br>
<br>
7. Why do we allow these people to tell us when we can camp ragefire?<br>
- Out of fairness.<br>
<br>
8. Why is it ragefire is not allowed to be camped by anyone under lvl 56?<br>
- I don't know anything about this.<br>
<br>
9. Is Rathe so an@l retentive that we tell clerics &quot;don't do your epic cause your not ALLOWED to get it until lvl 56, because RTA says so?&quot;<br>
- See #8<br>
<br>
I don't understand this, we all pay the same amount to play, we all experience the game the way we enjoy it, so<br>
10. WHY!!!! are the people who run RTA telling the server how and when to play?<br>
- Because if The Rathe didn't have such a government, there WOULD be a single guild, or a very small number of guilds (like 3) that would be telling you EXACTLY how/when/where to enjoy your game and they would be telling you to shove your $13/month where the sun don't shine.  Smaller guilds would have NO shot or HOPE of seeing higher end encounters more than once a year.<br>
<br>
11. Is the Rathe made up of a bunch of children who need direction and guidance from other children?<br>
- Exactly the opposite.  It is made up of mature, rational thinking individuals that can see the good and usefulness in compromise instead of greed and immaturity.<br>
<br>
12. Why do we have a rotation calendar? <br>
- To guarantee that smaller guilds have the exact same (fair) access to higher end encounters as the larger guilds.<br>
<br>
13. Why do we have to sign up and why are there rules?<br>
- You sign up to guarantee your rights to access content and so that other guilds will not bully or runover you.<br>
<br>
14. Why do I need permission to go to the planes?<br>
- You don't.  You are free to go all you want.  Just be prepared to be an outcast and unguilded (which means you won't be going to the planes at all).<br>
<br>
15. What are the GM's/Verant views to my guild going to the planes while not on the RTA board?<br>
- Heh... you'd be surprised and it depends on the situation.  GMs have enforced our calendar before.<br>
<br>
No where in the EQ manual or on the server select screen under The Rathe does it say , must check RTA to be able to play the way you want.<br>
16. How is it that you all fight about RF all the time but no one has the balls to say screw the RTA my guild will take it down if we engage first. Then to have whining little babies come running to the RTA/Flame board, just so they can bash someone for playing the game by the game rules?<br>
- You are free to gank Ragefire if you want.  Be prepared to be unguilded and an outcast.<br>
<br>
<br>
17. Why is my guild not allowed to bring more then 6 people from another posting entity guild to my raid?<br>
- This actually has a lot of history behind it.  Basically it comes from the epic mobs that are in the planes.  A group of 60s can clear the planes, in addition to 'elevating' the strength of a guild by a huge factor in PoF and PoH, allowing them to get access status when they would really be wasting everyone's (including theirselves) time.<br>
<br>
<br>
18. Who makes up all these rules?<br>
- The players of The Rathe do.<br>
<br>
19. So can I make an RTA board add a Flame central then start spouting rules and you will all follow them?<br>
- You are welcome to try.<br>
<br>
20. So is the RTA a majority or is it a handful of people telling a few thousand what to do?<br>
- It is the majority.  If you go look at the rotation pages or the reservation calendar, everyone on those lists agree and support the RTA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me make this additionally clear: It isn't that everyone loves to share because rotations naturally work against humans' natural proclivity to greed.  However, most rational people agree that order is preferred to chaos and that rotations are fair and much more orderly.  In addition, the calendars and rotations let guilds who typically have more casual gamers to plan ahead so that they can field full forces on the days when their turn at a mob is up.  The RTA tries to guarantee that the game is fair for every paying customer by insuring their access to higher level content that would otherwise be permanently controlled by the higher tier guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubloodcelt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BloodCelt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bloodcelt/pics/forum/shocker.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Celts</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/31/02 5:46:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bloodcelt/pics/forum/ezbc.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> Simply put, we as a whole endured the endless drama, power struggles, negotiations and near revolt that finialy led us to a system that has managed to hold the peace damn well.

We have to be reminded of the crap we swam through to get to this point every now and then when someone offer a challenge to the system.. and to let those who are newer and impatiant that if they @#%$ with the system, they will not be on the rathe long.<br>

My cousin has been playing since EQ started.  I can't remember which server he's on but he's got two level 50+ toons who have never even seen Lower Guk.  There are a lot of places he's not allowed to go because its controlled by the larger guilds.  Thankfully  have the RTA and don't have to worry about never seeing certain zones.

I am sedentary by nature, enjoying passive entertainment, eating when the mood takes me, and playing with my food.

I'm glad those people pull those out because they immediately let me know what kind of person I'm dealing with.  These people think only for themselves - i.e. ruled by greed and the lack of logical thought processes.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a 'what if' scenario to explain it more...<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
What if BotS suddenly decided that we all pay at least $13/month each and we now feel that we should kill every spawn that you ever attempt to kill, from the lowliest moss snake to Aten Ha Ra?  After all, it is our right since we ALSO pay this fee.  Since there are more of us paying our $13/month than there are of you, this makes it completely right and just that we should do so.  Tindi'Losi and Noble Blade could also make similar arguments.  I think between our three guilds we could guarantee that you and your guild would never, ever see any content worth continuing to play and pay your $13/month, much less Ragefire or the planes.<br>
<br>
Let me explain it further.  It takes my guild 13 people to kill Derakor the Vindicator, less than 18 to kill Statue of Rallos Zek, 4 to kill Ragefire (and not MB wizards either, although that is also an option), and we can clear PoF with 6.  In addition, we can deploy these numbers on a moment's notice, specifially when we learn that you are starting to head somewhere interesting.  After all, it the rules of the game that we can kill whatever mobs we want, whenever we want, as long as you aren't currently fighting it... and since this isn't a PvP server, there's really not much you can do about it.  Plus, we play our $13/month just like you do.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Obviously, neither BotS, Tindi, nor NB would ever do such a thing... although this is a 'what if' scenario, it is actually quite similar to the playing environment seen on many other servers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=718.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=718.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=718.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=718.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=718.topic&start=101&stop=111>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=718.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=718.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=718.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=718.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=718.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=718.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Adiminstration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.6<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
