If guild A is up and loses a &quot;race&quot; once, then they know they HAVE to be ready the next week. If they are busy &quot;frying bigger (or different) fish&quot; perhaps they should think about scheduling the bigger fish around their rotation obligations.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree. Rotation obligations should come first. A guild up on rotation should try to kill the rotation mob as soon as it's capable.<br>
<br>
What about guilds that must wait until a certain time before they have a force capable of killing Sev? Slissia had a good example:<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Example: Sev spawns at 9 am on a weekday...I'm at work, so are most of my guildies...we do not have the force at that moment in time to take him, although we would within the 24 hours as we all come home from work. Guild Z has more folks on than we do, and kills mob before we manage to clock out and zip home. Okay, no problem, there's a next time. <br>
<br>
Next time Sev spawns at 8 am on a weekday. Again, other guilds looking to get on the rotation have a good 8 hours before I and my other guildies get home from work and get our happy little toons logged in. So Guild Y kills him before we can. <br>
<br>
With the 'two strikes' thing going, we would then have to wait another half a year, to hope and pray that Sev picks a more appropriate time of day (for us) to spawn. This seems to kinda penalize people who have no choice but to go out and work for a living.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Her example guild did everything right, and was forced to pass. The example guild simply was forced to pass becuase it was a less mature guild. (Note - less mature is being used to mean a small membership guild with the average level being low to mid 50s.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
If 10 guilds enter all at once, the practicality of the rotation is destroyed because NO ONE can plan for their kill.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't understand this. When the guild before you kills the rotation mob, I thought your guild was at that point on watch.<br>
Your guild is supposed to be on watch until you kill the rotation mob or pass. How your guild sets up it's calendar and plans for killing a rotation mob is not the RTA's concern. The RTA's job in this matter is to simply keep track of who's turn it is on the list and then inform the guilds participating on the rotation.  <br>

<br>
I think the best idea on seb right now is the current one. Even if what you propose, Rog, is &quot;fair,&quot; I can't see telling a warrior in my guild &quot;no sorry we got unlucky with sev spawning at bad times so now you gotta wait ANOTHER year before we can try killing him.&quot; Fair or not, its not doable in my view.<br>
<br>
Or how about this... Assume you have this rotation setup... Guild C, Guild B, Guild A. Guild A is up for the kill, followed by Guild B, followed by Guild C. If a guild (guild A) fails to kill him twice, the mob becomes a race between the guild A and the following guild on the rot (guild B) for any and all subsequent spawns until guild A kills him. ONly those two guilds can participate in the race (or even talk it out and decide on who will get him) as well as any guild trying to enter the rotation of course. If guild B kills him they move ahead of guild A on the rotation and then teh mob is a race between guild A and guild C, (guild C being the one following next on the list.) Same rules apply. So in essence, if a guild is not really interested in sev, the rotation rotates aroudn that guild, but they never lose their spot. Just a though, not sure how well this woudl work however.  <p>Juryiel Shadowangel&lt;br&gt;<br>

Isn't that the whole purpose of the rotation - To make sure that the guilds on the rotation can organize and plan for when the mob pops. (and have a 24hr timeframe to do such) <br>
<br>
Now if the guild up on rotation waits over 24hrs and the mob gets snagged by another guild, then they are at fault there, but to penalize them before the 24hrs has passed because another guild plays in an earlier time zone or has more people that don't work and thus can mobilize faster is not really in the spirit of the rotation process.<br>
<br>
I know it sucks for guilds that are on deck or waiting for their spot in the rotation to come up when they keep getting pushed back and back, but if the situation were reversed I would think they would like their fair shot at the mob in that situation.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would, and to be perfectly clear, I do agree with you, *but* that situation will change when we examine what's happening with it. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Because of AA, higher levels, better gear, and the like- Sev can be killed by fewer and fewer people. With the reasonable rate of new guilds on the server, and the nearly 100% retention rate of the sev rotation, this rotation will, factually, continue to get bigger. <br>
<br>
When the ragefire list reached a 6 month wait, it collapsed under the weight of that, and other, issues that could not be addressed. <br>
<br>
With 20+ guilds on the sev rotation, minus server downs, it creates a 5+ month wait. <br>
<br>
Soon, it too will collapse under the weight of so many people who want it, versus the amount that it is available. That is not my opinion: I may be stating it, but realistically, if the wait were 6 months long in a situation where everquest may only be around for 12 to 18 more months (Supposing they turn off the servers for EQ2), certainly people are not going to maintain the rotation. <br>
<br>
When rotations get too big, there must be a mechinism to make the rotation move faster, or suggest the removal of those from the rotation who are 'beyond' it, as Vince is suggesting in the guild rep's forum right now. <br>
<br>
I would like to see Sev as a triggered spawn, needing rare drops from EJ zone mobs, in the manner of the cleric epic. However, I doubt verant will do that any time soon. <br>
<br>
Guilds that can kill Hosh in Veeshan's Peak should remove themselves from the Sev rotation, completely: they have access to green scales, and if they want Sev's drops, they can kill the FFA Gore or Talendor. However, that removes all of zero guilds from the rotation, I believe, since those who can get into Veeshans have already removed themselves from that rotation (And kudos to them for that).<br>
<br>
Vince's suggestion that any who are in Sleepers or beyond should remove voluntarily is also a valid one, though it does not address the topic of those who want their epics, even if it is to bank them so they can look like jedi's while they sell in the bazaar. <br>
<br>
So, if we do accept that the current way is the best way, with none conceivibly better, that's fine, and we can deal with what happens when it happens, but we do have to face the very real, and unavoidable future of the sev rotation, if not altered, or made smaller through voluntairy removal. It will, not might, will, break up due to the long wait. <br>
<br>
If the idea of a '2 strikes' rule is not appealing, lets think of another modification that will keep the rotation moving. <br>
<br>
We have to remember that just because the other (slightly in some cases) smaller rotations are working *because* they are smaller; the content is available more often. <br>
<br>
If Sev was a 3 day spawn, even, would solve many of the issues we are having. <br>
<br>
Certainly, if you want to feedback for a triggered spawn, or a shorter spawn timer, that would be great. Until that change takes place, though, it would be detrimental for us to not have a better way, or at least try to think of a better way. <br>
<br>
Perhaps... since Sev is the bottleneck for the warrior epic, as ragefire was for the cleric... perhaps moving him onto a &quot;camp&quot; rather than rotation would be the solution?<br>
<br>
Warriors must wait in the zone as clerics had to wait for ragefire, with respect to the camp in the same way that ragefire was respected. That would allow those warriors who wanted their epics, for whatever reason, badly enough, to get a green scale. <br>
<br>
If that's something that's worth considering, we can then suggest that the spot is reserved for as long as sev takes to drop a green scale; that is, the warrior there gets to keep camping him if he doesn't drop a scale. That's a secondary suggestion, however. <br>
<br>
Anyone think there is feasability to him as a camp situation, rather than rotation?<br>

<br>
To correctly identify the problem is the first step to solution.  The problem isn't people not killing Sev.  The problem is that Sev doesn't spawn enough to feed everyone wanting the loot.<br>
<br>
If we take a step back from the whole thing we see that this is a designed &quot;limit&quot; of how many scales get into the game in a given period of time.   It doesn't matter what you do to any rotation, the fact is that there will only be so many scales.<br>
<br>
There might be something to address from the RTA point of view IF Sev was going unkilled for a period of time.  This simply isn't the case.   This means that we, as a server, are bringing in as many scales as we can.  <br>
<br>
Regarding some talk of a two strikes rule that just seems contradictory to creating a respectful environment.  We have matured to a point that even someone going to race for a mob feels comfortable enough to let the rot guild know that they are doing so.  This is just respect, and it is usually returned in kind fashion by allowing the attempt unless said rot guild is already on the way.  Everyone respects both the new and the existing rot guild for showing respectful behavior.  Introduction of a &quot;don't be too nice&quot; rule seems contradictory.

But maybe someone can build on this idea or use it to come up with another one.<br>
<br>
The ragefire camp (the one with clerics waiting about a month) pretty much required the cleric to be level 56.  It was frown apon if the cleric was below that level.<br>
<br>
For warriors, we might be able to do something simular, except I don't want to see a line of warriors sitting on the stairs in EJ.  My idea is that a guild goes into autopass mode if they do not have a 58+ warrior that requires the green scale.<br>
<br>
Implementation would be easy, each guild will simply post what 58+ warriors they are trying to get their green scales for.  When they get a green scale, they take a warrior off the list.  If they don't get a green scale, simply state that they did not get the green scale.<br>
<br>
Anyway, 58 was just a number I decided to choose.  I figured epics used to be end game items so a number like 58 seemed fitting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mavier>Mavier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/6/02 5:14:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=369.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion about Sev: Part 2</span><hr size=1> How about we take it off rotation, and let warriors sit in EJ waiting for it to pop for weeks on end to hold their spot for next pop?  hehe  Just a joking thought <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=263206&quot;">Balme</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> lvl 65 Cleric<br>

<br>
- Passing is acceptable. The next guild has 24 hours from time of notification to kill. <br>
<br>
- Tunare and CT are partial exceptions to the 24 hour rule. <br>
- CT (Cazic Thule, the God, in Fear) depends on clearing Fear first. Fear may be scheduled, and the Rotation Guild has to wait for the scheduled Raid to be completed. <br>
- Tunare depends on clearing PoG first. A guild has 24 hours from the time they enter PoG to kill Tunare. <br>
<br>
- The zones of NToV and ST have their own rules, please see the applicable thread. <br>
<br>
<br>
This is copied from the section on etiquette.<br>
<br>
Now it would seem to me, that if a guild is scheduled for rotation and they allow a smaller guild to kill the mob, ...hmmm<br>
<br>
Would seem to me the mob is dead and in 24 hours it is next guild up in rotation. The rotation guild passed in favor of a smaller guild not on rotation.<br>
<br>
If the guild doesn't get around to killing, in 24 hours they blew it, they have effectively passed.<br>
<br>
That seems logical to me. Am I missing something?<br>

If it were, it would be much more difficult to get on rotations because the existing guilds would make sure they didn't miss their chance.

Maybe the RTA can make a limit on the number of rotations a guild can participate in.  Lets say a limit of X.  Then if a guild is on more then X rotations, they choose which X rotations they want to stay on, and go into autopass mode on the others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dembiredeadbones>Dembire Deadbones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.w3.org/Icons/Misc/skeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/9/02 10:11:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=369.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion about Sev: Part 2</span><hr size=1> Why not keep the same rule, but just only allow one guild to enter the rotation in between rotations at a time.  The guild on rotation would still have the same 24 hours to kill Sev on the next pop after the guild entering the rotation kills Sev.<br>
Everyone obviously knows about RTA or Sev would be ganked, so they can check on the boards to see who killed last or maybe the guild wanting to enter rotation MUST check with the guild whose turn it is, to see if they can take him.  This will keep the rotation moving, and the guild can't keep delaying their kill by allowing all these guilds to enter at one time.<br>
example: Guild A is up to kill Sev.  Guild B wants to enter Rotation.  Guild B MUST ask Guild A if they can.  Guild A will say Yes you can, or if Guild C already killed Sev to enter the rotation while Guild A was due to kill him.<br>
If Guild C did kill sev to enter rotation on Guild A's turn, then Guild B has to wait until the next guild on rotation is due.<br>
<br>
Hope this is somewhat clear, just an idea.  Same rules as we have now, exept that it limits the amount of guilds to enter rotation per turn. <p>Dembire Deadbones<br>

If it could be done, we would basically be implementing the same kind of thing as Rogg is suggesting ...<br>
<br>
Say CB is top of the list for next spawn.  On the next spawn, CB is racing pretty much any other non-rotation guild (this is done now, btw) to Sev for the kill.  Here's where the policy change comes into play:<br>
<br>
A)  If CB wins the race and kills Sev first, the rotation continues to the next guild.  Any non-rotation guilds who lost against CB now has to race the next guild for their Sev.  Again, this is exactly the way it is done now ...no change here.<br>
<br>
B)  If CB were to lose their race and the non-rotation guild gets the kill ...welcome to the rotation ...but the next spawn is CB's totally ...no race, assuming a limit of 1 guild per cycle can insert into the rotation, CB has 24 hours to kill him, or force an autopass (per current policy).  A pass or an autopass moves the rotation to the next guild.<br>
<br>
This seems like a complete compromise to me.  Guilds are being put on the rotation via winning the race (albeit slower than they are now given that an unlimited number of non-rotation guilds can kill Sev) and the rotation is moving ahead with no more than two spawns at any cycle.  The key is to let the top of the list rotation guild have the second spawn completely to themselves for a period of 24 hours, if they miss the first one.<br>
