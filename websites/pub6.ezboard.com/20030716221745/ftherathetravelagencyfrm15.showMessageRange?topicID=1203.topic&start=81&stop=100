It is for nobody to decide which religion is right,and who and who isnt going to hell, it is for god to decide. He knows who believes in him, and also who loves<br>
him. Any religion can have screwed up, and or backwards traditions / beliefs, but if they believe the one thing that does count, they recieve eternity. I just can't see why everyone in the world won't believe in god, when it would take a minute or two to do. Why have<br>
a 50% chance of going to hell, when you can have a 0% chance? Well, I know some of you are atheist and what not,<br>
but it doesnt say to gain eternal life, read the bible, go to church, pray every day, or do anything that most chrisitians do. You could say a 20 word pray and be done with it. But why do so many hesitate? the World will never know, until the end.<br>

<br>
The hell concept is ridiculous. You mean to tell me that god will send people to burn, suffer, and scream or just suffer or whatever horrible thing we are supposed to be afraid of that will happen in hell, simply because a person didnt spend a MINUTE OR TWO doing something that god feels is so necessary to do? Even if the rest of that person's 80 years were spent being kind, loving, and helpful to other humans? What kind of a strange vindictive being is this?<br>
<br>
People hesitate because 1. the idea of a loving father casting his children into a &quot;lake of fire&quot; to suffer for all ETERNITY because they disobeyed him is ridiculous and 2. Christianity looks to many like just another BS belief system that isn't worth 2 seconds of serious attention. There are lots of other valid reasons too. I think if you thought about this honestly you would admit that you can understand the hesitation. Did you just jump in without hesitation? Do you ever have honest doubts?<br>
<br>
Just because you were convinced to be scared of hell doesn't mean we were. I guess if someone came up to me and said that if I don't pray to Odin, then I will suffer for all eternity, I better pray to Odin just to be on the safe side. Wouldn't that be a foolish thing to do? Shouldn't I demand proof of this person's claim before I go acting on it? There is NO proof that people will go to hell if they don't believe in God or Jesus. The only evidence that this might be true is in the Bible, and there is no reason to believe that the bible is inerrant.<br>
<br>
Sorry all, but this stuff just burns me.

It's not about disobeying him.  Like most parents.. If you have a child who breaks the laws(Obey the laws of the land, i forget the verse)... commits crimes(rape, murder and infidelity)... publicly deny and yes not saying you are a christian and/or sticking up for your beliefs is denying.  ANY parent of going through a lifetime of this would outcast your child.  I know many parents who refused to bail their children out of prison for the crimes they have committed.  <br>
<br>
If one of my two boys committed a crime against someone or me and was found guilty of it.  I would let him serve his time.. and if he did the same crime 90% of his life then I deffinatly would let him do his time, but that dosn't mean I would love him any less.  I would cast him into a lake of fire (prison with a bunch of big burly gay men who like new inmates as girlfriends) for all ETERNITY (for a life sentence if he did wrong and deserved it)  Hell isnt about burning it is about putting you in what ever your horror is.  I am sure my hell would be stuck in a small box with like a thosand spiders.  <br>
<br>
God will only knock at your door so many times.  If you don't answer it then he wont force you.  Thats what it says..   I take it as... You can only ask someone a few times before you have to stop.  Thoes bible thumpers (yeah I call them that)  Who pester and talk down to others for not being christian are committing sins.  They give other christians bad names... <br>
<br>
I am not perfect.. I am christian... I don't knock people for who they are or what they believe in.  My best friends are wiccan and muslim.  I am not here to preach but when you run into the bad christians... is when people start to hate religious people. I know if I died tomorrow I would be in hell.  <br>

<br>
In the bible it states that it was the devil that gave humanity knowledge (aka eve the apple) not god, god wanted us to be stupid mindless people, so sorry i would have to side with the devil. from what i have noticed in the bible most of the &quot;bad&quot; things that happen arent of the devils doing but by humans. and a good chucnk of what they say about the devil has mostly been things that have helped humans.<br>
<br>
Now maybe its just me but maybe you think the wrong person is evil, when infact it is the very god you worship and love so highly.Maybe you should all step back and take a second look at your beleifs, and maybe change it to beleiving that humans have more say in how things go in our lives then some mystic beleif, if we dont we will just be repeating all the mistakes of the past over yet again.<br>

And since im sure someone is going to ask or say something about it, I beleive in only myself, no god, no religion, nothing, i do not need anything to beleive in to know the difference between right and wrong, thats why i have a brain. I see no need to put faith or trust in a 2500 year old beleif.<br>
<br>
You want to know why religion was started, because anceint humans needed a way to explain things like fire, rain nature, birth, death, pritty much everything in the world, but as we evoled we learned why all these things happen. Religion is now obsolete we dont need it anymore, plane and simple <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A great example of...<BR>

You don't know what religion is the &quot;true&quot; religion so how do you know what ones are &quot;backwards or screwed up&quot; as you say? What religion do you compare your &quot;backwards&quot; ones to?<br>

<br>
How in the hell can you compare a real crime that would require life-lone inprisonment with simply not believing in someone elses imaginary friend?<br>
<br>
Not by any stretch of the imagination can I compare the two. Sorry.<br>
<br>
A closer comparison would be that if your child woke up every day and ignored you. Would you condemn them to life inprosonment for that? Think about it.<br>
<br>
As for chirstianity, I was raised in it. I have more knowlege of the bible in my head than I do of anything they ever taught me in school. <br>
<br>
I can stand here and honestly say that I really don't know if there's a God, there could be, but I will say that the bible is not much more than a history book. Most of the stories are historical facts, but they aren't accuratly accounted. And some are just ourtight bullshit.<br>
<br>
There are stories in the bible, that are not only unbelievable, but given the time of writing vs. the time it was supposed to have occured, it's virtually impossible for the writer to have known the story from facts. BUt, we all the the answer to that is that they were inspired by God to write it, so it MUST be right.....<br>
<br>
You believe that a man built an ark big enough to hold two of every creature along with his family. He built it of wood, over 40 years, and this same man lived to be hundreds of years old, and survived a flood so large that the entire earth was covered with water, and it only took 40, 24 hour periods to cover the entire earth with water.<br>
<br>
Everything in the above story, is impossible. You couldn't even build a boat like that given today's technology even with help. People do not now and never have lived for hndreds of years, and someone please do the math and tell us how long it would need to rain to cover the entire earth in water. Mountains and all.<br>
<br>
You see, you read these things and just because your mommy and daddy tell you it's true, you believe it. Well, I for one decided to use my noggin one day, and I have to say it's all bullshit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rejard>rejard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/30/03 8:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1203.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pissing off a Christain in Yahoo Christain Chat</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He knows who believes in him, and also who loves<br>

Sure are some disturbing opinions out there. And some huge generalizations being made. Also folks telling each other what they (the other) believe. I can tell you my Christian beliefs don't include a lot of what I see folks saying.<br>

Why don't we just drop this waste of a thread. No one is listening and everyone is angry. Everyone is certain they are right and everyone else is an idiot. It's pointless.<br>

CHISTIANITY! The religion of a thousand faces.<br>
<br>
You too can create your very own version of Christianity and feel secure that it is true! Yes! If you feel something is true, it must be true! But if someone else feels something is true that differs from you, well, they are just confused or delusional. JUST REMEMBER: YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE CONFUSED OR DELUSIONAL YOURSELF!

Just because the bible had convinced everyone that god gets offended if you look at him funny, doesn't mean he is offended by anything that rejard said. People may be offended by people making jokes about god, even jokes that are socially unacceptable (i'm not offended), but that doesn't mean god is bugged. I always find it funny that when someone says something mean about god, it is only the god believers who seem to get upset. God himself doesn't seem to get nearly as upset. OR if he does, he doesn't make it too obvious. How much of what people believe about god is simply a projection of what they want for themselves? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page
