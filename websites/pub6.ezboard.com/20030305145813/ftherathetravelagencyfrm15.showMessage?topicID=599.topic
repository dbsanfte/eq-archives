<br>
Earlier today in EC, I was buying Boots of Flowing Slime.<br>
I messaged him, and said if he'd wait for me to get on an alt because that alt had half the money. He said OK.<br>
<br>
So, I bring Shred to EC, get a transfer, get there, and we do the trade. I notice theres a level 51 limit, and say i'm sorry for wasting his time, I never knew there was one on it and that i'd pay him a little for wasting his time.<br>
<br>
He proceeded to tell me even though theres a level limit on it, that the FT 3 effect would still work, it only effects<br>
the AC and stats.<br>
<br>
I asked for a refund if it didn't work. He never replied, so I thought he'd be a good enough man to if it didn't work.<br>
<br>
Well, turns out I couldn't wear the damn things. I told him that and asked for the refund like I did earlier. Well, he said &quot;No, You bought them.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point, i'm saying &quot;WTF, first you talk bullshit to me and then you won't give me my money back.&quot;<br>
<br>
He continued like this for quite a while, then finally agreed to refund only 55 of the 60k i paid him. That isn't enough, i'd rather see him immortalized as a @#%$.<br>
<br>
Sure, maybe its my own stupidity that did this, but he also lied to me, remember that. <br>
<br>
Oh and Rakkin, if you happen to try to deny any of this, I took PLENTY of screenshots.<br>

<br>
the boots were, i said 60k, u siad sure. U NEVER once asked <br>
<br>
any info on the boots, so like a normal person i assumed u <br>
<br>
knew what your were buying due to the fact that your main is <br>
<br>
a 55 shadowknight. So i took them off auction and held them <br>
<br>
for u and waited 1hour+. OTW down u proceeded to say well <br>
<br>
sorry i only have 55k can u do that? i said no then some how <br>
<br>
u happened to come up with a bunch of extra money telling <br>
<br>
me u had to click down 1500pp to 60k. last time i checked <br>
<br>
thast 61500, how dare u call me a lier u prick. i said they <br>
<br>
SHOULD work, meaning <br>
<br>
i wasn't sure. i honestly thought they would. i didn't make u <br>
<br>
push trade, u made that decision, im not Target, i don't give <br>
<br>
refunds, and no one else i know does either. i have made <br>
<br>
stupid buys before but i don't bitch at people and start <br>
<br>
cursing at them because i was a dumbass, nor do i ask for a <br>
<br>
refund or expect one. when i buy items i know what im <br>
<br>
buying, and if i don't i ask, u obviously didn't do either. sorry <br>
<br>
if u feel mislead, or lied to, i didn't mean to do that but u <br>
<br>
should have thought about that before u pushed trade. i <br>
<br>
offered a refund, u turned it down, thats not my fault. well   <br>
<br>
whatever u say Shred means absolutely nothing to me, i <br>
<br>
didn't do anything wrong in my mind and didn't mean to if i <br>
<br>
really did, i try to be as good a person as i can but im not <br>
<br>
perfect and your not either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ualistriwen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alistriwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tba</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/8/02 11:35:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=599.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Another EC incident and a person who @#%$ </span><hr size=1> Shred was stupid, and Rakkin was a jerk. The only real question now, is who was worse?<br>
<br>
Personally, if someone buys something, thinking it is different than what it is, I give them a refund. Similarly, when I buy something and it isn't what I expected, people usually give me a refund. It is common courtesy.  You don't HAVE to do it, and no you are NOT Target, but it is the nice thing to do. If you don't want to be nice, then go ahead and take a 5k bite for nothing but your time. It means you will eventually have earned 65k on a 60k item, good job! <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>

In the future I suggest you trust noone (unless he's a known friend) and make absolutly sure it's the item you want because refunds arent guaranteed!<br>

I remeber a few months back I sold a guy a RBG and he comes back to me like 5 days later asking for a refund because his friend in an &quot;UBER&quot; guild is going to give him one for free...........Guess what I told him?<br>

I like many others have been ripped off before in ec and I took it as a well learned lesson which is.....TRUST NOONE UNLESS THEY HAVE EARNED YOUR TRUST! <p><img src=http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/mestre/Aiyanna.jpg Width=310 height=180></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadow2051.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadow2051</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/9/02 12:46:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=599.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   actually</span><hr size=1> Actually, I DID ask him about it, which my mistake was to trust him. <br>

First i'd like to say- You type like a retarded monkey, learn to use caps and punctuation.<br>

And yes, I DID use 5k that was loaned to me, I asked if you'd go lower, big deal, all people in EC try to haggle your ass down. <br>
<br>
And i'll be damned, you can count. 60000+1500=61500, you must be in honors class. So what does that have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
And you didn't say anything about- &quot;should&quot; when you were explaining it to me.<br>
<br>
You just stated- Lvl req doesn't effect anything except ac and stats, the effect should still work.<br>
<br>
Obviously more crap spewing from your mouth.<br>
<br>
I asked if I could get a refund before that, either way, your a @#%$ @#%$ and you can bet your ass I ain't selling anything to you in the future without slapping a extra 10k to the price tag.<br>

A person trades you an item for pp....and then you want to trade them back because you couldnt use them? <br>
<br>
Seems maybe you need to learn to do a little research before you do trades on if you can use the items. <br>
<br>
The person doesnt HAVE do trade them back. Usually when someone is trading they want to get rid of the ithem they have...not want it back once they made a legitimate sale.<br>

<br>
If you guys bought low, and wanted to sell high, what crime is there in that?  <br>
<br>
The flame itself? Whatever, people get mad in EC all the time. <br>
<br>
But really, is it so bad to make a few plat here, a couple thousand here until you've broken the bank?<br>
<br>
Hell, if I could make 60k buying and selling, I'd do it. I don't have the patience for it, or the will power. 4k right now is better in my mind than 5k in two weeks. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Eh, if there wasn't supposed to be a reasonably workable player economy, everything would be sold by vendors or be no drop. <br>
<br>
Anyway, that's me,<br>
