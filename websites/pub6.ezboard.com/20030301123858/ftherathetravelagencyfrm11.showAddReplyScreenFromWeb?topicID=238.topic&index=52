<br>
It's about precedent, already we have FK pointing to some VOLS/ED Trak issue I know nothing about as a reason they should be allowed to get away with KSing our King Tormax.  Where does it end?  If you guys get away with it, then people have two precedents, next thing you know, rotations mean nothing, and people can kill out of turn and just say &quot;oops, sorry about that&quot;, and everything is ok.  That's a wrong answer in my book.<br>
<br>
If ED/VOLS were able to work out their differences without involving the RTA, that is between them, and has nothing to do with FK/NB.  Personally, I think whoever KSed Trak should be punished, but it doesn't involve me.  However, the KT situation does, and this wasn't just a mistake, it was completely mishandled from A to Z.  You killed a mob that wasn't up for 24 hours, you didn't send a tell or ask in RTA before you killed him under &quot;FFA&quot; rules, you didn't send a tell or ask in RTA AFTER you killed him when you realized you messed up.  You left NB to find out on  its own that KT had been KSed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let's say it was two...three hours later, or whatever long enough to have a confirmed uptime on Tormax of 24 hours and FK HAD killed him 'legally' under the Christmas rules.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sure, I'll play that game, that means FK would have waited until 4pm PST on Saturday to kill him.  I am ok with that, because if we ever took 16 hours to kill King Tormax, I would probably /guilddisband.  Let's review the timeline here:<br>
<br>
8 pm PST (11 EST) Thursday servers crash<br>
12 am PST Friday Karadin checks on KT to see in what order NB should plan their mobs (yay for SoS)<br>
4 pm PST Friday Karadin recieves a tell from Malystrx of VoF that King Tormax is up<br>
9pm PST (12 pm EST) Friday King Tormax is killed by FK<br>
12am PST Friday NB moves to Kael to kill KT, but he is already dead.<br>
<br>
Explain to me first how it happened.  Wait, that's been done, with two different stories.  First story, KT was up over 24 hours (all but impossible given that server crash was 25 hours before you killed him, he would have had to spawn on server up: he hadn't even spawn 4 hours after server up, I checked).  Second story, that an entire guild of mostly above college age people misread Vince's post about special holiday rotation exceptions and thought every mob was FFA.  This was able to happen because both RTA reps for FK were conveniently missing at the time (Jlxaac and Jurassic), and couldn't correct the misunderstanding about the post.<br>
<br>
Now explain something even more basic.  I got ZERO tells from anyone even remotely affiliated with FK leadership before they went to kill KT (I was on all day).  I saw ZERO questions in RTA channel about &quot;Hey, KT has been up over 24 hours, we're gonna kill him under FFA, ok?&quot;.  I got ZERO tells AFTER you killed him and Jlxaac knew you guys had killed out of turn.  Why?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>FK is guilty of bad manners towards NB in this case, but I somehow think it would be hard for you to dislike us more anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only thing I dislike about FK is the dual-wielded chips you seem to wear firmly planted on both shoulders.  I have had Jlxaac, Fere, Eros, Xarien, Dannis, and many other FK members on NB raids in the last 3 years (gladly and with much respect).  I'm the one who opened Jaled Dar's door for Sylph to do his ST key turn in.  Yah, you caught me Jurassic, I just love to hate FK, it's my driving force in life (/sarcasm off).  Hell, I remember when most of you weren't FK, but wore Far Runner tags and we were all in one big happy alliance together back in the day for planar raids.  I have no reason to dislike you save the one I just listed, namely that you guys seem to have such a big problem with us to include even the most basic of communications on rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
The reason NB doesn't find itself in this situation is because Milambus and I make damn sure to be certain we are communicate with the rest of the community on any questionable mobs we are going to kill.  If something has been up 24 hours, I check with the guild in question first before moving on it.  Why?  Because its that important to maintain the basic premise of rotations - that you don't kill out of order.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now if you be the bigger man, let the precedent stand in this situation then NB STILL takes the next Tormax, and FK skips their upcoming Tormax and NB gets their NEXT tormax one spawn sooner then if we had killed him legit that night anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This isn't about being practical and caring how soon we get our next KT and the one after that.  It's about precedent and complete disregard for the most basic part of a rotation.  All your recommendation does is allow FK to walk away without so much as a slap on the wrist for forcibly switching places in the rotation with us.  You &quot;skipping&quot; the next turn is a joke, as you aren't &quot;skipping&quot; anything, you ALREADY killed this turn, you just did it three weeks earlier than you would have if you followed rotation order.  How does letting you get away with this make me a bigger or better man?  I understand we all make mistakes, but come on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's all ready been said how embarrased we are as a collective entity of assing it up so badly, we have and are continuing to take internal measures to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again.

<br>
None of your raid leaders are ebayed newbs with no clue about how rotations work.  They've already all been on this server, working with the system for well over two years.  What steps are you taking to &quot;train&quot; these seasoned veterans on how to send /tell GuildLeaderX to work out issues ahead of time?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However we have no desire to be 'punished' for this stupid mistake then any other guild who also made this same mistake.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We would voluntarily take this &quot;punishment&quot;, or penalty for making this kind of error.  BotS has already done so twice in the last 4 months on Cursed rotation situations.  We haven't had to yet, because as I cited above, we put a lot of effort into making sure we don't make these kinds of mistakes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylph@therathetravelagency>Sylph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Frayed Knot - GL</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 8:06:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   blah</span><hr size=1> First off, as already explianed, FK was under the mistaken impression that KT was FFA (yes our college grads can skim a post and miss something), why would we contact anyone?  Would NB send us a tell if they were about to kill Lozidal?  I fail to see your logic here Karadin.<br>
<br>
Currently this is how the KT rot stands<br>
NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS - SotE<br>
<br>
Fk going out of turn directly effects 3 guilds, NB, TL, LoM. I fail to understand why people seem to think this is just an issue with NB, our mistake effected TL and LoM just as much.  Our mistake also indirectly effected the rest of the guilds on the KT rotation.<br>
<br>
As for skippin turns, easy to make that punishment for yourself where there are 2 or 3 guilds on a 3 day rotation.  Skipping one KT spawn equates to 5 months with the current guilds on rotation and spawn time of KT.<br>
<br>
The total effect of our mistake was to make 3 guilds wait one week each, so what seems reasonable to me is for us to wait 3 weeks for our next KT.<br>
<br>
NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS - SotE<br>
becomes<br>
NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS - FK - SotE<br>
and we skip the turn we took out of place<br>
<br>
I know the other two GL's of FK feel that my proposal is still harsh and do not fully agree with me (since we did not intentionally ninja the spawn, why should we get punished like we did), but I personally feel that it is the right thing to do.<br>

<br>
And yes, Noble Blade has always sent tells and discussed in RTA on nights with emergency patches when rotation mobs become FFA to avoid being eaten by the patch.  I still make sure we don't take mobs people plan on keeping their turns for by sending tells.<br>
<br>
It's odd you would treat rotations with more guilds on it as deserving of different penalties than those with smaller numbers, when I would argue that even more stringent care needs to be taken not to mess up and kill out of turn.  You have no one to blame but yourselves for KSing our mob, and how long it takes before you get to kill him again doesn't change my mind on how serious of a violation this is.  You killed out of turn, and the rules for that have been clear for a very long time.<br>
<br>
As for your analysis of what the effect is, I disagree.  You are minimalizing at best.  For one thing, you didn't directly interuppt LoM or TLs plans for the night.  Sure you residually affected TL and LoM by putting them off a week each as well, but you were a direct downer to how we ended our night.  Put yourself in our shoes - next night you plan on doing Vindi, Statue, King Tormax, and Yelinak - you get to Yelinak and find nothing but a mystery to solve as to where your mob is.  Then have it turn out that we KSed your mob.   I know if we KSed a mob of yours, you'd be plenty pissed at us, and understandably so.<br>
<br>
Your proposal is no penalty, and since we can't have our KT back, I don't see why you shouldn't accept the standing punishment for breaking rotations.  There is no reason you shouldn't have checked ahead of time, or come forward on your own about this situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xpedia>Xpedia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EotF - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 11:52:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> I am a new rep for my guild, so i am paying more attn to these boards though I have often cruised them for the pure reading enjoyment of it all.

and we skip the turn we took out of place<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I am not mistaken you will get to kill him again before SotE gets to go?  I can't believe no one else has laid into you for that one.  Did someone say something about math geniuses?  Either that or I am reading that wrong because its not entirely clear.  The other way I see to interpret it is that you all will skip that turn when it comes and take it the next time around, which is more or less what everyone else is saying (before SotE or before NB is one guild difference, big deal).  I may have missed the boat entirely on that one too, happens often.<br>
<br>
I don't think you should be held to a different standard than anyone else, but you shouldn't be able to pick your standard.  There seem to be two precedents to go on and one is much more palatable than the other.  No one wants to be punished, thats why its a punishment.  To say you are sorry and you feel bad is good, I commend you for that.  I don't think it is a good standard though to let people off with a &quot;sorry, we screwed up&quot; though.  The Rathe is orderly for a reason and to let things go can create a slippery slope<br>
<br>
I think that with a change or lapse in rules some screw ups are bound to happen, but I personally would take extra caution in breaking form the norm by sending tells to double check.  Bottom line is that there needs to be something put in place by the RTA that is agreed upon ahead of time for address this.  That way if it happens its a non issue and the motives behind it are irrelevant.  Its hard to hold someone to a standard that wasn't officially in place.<br>
<br>
My opinion, for what its worth.<br>

<br>
--------------<br>
Current Rotation Order:<br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
FK's rotation numbers are 5,13,21,29,...<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
FK jumped ahead of NB on this round which has caused the problems:<br>
SotE - FK - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
If nothing is done then FK's rotation numbers are 2,6,14,22,30,...<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure everyone (including FK) agrees that this isn't acceptable.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
Karadin's proposed to fix the situation by bumping FK before NB and skipping one rotation:<br>
SotE - FK - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - FK - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
If this is done then FK's rotation numbers are 2,17,25,33<br>
<br>
When you look at the original order that means a 1 month punishment because they took a spawn 3 weeks early.  FK is opposed to this because on paper it looks like they are having to skip 2 entire rotations, when really they are only repaying in double what they accidentally took.  NB feels it is fair because it will discourage other guilds from taking spawns eariler than normal. <br>
<br>
--------------<br>
FK's counter-proposal is to leave the rotation as it is, but skip this rounds: <br>
SotE - FK - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
Now FK's rotation numbers are 2,13,21,29, ...<br>
<br>
FK feels this is fair since it was accidental and NB is against it because they see it as no punishment at all.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
Elaundar's counter-counter-proposal is to punish the number of rotation spots they skipped:<br>
SotE - FK - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS <br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS - FK<br>
SotE - NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS - FK<br>
With this, then FK rotation numbers are 2,16,24,32.  This is basically Sylph's comment, but is precise that they do not go before SotE on this round.<br>
<br>
In other words, FK illegally gained 3 positions so they should loose 3 positions. I really don't care what the punishment is that FK gets, but the it will establish the precidence.<br>

P.S. Hey Karadin, Frayed Knot isn't Far Runners - the Far Runners died a long time ago at my hands. Only a sliver of Frayed Knot even know what Far Runners were.<br>
