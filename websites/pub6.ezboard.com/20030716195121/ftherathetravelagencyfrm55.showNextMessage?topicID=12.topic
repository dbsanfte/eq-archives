<br>
The &quot;stat&quot; type were listed only once per level to conserve space, sta = wis = str etc in rules.<br>
<br>
**hotkey = &quot;/alt activate ###&quot; is how you link these abilities to your hot keys so ya can say shit<br>
like : &quot;/g Divine Arbitration incomming, you may gain, you may lose, but it's for the good of the<br>
group, like Socialism!&quot;<br>
<br>
I included the info regarding specific numbers as needed in heals/cures and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
General Archetypes (Level 51)<br>
First Aid - Increases Healing Rate from Bind Wound <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: This ability increases the amount healable for a player using the bind wound skill.<br>
It is especially useful to those classes who cannot heal up to 75% of a players life with bandages.<br>
This skill grants a 10% increase in the amount healable for the first point, 20% for the second, and<br>
30% for the third.<br>
In practical numbers this means a normal player who could heal only heal to 50% of total life with<br>
no skill can heal up to 80% of total life with 3 points in the skill.<br>
<br>
Improved Lung Capacity - Increases Duration Player Can Hold Breath<br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: This ability increases the duration a player can hold their breath.<br>
It is very useful for players who do not have easy access to an enduring breath item or spell.<br>
It improves capacity by 10% for the first point, 25% for the second, and 50% for the third. <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Agility - Increases Base Agility <br>
Max Training: 5 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: This ability increases the base agility by 2 for each point invested (maximum of 10). <br>
Putting points into this raises the characters base, but does not allow them to exceed the 255 stat<br>
cap. <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Charisma - Increases Base Charisma <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Cold Resistance - Increases Base Cold Resistance <br>
Max Training: 5 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: This ability increases the base Cold Resistance by 2 for each point invested<br>
(maximum of 10).<br>
Putting points into this raises the characters base, but does not allow them to exceed the 255 stat<br>
cap.<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Dexterity - Increases Base Dexterity <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Disease Resistance - Increases Base Disease Resistance<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Fire Resistance - Increases Base Fire Resistance<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Intelligence - Increases Base Intelligence <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Magic Resistance - Increases Base Magic Resistance <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Metabolism - Reduces Characters Need for Food and Water. <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: This ability reduces the rate at which food and water is consumed by a player. This<br>
ability is probably one of the last ones players will want to fill up as its usefulness to a player is<br>
really very minor. 1 point reduces hunger and thirst by 10%, 2 points by 25% and 3 points by<br>
50%.<br>
Improved Natural Poison Resistance - Increases Base Poison Resistance<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Regeneration - Increase Hit point Regeneration Rate<br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: 1 <br>
Description: Each point increases the base heal rate by 1 per tick. I.e. 1 point is 1 hitpoint<br>
increase per tick, 3 points is a 3 hit point increase per tick <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Run Speed - Increases Base Running Rate <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Stamina - Increases Base Stamina <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Strength - Increases Base Strength <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Wisdom - Increases Base Wisdom <br>
<br>
Priest Archetypes (Level 55) <br>
Channeling Focus - Improved Channeling Ability <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points<br>
Description: This ability reduces the chances that a player will have their spell casting interrupted<br>
due to damage or movement. The first point improves channeling by 5%, the second improves<br>
that to 10%, and the third raises it to a final 15% <br>
<br>
Combat Stability - Improve Damage Absorption <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points<br>
Description: This reduces damage taken from every blow which lands on the player. It is<br>
especially useful to characters who gain high amounts of taunt through healing or debuffing. The<br>
first point reduces all damage taken by 2%, the second by 5% and the third by 10%. As an<br>
example of this in a given raid if this skill is maxed it would reduce every blow that would land for<br>
500 by 50. Over the course of 100 of these blows that is 5000hp worth of damage that never<br>
lands (and hence doesn't need to be healed).<br>
<br>
Healing Adept - Improves Instant Heal Spells <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This spell increases the amount of healing done by instant heal spells (not Celestial<br>
heals spells or regrowth etc). The first point improves healing done by 2%, the second point by<br>
5% and the third by 10%. For example, 3 points in this skill would make a 438 hitpoint remedy<br>
heal 482 hipoints instead. <br>
<br>
Healing Gift - Chance to Critical Heal <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This ability gives the healer a chance to critical heal. A critical heal gives twice as<br>
many hitpoints as its base. The first point gives a 3% chance, the second a 6% chance, and the<br>
third a 10% chance. This means that a person with 3 skill points has a 10% chance that a 438<br>
hitpoint remedy spell will heal 876 hitpoints.<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Durability - Increase Hitpoints of Player <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This spell increases the hitpoints of a player by a base percentage. The first point<br>
increases their hitpoints by 2%, the second by 5%, and the third by 10%. This impacts the players<br>
base hitpoints (determined by class, level and stamina).<br>
<br>
Mental Clarity - Improved Mana Regeneration <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This ability increases the base mana regeneration of the player. Each point increases<br>
the mana regained by 1 point per tick. This mana regeneration stacks with all other forms of<br>
mana regeneration in the game.<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Fury - Chance to Cast Critical Strike Spells <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This ability gives the player the chance to score critical damage when casting damage<br>
spells on enemies. This is especially important for classes such as Wizards and Magicians who<br>
rely heavily on their direct damage spells. Critical damage spells hit for twice their normal<br>
damage. The first point adds a 2% chance for this ability to be activated. The second point<br>
increases this to a 4% chance, and the third to a 7% chance.<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Mastery - Increases Chance of Specialization Activation <br>
Ability Type: Passive <br>
Max Training: 3 Levels <br>
Point Cost: <br>
Level 1: 2 points<br>
Level 2: 4 points<br>
Level 3: 6 points <br>
Description: This ability increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization<br>
roll. The first point increases the chance of specialization by 5%, the second raises the chance to<br>
15% and the third to 30%.<br>
<br>
