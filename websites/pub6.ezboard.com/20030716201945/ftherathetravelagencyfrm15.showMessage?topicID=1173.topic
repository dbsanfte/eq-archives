What happens when you play on Sullon Zek and take your EQ life a bit too seriously?   READ ON!  It happened to a friend of a friend....<br>

This is a HUGE ass log.. but basically Me, Dirm, Mysteltin were outside of PoN, when I saw some fag bard in a guild named &lt;Nymph&gt; so naturally I decided to make fun of her faggy guild name, what later insued had me fearing for my life, SHE IS A NYMPH IRL AND HAS QUANTUM COMPUTERS AND TIME MACHINES TO PARALELL DIMENSIONS AND CAN CAST SPELLS IRL, READ ;(<br>
